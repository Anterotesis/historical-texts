            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Character of Doctor <hi>PRIESTLEY,</hi> is known to ſtand very high in the literary World. This ſmall Tract is as much celebrated as any of his numerous Publications. It is ſaid, that above thirty Thouſand Copies of it have been ſold in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. This affords a ſtrong Preſumption, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of that weight of Evidence which it contains. Of this, however, let the Reader judge for himſelf.</p>

                  <p>It would be offering an inſult to your profeſſion, to your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, to your high pretenſions to literature, to ſuppoſe that you can be offended with the following publication. As gentlemen you muſt be candid. As Chriſtians, you muſt be forbearing. As men of ſcience, you muſt wiſh to give every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a fair hearing.</p>
                  <p>We are no longer confined, within thoſe ſoporiferous circles, which were drawn by vindictive bigots, in the darkeſt ages. We are now ſenſible, that it is our duty to know the truth, that the truth will make us free. We are convinced, alſo, that an implicit faith is not the duty of a Chriſtian, but, on the contrary, that we ſhould prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good, or that every man ſhould be fully perſuaded in his own mind.</p>
                  <p>If therefore, the ſentiments which are urged upon us, in the tract before you be founded in truth, you, will give them all their influence upon yourſelves, and will recommend them, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt earneſtneſs, to all your different audiences.</p>
                  <p>If, on the other hand, you have reaſon to apprehend, that any errors are propagated in this book, you have a fair opportunity of confuting them. But read, read candidly and impartially, before you pronounce the ſentence of condemnation, and direct all thoſe with whom you have any connection, to give the moſt unbounded ſcope to their examination of the doctrines in queſtion, leſt they ſhould ſay, that you are afraid of the light or injuriouſly charge you, with being either not able to defend the truth, or willing to conceal it under an impenetrable chaos.</p>
                  <p>When you ſeriouſly Weigh the preceding reflections, I ſhall, I am ſure, receive your thanks for the preſent publication, and you will endeavour to accelerate the circulation of it over all this vaſt continent.</p>
                  <p>Suffer me to throw out another obſervation in vindication of myſelf, ſome copies of this pamphlet have crept in among us, and are ſecretly making many proſelites. on the ſuppoſition, then, that it is an heretical performance, by thus making it better known, you the phyſicians are called in, before it be too late, to extricate the poiſon, and to prevent the ſpreading of the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before it go beyond the reach of a radical remedy.</p>

                  <p>I WISH you to be without ſpot. But, I am afraid, if you examine your own conduct, that you cannot ſay, this is altogether the caſe, you have no occaſion to be directed not to imitate thoſe who ſtile themſelves the orthodox, in their malicious calumny, in their aptitude to do every injury in their power to thoſe who differ from them, or in their habit of condemning unheard, or rejecting without reading them, ſuch authors as contradict their own ſentiments. But after you have fully examined the doctrines of any particular church, and are decidedly clear in your own minds, that ſuch doctrines are diametrically repugnant to the good word of truth, I wiſh you to imitate the <hi>orthodox</hi> in not appearing to give any countenance to ſuch doctrines.</p>
                  <p>You are ſenſible, according to the expreſs declaration of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that THE ONLY TRUE GOD IS THE FATHER of all; and you believe with the apoſtle Paul, and with all the other inſpired writers of the Old and New-Teſtament, that THERE IS BUT ONE GOD EVEN THE FATHER, who was never born, who could not become a child, nor ſuffer death nor be ſubject to any poſſible change.</p>
                  <p>Should you not, therefore, make your light to ſhine? If only two or three of you were convinced of this great truth, ſhould you not by publickly proteſting againſt the worſhip of more Gods than one, declare your ſupreme veneration of the one only God?</p>
                  <p>It is unneceſſary to inform you, that the <hi>true worſhippers worſhip</hi> THE FATHER ONLY, and that the true worſhippers worſhip him <hi>in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> But, they cannot be deemed true worſhippers who do not worſhip at all, who put their candle under a buſhel, who hide their talent in the earth, and do not worſhip in the face of men, or, who through the ſlaviſh fear of appearing ſingular, give countenance to the worſhip of three, or four Gods.</p>
                  <p>Come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate. Be not aſhamed of Chriſt, and his kingdom. Shew your faith by your works. Worſhip publickly the one Eternal Jehovah. This is your duty, which you cannot controvert or deny. Let it not therefore be ſaid of you on the laſt day, that your fear of your fellow creatures was ſuperior to your veneration of the Almighty Creator, that you loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe your deeds were evil.</p>
                  <p>The great Lord of the univerſe requireth ſincerity from us. But we cannot be ſincere when we appear to give his glory to another.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU are my brethren in nature, and equally with me, ſubjects of the one univerſal parent.</p>
                  <p>Some of you are charged with duplicity. Some of you are charged with bigotry. Some of you are charged with inſincerity, in being ſaid to appear to conform to what you utterly diſapprove. Theſe are heavy charges. Wipe them away, by examining can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly every thing that has any pretenſions to truth, and by adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly to whatever your unprejudiced reaſon ſhall convince you is truth.</p>
                  <p>I believe, you have generally rejected Chriſtianity, becauſe it's doctrines have been perverſly miſrepreſented to you. You have been told that the doctrine of a trinity is it's grand baſis, and that the doctrines of original Sin, predeſtination, a ſatisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the ſuperſtructures. But examine chriſtianity itſelf, and you will find that it contains none of theſe doctrines. It is a pure Syſtem of faith, in the one God, and Father of all: and of peace and good will to men.</p>
                  <p>It's real doctrines you have now before you, can you ſay, that any of theſe are unworthy of the divine perfections? Can you ſay that any of theſe are repugnant to the natural dictates of your own minds? Can you ſay, that God could not reveal himſelf to men? Can you ſay, that the infinitely benevolent Being whoſe tender mercies are ever over all his works, is not as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to enlighten our minds and to reſcue us from the ſnares of Sin and death, as to preſerve our bodies and pour upon us a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of earthly joys? Look to yourſelves we muſt all hereafter be accountable for the talents we poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>This preſent world is wearing away, The youngeſt of us muſt ſoon leave it. If, then, there be another world, this ſhould be our grand concern. What can I ſay more?

                  <p>PERMIT one who profeſſes obedience to the ſame Lord, and faith in the precious promiſes of the ſame goſpel with yourſelves to addreſs himſelf to you, with all freedom and plainneſs of ſpeech, on ſubjects relating to our common ſalvation. I need not tell you that theſe ſubjects are intereſting. In reality, nothing elſe is intereſting in compariſon with them. For what is this world compared with the future! What is time compared with eternity! Believe me my brethren, it is nothing but the deepeſt concern for the honour of a religion which is the moſt valuable inheritance of the human race, and which ſets us above all the follies and vices, all the weakneſſes and troubles of life, by giving us the moſt ſolid hope in death, that, has induced me to ſolicit your attention. But I am confident that you will not think it ill beſtowed, becauſe it is upon a ſubject that is near and dear to you, and the conſideration of which cannot, but pleaſe and profit you.</p>
                  <p>If, by the bleſſing of God upon our common endeavours to <hi>lead,</hi> and to be <hi>led into all truth,</hi> I ſhall be ſo happy as to bring you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the ſame views of theſe things with myſelf, we ſhall rejoice together; and if, after all that I may be able to advance, you ſhould ſtill think differently from me, I truſt you will, at leaſt, be diſpoſed to think with more candour of ſome of your fellow-chriſtians, who love the goſpel, and are zealous for its honour, though you may think them miſtaken in their conceptions concerning it. Let me intreat you, therefore, my brethren, to give me a patient and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did hearing. Attend, in the ſpirit of meekneſs, to what I ſhall ſay from the earneſtneſs of my heart; and exerciſe the reaſon which God has given you upon this occaſion, which is the nobleſt on which it can be exerciſed, and for which you may, therefore, conclude, that it was principally given you.</p>

                     <p>BE not backward, or afraid, my brethren, to make uſe of your reaſon in matters of religion, or where the ſcriptures are concerned. They both of them proceed from the ſame God and Father of us all, who is the giver of every good and every perfect gift. They cannot, therefore, be contrary to one another, but muſt mutually illuſtrate and enforce one another. Beſides, how can we diſtinguiſh one ſcheme of religion from another, ſo as to give the preference to that which is the moſt deſerving of it, but by the help of our reaſon and underſtanding? What would you yourſelves ſay to a Mahometan, whom you would perſuade to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018741_0007_0FA81B763B4D6198"/>
abandon the impoſture of Mahomet, and embrace chriſtianity, but bid him uſe his reaſon; and judge, by the help of it, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt difference between the two religions, and the great ſuperiority of yours to his? Does not God himſelf appeal to the reaſon of man, when he condeſcends to aſk us, <hi>Whether his ways be not equal?</hi> Ezek. xviii. 29. Does not the apoſtle exhort us that <hi>in underſtanding we be men?</hi> 1 Cor. xiv. 20. Are we not expreſſly commanded to <hi>prove all things, and then hold faſt that which is good?</hi> 1 Theſſ. v. 21. Alſo, when we are commanded to <hi>ſearch the ſcriptures,</hi> John v. 39 more muſt be meant than merely <hi>reading</hi> them, or <hi>receiving implicitly,</hi> the interpretations of others. <hi>Searching</hi> muſt imply an earneſt endeavour to find out for ourſelves, and to underſtand the truths contained in the ſcriptures; and what faculty can we employ for this purpoſe, but that which is commonly called <hi>reaſon,</hi> whereby we are capable of thinking, reflecting, comparing, and judging of things?</p>
                     <p>Diſtruſt, therefore, all thoſe who decry human reaſon, and who require you to abandon it, wherever religion is concerned. When once they have gained this point with you, they can lead you whither they pleaſe, and impoſe upon you every abſurdity which their ſiniſter views may make it expedient for them that you ſhould embrace. A Popiſh Prieſt would require nothing more than this, to make you believe the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, and that a man is infallible; or to perſuade you to commit the moſt flagrant wickedneſs; as a means of <hi>doing God ſervice.</hi> For the firſt of theſe articles they do not fail to urge the words of ſcripture, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſay, concerning the bread that is uſed in the Lord's ſupper, that it <hi>is the body of Chriſt;</hi> Matt. xxvi. 6. and there is no poſſibility of replying to them, but by appealing to reaſon, as the neceſſary and proper judge of the ſenſe of ſcripture. The Papiſts, therefore, as might well be expected, is forward, on all occaſions, to vilify human reaſon, and to require men to abandon it; but true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants will not part with it. It is by the help of reaſon, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the ſcriptures, that we guard ourſelves againſt the groſs deluſions of the Papiſts, who, after relinquiſhing reaſon, have been <hi>made to believe a lie;</hi> and by the diligent and continued uſe of the ſame power, let us endeavour to combat every remaining error, and trace out and reform every corruption of chriſtianity, till we hold the pure <hi>truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>obey it in the love thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do not think that, by recommending the uſe of reaſon, I am about to decry the ſcriptures. My appeal ſhall be to both, upon every ſubject on which I addreſs you; and I think you cannot but ſee that the plainneſt and moſt obvious ſenſe of the ſcriptures is in favour of thoſe doctrines which are moſt agreeable to reaſon. A good man will rejoice to ſee them thus go hand in hand, mutually illuſtrating and enforcing one another.</p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> Of the Power of Man to do the Will of God.</head>
                     <p>ONE of the ſubjects with reſpect to which I earneſtly wiſh that you would attend to the voice of reaſon and the ſcriptures, and with reſpect to which, one miſtake will be followed by many others, and miſtakes of great conſequence, is concerning <hi>the power of man to do the will of God.</hi> It is a favourite opinion with many teachers of religion, that men have <hi>naturally</hi> (or by that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and frame which God their maker hath given them) no power at all to do any thing that is good, not even to think a good thought, much leſs actually to obey any of the commands of God; ſo that, if men were left to themſelves, they could do nothing but ſin, and muſt be under a neceſſity of aggravating their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, by every thought, word, and action of their lives. But, my brethren, how does this doctrine agree with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and particularly with the manner in which the Divine Being conſtantly expoſtulates with the ſinful ſons of men; as when he ſays to the Jews,
<q>Turn ye turn ye from your evil ways, why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxiii. 11. Waſh ye make you clean.</q>
Ceaſe to do evil learn to do well, &amp;c, <hi>Iſa.</hi> i. 16.</p>
                     <p>Is it not plain from this, that it depends upon men themſelves, whether they will repent and turn to God or not? And how can it depend upon themſelves if they have not naturally, a ſufficient power to do it? You cannot think that God would command, and expect obedience, when he had not given power to obey; and much leſs that he would urge men to provide for their own ſafety and happineſs, when himſelf had put an effectual bar in the way of it.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe that any man's children were ſhut up in a building that was on fire, while he himſelf was without, and had the key: and that, inſtead of opening the door, to favour their eſcape, he ſhould only call out to them to flee out of the place, in order to avoid inſtant deſtruction; and that, as the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, they ſhould all periſh in the flames before his eyes; what would you think of ſuch a father? You would want words to expreſs your abhorrence of his cruelty; and yet in this very light do many chriſtian divines repreſent the conduct of that God <hi>whoſe tender mercies are over all his works,</hi> and who has ſolemnly declared, <hi>that he hath no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he would turn from his way and live</hi> Ezek. xxxiii. 11. yea, <hi>who would have all men to be ſaved.</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 4.</p>
                     <p>The conduct of our <hi>merciful God and Father,</hi> is certainly far different from this, and more agreeable to reaſon and equity. If he deſigned us to be accountable creatures, and treats us as ſuch we muſt have <hi>talents</hi> given us, which we may either improve or miſimprove. If we be the ſubjects of his <hi>moral government,</hi> we muſt be in a condition either to <hi>obſerve</hi> or to <hi>break</hi> his laws. A power to do the one neceſſarily ſuppoſes a power to do the other; and without this power we ſhould not be the proper ſubjects
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018741_0009_0FA81B779B49BBA8"/>
of religion; as, in that caſe it would be vain to propoſe to us either rewards for obedience, or puniſhments for diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the ſuppoſition of a power in man to do the will of God, any foundation for <hi>pride.</hi> For we muſt ſtill ſay, with the apoſtle, <hi>What have we that we have not received? and how then can we glory, as if we had not received it? Every good and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift comes from God;</hi> and, knowing this, the more we receive of his bounty, the more thankful, and the more humble we ſhould be. I ſhall, certainly, be more ſolicitous to exert myſelf in doing the will of God, when, I believe that I have a talent to improve, than if I believe that I have no talent intruſted with me at all; ſo that I cannot do even ſo much as the <hi>wicked and ſlothful ſervant, who hid his talent in a napkin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some of thoſe perſons who believe that all mankind are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incapable of doing any good, are ſometimes heard to invite ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of all kinds to come to Chriſt, <hi>as they are,</hi> and to ſay, that the viler they are, the more welcome they will be to him; as if he was, after this, to cleanſe them by ſome miraculous power. But, my brethren, the invitation of the goſpel runs in very different terms. It is, <hi>Repent, and bring forth fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Matt. iii. 8. <hi>Repent, and be converted that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi> Acts iii. 19 And none are invited <hi>to come to Chriſt,</hi> but thoſe who <hi>labour and are heavy laden;</hi> nor can they <hi>find reſt for their ſouls,</hi> till they have <hi>actually learned of him to be meek and lowly in heart.</hi> Matt. xi. 28.</p>
                     <p>What can be more contrary to the maxims above-mentioned, than the whole tenor of that ſerious expoſtulation with the children of Iſrael in the prophet Iſaiah, part of which I quoted above? <hi>waſh you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well. Seek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſs, plead for the widow. Come now,</hi> (and not before) <hi>and let us reaſon together, ſays the Lord. Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> Iſa. i. 16, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Others, who entertain the ſame opinion of the utter inability of man to do the will of God, act more conſiſtently with thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, but far more inconſiſtently with the ſcriptures, in never preaching to ſinners at all; though to <hi>call ſinners to repentance</hi> was the chief end of Chriſt's coming into the world. <hi>Matt.</hi> ix. 13.</p>
                     <p>Whatever repreſents a ſtate of acceptance with God, as a thing that may be brought about without any efforts of our own, and eſpecially if it may be done in a moment, or in a very ſhort ſpace of time, is ſure to be a popular doctrine. Mankind in general care not how little is expected of them, or how little they themſelves have to do, in order to get to heaven. But true religion, that alone which affords ſolid ground of hope towards God, conſiſts in a change of heart, affections, and habits; which can only be brought about by ſerious reſolution, and a vigorous and con<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

formed early in life, there is very great danger that the <hi>thorns, briars,</hi> or <hi>bad ſoil,</hi> will prevent the good ſeed from ever coming to maturity.</p>
                     <p>To believe, as the ſame perſons do, that faith and repentance are nothing that we ourſelves are capable of, but altogether the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous operation of the ſpirit of God in us and upon us, ſuppoſes that this great and ſudden change may as well take place at the <hi>laſt</hi> hour of life, as at any other; which certainly encourages the moſt unwarrantable and moſt dangerous preſumption, and is far from having any countenance in the ſcriptures. The word of God always repreſents a ſafe and <hi>happy death</hi> as the conſequence of nothing but a good and <hi>well-ſpent life.</hi> Some, indeed, are ſaid to have been called at the <hi>eleventh</hi> hour, but none at the <hi>twelfth,</hi> when the time for labouring in the vineyard was quite over; and not one of the fooliſh virgins, who had neglected to provide themſelves with oil, was admitted to the marriage-ſupper.</p>

                     <p>AS a foundation for this ſtrange doctrine, of the utter inability of men to do what God requires of them, a doctrine ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious both to our Maker and ourſelves, it is ſaid that by his firſt offence our firſt parent Adam, and all his poſterity, loſt all power of doing any thing acceptable to God for the future; that he was the repreſentative of all his poſterity; ſo that when he ſinned, we all ſinned; and, every ſin being an offence againſt an infinite God, we all became, from that moment, liable to an infinite puniſhment, even the everlaſting wrath and curſe of our Maker. And they ſay, that, on this account only, it would have been juſt in God to have made us all ſuffer the moſt exquiſite and endleſs torments in hell, even though we had never ſinned in our own perſons.</p>
                     <p>But, my brethren, you find nothing like any part of this in your bibles. For there you read, <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> Ezek. xviii. 4. And long after the tranſgreſſion of Adam, and to this very day, God is continually calling upon men to <hi>ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well;</hi> which certainly ſuppoſes that men always have had, and that we now have, a power to do ſo. It is allowed that we <hi>ſuffer</hi> by the ſin of Adam, as any child may ſuffer in conſequence of the wickedneſs of his anceſtor; but it is not poſſible that we ſhould have <hi>ſinned</hi> in him. Wherever there is <hi>ſin,</hi> there is <hi>guilt,</hi> that is, ſomething that may be the foundation of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe</hi> of conſcience; ſomething that a man may be <hi>ſorry for,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of;</hi> ſomething that he may wiſh he had not done; all which clearly implies, that ſin is ſomething that a man has given his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> to, and therefore muſt be convinced of the reaſonableneſs of his being puniſhed for But how can any man repent of the ſin of Adam, or feel any thing like remorſe of conſcience for it; when he cannot but know that he never gave his conſent to it, and could not poſſibly have been, in the leaſt degree, acceſſary to it? Good and bad conduct are, in their own nature, perſonal, and cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018741_0011_0FA81B790F99F138"/>
be transferred from one to another. Whatever ſome divines pretend, nothing of this kind can be <hi>imputed</hi> in this ſenſe of the word. We may receive harm by means of one perſon, and benefit by means of another, but no ſin of the former, or righteouſneſs of the latter, can be conſidered as ours, in the eye of an equitable and juſt God. The contrary is as much the language and the plain meaning of the ſcriptures throughout, as it is agreeable to the common ſenſe and reaſon that God has given us.</p>

                        <hi>IV.</hi> Of Election and Reprobation.</head>
                     <p>SUPPOSING that all mankind became liable to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting wrath and curſe of God for the ſin of one man, ſome divines ſay, that it was mercy in God to ſave any, though by an <hi>arbitrary decree,</hi> which left all the reſt of the human race under an inevitable neceſſity of periſhing. But certainly, my brethren, ſuch <hi>tender mercy is cruelty.</hi> All the creatures of God muſt look up to him as the author of their being, ſince it was, undoubtedly, in his power to give, or to withhold it, at his pleaſure; and, ſurely, a good and merciful God would have put a ſtop to the propagation of ſuch a race of creatures, rather then ſuffer them to be born in ſuch ſhocking circumſtances; in which he infallibly foreſaw, that the greateſt part of them muſt be expoſed to, and even actually ſuffer remedileſs deſtruction. As ſurely as I derive my being from a juſt and merciful God, I conclude that the terms on which I came into the world are advantageous to me; and therefore, that it muſt be my own fault only, if I have not reaſon to rejoice in it, and to be thankful, for it. But, indeed, I can hardly think that any man ſeriouſly believes, that the greateſt part of his fellow-creatures are born into the world under a predetermined neceſſity of being for ever miſerable. For in that caſe, it muſt appear probable that any children which he himſelf may be the means of bringing into the world will be for ever miſerable; and ſurely no man of real goodneſs or compaſſion would wiſh to have children, or be neceſſary to their being born in ſuch circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>If this doctrine be true, what motive can any man have to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>flee from the wrath to come.</hi> Matt. iii. 7. when if it is to be his lot at all, nothing that he can do will enable him to eſcape it; or what motive can a man have to exert himſelf to <hi>lay hold on eternal life,</hi> 1 Tim. vi. 12. when, if he is to enjoy it at all, he cannot poſſibly miſs of it, or of any thing belonging to it, or that is neceſſary to prepare him for it? What reaſon had the apoſtle Paul to exhort Chriſtians to <hi>take heed leſt they ſhould fall,</hi> 1 Cor. x. 12. when none that ever did ſtand could poſſibly fall? and what reaſon had he to <hi>labour, left after having preached to others, he himſelf ſhould be a caſt-away,</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 27. when, being certain of his converſion, he muſt have known that that conſequence was impoſſible?</p>
                     <p>This doctrine, of abſolute election and reprobation, is certainly
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018741_0012_0FA81B79D62A5CB8"/>
a doctrine of <hi>licentiouſneſs,</hi> and not a <hi>doctrine according to godlineſs;</hi> and let divines employ all the ingenuity they are maſters of, it is impoſſible for them to clear this opinion from being the cauſe of fatal deſpair in ſome, and as fatal a ſecurity in others. If this opinion were true, and men were really aware of their ſituation, I ſhould think it impoſſible to prevent their falling into abſolute diſtraction, through terror and anxiety. It would be like a man having his <hi>all,</hi> his <hi>life,</hi> nay infinitely more than his life, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the caſt of a die; the decree of God being a thing that he has as little power to command.

But whatever ſuch divines may ſay, the apoſtle Paul ſays, in direct contradiction to them, that,
<q>To us there is but one God, the FATHER, of whom are all things; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him, 1 Cor. viii. 6.</q>
And again, after ſaying that we have <hi>one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm,</hi> he adds,
<q>one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all, Eph. iv. 5.6.</q>

                     <p>The <hi>Father</hi> is frequently ſtiled <hi>God,</hi> even with reſpect to Chriſt, as well as other beings.
<q>The God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, give unto you, that ye may know the exceeding greatneſs of his power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand, &amp;c. Eph. i. 17. &amp;c.</q>

The words that I ſpeak unto you, I ſpeak not of myſelf, but the Father who dwelleth in me, he doth the works. xiv. 10. I live by the Father. vi. 57. The Father hath given to the ſon to have life in himſelf; and hath given him authority to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgment. v. 26.27. All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Matt. xxviii. 18 <hi>He even calls his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> the only true God, John xvii. 3 that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</q>
It appears to me not to be in the power of language to exclude the idea of the divinity of Chriſt more expreſsly than by theſe ſolemn words.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the divine communications with which our Lord was favoured, ſome things are expreſsly ſaid to be withheld from him. For he himſelf, ſpeaking of his ſecond coming, ſays, Mark xiii. 32. <hi>But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> In Matthew xxiv. 36. where the ſame obſervation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, it is, <hi>but my Father only.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The apoſtles notwithſtanding their attachment to their Lord, and Maſter, always preſerve the idea of his ſubordination to the Father, and conſider all his honour and power as derived from him.
<q>He received from God the Father, honour and glory, 2 Pet. i. 17. It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fullneſs dwell, Col i. 19. The revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave unto him, Rev. i. 1. Ye are Chriſt's and Chriſt is God's, 1 Cor. iii. 23. The head of Chriſt is God, 1 Cor. xi. 3</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon why Chriſt was ſo much diſtinguiſhed by God the Father, is frequently and fully expreſſed in the ſcriptures, viz. his obedience to the will of God, and eſpecially in his ſubmitting to die for the benefit of mankind.
<q>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, John x. 17. He humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs. Wherefore God has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven and things in earth; and that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord to the Glory of God the Father, Phil. ii. 8—11. Who, for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is now ſat down at the right hand of God. Heb. xii. 2.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Lord ſays, that <hi>he and his Father are one.</hi> John x. 30. but he ſufficiently explains himſelf, when he prays that all his diſciples may be
<q>one with him, and his Father, even as they are one. John xvii. ii. and he gives them the ſame glory
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018741_0014_0FA81B7B82B38358"/>
which God had given to him, ver. 22.</q>
Beſides, at the very time that our Lord ſays, that he and his father are one, and in the very ſentence preceding it, ver. 29. he ſays, that "his Father is "greater than all. But how could the Father be greater than all, if there was any other, who was ſo much <hi>one</hi> with him, as to be, in all, reſpects <hi>equal</hi> to him.</p>
                     <p>The mere term <hi>God</hi> is, indeed. ſometimes uſed in a lower and inferior ſenſe in the ſcriptures, denoting <hi>dominion</hi> only; as when the Divine Being himſelf ſays, that <hi>he will make Moſes a god to Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. vii. 1; but ſurely, there can be no danger of our miſtaking the ſenſe of ſuch phraſes as theſe; or if it were poſſible, our Lord himſelf has ſufficiently guarded againſt any miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of them when applied to himſelf, by the explanation he has given of them; informing us, that if in the language of ſcripture, <hi>they are called gods to whom the word of God came,</hi> John x. 35 (though, in fact, they were no other than mere men) he could not be guilty of blaſphemy in calling himſelf only the <hi>Son of God.</hi> Now if Chriſt had been conſcious to himſelf that he was the <hi>true and very God,</hi> and that it was of the utmoſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to mankind that they ſhould regard him in that light, this was certainly a proper time for him to have declared himſelf, and not to have put his hearers off with ſuch an apology as this.</p>
                     <p>But even this power and dominion, to which Chriſt is advanced by God his Father, <hi>who gave all power into his hands,</hi> and who <hi>made him head over all things to his church,</hi> Eph. i. 22, this <hi>media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial kingdom</hi> of Chriſt (as it is ſometimes, and with ſufficient propriety, termed) is not to be perpetual. For the apoſtle Paul, ſpeaking no doubt, under immediate inſpiration, expreſsly ſays, that when <hi>the end ſhall come, that God ſhall have ſubdued all things to his Son</hi> (in which, he obſerves, that <hi>he muſt be excepted who did ſubdue all thing unto him</hi>) <hi>he muſt deliver up the kingdom to God, even the</hi> FATHER, <hi>and he himſelf ſubject to him who had put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 24. &amp;c. Nay, he himſelf ſays expresſly, that he had not the diſpoſal of the higheſt offices of his kingdom, Matt. xx. 23. <hi>To ſit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give; but it ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So clear, my brethren, ſo full, and ſo expreſs, is the uniform teſtimony of the ſcriptures to the great doctrine of the proper <hi>unity of God,</hi> and of the ſubordination of Chriſt, and all other beings to him, that the prevalence of ſo impious a doctrine, as the contrary muſt be, can be aſcribed to nothing but to that <hi>myſtery of iniquity,</hi> which though it <hi>began to work</hi> in the times of the apoſtles themſelves, was not then riſen to ſo enormous a height as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the ſupremacy of the <hi>one living and true God,</hi> and <hi>give his peculiar glory to another.</hi> This, my brethren, among other ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corruptions of genuine chriſtianity, grew up with the ſyſtem of popery; and to ſhew that nothing is impoſſible to the ſuperſtition and credulity of men, when they are <hi>become vain in their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="unknown:018741_0015_0FA81B7C3B331720"/>
after exalting a man into a god, a creature into a creator, they made a piece of bread into one alſo, and then bowed down to, and worſhipped, the work of their own hands.</p>
                     <p>But though it ſeemed fit to the unſearchable wiſdom of God, that all the errors and abuſes of popery ſhould not be reformed at once; and though this great error was left untouched by the firſt reformers, bleſſed be God the bible is as open to us as it was to them? and by the exertion of the ſame judgment and ſpirit, we may free chriſtianity from the corruptions which they left adhering to it; and then among other excellencies of our religion, <hi>Our Lord will be one and his name one.</hi> Zech. xiv. 9.</p>
                     <p>If you aſk <hi>who,</hi> then, is Jeſus Chriſt, if he be not God; I anſwer, in the words of St. Peter, addreſſed to the Jews, after his reſurrection and aſcenſion, that <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth was a</hi> man <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God, by miracles and wonders and ſigns, which God did by him.</hi> Acts ii. 22. If you aſk what is meant by <hi>man,</hi> in this place; I anſwer, that <hi>man,</hi> if the word be uſed with any kind of proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt mean the ſame kind of being with yourſelves. I ſay, moreover, with the author of the epiſtle to the Hebrews, that
<q>it became him by whom are all things, and for whom are all things,</q>
to make this great captain of our ſalvation in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, like unto us his brethren, that he might be made perfect through ſufferings. Heb. ii. 10.17. and that he might have a feeling of all our infirmities, iv. 13. For this reaſon it was that our Saviour and deliverer was not made of the nature of an <hi>angel,</hi> or like any ſuper-angelic being, but was of <hi>the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> ii. 16. that is (excluſive of the divinity of the Father, which reſided in him, and acted by him) a mere <hi>man,</hi> as other Jews, and as we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo are.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt being made by the immediate hand of God, and not born in the uſual courſe of generation, is no reaſon for his not being conſidered as a man. For then Adam muſt not have been a man. But in the ideas of St. Paul, both <hi>the firſt and ſecond Adam</hi> (as Chriſt, on this account, is ſometimes called) were equally men; <hi>By man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 21. And, certainly, in the reſurrection of a <hi>man,</hi> that is, of a perſon in all reſpects like ourſelves, we have a more <hi>lively hope</hi> of our own reſurrection; that of Chriſt being both a <hi>proof</hi> and a <hi>pattern</hi> of ours. We can, therefore, more firmly believe, that <hi>becauſe he lives, we</hi> who are the ſame that he was, and who ſhall undergo the ſame change by death that He did, <hi>ſhall live alſo.</hi> John xiv. 19.</p>
                     <p>Till this great corruption of chriſtianity be removed, it will be in vain to preach the goſpel to Jews, or Mahometans, or, indeed, to any people who retain the uſe of the reaſon and underſtanding that God has given them. For how is it poſſible that <hi>three</hi> perſons, <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſhould be ſeparately, each of them, poſſeſſed of all divine perfections, ſo as to be <hi>true, very,</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> God, and yet that there ſhould be but <hi>one God;</hi> a truth which is
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018741_0016_0FA81B7CD4B49D08"/>
ſo clearly and fully revealed, that it is not poſſible for men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe their aſſent to it; or elſe it would, no doubt, have been long ago expunged from our creed, as utterly irreconcileable with the more favourite doctrine of a <hi>Trinity,</hi> a term which is not to be found in the ſcriptures. Things <hi>above</hi> our reaſon may, for any thing that we know to the contrary be true; but things expresſly <hi>contrary</hi> to our reaſon, as that <hi>three</hi> ſhould be <hi>one</hi> and <hi>one three</hi> can never appear to us to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>With the Jews, the doctrine of the Divine Unity is, and indeed juſtly, conſidered as the moſt fundamental principle of all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Hear O Iſrael, the Lord Our God is one Lord,</hi> Deut. vi. 4. Mark xii. 29. To preach the doctrine of the Trinity to the Jews, can appear to them in no other light than an attempt to ſeduce them into <hi>idolatry,</hi> a thing which they dare not entertain the moſt diſtant thought of.</p>
                     <p>The great creed of the Mahometans, is, that <hi>There is one God, and Mahomet is his prophet.</hi> Now that Mahomet is not the prophet of God, it is to be hoped they may, in time, be made to believe; but we muſt not expect that they will ſo eaſily give up their faith in the unity of God. To make the goſpel what it was originally, <hi>glad tidings of great joy;</hi> and as at laſt it certainly will be to all the nations of the world, we muſt free it from this moſt abſurd and impious doctrine, and alſo from many other corruptions which have been introduced into it. It can no otherwiſe appear worthy of God, and favourable to the virtue and happineſs of mankind.</p>
                     <p>Leſt ſome common objections ſhould hinder the reception of the great truth here contended for, I ſhall briefly conſider and reply to the principle of them. It is often ſaid that Chriſt ſpeaks of his <hi>humanity</hi> only, whenever he repreſents himſelf as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the Father, and dependent upon him. But the ſcriptures themſelves are far from furniſhing the leaſt hint of any ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of interpretation, though, according to the Trinitarians, it is abſolutely neceſſary to the true underſtanding of them.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, when it is applied to the paſſages in queſtion, it is far from making them either true in themſelves, or agreeable to the obvious purport and deſign of the places in which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. I ſhall juſt mention a few. Could our Lord ſay with truth, and without an unworthy prevarication, that <hi>the Father is the only true God,</hi> John xvii. 3. if any other perſon, not implied in the term <hi>Father,</hi> was as much the true God as himſelf? Now the term <hi>Father</hi> being appropriated to what is called the <hi>firſt</hi> perſon in the godhead, cannot comprehend the <hi>Son,</hi> who is called the <hi>ſecond.</hi> This key, therefore, is of no ſervice in this caſe, and our Lord, by expreſſing himſelf as he has done, could not but lead his hearers into what is called a dangerous miſtake.</p>
                     <p>When our Lord ſaid that <hi>his Father was greater than he,</hi> did he make any reſerve, and ſecretly mean, not <hi>his whole ſelf,</hi> but only <hi>part,</hi> and the inferior part of himſelf the other part being equal in power and glory with the Father? How mean the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication, and how unworthy of our Lord!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:018741_0017_0FA81B7D92687A88"/>When our Lord ſaid that <hi>the time of the day of judgment was not known to himſelf, the Son, but to the Father only,</hi> could he mean that his <hi>humanity</hi> only did not know it, but that his <hi>divinity</hi> (which is ſuppoſed to be intimately united with his humanity) was as well acquainted with it as the Father himſelf? If the human nature of Chriſt had been incapable of having that knowledge communicated to it, the declaration would have been needleſs; but as that was not the caſe, his hearers muſt neceſſarily underſtand him as ſpeaking of himſelf in his higheſt capacity; as he certainly muſt do, if at all, when he ſpeaks of himſelf as the <hi>Son,</hi> correſponding to the <hi>Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If Chriſt had not ſatisfied the Jews that he did not mean to make himſelf equal with God, would they not have produced it againſt him at his trial, when he was condemned as a blaſphemer, becauſe he confeſſed that he was the Chriſt only: and yet no Jew expected any thing more than a man for their Meſſiah, and our ſaviour no where intimates that they were miſtaken in that expectation. It is plain that Martha conſidered our Lord as a different perſon from God, and dependent upon God, when ſhe ſaid to him, John xi. 22. <hi>I know that even now, whatſoever thou wilt aſk of God, God will give it thee.</hi>

                     <p>YOU have been taught by divines, that if Chriſt be not God, he could not have made an <hi>infinite ſatisfaction</hi> for the ſins of mankind. But, my brethren, where do you learn that the pardon of ſin, in a finite creature, requires an infinite ſatisfaction; or, indeed, any ſatisfaction at all, beſides repentance and reformation, on the part of a ſinner. We read in the ſcriptures that we are <hi>juſtified freely by the Grace of God,</hi> Rom. iii. 34. but what free grace, or mercy, does there appear to have been in God, if Chriſt gave a full price for our juſtification, and bore the infinite weight of divine wrath on our account. We are commanded to <hi>forgive others, as we ourſelves hope to be forgiven,</hi> Matt. vii. 14. and to be <hi>merciful, as our Father, who is in heaven, is merciful.</hi> But ſurely we are not thereby authorized to inſiſt upon any atonement, or ſatisfaction, before we give up our reſentment towards an offending and penitent brother. Indeed, how could it deſerve the name of <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> if we did? If he only <hi>repent,</hi> we are commanded to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give</hi> him. Luke xvii. 4.</p>
                     <p>You read in the ſcriptures that Chriſt died a <hi>ſacrifice for our ſins.</hi> Heb. ix. 26. So he did; and a ſacrifice it was, of <hi>a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to God.</hi> To die, as Chriſt did, in the glorious cauſe of truth and virtue; to die, as he did, in order to ſhow us an example of patiently ſuffering death for our religion, and the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and in a firm hope of a reſurrection to a future and eternal
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018741_0018_0FA81B7E8545BF28"/>
life; to die, as he did, in expreſs atteſtation of his own divine miſſion, by his manifeſt reſurrection from the dead, and as the fulleſt proof of that doctrine, by means of which ſinners are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually reconciled unto God, was a noble ſacrifice indeed. We alſo are commanded to <hi>yield our bodies living ſacrifices.</hi> Rom. xii. 1. And we are required to offer the <hi>ſacrifices of praiſe continually.</hi> Pſal. cxvi. 17. But it is plain that all theſe are only figurative expreſſions, and uſed by way of compariſon. Neither our <hi>bodies,</hi> nor our <hi>prayers</hi> can be conſidered as <hi>real</hi> ſacrifices; nor are we, therefore, obliged to ſuppoſe that Chriſt was a real ſacrifice. And though we, like him, ſhould be called actually to <hi>lay down our lives for our brethren,</hi> 1 John iii. 16. which, in imitation of him, we are enjoined to be ready to do, we ſhould be ſacrifices only in the figurative ſenſe of the word.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that no man who is a ſinner (and all men have ſinned) can be <hi>juſtified by his works.</hi> We all ſtand in need of, and muſt have recourſe to, <hi>free grace</hi> and <hi>mercy;</hi> but it is a great diſhonour to God to ſuppoſe that this mercy and grace takes its riſe from any thing but his own eſſential goodneſs; and that he is not <hi>of himſelf,</hi> and independent of all foreign conſiderations whatever, what he ſolemnly declared himſelf to Moſes, at the time of the giving of the law, to be, namely, <hi>a God merciful and gracious, long ſuffering, abundant in goodneſs and in truth.</hi> Exod. xxxiv. 6. or that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires any other ſacrifices, but <hi>the ſacrifices of a broken ſpirit, and a contrite heart, which he will never deſpiſe.</hi> Pſ. li. 17.</p>
                     <p>Can we wiſh for a more diſtinct, and perfect repreſentation of the manner in which God forgives the ſins of his offspring of mankind, than our Saviour has exhibited to us in that moſt excellent parable of the <hi>prodigal ſon;</hi> in which the good father no ſooner ſees his child, who had abandoned him, and waſted his ſubſtance in riotous living, returning to him and to his duty; but without waiting for any atonement or propitiation, even <hi>while he was yet a great way off, he ran to him, fell upon his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi> Luke xv. 20. The ſame repreſentation we ſee in the parable of the creditor, who freely forgave his ſervant, becauſe he humbly <hi>deſired</hi> him. Let us not then, my brethren, deprive the ever bleſſed God of the moſt glorious and honourable of all his attributes, and leave him nothing but <hi>juſtice,</hi> or rather <hi>vengeance,</hi> which is expreſſly ſaid to be <hi>his ſtrange work.</hi> Iſaiah xxviii. 21.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to reconcile the doctrine of the ſatisfaction for ſin by the death of Chriſt, with the doctrine of <hi>free grace,</hi> which, according to the uniform tenet of the ſcriptures, is ſo fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the pardon of ſin, and the juſtification of ſinners. When, therefore, the apoſtle Paul ſays, Rom. iii 24. <hi>That we are juſtified freely by the grace of God, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the meaning of the latter clauſe muſt be interpreted in ſuch a manner as to make it conſiſtent with the former; and it is far from requiring any force or ſtraining of the text to do it. For it is only neceſſary to ſuppoſe that our <hi>redemption</hi> (or, as the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018741_0019_0FA81B8155C74D58"/>
ſignifies, and is indeed frequently rendered by our tranſlators, our <hi>deliverance</hi>) from the power of ſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> our repentance and reformation, without which there is no promiſe of pardon, is effected by the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, who came <hi>to call ſinners to repentance;</hi> but ſtill God is to be conſidered as the <hi>giver,</hi> and not the <hi>receiver</hi> with reſpect to our redemption, for we read that <hi>he ſpared not his own ſon, but gave him up for us all.</hi> Rom. viii. 32.</p>
                     <p>To ſay that God the Father provided an atonement for his own offended juſtice is, in fact, to give up the doctrine. If a perſon owe me a ſum of money, and I chuſe to have the debt diſcharged, is it not the ſame thing, whether I remit the debt at once, or ſupply another perſon with money wherewith to pay me to the debtor's name? If ſatisfaction be made to any purpoſe, it muſt be in ſome manner, in which the offender may be a ſufferer, and the offended perſon a gainer; but it can never be reconciled to equity, or anſwer any good purpoſe whatever, to make the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſuffer the puniſhment of the guilty. If, as Abraham ſays, it be <hi>far from God to ſlay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous ſhould be as the wicked,</hi> Gen. xviii. 25. much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt it be from him to ſlay the righteous <hi>inſtead</hi> of the wicked.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh the zealous advocates for this doctrine would conſider, that if it be neceſſary, in the nature of things, that the juſtice of God be ſatisfied before any ſin can be pardoned, and Chriſt be God as well as the Father, whether the juſtice of Chriſt ought not to have been ſatisfied in the firſt place. If ſo, what other infinite being has made ſatisfaction to him? But if the divine nature of the Son required no ſatisfaction, why ſhould the divine nature of the Father require any?</p>
                     <p>If it had been inconſiſtent with the divine juſtice to pardon ſin upon repentance only, without ſome farther ſatisfaction, we might have expected to have found it <hi>expreſsly ſaid to be ſo</hi> in the ſcriptures; but no ſuch declaration can be produced either from the Old or the New Teſtament. All that can be pretended is, that it may be <hi>inferred</hi> from it. Though good works are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us in the ſtrongeſt manner, it is never with any ſalvo or caution, as if they were not <hi>of themſelves</hi> acceptable to God. The declarations of the divine mercy to the penitent are all abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, without the moſt diſtant hint of their having a reference to any <hi>conſideration</hi> on which they are made. <hi>Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive.</hi> Pſalm lxxxiv. 5. <hi>To the Lord our God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long mercies and forgiveneſſes, though we have rebelled againſt him.</hi> Dan. ix. 3. When David and other penitents confeſs their ſins, and intreat for pardon, they refer themſelves to the divine mercy only, without ſeeming to have the leaſt idea of any thing farther. <hi>Remember not the ſins of my youth, nor my tranſgreſſions; according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodneſs ſake, O Lord.</hi> Pſalm xxv. 6.</p>
                     <p>It is particularly remarkable, that when ſacrifices under the law are expreſsly ſaid not to be ſufficient for the pardon of ſin, we are
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018741_0020_0FA81B82D2ABA1F0"/>
never referred to any <hi>more availing ſacrifice;</hi> but to good works only.
<q>Thou deſireſt not ſacrifice, elſe would I give it; thou delighteſt not in burnt offering. The ſacrifices of the Lord are a broken ſpirit A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe. Pſalm li. 16 17.</q>
If any of the Jews had had the leaſt notion of the neceſſity of any atonement for the ſins of mankind, they could not but have expected a <hi>ſuffering Meſſiah;</hi> and yet it is plain that the very beſt of them had no ſuch idea. And though our Saviour frequently explains the reaſon of his coming, and the neceſſity of his ſuffering, it is never on any ſuch account. If he had done it any where, it might have been expected in thoſe diſcourſes by which he endeavoured to reconcile his diſciples to his death, in his ſolemn prayer before his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, at the time of his agony in the garden, or when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſs; yet nothing of this kind drops from him on any of theſe occaſions.</p>
                     <p>When our Lord deſcribes the proceedings of the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he doth not repreſent the righteous as referring themſelves to the ſufferings or merit of their judge for their juſtification; and the judge himſelf expreſsly grounds it on their good works only. Though St. Peter, in his diſcourſe to the Jews on the day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, ſpeaks of their ſin in murdering Chriſt as of a heinous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he ſays not a word of the neceſſity of any atonement, or that an ample ſatisfaction had juſt been made, by means of their very wickedneſs. How would a modern divine have harangued upon the occaſion, and what advantage might he have taken of the cry of the Jews, <hi>His blood be upon us, and upon our children.</hi> But St. Peter only exhorts to repentance, and ſpeaks of the death of Chriſt as an event that took place according to the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
                     <p>All the diſcourſes of St. Paul upon various occaſions in the book of Acts, are entirely moral. In his celebrated ſpeech at Athens, he only urges his hearers to repentance, from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a future judgment. He ſays not a word of what is now called the true goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. In ſhort, it is only from the literal interpretation of a few figurative expreſſions in the ſcriptures that this doctrine of <hi>atonement,</hi> as well as that of <hi>tranſubſtantiation</hi> has been derived; and it is certainly a doctrine highly injurious to God; and if we, who are commanded to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God, ſhould act upon the maxims of it, it would be ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the moſt amiable part of virtue in men. We ſhould be implacable and unmerciful, inſiſting upon the uttermoſt farthing.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, my brethren, are the principal heads on which I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to expoſtulate with you, in the plain and free manner in which I have done. Do you yourſelves,

                        <hi>VII.</hi> Practical Conſequences of the above Doctrines.</head>
                     <p>THE found knowledge of chriſtianity is not of importance as a matter of <hi>ſpeculation</hi> merely; though abſtract truths, eſpecially truths that relate to God, and the maxims of his moral government, are not without their utility and obligation; but the truths that I here contend for nearly affect the ſentiments of our hearts, and our conduct in life; as, indeed, has been ſhewn in many reſpects, already. Conſidering God as poſſeſſed of the character in which ſome divines repreſent him, it is impoſſible, while human nature is what it is, that he ſhould appear in an amiable or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable light. Such a God may, indeed, be the object of <hi>dread</hi> and <hi>terror</hi> to his creatures; but by no means of their <hi>love</hi> or <hi>reverence.</hi> And what is obedience without love? It cannot be that of the <hi>heart,</hi> which, however, is the only thing that is of any real value in religion. Alſo, how can a man love his fellow-creatures in general, when he conſiders the greateſt part of them as the objects of the divine abhorrence, and doomed by him to an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction, in which he believes that he himſelf muſt for ever rejoice? And what can remain of virtue, when theſe two great ſources of it, the <hi>love of God and of mankind,</hi> are thus groſsly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted? Laſtly, how muſt the genuine ſpirit of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which ſo eminently diſtinguiſhes the goſpel of Chriſt, be debaſed, when God himſelf (whoſe conduct in this very reſpect is particularly propoſed to our imitation) is conſidered as never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ſin without ſome previous atonement, ſatisfaction, or interceſſion.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, loving God, as the compaſſionate Father of all his offspring, as <hi>willing that all men ſhould be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of his truth;</hi> and alſo loving all mankind as our brethren, as, together with ourſelves, the children of the ſame gracious Father, we cannot want the moſt generous and powerful motives <hi>to do the will of God,</hi> and <hi>to provoke one another to love, and to good works;</hi> being in no fear of counteracting the ſecret deſigns of the Almighty, which we believe are aimed, not at the deſtruction, but the happineſs of all his creatures.</p>
                     <p>Think not, however, that I am ſo uncharitable as to ſuppoſe that all thoſe who profeſs to maintain the doctrines I have been arguing againſt, are univerſally deſtitute of the genuine love of God, or of their fellow-creatures. I am ſenſible, and truly thankful, that it is not always the conſequence; but it is becauſe the hearts of ſuch perſons are really influenced by better principles than thoſe which they avow. They by no means habitually regard the Divine Being in the light in which their principles repreſent him, but as the <hi>true Father</hi> of all the creatures that he has made, and, as ſuch, ſincerely deſirous to promote their beſt intereſts.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, notwithſtanding, if they be aſked, they will not heſitate to ſay, that Chriſt is God, the ſupremacy of the Father, even with reſpect to the Son, is, at the ſame time, the real ſentiment,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018741_0022_0FA81B840BED0638"/>
of their Minds; and when they lift up their hearts to God, it is only <hi>God the Father</hi> that is the proper object of their adoration. The conſtant tenor of the ſcriptures is ſo contrary to their profeſſed creed, that though they dare not call it in queſtion, it is not able to counteract the plainer, the more conſiſtent, and the better prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which will force themſelves upon their minds from converſing with the bible.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it requires more ſubtilty and refinement to enter into the principles above-mentioned, than the common people are maſters of. They cannot conceive how one man ſhould ſin, and another perſon, ſix thouſand years after, be guilty of that ſin, and puniſhable for it; how one perſon's righteouſneſs ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the righteouſneſs of another; or that three diſtinct perſons ſhould each of them be God, and yet that there ſhould be no more gods than one.</p>
                     <p>Men of plain underſtandings, in fact, never do believe any ſuch thing; nor can it be ſuppoſed that the goſpel, which was intended to be the ſolid foundation of the faith, hope, and joy of common people, ſhould require ſo much acuteneſs, as is neceſſary to give even a plauſible colour to theſe ſtrange aſſertions. The attempt to explain them (and, till they be explained, they can no more be believed, than a propoſition in an unkown tongue) can lead to nothing but endleſs and unprofitable contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. It is happy, therefore, that ſo many perſons make a better uſe of the goſpel than their tenets would lead them to do, and that they conſider it chiefly as <hi>a rule of life,</hi> and the <hi>foundation of hope after death.</hi> But, as far as the principles I have been arguing againſt are believed, they cannot but do harm to thoſe who entertain them, as well as bring diſgrace upon the chriſtian name; both which every <hi>lover of the goſpel</hi> ſhould endeavour to prevent.</p>

                        <hi>I.</hi> A conciſe Hiſtory of Opinions concerning Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
                     <p>YOU will ſay, If Chriſt be not really <hi>God,</hi> but merely <hi>a man,</hi> though inſpired and aſſiſted by God, how came the chriſtian world to fall into ſo great an error? In return, I might aſk, how, if Chriſt be truly God, equal to the Father, ſo many chriſtians, and eſpecially the Jewiſh chriſtians, and many others in the very early ages of the chriſtian church came to think him to be merely a man; when it may be eaſily conceived that, on many accounts, chriſtians, who were continually reproached with the meanneſs of their maſter, would be diſpoſed to <hi>add to,</hi>
                        <pb n="24" facs="unknown:018741_0023_0FA81B845796A2A0"/>
rather than to <hi>take from</hi> his dignity? But it is not difficult to ſhew by what <hi>means,</hi> and by what <hi>ſteps,</hi> chriſtians came to think as the generality of them now do.</p>
                     <p>It was the univerſal opinion of philoſophers, at the time of the promulgation of chriſtianity, that the ſouls of all men had exiſted before they were ſent to animate the bodies that were provided for them here, and alſo that all ſouls were <hi>emanations,</hi> or <hi>parts detached</hi> from the deity. For at that time there was no idea of any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance being properly <hi>immaterial,</hi> and <hi>indiviſible.</hi> When theſe philoſophers became chriſtians, and yet were aſhamed of being the diſciples of a man who had been crucified, they naturally gave a diſtinguiſhed rank to the ſoul of Chriſt before he came into the world. They even went one ſtep farther, and maintained that Chriſt had a body in appearance only, and not in reality, and therefore that he ſuffered nothing at all when he was ſcourged and crucified.</p>
                     <p>This opinion the apoſtle John reprobates with great ſeverity, and even calls it <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> 1 John iv. 3. whereas though it is acknowledged that the other opinion, viz. that of Chriſt being <hi>merely a man,</hi> exiſted in the times of the apoſtles, it is remarkable that this apoſtle takes no notice of it. It was plainly the doctrine of thoſe only who maintained that Chriſt was not truly a man that gave this apoſtle any diſturbance, or he could never have ſaid as he does, 1 John iv. 2. <hi>Every ſpirit that confeſſes that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh</hi> (that is, was truly a man) <hi>is of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, philoſophizing chriſtians began to add to the pre-exiſtent dignity of Chriſt in another way, and at length carried it much higher than thoſe upon whom this apoſtle animadverted with ſo much ſeverity. They ſaid that Chriſt was originally <hi>in God,</hi> being his <hi>reaſon,</hi> or <hi>logos,</hi> which came <hi>out of him,</hi> and was <hi>perſonified</hi> before the creation of the world, in which he was the immediate agent, and that this new perſonage was henceforth the medium of all the divine communications to mankind, having been the perſon who ſpake to Adam in Paradiſe, to Noah, to Abraham, and all the patriarchs, who delivered the law from mount Sinai, and laſtly inhabited the body of Jeſus of Nazareth.</p>
                     <p>On this principle they explained many paſſages in the Old Teſtament, in which the <hi>word of God</hi> is ſpoken of, as that of the pſalmiſt, <hi>by the word of the Lord were the heavens made,</hi> &amp;c. making this <hi>word</hi> to be <hi>a perſon,</hi> diſtinct from God, whoſe word it was; whereas nothing can be more plain, then that by the <hi>word of God</hi> in this place, is meant the <hi>power of God,</hi> exerted with as much eaſe as men utter words.</p>
                     <p>Theſe philoſophizing chriſtians, took great pains to explain how the <hi>reaſon,</hi> or <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God could thus become a perſon, diſtinct from God, and yet God continue a reaſonable being; but their account of it is too trifling to be recited in this place. However, it was far from being pretended, in general, that the doctrine of the divinity of Chriſt was ſuch a myſtery as could
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018741_0024_0FA81B851E5B06D0"/>
not be explained. For by <hi>myſtery</hi> they only meant ſomething of a ſolemn nature, which was unknown till it was revealed or explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And indeed this is plainly the uſe of the word <hi>myſtery</hi> in the New Teſtament; and it was alſo the uſual meaning of the word when the preſent tranſlation of the bible was made; the <hi>myſteries of any particular trade</hi> being the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of that trade, which yet every maſter taught his apprentices.</p>
                     <p>In this ſtate the doctrine continued till after the council of Nice, in the year of our Lord, 325; but in all this time a real ſuperiority was always acknowledged in the Father, as the only ſource of divinity; and it was even explicitly acknowledged that there was a time when the ſon of God had no ſeparate exiſtence, being only the <hi>reaſon of God,</hi> juſt as the reaſon of man is a part, or a property, of man. One of the moſt eminent of the chriſtian Fathers ſays,
<q>There was a time when God was neither a Father, nor a judge; for he could not be a Father before he had a ſon, nor a judge before there was ſin.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So far were they from ſuppoſing the ſon of God to be <hi>Equal to the Father,</hi> that when they were charged, as they frequently were, with making <hi>two Gods,</hi> they generally replied, that the ſon was only <hi>God of God,</hi> as having proceeded from a ſuperior God, which is the language of the Nicene Creed; whereas the Father was <hi>God of himſelf (autotheos</hi>) by which they meant <hi>underived,</hi> which they held to be the prerogative of the Father only.</p>
                     <p>In all this time the Jewiſh chriſtians who were not tainted with the heathen philoſophy, maintained the doctrine of the proper and ſimple humanity of Chriſt. Athanaſius himſelf was ſo far from being able to deny this, that he ſays all the Jews were ſo fully perſuaded that their Meſſiah was to be a man like themſelves, that the apoſtles were obliged to uſe great caution in divulging the doctrine of the divinity of Chriſt. He ſays that the reaſon why Peter, Acts ii. 22. only calls him <hi>a man approved of God,</hi> and why, on other occaſions in the courſe of that book, and other parts of the New Teſtament, he is ſimply called <hi>a man,</hi> was that at firſt the apoſtles did not think proper to do more than prove that Jeſus was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a Meſſiah, and that they thought it prudent to divulge the doctrine of the divinity of Chriſt by degrees. He likewiſe ſays, that the Jews of thoſe times, meaning the Jewiſh Chriſtians, being in this error themſelves drew the Gentiles into it. Athanaſius greatly commends the apoſtles for this addreſs in their circumſtances. But what the apoſtles ſcrupled to teach, we ſhould be ſcrupulous in believing.</p>
                     <p>It alſo clearly appears from eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned among the chriſtians were exceedingly averſe to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the divinity of Chriſt, even in the qualified ſenſe above mentioned, oppoſing what they called the ſupreme <hi>monarchy</hi> of the Father to the novel doctrine of the divinity of the Son; and the philoſophiſing chriſtians were obliged to make laboured apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies to theſe early unitarians, acknowledging the perfect infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018741_0025_0FA81B85DC387CC0"/>
of he Son to the Father. But at length theſe unitarians were over-borne by the ſuperior influence and popularity of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who, from believing Chriſt to be God in an inferior and qualified ſenſe of the word, came, in the natural courſe of things, to believe him to be God equal to the Father himſelf, and to have exiſted from all eternity indepently of him. But it was ſeveral cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies before this doctrine was fully eſtabliſhed. And the Holy ſpirit was generally conſidered either as the ſame thing with <hi>the power of God,</hi> that is God himſelf (juſt as the <hi>ſpirit of a man</hi> is a man) or elſe a ſuper-angelic being, inferior both to the Father and the Son, till after the council of Nice.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, Arius and his followers, ſhocked at the doctrine of Chriſt being of <hi>the ſame ſubſtance</hi> with the Father, maintained that, though he had pre-exiſted, and had been the medium of all the dipenſations of God to mankind, he was, like all other deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved beings, <hi>created out of nothing;</hi> the opinion of all ſouls having been emanations from the ſupreme mind being then generally denied by chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Thus did it pleaſe God, for reaſons unknown to us, to permit the riſe and general ſpread of the trinitarian and arian opinions, as he permitted the riſe and amazing power of the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> and many corruptions and abuſes of chriſtianity utterly ſubverſive of the genuine purity of the goſpel, till the full time for the reformation of this and other groſs corruptions of chriſtianity was come.</p>

                     <p>IT was a controverſy about the nature and uſe of baptiſm that occaſioned the ſtarting of the doctrine of <hi>the natural impotence of man to do what God requires of him,</hi> of the imputation of the <hi>ſin of Adam</hi> to all his poſterity, and of the arbitrary <hi>predeſtination</hi> of certain individuals of the human race to everlaſting life, while the reſt of mankind were left in a ſtate of <hi>reprobation;</hi> and this was ſo late as four hundred years after Chriſt. Before that time it had been the univerſal opinion of chriſtians, and of Auſtin himſelf, who firſt advanced the doctrines above-mentioned, that every man has the power of obeying or diſobeying the laws of God, that all men may be ſaved if they will, and that no decrees of God will be the leaſt obſtruction in the way of any man's ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>But Pelagius, a man of good underſtanding, and exemplary morals, in his declamations againſt ſome abuſes of baptiſm, aſſerting that baptiſm itſelf does not waſh away ſin, as was then generally ſuppoſed (on which account it was the cuſtom with many to defend it till near death) nor could have been appointed for that purpoſe, becauſe infants, which have no ſin, are baptiſed, Auſtin in oppoſition to him maintained that, though infants have no <hi>actual ſin</hi> of their own, they have the ſtain of <hi>original ſin</hi> in which they were born; though he was far from aſſerting that Adam was the <hi>federal head</hi> of all his poſterity, and that his ſin was properly <hi>imputed</hi> to them.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018741_0026_0FA81B86B2971490"/>
This was an improvement upon the doctrine in after ages. What Auſtin maintained was, that men derive a <hi>corrupt nature,</hi> or a <hi>proneneſs to ſin,</hi> from Adam.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, having been led, in the courſe of this controverſy, to aſſert that by means of original ſin no man had it in his power to attain to ſalvation, he was obliged to maintain that it depended upon the <hi>will of God</hi> only who ſhould be finally ſaved, and that he <hi>predeſtinated</hi> whom he thought proper for that purpoſe, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of any foreſight of their good works, which it was not in their power to perform without his immediate aſſiſtance, and in which he muſt be the firſt mover.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding this doctrine of the corruption of human nature, the neceſſity of divine grace for the production of every good thought or action, and the predeſtination to eternal life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to good works, advanced by Auſtin, prevailed in the weſt, chiefly through the authority of his name, it was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the eaſtern church, and was much controverted, and held with various modifications, in the weſtern. Alſo, together with this doctrine of grace, the divines of the Roman Catholic church held the doctrine of <hi>human merit,</hi> founded on the right uſe of the grace of God to man. And the preſent doctrines of <hi>grace, original ſin,</hi> and <hi>predeſtination,</hi> were never maintained in their full extent till after the reformation by Luther, who was a friar of the order of Auſtin, had been much attached to his doctrines, and made great uſe of them in oppoſing the popiſh doctrines, of <hi>indulgence,</hi> founded on that of <hi>merit.</hi>

                     <p>THE doctrine of <hi>atonement,</hi> or of the neceſſity of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> being made to the juſtice of God by the death of Chriſt, in order to his remitting the ſins of men, aroſe from an abuſe of the figurative language of ſcripture, as the doctrine of <hi>tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> alſo did. But for ſeveral centuries theſe figurative expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were underſtood and applied in a manner very different from what they now are.</p>
                     <p>It was granted by ſome pretty early writers, that we were <hi>bought</hi> (or <hi>redeemed</hi>) <hi>with a price;</hi> but then, as we had been the ſlaves of <hi>ſin,</hi> and were redeemed by God, who ranſomed us by the death of his ſon, it was maintained till after the time of Auſtin (the principal author of all the rigid doctrines that are now called <hi>Calviniſtic</hi>) that the price of our redemption was paid not <hi>to</hi> God, but <hi>by</hi> God, to the <hi>devil,</hi> in whoſe power we were. Of this opinion was Auſtin himſelf, who wrote largely on the ſubject in his treatiſe on the doctrine of the trinity. It was long after his time before we find any traces of it, being generally thought that the price of redemption was paid to the offended juſtice of God; and the preſent doctrine of atonement, founded on the idea of the abſolute neceſſity of an infinite ſatisfaction being made by
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018741_0027_0FA81B87A3B39E30"/>
one infinite being for offences of an infinite magnitude, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited againſt another infinite being, is ſubſequent to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. This doctrine was advanced by the reformers in the courſe of their controverſy with the Papiſts, about the doctrine of human merit, works of penance, and the power of granting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences. Now can it be ſuppoſed that a doctrine of ſo much importance, as this is always repreſented to be, ſhould have been unknown ſo many ages?</p>
                     <p>Thus all theſe boaſted ancient doctrines are in fact of late date, either having ariſen from the principles of heathen philoſophy, or having been ſtarted and extended in the courſe of controverſy, one falſe poſition making another neceſſary for its ſupport; and an air of awful and deep <hi>myſtery</hi> has been no ſmall recommendation of them to many of the more ignorant.</p>
                     <p>The doctrine of the <hi>trinity,</hi> having been one of the earlieſt, corruptions of chriſtianity, will probably be one of the laſt to be completely eradicated. But the time, I truſt, is faſt approaching, when, by means of the zeal of truly enlightened and good men in this great cauſe, this fundamental error, which gives ſuch great and juſt cauſe of offence to Jews and Mahometans, will be removed, and all that has been built upon it will fall to the ground.</p>

                     <p>Think not to avail yourſelves of the wretched equivocation of many divines, who imagine that they may ſafely aſcribe all divine honours to Jeſus Chriſt, on account of his <hi>union with the Father,</hi> when they believe no more of his <hi>proper divinity,</hi> than profeſſed Arians or Socinians.

To mere wordly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, to the <hi>praiſe</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> they ſacrifice that <hi>integrity,</hi> for the loſs of which worlds cannot compenſate.</p>
                     <p>The publiſher of theſe tracts does not conceal his name through the fear of any thing that <hi>men</hi> can <hi>ſay of him,</hi> or <hi>do to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018741_0028_0FA81B88D209AD00"/>
him,</hi> but merely to give what he has written a better chance of being read without prejudice. What he has done is out of a ſincere good-will and compaſſion to the multitude, who believe they know not what, or why, and what is of more conſequence, who <hi>know not what ſpirit they are of;</hi> but inſtead of <hi>ſpeaking the truth in love,</hi> miſtake bitterneſs and rancour for a zeal for God and his truth, and alſo for the ſake of a better ſort of people, who are unhappily drawn into the ſame deluſions.</p>
                     <p>The Authors name was not printed in the firſt Edition.</p>
                     <p>Conſidering the deference which the common people always pay to the judgment of men of learning, there can be little doubt but that, if thoſe perſons who, having ſtudied this ſubject, have been convinced that Chriſt is not God, and ought not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as God, had openly avowed their opinion, and had had recourſe to no mean ſubterfuge or equivocation, this fundamental article of true and rational chriſtianity had long ago been the prevailing belief; and our religion appearing more worthy of its divine author, there would have been at this time fewer unbelievers in all chriſtian countries, and many more converts made to it from other religions. And, compared with this glorious advantage, what has been gained by all the arts and ſophiſtry of miniſters, who have concealed their real meaning under ambiguous expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, leſt, as they pretend, they ſhould too much ſhock the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of their hearers?</p>
                     <p>That ſome regard ſhould be paid to the prejudices of the <hi>weak</hi> is allowed; but let not this lead men to criminal diſſimulation, or extend to things of ſo much importance as this, reſpecting the <hi>unity of God.</hi> In this caſe, let us keep at the greateſt diſtance from every thing that is <hi>diſingenuous;</hi> let the truth be ſpoken in the moſt explicit manner, and let the conſequences be left to the <hi>power of truth,</hi> and the <hi>God of truth.</hi> Beſides, it is impoſſible that while men retain depraved and unworthy notions of God, their devotion ſhould be ſuch as God requires; ſo that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended tenderneſs injures thoſe who are the objects of it, as well as bears an unfavourable aſpect on the intereſts of chriſtianity more at large. Such are the effects of the <hi>wiſdom of this world,</hi> when it is put in the place of <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and a regard to the plain <hi>truth of the goſpel</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
                     <p>Profeſſing the purity of the chriſtian faith, let us be careful, my brethren, to adorn it by a blameleſs and exemplary life. More eſpecially let us beware that we do not wear <hi>the form of godlineſs,</hi> when our hearts are deſtitute of the <hi>power</hi> of it; and that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge no ſecret hope, that by any peculiar ſtrictneſs and auſterity of life, by frequent or long prayers, or by attending on much preaching, and uſing other <hi>means</hi> of religion, we ſhall atone for a neglect of the <hi>weight of matters</hi> of the <hi>law, righteouſneſs, mercy and truth.</hi> Let the integrity of our hearts appear in the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our countenances, and let us ſhow that <hi>we love God whom we have not ſeen,</hi> by loving our <hi>brethren whom we do ſee,</hi>
                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:018741_0029_0FA81B8997920EC0"/>
and by being always ready to do them every kind office in our power.</p>
                     <p>To judge of our love to God, or of our love to Chriſt, directly, by what we <hi>feel</hi> when we think of them, eſpecially when we are excluded from the world, as is the cuſtom with many, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ourſelves to the groſſeſt and moſt dangerous deluſions. We find in the ſcriptures a much plainer, and ſafer method of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in both theſe caſes.
<q>This, <hi>ſays the apoſtle John,</hi> is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. If ye love me, <hi>ſays our Lord,</hi> keep my commandments. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you; <hi>and</hi> this is my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ye love one another. By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one for another.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Remember that true chriſtian charity is humble, modeſt, and diffident; and that he is pronounced to be happy, who <hi>feareth always,</hi> ſo as to be circumſpect in thought, word, and deed; and that, for this purpoſe, we are to <hi>put on the whole armour of God,</hi> that we may withſtand the temptations of the world.</p>
                     <p>Rather than indulge a Phariſaical pride, in recounting your <hi>experiences,</hi> boaſting how vile you have once been, or thought yourſelves to be, in order to make others believe how holy and ſanctified you are now, content yourſelves with the language and practice of the humble publican, who, ſpeaking to God and his own heart only, cried, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rejoice in all the real good you ſee done by others, whatever may be their ill will, or oppoſition to you; and be eſpecially upon your guard, leſt your juſt averſion to what is corrupt in the principles or practices of others, lead you to diſlike what is good in them. Let not the <hi>Phariſaical rigour</hi> of ſome throw you into the oppoſite extreme of <hi>levity;</hi> and let not their laying an undue ſtreſs upon praying, preaching, and other means of religion, make you neglect them as we are too apt to do, with reſpect to any thing that has been much abuſed.</p>
                     <p>Having enough to do with our own hearts, let us be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon our guard againſt that ſpirit of <hi>cenſoriouſneſs,</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſſing chriſtians indulge with too little reſtraint. Let us remember that the true chriſtian <hi>beareth all things and hopeth all things;</hi> and let us never forget the awful warning of our Lord, "Judge not that ye be not judged: for with what judgment ye "judge, ye ſhall be judged; and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</p>
                     <p>Be not moved, my Brethren, by the raſh cenſures and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of others.
<q>Perſecution, <hi>of ſome kind is what</hi> all who live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt expect to ſuffer in this world. <hi>To their</hi> wrath, anger, clamour, evil ſpeaking, and malice, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with</hi> the wiſdom that is from above; which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated; full of mercy, and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocriſy.</q>
Let us even rejoice that we are <hi>counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame,</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018741_0030_0FA81B8A6CDB1BC8"/>
inſult, <hi>for the ſake of Chriſt,</hi> though our ſufferings come not from the profeſſed enemies of Chriſt, but from <hi>falſe brethren;</hi> and let us not be concerned at being counted <hi>deceivers,</hi> if we be conſcious to ourſelves that we truly love the goſpel, and that we labour to promote and adorn it.</p>
                     <p>You will be called <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> by your adverſaries, or ſomething elſe that ſhall expreſs more of their hatred and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. But let not this offend you. If there be any proper mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe epithets, it can only be that you hold certain opinions which they deem to be falſe, but which you cheriſh, as the only genuine doctrines of the goſpel. If nothing more is meant by thoſe terms, beſides mere <hi>reproach</hi> and <hi>abuſe,</hi> think yourſelves happy, as being <hi>reproached for the name of Chriſt.</hi> 1 Peter, iv. 14. With many the appellation of <hi>Lutheran</hi> or <hi>Calviniſt</hi> is reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and with many alſo, that of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is much more ſo. Beſides, both Arminius and Socinus were men who loved the goſpel, and who ſuffered more for their adherence to it, than moſt others of the Reformers, eſpecially Socinus.</p>
                     <p>If we be Chriſtians indeed, we ſhall conſider ourſelves as <hi>not of this world,</hi> but <hi>as citizens of heaven. The friendſhip of this world,</hi> therefore, together with popularity, and ſucceſs in it, ought not to be conſidered as any object for us. If we <hi>abide in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>walk even as he alſo walked,</hi> not <hi>being conformed to this world, but being transformed by the renewing of our minds,</hi> we are <hi>heirs of a far</hi> nobler inheritance, <hi>an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for us;</hi> and <hi>when Chriſt, who is our life, and for whom we ſuffer reproach ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we alſo ſhall appear with him in glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude this addreſs with a word of advice and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to all <hi>unitarians,</hi> whether they be members of the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed church or of any ſociety of <hi>diſſenters</hi> in this country.</p>
                     <p>Of ſuch great importance is the doctrine of the <hi>divine unity;</hi> that nothing will more fully juſtify a ſeparation from any chriſtian church that does not openly profeſs it, and much more from thoſe that avow the contrary doctrine, directing prayers, and paying ſupreme worſhip, to any other than the <hi>God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was for the preſervation of this great and fundamental doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that Abraham, and his family by Iſaac and Jacob, were ſeparated from the reſt of the world, and made a diſtinct people, as it were to be the depoſitaries of the true religion, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts principally in the ſole worſhip of the one true and living God, the maker and preſerver of all things. The ſame important doctrine was uniformly taught by Chriſt and the apoſtles; though chriſtians in after times, like the Iſraelites after the time of Joſhua, relapſed into that idolatry which has generally prevailed to this day</p>
                     <p>If it was a ſufficient juſtification of the firſt reformers, that they conſidered the church from which they ſeparated as worſhipping
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018741_0031_0FA81B8D48D323D8"/>
ſaints and angels; will it not juſtify your ſeparation from their partial reformations, that you conſider them as praying to and worſhipping one whom you conſider as a <hi>man</hi> like yourſelves, though honoured and diſtinguiſhed by God above all other men?</p>
                     <p>To join habitually in public worſhip with trinitarians, is countenancing that worſhip, which you muſt conſider as <hi>idolatrous;</hi> and which, however innocent in them, is highly criminal in you. If they think it a point of conſcience not to go to maſs in popiſh churches becauſe, in their opinion, it is idolizing a <hi>piece of bread,</hi> you ought to make a point of conſcience of not worſhipping with them, becauſe in your opinion it is idolizing <hi>a man,</hi> who is as much a creature of God as a piece of bread, and juſt as impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per an object of worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the great offence to Jews, Mahometans, and the world at large, being the doctrine of the <hi>trinity,</hi> it is highly neceſſary that ſocieties of chriſtians ſhould be formed expreſsly on this principle of the <hi>divine unity,</hi> that it may be evident to all the world, that there are chriſtians, and ſocieties of chriſtians, who hold the doctrine of the trinity in as much abhorrence as they themſelves can do. For the converſion of Jews or Mahometans to chriſtianity, while it is ſuppoſed to contain the doctrine of the trinity, no perſon who knows, or has heard of Jews or Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, can ever expect.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay We unitarians are but few, even in large towns, and ſtill fewer in villages, and there are no men of leiſure or learning among us. But was not this the caſe with the primitive chriſtians, and yet this circumſtance was no obſtruction to the forming of a chriſtian church in any place. We read of churches in private houſes.</p>
                     <p>Aſſemble together, therefore, in the name and in the fear of God, and according to the order of the goſpel, every Lord's-day, if there be no more that <hi>two or three,</hi> or even a ſingle family of you in a place; read the ſcriptures, and pray together. Alſo read ſermons, or other works of moral inſtruction, of which there is, happily, no want at this day. Baptize, and adminiſter the Lord's ſupper among yourſelves; and as you grow more numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, form yourſelves upon ſome regular plan of church diſcipline; that it may be the means af uniting and keeping you together; and rigorouſly exclude all perſons whoſe conduct would be a reproach to you.</p>
                     <p>As to a <hi>learned miniſtry,</hi> it is acknowledged to be deſirable, where it can be had, but it is by no means neceſſary. The graveſt and moſt reſpectable perſons among you, and thoſe who have the moſt leiſure, will, in the character of <hi>elders,</hi> ſelect and read proper prayers and diſcourſes, and perform all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of chriſtian ſocieties, juſt as well as the elders in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive churches, who had no ſuch helps as you now have; and miraculous powers were not of long continuance with them.</p>
                     <p>If you be at preſent members of the eſtabliſhed church, you
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018741_0032_0FA81B8D7655F538"/>
will find <hi>a reformed liturgy</hi> ready prepared for your uſe by Mr. Lindſey. But if you ſhould prefer the mode of worſhip among the Diſſenters (but men of ſenſe will not make much account of ſuch diſtinctions) you may in many authors, eſpecially at the end of Mr. Holland's ſermons, find forms of ſuch prayers as you have been uſed to: or you may apply to diſſenting miniſters of your acquaintance, who will chearfully give you any aſſiſtance in their power.</p>
                     <p>All theſe are trifling obſtacles to a great deſign. It requires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a proper degree of chrſtiain <hi>zeal;</hi> but the object is worthy of it. The example has been already ſet in Scotland, where it was leaſt of all to be expected; and the ſucceſs has been ſuch as ſhould abundantly encourage ſimilar attempts in this country.</p>
                     <p>The Baptiſts and Methodiſts, not laying much ſtreſs upon a learned miniſtry, flouriſh greatly, the Independents are now taking the ſame methods, and with the ſame ſucceſs; while the rational Diſſenters, fancying they would be diſgraced by the want of a learned miniſtry, are dwindling away almoſt every where.</p>
                     <p>Whatever inconvenience may ariſe from mere <hi>novelty,</hi> it is ſoon over; and as the Methodiſts are collecting into bodies in all places; a thing of this kind will excite much leſs ſurprize. But what impreſſion ought the cenſure of the world to make upon thoſe who, as chriſtians, profeſs to be <hi>above the world,</hi> and to <hi>rejoice that they are counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame</hi> in the cauſe of Chriſt, and to think themſelves <hi>happy</hi> if they be <hi>reproached</hi> on that account. You ſhould imagine that you hear that awful <hi>voice from heaven,</hi> recorded in the book of Revelation, ch. xviii. 24. <hi>Come out of her</hi> (i. e. of myſtical Babylon, the great ſource of all the corruptions of chriſtianity) <hi>my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Be careful, however, to do this in the ſpirit of chriſtian charity, which ſhould be extended to all men, but eſpecially to all that bear the chriſtian name. Conſider them as men who are in an error, which is always involuntary. Endeavour to remove the prejudices they unhappily lie under, but forbear all angry reproaches, all inſult, and even ridicule; for religion is a ſerious thing, and <hi>brotherly love</hi> is the very eſſence of it. And if this love is to be extended even to <hi>enemies,</hi> much more ſhould it be indulged towards our merely <hi>miſtaken friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The author of this addreſs intirely approves of <hi>Mr. Lindſey's Liturgy,</hi> or that which was uſed at the Octagon Chapel in Liverpool; and he would recommend <hi>reſponſes</hi> eſpecially to ſocieties formed in this manner, in which it is particularly deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the members, bring nearly on a level, ſhould each bear his part in the ſervice.

                  <head>PREFACE TO THE TRIAL OF MR. E. ELWALL.</head>
                  <p>THIS trial is printed from the author's ſecond edition, even without altering ſuch phraſes as are peculiar to that deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of chriſtians with whom he generally aſſociated, and whoſe ſtyle he adopted; and certainly the Quakers ought to think themſelves honoured even by this kind of relation to Mr. Elwall. Such firmneſs in the cauſe of truth, and ſuch preſence of mind in aſſerting and vindicating it, as appear in this trial, are truly apoſtolical, and have had but few examples ſince the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of chriſtianity. It is impoſſible for an unprejudiced perſon to read this account of it (which is written with ſo much true ſimplicity, perſpicuity, and ſtrength of evidence) without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt veneration for the writer, the fulleſt conviction and love of the truth, and a proportionable zeal in maintaining it. I ſhould even think it impoſſible for the moſt prejudiced perſon to read it attentively, but, if he uſe no violence with his own mind, he will receive ſome favourable impreſſions both of the author, and of that cauſe, which he ſupports with ſuch becoming dignity, and with a temper and diſpoſition of mind, in every reſpect worthy of a true chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>So great was the force of truth on this memorable occaſion, that a reputable and honeſt Jury, directed by a good-natured and ſenſible judge, acquitted the criminal contrary to the expreſs laws of this country, according to which this glorious man ought to have been ſentenced to a ſevere puniſhment, as a convicted and avowed <hi>blaſphemer.</hi> What muſt a lover of <hi>truth,</hi> and of <hi>free inquiry,</hi> as ſubſervient to truth, think of ſuch laws, and of the eccleſiaſtical conſtitution of the countries in which they are in force!</p>
                  <p>It is to be wiſhed that ſuch a monument of the TRIUMPH OF TRUTH might be conſtantly held out to the view of all mankind, and particularly in this country where it was exibited.</p>
                  <p>The Dedication of the treatiſe, on account of which Mr. Elwall was proſecuted, is dated <hi>the eighth day of the ſecond month,</hi> 1724; he ſpeaks of his trial in a treatiſe intitled, <hi>A declaration againſt all kings and temporal powers under heaven,</hi> printed in 1732; and Judge Denton, before whom he was tried, went the Oxford circuit in 1726 and 1728. From theſe circumſtances it may be concluded, that the former of theſe years is the date of this remarkable trial, eſpecially as in ſome part of the ſame year 1726. Mr. Elwall publiſhed another defence of the unitarian ſyſtem, in a treatiſe which he intitled <hi>Dagon fallen before the Ark of God,</hi> which would probably have been mentioned in the courſe of the trial, if it had been publiſhed at that time.</p>

                  <head>THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH; BEING AN ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL OF MR. ELWALL. for HERESY and BLASPHEMY, at STAFFORD ASSIZES.</head>
                  <p>BECAUSE ſo many perſons have earneſtly deſired to read this trial, I have here publiſhed a ſecond edition of it, in order to encourage all honeſt men, who have the eternal law of God on their ſide, not to fear the faces of prieſts, who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the grand adverſaries of liberty and truth; and the baſtions and bulwarks of all ceremonies, ſopperies, and abſurd doctrines that are in the world.</p>
                  <p>I do this for the glory of the Moſt High God, and for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his ſacred law, and for the good of all my fellow creatures; that they may obey God, and not man; Chriſt, and not the pope; the prophets and apoſtles, and not prelates and prieſts; and God knoweth this is my ſincere deſire, that all religion and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things may be perfectly free, neither forced nor hindered; this being the true liberty of the goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>The kings of the Gentiles exerciſe authority, but it ſhall not be ſo with you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About fourteen years ago, I wrote a book intitled,
<q>A True Teſtimony for God and his ſacred Law; being a plain, honeſt defence of the firſt commandment of God, againſt all the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians under heaven, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me.</hi>
                     </q>
I lived then at <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> where my anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors have lived above eleven hundred years, ever ſince the <hi>Saxons</hi> conquered the <hi>Britons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this book was publiſhed, the prieſts in the country began to rage, eſpecially the prieſts of <hi>Wolverhampton;</hi> who had a great hand in the ſeveral troubles I underwent, In ſhort, they never ceaſed till they had procured a large indictment againſt me at <hi>Stafford</hi> aſſizes; where I felt the power of God, enabling me to ſpeak before a very great number of people; being accuſed of hereſy, &amp;c. But I truly anſwered as my beloved brother <hi>Paul</hi> did in his day, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>In that way which ſome call hereſy, ſo chuſe I to ſerve the God of my fathers, believing all that is written in the law and the prophets.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the long indictment was read, I was aſked if I pleaded guilty, or not guilty. I ſaid I was not guilty of any evil, that I knew of, in writing that book; but if they meant whether I wrote the book or not (for they had quoted many pages of the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018741_0035_0FA81B9054859DC8"/>
book in that indictment) I owned I did write it; and that if I might have liberty to ſpeak, I believed I ſhould make it manifeſt to be the plain truth of God.</p>
                  <p>Then the judge ſtood up and ſaid,
<q>Mr. <hi>Elwall,</hi> I ſuppoſe you have had a copy of your indictment?</q>
I told him I had not had any copy of it. Upon which he turned towards the prieſts, and told them that I ought to have had a copy of it. But they not anſwering, he turned to me, and ſaid, That if I would give bail, and be bound to appear at the next aſſizes, he would defer my trial till then. But I told him, I would not give bail, neither ſhould any man be bound for me; that if the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> himſelf would, he ſhould not; for, ſaid I, I have an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent breaſt, and I have injured no man; and therefore I deſire no other favour, but that I may have liberty to plead to the indictment myſelf.</p>
                  <p>Upon which he ſaid, very courteouſly, You may. The judge having given me liberty of pleading to the indictment, I began my ſpeech with the ſacred firſt commandment of God, viz. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but Me.</hi> I inſiſted upon the word <hi>Me</hi> being a ſingular; and that it was plain and certain, that God ſpake of himſelf, as one ſingle perſon or being, and not three diſtinct perſons. And that it was manifeſt, that all the church of God, which then heard thoſe words, underſtood it in the ſame plain obvious ſenſe as I do; as is moſt evident from the words of the prophet <hi>Moſes;</hi> who ſaid to Iſrael thus;
<q>Unto thee it was ſhewed, that thou mighteſt know, that the Lord he is God, there is none elſe beſides him; out of heaven he made thee hear his voice, &amp;c.</q>
I told them, that from the words <hi>he,</hi> and <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>his,</hi> it was certain God was but one ſingle perſon, one ſingle <hi>he,</hi> or <hi>him,</hi> or <hi>his.</hi> I told them, that all the patriarchs from the beginning of the world, did always addreſs themſelves to God, as one ſingle being. <hi>O</hi> thou <hi>Moſt High God, poſſeſſor of heaven and earth;</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to the king of <hi>Sodom, I have lift up my hand unto the Lord, the Moſt High God, the poſſeſſor of heaven and earth, &amp;c.</hi> They knew nothing of a trinity, nor of God's being a plurality of perſons; that monſtrous doctrine was not then born, nor for two thouſand years after, till the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy and Popery began to put up its filthy head.</p>
                  <p>Then I told them, that all the prophets witneſſed to the truth of the ſame pure uncorrupted unitarian doctrine <hi>of one God, and no other but he: Have we not all one Father, hath not one God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us?</hi> Then I told them the word of God to <hi>Abraham, I am God Almighty, walk before me, and be thou perfect;</hi> and by the prophet <hi>Iſaiah, To whom will ye <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> me, or ſhall I be equal, ſaith the holy One,</hi> not the holy Three. I told them that the words <hi>Me</hi> and <hi>One</hi> did utterly exclude any other perſon's being God, but that <hi>One</hi> ſingle <hi>Me;</hi> and that God himſelf often teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſame truth, by ſaying, <hi>Is there any God beſides Me?</hi> And then tells us plainly, <hi>There is no God, I know not any: I am
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018741_0036_0FA81B911B8D44B8"/>
the Lord, and there is none elſe: there is no God beſides me.</hi> Iſaiah xlv. 5.</p>
                  <p>Now, ſaid I, let God be true, but every man a liar, that is, every man that contradicteth him; for he is the God of truth; he ſays, <hi>I lift up my hand to heaven, I ſay, I live for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After I had pleaded many texts in the Old Teſtament, I began to enter the New: and told them, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the prophet, like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> held forth the ſame doctrine that <hi>Moſes</hi> had done; for when a certain ruler came to aſk him which was the firſt and great commandment (or how he expounded it) he told him the ſame words that <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid. <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord thy God is one Lord,</hi> not three, <hi>and thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſcribe ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt anſwered right for there is but one God, and there is no other but he,</hi> &amp;c. Then I mentioned the words of Chriſt, in the xviith of <hi>John</hi> and ver. 3. as very remarkable and worthy of all their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> And then I turned my face directly to the prieſts (my proſecutors, who all ſtood on the right ſide of the judge) Now ſaid I, ſince the lips of the bleſſed Jeſus, which always ſpoke the truth, ſays, his Father is the only true God; who is he, and who are they that dare ſet up another, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to my bleſſed Lord, who ſays, his Father is <hi>the only true God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I ſtopped here, to ſee if any of them would anſwer; but the power of God came over them, ſo that all their mouths were ſhut up, and not one of them ſpake a word. So that I turned about over my left ſhoulder, and warned the people in the fear of God, not to take their religious ſentiments from men, but from God; not from the Pope, but from Chriſt; not from Prelates nor Prieſts, but from the Prophets and Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>And then I turned towards the judge and told him, that I was the more convinced of the truth of what I had ſaid, from the words of my beſſed Lord; who ſaid, <hi>Call no man Father here upon earth; for one is your Father, even God, And call no man Maſter, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt.</hi> From hence, ſaid I, I deduce this natural inference, that in all things that are of a ſpiritual nature, we ought to take our religion from God and his prophets, from Chriſt and his apoſtles. It will be too long to mention all the texts and proofs that I made uſe of; I will only add one or two, as that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. viii. 4, 5, 6. where the apoſtle tells us, <hi>There is no other God but one; for though there be that are called gods (as there be gods many, and lords many) both in heaven and earth; but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things:</hi> ſo that I told them here was a plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; for he ſays, <hi>there is but one God;</hi> and tells us who that one God is, that is, <hi>the Father.</hi> And therefore no other perſon could be God but the Father only; and what I had wrote in my book was the plain truth, and founded on God's own words, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="unknown:018741_0037_0FA81B91D9663E38"/>In ſhort, I could plainly perceive there was a general convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through the court. The judge and juſtices of the peace did not like the proſecution; but ſaw plainly, that <hi>out of envy the prieſts had done it.</hi> I then began to ſet before them the odious nature of that hell-born principle of perſecution, and that it was hatched in hell; that it never came from Jeſus Chriſt; that he and his followers were often perſecuted themſelves, but they never perſecuted any; that we had now a very flagrant inſtance of it by the papiſts at <hi>Thorn;</hi> where they firſt took away the ſchools where our brethren the proteſtants educated their children; then they took away the places of their religious worſhip; then they put them in priſons; then confiſcated their eſtates, and, laſt of all, took away their lives.</p>
                  <p>Now we can cry out loud enough againſt this, and ſhow the inhumanity, cruelty, and barbarity of it; but, ſaid I, if we, who call ourſelves <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſhall be found acting in the ſame ſpirit, againſt others, the crime will be greater in us than in them becauſe we have attained to greater degrees of light than they.</p>
                  <p>However, I told them, that I had put my houſe in order and made up my accounts with all men as near as I could: and that as I owed no man here any thing, ſo I would not pay a penny towards this proſecution, And that I was ſure of it, that whatever fine they laid on me, or whatever hole or priſon, ſaid I, you thruſt me into, I ſhall find God's living preſence with me, as I feel it this day: And ſo ended my ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Upon this a juſtice of the peace, one <hi>Rupert Humpatch,</hi> got up, went to the judge, laid his hand upon the judge's ſhoulder, and ſaid, My Lord, I know this man to be an honeſt man; and what I ſay, I ſpeak not by by hear ſay, but experience; for I was his next door neighbour three years. Alſo another juſtice ſpoke to the ſame effect. Then the judge ſpoke to me: Mr. <hi>Elwall,</hi> I perceive you have ſtudied very deeply into this controverſy; but have you ever conſulted any of our reverend clergy, and biſhops of the church of <hi>England,</hi> I anſwered Yes, I have; and among others the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> himſelf, with whom I have exchanged ten letters, viz. four I have had from him, and ſix he has had from me. [At which words, all the prieſts ſtared very earneſtly.] Well, ſays the judge, and was not the archbiſhop able to give you ſome ſatisfaction in theſe points, Mr. <hi>Elwall?</hi> I ſaid, no; but rather quite the reverſe; for that in all the letters I ſent to the archbiſhop, I grounded my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the word of God and his prophets, Chriſt and his apoſtles; but in his anſwers to me, he referred me to acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and declarations of ſtate, &amp;c. whereas I told the biſhop, in one of my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that I wondered a man of his natural and acquired abilities, ſhould be ſo weak as to turn me over to human authorities, in things of a divine nature; for though in all things that are of a temporal nature, and concern the civil ſociety, <hi>I will be ſubject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018741_0038_0FA81B92A4616290"/>
ſake;</hi> even from the king upon the throne, down to the meaneſt officer in the land; but in things that are of a ſpiritual nature, and concern my faith; my worſhip of God, and future ſtate, I would <hi>call no man father here upon earth,</hi> nor regard either popes or councils, prelates or prieſts of any denomination, nor convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, nor aſſemblies of divines: but obey God and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Chriſt and his apoſtles. Upon which the judge anſwered, Well, if his Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was not able to give you ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction Mr <hi>Elwall,</hi> I believe I ſhall not: and ſo ſat down and and reſted him, for I think he had ſtood up for near an hour and a quarter.</p>
                  <p>Then he ſtood up again, and turning to the prieſts, talked ſoftly to them. I did not hear what he ſaid, or what they ſaid to him; but I gueſſed from what the judge ſaid next, for, ſays he, Mr. <hi>Elwall,</hi> you cannot but be ſenſible that what you have writ, being contrary to the commonly received doctrines of the church, it has given offence to ſome of your neighbours, and particularly to the clergy; are you willing to promiſe, before the face of the country here, that you will not write any more on this head? I anſwered, God forbid that I ſhould make thee any ſuch promiſe; for when I wrote this book, I did it in the fear of God; and I did not write it to pleaſe the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the church of <hi>England,</hi> nor the church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but to pleaſe that God who gave me my breath; and therefore, if at any time I find myſelf drawn forth to write in defence of this ſacred firſt commandment, or any other of the ten, I hope I ſhall do it in the ſame ſpirit of ſincerity as I have done this. And I perceived the judge was not in any wiſe diſpleaſed at my honeſt, plain, bold anſwer, but rather his heart ſeemed to be knit in love to me; and he ſoon declared me acquitted: and then the clerk of the arrraigns, or aſſizes, ſtood up, and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Elwall</hi> you are acquitted: you may go out of court when you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>So I went away through a very great croud of people (for it was thought there was a thouſand people at the trial) and having ſpoken long I was a-thirſt, ſo went to a well and drank. Then went out of town by a river-ſide, and looking about and ſeeing no one near, I kneeled down on the bank of the river and ſent up my thank offering to that good God who had delivered me out of their hands.</p>
                  <p>By the time that I returned to the town, the court was up and gone to dinner: a juſtice of peace and another perſon met me, and would have me to eat and drink with them, which I did: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as I was walking along the ſtreet, ſome perſons hove up a great <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>-window and invited me up to them, and when I entered the room, I found ten or a dozen perſons, moſt of them juſtices of the peace, and amongſt them a prieſt, whom they called Doctor. One of the juſtices took me by the hand, and ſaid Mr. <hi>Elwall,</hi> I am heartily glad to ſee you, and I was glad to hear you bear your teſtimony ſo boldly as you did. Yes, ſays another juſtice, and I was glad <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Mr. <hi>Elwall</hi> came off with flying colours as he did:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="unknown:018741_0039_0FA81B9355C51308"/>Upon which the Prieſt ſaid (in a very bitter manner) <hi>He ought to have been hanged.</hi> I turned unto him, and ſaid Friend, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>thou doſt not know what ſpirit thou art of; for the ſon of man came not to deſtroy but to ſave,</hi> But thou wouldeſt have me deſtroyed. Upon which one of the juſtices ſaid, How, now Doctor, did not you hear one of the juſtices ſay, that he was an honeſt man, and that what he ſaid, was not by hear-ſay, but by experience, and would you have honeſt men hanged. Doctor? Is this good doctrine? So that the prieſt ſaid but little more for ſome time.</p>
                  <p>So I took leave of the juſtices, and took horſe for <hi>Wolverhamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> for I knew there would be great joy in my family, for the common people all expected to hear of my being fined and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned. But a farmer that lived near, who had been upon the jury at <hi>Stafford</hi> got to town before me, and the people went all up and aſked him. What have they done to Mr. <hi>Elwall?</hi> Have they put him in priſon? He anſwered
<q>No, he preached there an hour together, and our parſons could ſay never a word. What muſt they put him in priſon for? I told our foreman of the jury. Mr. <hi>Elwall</hi> was an honeſt man, and his father was an honeſt man, I knew him very well</q>
ſo they were all damped. But there was great joy in my family, and amongſt all my friends: Praiſes, living praiſes be attributed to that good God who deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me out of their hands!</p>
                  <p>Chriſt never told us of that ſcandalous popiſh invention, of his human nature praying to his divine nature: but, like a true obedient ſon of God, ſubmitted to death, even that cruel death which the hatred and envy of perſecuting wicked prieſts inflicted on him, becauſe he had ſo plainly and truly told them all of their blindneſs, covetouſneſs, pride, and hypocriſy. And therefore <hi>God raiſed him from the dead;</hi> and for his faithfulneſs, <hi>God has exalted him to be a prince and a ſaviour</hi> to all thoſe that obey that pure doctrine which God gave him to teach; <hi>that denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and ſinful luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly and righteouſly in this world Then are we his diſciples indeed, when we do thoſe things that he hath commanded.</hi> Then ſhall we be ſaved, not by the merits of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is another popiſh invention; for he never did any thing but what was his duty to do, and therefore could not merit any thing for others: but he taught us the true way to find acceptance with God, and that was by "doing the will of his Father which is in heaven: and therein he is the way, the truth, and the life, "becauſe no one cometh unto the Father, but by that way.</p>
                  <p>Neither did he make ſatisfaction unto God for us. It was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: and what God never required: But
<q>he who had no pleaſure in the death of ſinners, but rather that they ſhould turn from wickedneſs and live,</q>
out of the immeaſureable height and depth of his love, directed our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to teach man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind a never failing way of being reconciled to God, and that was by ſincere repentance and reformation. This was the goſpel
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018741_0040_0FA81B9415876210"/>
or good tidings of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> He tells us, <hi>I am not come to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance;</hi> and by that beautiful excellent parable of the prodigal ſon, he illuſtrates the tender mercy of his God, and our God, of his Father and our Father, without any ſatisfaction. The compaſſionate Father required none at all, but humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and ſubmiſſion, with ſincere repentance, and reformation, and then comes <hi>the beſt robe, the ring, the ſhoes, and the fatted calf,</hi> to demonſtrate the paternal acceptance without ſatisfaction or ſacrifice, <hi>but a broken and a contrite heart which he will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe;</hi> for he can as ſoon ceaſe to be God, as ceaſe to be merciful.</p>
                  <p>And as to the trinitarians, nothing is more plain, than that they feed upon aſhes: <hi>a deceived heart hath turned them aſide,</hi> becauſe they will not make uſe of thoſe rational faculties which God hath given them; nor ſay, <hi>Is there not a lye in my right hand?</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would never flatter the humble <hi>Jeſus,</hi> nor make the moſt high God to be a plurality of perſons.</p>
                  <p>For as to the Holy Ghoſt (their third God) it is evidently no diſtinct perſon from God, any more than a man's ſpirit is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct perſon from the man; ſo that the Spirit of God is God's ſpirit; as is manifeſt from ſcripture and reaſon, Gen. vi. 3.
<q>My ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man: And the ſpirit of God moved upon the face of the waters: And God ſaid, Let there be light, and there was light. And God ſaid, Let there be a firmament in the midſt of the waters And God made all things by the word of his power.</q>
So that the word of God, and the ſpirit of God, are not diſtinct perſons from God, but the power of God, and the energy of God. So the word of a man, and the ſpirit of a man, are not diſtinct perſons from the man, but the man himſelf; if his word be falſe, or his ſpirit be wicked, the man is falſe and wicked.</p>
                  <p>The ſame degree of ſtupidity that leads trinitarians to call the word of God, and the ſpirit of God, diſtinct perſons, would lead them to call the wiſdom of God, the goodneſs of God, the love of God, the peace of God, the power of God, and the mercy of God, diſtinct perſons; and make God to be a trinity of trinities: for it is certain, God is expreſſly called by all thoſe names.</p>
                  <p>But whoſoever goes about to father this abſurd and horrid doctrine of the trinity upon Jeſus Chriſt, do egregiouſly abuſe him; who told us plainly, <hi>his Father was greater than he; and that he could do nothing of himſelf,</hi> which is a demonſtration that he is not God: For we are ſure God is omnipotent, and can do all things of himſelf; being ſelf-exiſtent and independent, the ſupreme cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the univerſe; and in this it is, that the unitarians triumph as unſwerable, believing in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who told us his Father was <hi>the only true God,</hi> John xvii. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P. S.</hi> By theſe laſt words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I myſelf was convinced many years ago.</p>

                     <p>THAT the doctrine of the trinity could ever have been ſuggeſted by any thing in the courſe of nature (though it has been imagined by ſome perſons of a peculiarly fanciful turn, and previouſly perſuaded of the truth of that doctrine) is not maintained by any perſons to whom my writings can be at all uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I ſhall therefore only addreſs myſelf to thoſe who believe the doctrine on the ſuppoſition of its being contained in the ſcriptures, at the ſame time maintaining, that, though it is <hi>above,</hi> it is not properly <hi>contrary</hi> to reaſon; and I hope to make it ſufficiently evident, either that they do not hold the doctrine, or that the doctrine of <hi>three divine perſons conſtituting one God</hi> is ſtrictly ſpeaking an <hi>abſurdity,</hi> or <hi>contradiction;</hi> and that it is therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any proof, even by miracles. With this view, I ſhall recite in order all the diſtinct modifications of this doctrine, and ſhew that, upon any of them, there is either no proper <hi>unity,</hi> in the divine nature, or no proper <hi>trinity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If, with Dr. Waterland, and others who are reckoned the ſtricteſt Athanaſians (though their opinions were not known in the time of Athanaſius himſelf) it be ſuppoſed that there are three perſons properly equal, and that no one of them has any ſort of ſuperiority over the reſt, they are, to all intents and purpoſes, three diſtinct Gods. For if each of them, ſeparately conſidered, be poſſeſſed of all divine perfections, ſo that nothing is wanting to complete divinity, each of them muſt be as properly <hi>a God</hi> as any being poſſeſſed of all the properties of man muſt be a man; and therefore <hi>three perſons</hi> poſſeſſed of all the attributes of divinity muſt be as properly <hi>three Gods</hi> as three perſons poſſeſſed of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man attributes muſt be three men. Theſe three perſons, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt be incapable of any ſtrict or numerical <hi>unity.</hi> It muſt be univerſally true, that <hi>three things</hi> to which the ſame definition applies can never make only <hi>one thing</hi> to which the ſame definition applies.

Moreover, as upon this ſcheme the Son was never capable of giving birth to another perſon like himſelf, he muſt have been originally inferior in power to the Father, the ſource from which he himſelf ſprung. On this ſcheme, therefore, there is no proper <hi>equality</hi> between theſe divine perſons; and the ante-nicene fathers did not pretend that there was, but diſtinguiſhed the Father by the epithet of (<hi>autotheos) God of himſelf,</hi> and the Son by the inferior title of (<hi>theos ek theou God of God,</hi> or a derived God.</p>

                     <p>THE Arian doctrine, of the world having been made and governed not by the ſupreme God himſelf, but by Chriſt, the ſon of God, though no contradiction in itſelf, is upon ſeveral accounts highly improbable.</p>
                     <p>Our reaſoning from effects to cauſes, carries us no farther than to the immediate creator of the viſible univerſe. For if we can ſuppoſe that being to have had a cauſe, or author, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that his cauſe or author had a higher cauſe, and ſo on <hi>ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum.</hi> According to the light of nature, therefore, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe or author of the viſible univerſe, is the ſelf-exiſtent firſt cauſe, and not any being acting under him, as his inſtrument. However, the ſcheme itſelf is not naturally impoſſible; ſince a being poſſeſſed of power ſufficient to produce the viſible univerſe, which is a limited production, may be <hi>finite,</hi> and therefore may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive his power and his being from one who is ſuperior to him. But though the Arian ſcheme cannot be ſaid to be in itſelf impoſſible, it is on ſeveral accounts, extremely improbable <hi>a priori,</hi> and therefore ought not to be admitted without very ſtrong and clear evidence.</p>
                     <p>If this great derived being, the ſuppoſed maker and governor of the world, was united to a human body, he muſt either have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and have exerciſed his extraordinary powers during this union, or have been diveſted of them; and either ſuppoſition has its peculiar difficulties and improbabilites.</p>
                     <p>If this great being retained his proper powers during this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he muſt have been ſuſtaining the whole univerſe, and ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending all the laws of nature, while he was in infant at the breaſt of his mother, and while he hung upon the croſs. And to imagine the creator of the world to have been in thoſe
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018741_0045_0FA81B97E0CA64D8"/>
circumſtances, is an idea at which the mind revolts, almoſt as much as at that of the ſupreme God himſelf being reduced to them.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, if Chriſt retained and exerciſed all his former powers in this ſtate of apparent humiliation, he muſt have wrought all his miracles by a power properly <hi>his own,</hi> a power naturally <hi>belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him,</hi> as much as the power of ſpeaking and walking belongs to any other man. But this is expresſly diſclaimed by our ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, when he ſaid, that <hi>of himſelf he could do nothing,</hi> and that it was the <hi>Father within him who did the works.</hi> Alſo, on this ſuppoſition, it muſt have been this ſuper-angelic being united to the body of Jeſus, that raiſed him from the dead; whereas this is an effect which is always aſcribed to God the Father only.</p>
                     <p>If, on the other hand, Chriſt was diveſted of his original powers, or <hi>emptied himſelf</hi> of them upon his incarnation, the whole ſyſtem of the government of the univerſe muſt have been changed during his reſidence upon earth. Either ſome other derived being (which this ſcheme does not provide) muſt have taken his place, or the ſupreme being himſelf muſt have condeſcended to do that which the ſcheme ſuppoſes there was an impropriety in his doing. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the making and the governing of the world would not have been delegated to another, if there had not been ſome good reaſon in the nature of things, though it be unknown to us and may be indiſcoverable by us, why the world ſhould have been made and governed by a derived being, and not by the ſupreme being himſelf. And this reaſon, whatever it was, muſt, as far as we can judge, have operated during the time that Chriſt was upon the earth, as well as before.</p>
                     <p>If Chriſt was degraded to the ſtate of a mere man during his humiliation on earth, reaſon will aſk, why might not a mere man have been ſufficient? Since, notwithſtanding his original powers, nothing was, in fact, done by him, more than any other man, aided and aſſiſted by God as he was, might have been equal to.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the object of Chriſt's miſſion, and the beings whom it reſpected, viz. the <hi>race of man,</hi> we cannot but think that there muſt have been a greater propriety, and uſe, in the appointment of a mere man to that office. What occaſion was there for any being ſuperior to man for the purpoſe of communicating the will of God to man? And as an example of a reſurrection to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life (to enforce which was the great object of his miſſion the) death and reſurrection of one who was properly and ſimply a man, was certainly far better adapted to give men ſatisfaction concerning their own future reſurrection, than the ſeeming death (for it could be nothing more) of ſuch a being as the maker of the world, and the reſurrection of a body to which he had been united. For, as he was a being of ſo much higher rank, it might be ſaid, that the laws of his nature might be very different from thoſe of ours; and therefore he might have privileges to which we could not pretend, and to which we ought not to aſpire.</p>
                     <p>If the world was created and governed by a derived being, this
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018741_0046_0FA81B98ADAE5DD0"/>
being, on whom we immediately depended, would be that to whom all men would naturally look. He would neceſſarily become the object of their prayers, in conſequence of which the ſupreme being would be overlooked, and become a mere cypher in the univerſe.</p>
                     <p>As modern philoſophy ſuppoſes that there are innumerable worlds inhabited by rational and imperfect beings (for all <hi>creatures</hi> muſt be finite and imperfect) beſides this of ours, it cannot be ſuppoſed but that many of them muſt have ſtood in as much need of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the maker of the univerſe as we have done. And can we ſuppoſe either that this ſhould be the only ſpot in the univerſe ſo highly diſtinguiſhed, or that the maker of it ſhould undergo as many degradations as this ſcheme may require?</p>
                     <p>The doctrine of Chriſt's pre-exiſtence goes upon the idea of the poſſibility, at leaſt, of the pre-exiſtence of other men, and ſuppoſes an immaterial ſoul in man, altogether independent of the body; ſo that it muſt have been capable of thinking and acting before his birth, as well as it will be after his death. But theſe are ſuppoſitions which no appearance in nature favours.</p>
                     <p>The Arian hypotheſis, therefore, though it implies no proper contradiction, is on ſeveral accounts, highly improbable <hi>a priori,</hi> and therefore ought not to be admitted without very clear and ſtrong evidence.</p>

                     <p>I SHALL now ſhew, in as conciſe a manner as I can, that the doctrine of the trinity, and alſo the Arian hypotheſis, has as little countenance from the ſcriptures as it has from reaſon. The ſcriptures teach us that there is but one God, who is himſelf the maker and the governor of all things; that this one God is the ſole object of worſhip, and that he ſent Jeſus Chriſt to inſtruct mankind, impowered him to work miracles, raiſed him from the dead, and gave him all the power that he ever was, or is now poſſeſſed of.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The ſcriptures contain the cleareſt, and moſt expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations that there is but <hi>one God,</hi> without ever mentioning any exception in favour of <hi>a trinity,</hi> or guarding us againſt being led into any miſtake by ſuch general and unlimited expreſſions. Ex. xx. 3. "Thou ſhalt have no other God before me." Deut. vi. 4. "Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord our God, is one Lord." Mark xii. 20.
<q>The firſt of all the commandments is, Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord our God is one Lord.</q>

Chriſt indeed ſays, John x, 30. "I and my Father are one;" but he ſufficiently explains himſelf, by praying that his diſciples might be one with him in the ſame ſenſe in which he was one with the Father. John xvii. 21.22
<q>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us; and the glory which thou gaveſt to me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.</q>

                     <p n="2">2. This one God is ſaid to have created all things; and no intimation is given of his having employed any <hi>inferior agent,</hi> or <hi>inſtrument,</hi> in the work of creation. GEN. i. 1. <hi>In the begining God created the heaven and the earth.</hi>—v. <hi>God ſaid let there be light, and there was light,</hi> Ps. xxxiii 6. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoſt of them by the breath of his mouth</hi>—v. ix. <hi>He ſpake, and it was done, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and it ſtood faſt.</hi> Is. xliv. 24. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things, that ſtretched forth the heavens alone, that ſpreadeth abroad the earth by myſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. This one God is called the <hi>Father,</hi> i. e. the author of all beings; and he is called God and Father with reſpect to Chriſt, as well as all other perſons. JOHN vi. 27, <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the Son of man ſhall give unto you; for him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi> JOHN xvii. 3, <hi>That they might know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> JOHN xx. 17. <hi>Go to my brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God, and your God.</hi> EPH. i. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Chriſt is ſaid expreſlly to be inferior to the Father, all his power is ſaid to have been given him by the Father, and he could do nothing without the Father. JOHN xiv. 28, <hi>My Father is greater than I.</hi> 1 COR. iii. 23, <hi>Ye are Chriſt's and Chriſt is God's.</hi> 1 COR. xi. 3, <hi>The head of Chriſt is God.</hi> JOHN v. 19, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the Son can do nothing of himſelf.</hi> John xiv. 10, <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you I ſpeak not of myſelf, but the Father that dwelleth in me he doth the works.</hi> Matt. xxviii. 18, <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</hi> 2 Pet. i. 17, <hi>He received from God the Father honour and glory.</hi> Rev. i. 1, <hi>The revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave unto him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is now alledged, that Chriſt did not mean that he was inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to the Father with reſpect to his <hi>divine nature,</hi> but only with reſpect to his <hi>human nature.</hi> But if ſuch liberties be taken in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining a perſon's meaning, language has no uſe whatever. On
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018741_0048_0FA81B9CABE28710"/>
the ſame principles, it might be aſſerted that Chriſt never died, or that he never roſe from the dead, ſecretly meaning his divine nature only. There is no kind of impoſition but what might be authorized by ſuch an abuſe of language as this.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Some things were with-held from Chriſt by his Father, Mark xiii. 32,
<q>But of that day, and that hour, knoweth no man; no not the angels that are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Matt. xx. 23, To ſit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give; but it ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 As all the dominion that Chriſt has was derived from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo it is ſubordinate to that of the Father, 1 Cor. xv 24, &amp;c.
<q>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power For he muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he ſaith that all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted who did put all things under him. And when all things ſhall be ſubdued to him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Chriſt always prayed to the Father, and with as much humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and reſignation, as any man, or the moſt dependent being in the univerſe, could poſſibly do. Our Lord's whole hiſtory is a proof of this; but eſpecially the ſcene of his agony in the garden, Matt. xxvi. 37, &amp;c.
<q>And he began to be ſorry and very heavy; Then ſaith he unto them, my ſoul is exceeding ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful even unto death, tarry ye here and watch with me. And he went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed, ſaying, O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me; nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou will.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Chriſt is not only ſtiled <hi>a man</hi> even after his reſurrection, but the reaſoning of the apoſtles, in ſome of the paſſages where he is ſpoken of, require that he ſhould be conſidered as a man with reſpect to <hi>his nature,</hi> and not in <hi>name</hi> only, as their reaſoning has no force but upon that ſuppoſition. ACTS ii. 22,
<q>Jeſus of Nazareth, a man approved of by God, by miracles and wonders, and ſigns, which God did by him, in the midſt of you</q>
HEB. ii. 17, "Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren. HEB. ii. 10,
<q>It became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſons unto glory, to make the captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſuffering,</q>
1. COR xv, 21.
<q>For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection from the dead. For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9 Whatever exaltation Chriſt now enjoys, it is the gift of his Father, and the reward of his obedience unto death. PHIL. ii. 8, 9,
<q>And being in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:018741_0049_0FA81B9D1BE386C0"/>
became obedient to death, even the death of the croſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name,</q>
HEB ii. 9
<q>But we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the ſuffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.</q>
HEB. xii 2, Looking unto
<q>Jeſus, the author and finiſher of our faith; who for the joy which was ſet before him endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and ſat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let it alſo be conſidered, that no uſe whatever is made of the doctrine of the incarnation of the maker of the world, in all the New Teſtament. We are neither informed <hi>why</hi> ſo extraordinary a meaſure was neceſſary for the ſalvation of men, nor that it <hi>was</hi> neceſſary. All that can be pretended is, that it is <hi>alluded to</hi> in certain expreſſions. But certainly it might have been expected that a meaſure of this magnitude ſhould have been expreſlly declared, if not clearly explained; that mankind might have no doubt what great things had been done for them; and that they might reſpect their great deliverer, as his nature, and his proper rank in the creation, required.</p>
                     <p>The author of the epiſtle to the Hebrews evidently conſidered Chriſt as a being of a different rank from that of angels; and the reaſon why he ſays that he ought to be ſo, is, that he might have a feeling of our infirmities. But, certainly, we ſhall be more eaſily ſatisfied that any perſon really <hi>felt</hi> as a man, if he was truly a man, and nothing more than a man; than if he was a ſuperior being, and eſpecially a being ſo far ſuperior to us as the maker of the world muſt have been, degraded to the condition of a man. Becauſe, if he had any recollection of his former ſtate, the idea of that muſt have borne him up under his difficulties and ſufferings, in ſuch a manner as no mere man could have been ſupported. And it is ſuppoſed by the Arians that Chriſt had a knowledge of his prior ſtate, for they ſuppoſe him to have referred to it in his prayer to the Father, for <hi>the glory which he had with him before the world was;</hi> and yet this is hardly conſiſtent with the account that Luke gives of his <hi>increaſing in wiſdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No perſon, I think, can, with an unprejudiced mind, attend to theſe conſiderations, and the texts of ſcripture above recited (which are perfectly agreeable to the tenor of the whole) and imagine that it was the intention of the ſacred writers to repreſent Chriſt either as the ſupreme God, or as the maker of the world under God. There is another hypotheſis, of ſome modern Arians, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents Chriſt as having pre-exiſted; but not as having been the creator or governor of the world, or the medium of all the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of God to mankind. But thoſe texts of ſcripture which ſeem to be moſt expreſs in favour of Chriſt's pre-exiſtence; do likewiſe, by the ſame mode of interpretation, repreſent him as the maker of the world; ſo that if the favourers of this hypotheſis can ſuppoſe the language of theſe texts to be figurative, they may more eaſily ſuppoſe the other to be figurative alſo; and that

whatever obſcurity there may be in them, they were not intended to refer to any pre-exiſtence at all.</p>
                     <p>The paſſages of ſcripture which are ſuppoſed to ſpeak of Chriſt, as the maker of the world, are the following, viz. JOHN i. 1, 10. EPH. iii. 9. COL. i. 15, &amp;c. HEB i. 1, &amp;c. Theſe, I will venture to ſay, are the texts that moſt ſtrongly favour the notion of Chriſt's pre-exiſtence, and no perſon can doubt but that, if they muſt be interpreted to aſſert that Chriſt pre-exiſted at all, they, with the ſame clearneſs, aſſert that he was the maker of the world. But if theſe texts admit of a figurative interpretation, all the other texts, which are ſuppoſed to refer to the <hi>pre-exiſtence only</hi> will more eaſily admit of a ſimilar conſtruction. Theſe two opinions, therefore, viz. that Chriſt pre-exiſted, and that he was the maker of the world, ought, by all means, to ſtand or fall together; and if any perſon think the latter to be improbable, and contrary to the plain tenor of the ſcriptures (which uniformly repreſent the ſupreme being himſelf, without the aid of any inferior agent, or inſtrument, as the maker of the univerſe) he ſhould abandon the doctrine of ſimple pre-exiſtence alſo.</p>
                     <p>In what manner the proper unitarians interpret theſe paſſages of ſcripture, may be ſeen in my <hi>Familiar Illuſtration of particular texts of ſcripture,</hi> in ſeveral of the <hi>Socinian tracts,</hi> in three volumes quarto, and eſpecially in <hi>Mr. Lindſey's Sequel to his Apology,</hi> p. 455, to which I refer my reader for a farther dicuſſion of this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>It is only of late years, that any perſons have pretended to ſeparate the two opinions of Chriſt's pre-exiſtence, and of his being the maker of the world. All the antient Arians maintained both, as did Dr. Clarke, Mr. Whiſton, Mr. Emlyn, Mr Pierce, and their followers; and I do not know that any other hypotheſis, has appeared <hi>in writing,</hi> except that it is alluded to in the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Repoſitory.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 IT is acknowledged by early writers of the orthodox per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, that two kinds of hereſy exiſted in the times of the apoſtles, viz. that of thoſe who held that Chriſt was ſimply a man, and that of the Gnoſtics; of whom ſome believed that Chriſt was man only in appearance, and others that it was only Jeſus, and not the Chriſt (a pre-exiſtent ſpirit who deſcended from heaven and dwelt in him) that ſuffered on the croſs. Now the apoſtle John animadverts with the greateſt ſeverity upon the latter, but makes makes no mention of the former; and can it be thought probable
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018741_0051_0FA81B9E94D4A440"/>
that he would paſs it without cenſure, if he had thought it to be an error; conſidering how great, and how dangerous an error it has always been thought by thoſe who have conſidered it as being an error at all? Maxim 12. H. p. 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The great objection that Jews have always made to chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in its preſent ſtate is, that it enjoins the worſhip of more gods than one; and it is a great article with the chriſtian writers of the ſecond and following centuries to anſwer this objection. But it does not appear in all the book of Acts, in which we hear much of the cavils of the Jews, both in Jeruſalem and in many parts of the Roman empire, that they made any ſuch objection to chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity then; nor do the apoſtles either there, or in their epiſtles, advance any thing with a view to ſuch an objection. It may be preſumed, therefore, that no ſuch offence to the Jews had then been given, by the preaching of a doctrine ſo offenſive to them as that of the divinity of Chriſt muſt have been. Maxim 12, 13. L. p 50</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As no Jew had originally any idea of their Meſſiah being more than a man, and as the apoſtles and the firſt chriſtians had certainly the ſame idea at firſt concerning Jeſus, it may be ſuppoſed that, if ever they had been informed that Jeſus was not a man, but either God himſelf, or the maker of the world under God, we ſhould have been able to trace the time and the circumſtances in which ſo a great a diſcovery was made to them; and alſo that we ſhould have perceived the effect which it had upon their minds; at leaſt by ſome change in their manner of ſpeaking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. But nothing of this kind is to be found in the goſpels, in the book of Acts, or in any of the Epiſtles. We perceive marks enow of other new views of things, eſpecially of the call of the Gentiles to partake of the privileges of the goſpel; and we hear much of the diſputes and the eager contention which it occaſioned. But how much more muſt all their prejudices have been ſhocked by the information that a perſon whom they firſt took to be <hi>a mere man,</hi> was not a man, but either God himſelf, or the maker of the world under God? Maxim 13. L. p. 55</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All the Jewiſh chriſtians, after the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, which was immediately after the age of the apoſtles are, ſaid to have been <hi>Ebionites;</hi> and theſe were only of two ſorts, ſome of them holding the miraculous conception of our ſaviour, and others believing that he was the ſon of Joſeph, as well as of Mary. None of them are ſaid to have believed either that he was God, or the maker of the world under God. And is it at all credible that the body of the Jewiſh chriſtians, if they had ever been inſtructed by the apoſtles in the doctrine of the divinity, or pre-exiſtence of Chriſt, would ſo ſoon, and ſo generally, if not univerſally, have abandoned that faith? Maxim 6. H. p. 7. R. p. 3. L. p. 14.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Had Chriſt been conſidered as God, or the maker of the world under God, in the early ages of the church, he would

But prayers to Jeſus Chriſt were not uſed in early times, but gained ground gradually, with the opinion of Chriſt being God, and the object of worſhip. Maxim 14. L. p 81.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Athanaſius repreſents the apoſtles as obliged to uſe great caution not to offend their firſt converts with the doctrine of Chriſt's divinity, and as forbearing to urge that topic till they were firſt well eſtabliſhed in the belief of his being the Meſſiah. He adds, that the Jews being in an error on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, drew the Gentiles into it. Chryſoſtom agrees with Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius in this repreſentation of the ſilence of the apoſtles in their firſt preaching, both with reſpect to the divinity of Chriſt, and his miraculous conception. They both repreſent them as leaving their diſciples to learn the doctrine of Chriſt's divinity, by way of <hi>inference</hi> from certain expreſſions; and they do not pretend to produce any inſtance in which they taught that doctrine clearly and explicitly.

                     <p n="7">7. Hegeſippus, the firſt chriſtian hiſtorian, himſelf a Jew, and therefore probably an Ebionite, enumerating the hereſies of his time, mentions ſeveral of the Gnoſtic kind, but not that of Chriſt being a mere man. He moreover ſays, that in travelling to Rome, where he arrived in the time of A<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> only. Juſtin Martyr alſo, and Clemens Alexandrinus, who wrote after He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſippus, treat largely of hereſies in general, without mentioning, or alluding to the unitarians. Maxim 8 H p 8. R p 8.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. All thoſe who were deemed <hi>heretics</hi> in early times; were cut off from the communion of thoſe who called themſelves the <hi>orthodox</hi> chriſtians, and went by ſome particular name; generally that of their leader. But the unitarians among the Gentiles were not expelled from the aſſemblies of chriſtians, but worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped along with thoſe who were called orthodox, and had no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular name till the time of Victor, who excommunicated Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus; and a long time after that Epiphanius endeavoured to give them the name of Alogi. And though the Ebionites, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably about or before this time, had been excommunicated by the Gentile Chriſtians, it was, as Jerom ſays <hi>only</hi> on account of their rigid adherence to the law of Moſes. Maxim 5. H. p. 14. L. p. 25.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Apoſtles creed</hi> is that which was taught to all catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens before baptiſm, and additions were made to it from time to time in order to exclude thoſe who were denominated <hi>heretics.</hi> Now, though there are ſeveral articles in that creed which allude to the Gnoſtics and tacitly condemn them, there was not, in the time of Tertullian, any article in it that alluded to the unitari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018741_0053_0FA81BA015775898"/>
ſo that even then any unitarian, at leaſt one believing the miraculous conception, might have ſubſcribed it. It may, therefore, be concluded, that ſimple unitarianiſm was not deemed he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical at the end of the ſecond century. Maxim 7. L. p. 27.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 It is acknowledged by Euſebius and others, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient unitarians themſelves, conſtantly aſſerted that their doctrine was the prevailing opinion of the chriſtian church till the time of Victor. Maxim 2 H. p. 18. R. p. 25.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Juſtin Martyr, who maintains the pre-exiſtence of Chriſt, is ſo far from calling the contrary opinion a <hi>hereſy,</hi> that what he ſays on the ſubject is evidently an apology for his own: and when he ſpeaks of <hi>heretics in general,</hi> which he does with great indignation, as no chriſtians, and having no communication with chriſtians, he mentions the Gnoſtics only. Maxim 12. H. p. 17. R. p. 15. L. p. 127.</p>

                        </gap>, who was after Juſtin and who wrote a large treatiſe on the ſubject of hereſy, ſays very little concerning the Ebionites. Thoſe Ebionites he ſpeaks of as believing that Chriſt was the ſon of Joſeph, and he makes no mention of thoſe who believed the miraculous conception. Maxim. 12. H p. 15. L. p 32, 118.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Tertullian repreſents the majority of the common or unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chriſtians, the <hi>Idiot<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

It may therefore be preſumed that, as the unitarian doctrine was held by the common people in the time of Tertullian, it had been more general ſtill before that time, and probably univerſal in the apoſtolical age. Athanaſius alſo mentions it as a ſubject of complaint to the orthodox of his age that <hi>the many,</hi> and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, perſons of <hi>low underſtandings,</hi> were inclined to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian doctrine. Maxim 4, 10. R p 26 L. p. 49.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The firſt who held and diſcuſſed the doctrine of the pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence and divinity of Chriſt, acknowledged that their opinions were exceedingly unpopular among the unlearned chriſtians; that theſe dreaded the doctrine of the trinity, thinking that it infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the doctrine of the ſupremacy of God the Father; and the learned chriſtians make frequent apologies to them, and to others, for their own opinion. Maxim 10. H. p. 54.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The divinity of Chriſt was firſt advanced and urged by thoſe who had been heathen philoſophers, and eſpecially thoſe who were admirers of the doctrine of Plato, who held the opinion of a ſecond God. Auſtin ſays, that he conſidered Chriſt as no other than a moſt excellent man, and that he had no ſuſpicion of the word of God being incarnate in him, or how
<q>the catholic faith differed from the error of Photinus.</q>
(the laſt of the proper unitarians whoſe name is come down to us) till he read the books of Plato; and that he was afterwards confirmed in the Catholic doctrine by reading the ſcriptures. Conſtantine in his oration to the fathers of the council of Nice, ſpeaks with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation

of Plato, as having taught the doctrine of
<q>a ſecond God, derived from the ſupreme God, and ſubſervient to his will.</q>
Maxim 11. H. p. 20,</p>
                     <p n="16">16. There is a pretty eaſy gradation in the progreſs of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the divinity of Chriſt; as he was firſt thought to be a God in ſome qualified ſenſe of the word, a diſtinguiſhed emanation from the ſupreme mind; and then the Logos or the wiſdom of God perſonified; and this <hi>logos</hi> was firſt thought to be only occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally detached from the Deity, and then drawn into his eſſence again, before it was imagined to have a <hi>permanent perſonality,</hi> diſtinct from that of the ſource from which it ſprung. And it was not till 400 years after that time that Chriſt, was thought to be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> that the apoſtles taught the doctrine of the divinity of Chriſt, yet it cannot be denied that in the very times of the apoſtles, the Jewiſh church, and many of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo, held the opinion of his being a mere man. Here the tranſition is quite ſudden, without any gradation at all. This muſt naturally have given the greateſt alarm, ſuch as is now given to thoſe who are called orthodox, by the preſent Socinians; and yet nothing of this kind can be perceived Beſides, it is certainly moſt probable that the chriſtians of thoſe times, urged as they were with the meanneſs of their maſter, ſhould incline to <hi>add to</hi> rather than <hi>take from,</hi> his natural rank and dignity.

                     <p>It will be perceived that the whole of this hiſtorical evidence is in favour, of the proper unitarian doctrine, or that of Chriſt being a mere man, having been the faith of the primitive church, in oppoſition to the Arian no leſs than the Trinitarian hypotheſis.</p>
                     <p>As to the Arian hypotheſis in particular, I do not know that it can be traced any higher than Arius himſelf, or at leaſt the age in which he lived. Both the Gnoſtics and the Platonizing chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, were equally far from ſuppoſing that Chriſt was a being <hi>created out of nothing;</hi> the former having thought him to be an emanation from the ſupreme being, and the latter the logos of the Father perſonified.
