            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Concerning which ſome farther arrangement is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the regiſtered debt, hitherto unſubſcribed, is owned by the citizens of foreign countries, moſt, if not all of whom appear now diſpoſed to embrace the terms held out by the act above mentioned; extenſive orders having been received from thoſe creditors, to ſubſcribe to the loan, after the time for receiving ſubſcriptions had elapſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:024926_0004_0FCD8E6D7AED2CB0"/>
A conſiderable part of the outſtanding or floating debt, conſiſts of loan-office certificates iſſued between the firſt of September, 1777, and the firſt of March, 1778, bearing intereſt on the nominal ſum. Many of the holders of this ſpecies of debt have come in upon the terms of the act, but others have hitherto declined it; alledging, that the ſpecial nature of their contract gives a peculiarity to their caſe, and renders the commutation propoſed not ſo fair an equivalent to them, as in other inſtances. They alſo complain, that the act has had, towards them, a compulſory aſpect, by refuſing the temporary payment of intereſt, unleſs they ſhould exchange their old for new certificates, eſſentially varying the nature of their contract.</p>
            <p>A reſolution of Congreſs of the tenth of September, 1777, ſtipulates in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of this claſs of creditors, intereſt upon the <hi>nominal,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>real principal</hi> of their debt, <hi>until that principal be diſcharged.</hi> This certainly renders their contract of a nature more beneficial than that of other creditors; but they are at the ſame time liable to be diveſted of the extra-benefit it gives them, by a payment of their ſpecie-dues; and it may be obſerved, that they have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enjoyed, and by accepting the terms offered to them, were enabled to realiſe, advantages ſuperior to other creditors. They have been paid intereſt by bills on France from the tenth of September, 1777, to the firſt of March, 1782, while other creditors received their intereſt in depreciated bills of the old emiſſions; and the terms of the loan propoſed put it in their power to realiſe the benefit of intereſt on the nominal amount of their reſpective debts, at rates from 6 10/100, nearly to 10 47/100 per cent. on their real or ſpecie capital down to the laſt of December, 1790.</p>
            <p>It does not therefore appear to have been an unreaſonable expectation, that they, as readily as any other deſcription of public creditors, would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced in a meaſure, calculated for the accommodation of the government, under circumſtances, in reſpect to which, it has been demonſtrated by <hi>ſubſequent events</hi> that the accommodation deſired was conſiſtent with the beſt intereſt of the public creditors. A large proportion of the parties intereſted have indeed view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the matter in this light, and have embraced the propoſition. It is probable, that the <hi>progreſs</hi> of things will ſatisfy the remainder, that it is equally their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to concur; if a farther opportunity be afforded. But it is, nevertheleſs, for themſelves only to judge, how far the equivalent propoſed is, in their caſe, a reaſonable and fair one; how far any circumſtances in their claim may ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt reaſons for moderation on their part; or how far any other motives, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or private, ought to induce an acceptance. And the principles of good faith require, that their election ſhould be free.</p>
            <p>On this ground, the complaint which regards the withholding of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary payment of intereſt, except on the condition of a ſurrender of the old cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates for new ones importing a contract ſubſtantially different, appears to the Secretary not deſtitute of foundation. He preſumes, that the operation of that proviſion, in the particular caſe was not adverted to; or, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception would have been introduced as moſt conſonant with the general ſpirit and deſign of the act. Accordingly the farther meaſures which will be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will contemplate a method of obviating the objection in queſtion.</p>
            <p>From the conſideration, that an extenſion of the time for receiving ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon the terms of the act making proviſion for the debt of the United States, is deſired by a large proportion of the non-ſubſcribing creditors; and from the farther conſideration, that ſufficient experience has not yet been had of the productiveneſs of a conſiderable branch of the revenues which have been eſtabliſhed, to afford the light neceſſary to a final arrangement—it is, in the judgment of the Secretary, adviſeable, to renew the propoſition for a loan in the domeſtic debt, on the ſame terms with the one which has been cloſed, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024926_0005_0FCD8E70729F2310"/>
to allow time for receiving ſubſcriptions to it until the laſt day of September next, incluſively; making proviſion for the temporary payment of intereſt to ſuch who may not think fit to ſubſcribe, for the year 1792, of the like nature with that which was made in the ſame caſe for the year 1791—except as to the holders of loan-office certificates, iſſued between the firſt of September, 1777, and the firſt of March, 1778; in reſpect to whom it is ſubmitted as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to diſpenſe with the obligation of exchanging their old certificates for new, as the condition of their receiving intereſt in capacity of non-ſubſcribers; and to allow them, without ſuch exchange, to receive the ſame intereſt, both for the years 1791 and 1792, as if they had ſubſcribed to the firſt loan. It will not be materially difficult, ſo to regulate the operation at the treaſury as to avoid in the particular caſe, that danger of impoſition by counterfeits, which was the motive to the general proviſion for an exchange of certificates.</p>
            <p>II. The amount of the ſubſcriptions in the debts of the reſpective ſtates, within the limits of the ſum aſſumed in each, appears by the ſtatement marked D. to be dollars 17,072,334 39/100 ſubject to the obſervations accompanying that ſtatement. Conſequently the difference between the aggregate of the ſums ſubſcribed, and the aggregate of the ſums aſſumed, is <hi>dols.</hi> 4,427,665 61/100</p>
            <p>This difference is to be attributed to ſeveral cauſes, the principal of which are the following. Firſt, That the ſums aſſumed in reſpect to certain ſtates exceeded the actual amount of their exiſting debts. Second, That in various inſtances, a part of the exiſting debt was in a form which excluded it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received, without contravening particular proviſions of the law; as in the caſe of certificates iſſued after the firſt day of January, 1790, in lieu of certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates which had been iſſued prior to that period, which was reported upon by the Secretary on the twenty-fifth day of February laſt. Third, Ignorance of, or inattention to the limitation of time for receiving ſubſcriptions. It appears, that a number of perſons loſt the opportunity of ſubſcribing from the one or the other of theſe cauſes.</p>
            <p>A ſtrong deſire that a farther opportunity may be afforded for ſubſcriptions in the debts of the ſtates, has been manifeſted by the individuals intereſted. And the ſtates of Rhode-Iſland and New-Hampſhire, have, by the public acts referred to the Secretary, indicated a ſimilar deſire. The affording of ſuch farther opportunity, may either be reſtricted within the limit, as to amount, which is contemplated by the act itſelf, or may receive an extenſion which will embrace the reſiduary debts of the ſtates.</p>
            <p>The firſt may be conſidered as nothing more than giving full effect to a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure already adopted.</p>
            <p>The laſt appears to have in its favour all the leading inducements to what has been already done. The embarraſſments which might ariſe from conflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſyſtems of finance are not entirely obviated. The efficacious command of the national reſources for national exigencies, is not unequivocally ſecured. The equalizing of the condition of the citizens of every ſtate, and exonerating thoſe of the ſtates moſt indebted, from partial burthens which would preſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in conſequence of exertions in a common cauſe, is not completely ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, until the entire debt of every ſtae, contracted in relation to the war, is embraced in one general and comprehenſive plan. The inconvenience to the United States of diſburthening the ſtates, which are ſtill encumbered with conſiderable debts, would bear no proportion to the inconvenience which they would feel, if left to ſtruggle with thoſe debts, unaided.</p>
            <p>More general contentment, therefore, in the public mind, may be expected to attend ſuch an exonoration, than the reverſe; in proportion as the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of actual inconvenience would be greater, though only applicable to parts, in the one than in the other caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:024926_0006_0FCD8E722D8E8190"/>
With regard to ſtates, parts only of the debts of which have been aſſumed, and in proportions ſhort of thoſe, which have prevailed, in favour of other ſtates, and ſhort alſo of what would have reſulted from a due apportionment of the entire ſum aſſumed; the claim to a further aſſumption is founded on conſiderations of equal juſtice, as relative to the meaſure itſelf, conſidered in a ſeparate and independent light.</p>
            <p>But there is a further reaſon of material weight for an immediate general aſſumption. Monied men, as well foreigners as citizens, through the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an eventual aſſumption, or that in ſome ſhape or other a ſubſtantial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion will be made for the unaſſumed reſidue of the ſtate debts, will be induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeculate in the purchaſe of them. In proportion as the event is unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, or uncertain, the price of the article will be low, and the preſent propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors will be under diſadvantage in the ſale. The loſs to them in favour of the purchaſers is to be regarded as an evil; and as far as it is connected with a transfer to foreigners, at an undervalue, it will be a national evil. By what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever authority an ultimate proviſion may be made, there will be an abſolute loſs to the community equal to the total amount of ſuch undervalue.</p>
            <p>It may appear an objection to the meaſure, that it will require an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of additional funds by the government of the United States. But this does not ſeem to be a neceſſary conſequence. The probability is, that without a ſupplementary aſſumption, an equal, or very nearly equal augmentation of funds will be requiſite to provide for <hi>greater</hi> balances in favour of certain ſtates, which would be proportionably diminiſhed by ſuch aſſumption. The deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not the quantum of the fund, will therefore be the chief diſtinction between the two caſes.</p>
            <p>It may alſo appear an objection to a total aſſumption, that the magnitude of the object is not aſcertained with preciſion. It is not certainly known, what ſum is due in each ſtate; nor has it been poſſible to acquire the information, owing to different cauſes. But though preciſe data are deficient, there are materials which will ſerve as guides. From the returns received at the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, aſſiſted by information in other ways, it may be ſtated without danger of material error—That the remaining debts of the ſtates over and above the ſums already ſubſcribed will not exceed the amounts ſpecified in the ſtatement D. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying this report—And that, including the ſums already ſubſcribed, the total amount to be <hi>ultimately</hi> provided for, in the event of a general aſſumption, will not exceed 25,403,362 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>/100 dollars, which would conſtitute an addition of 3,903,362, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1/100 dollars, to the ſum of 21,500,000 dollars already aſſumed.</p>
            <p>Should a total aſſumption be deemed eligible, it may ſtill be adviſeable to aſſign a determinate ſum for each ſtate, that the utmoſt limit of the operation may be pre-eſtabliſhed; and it is neceſſary in order to the certainty of a due proviſion in proper time, that intereſt ſhould not begin to be payable, on the additional ſums aſſumed, till after the year 1792.</p>
            <p>It will occur, that proviſion has been made, for paying to each ſtate, in truſt for its non-ſubſcribing creditors, an intereſt upon the difference between the ſum aſſumed for ſuch ſtate, and that actually ſubſcribed, equal to what would have been payable, if it had been ſubſcribed.</p>
            <p>In the event of a farther aſſumption, either within the limits already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, or commenſurate with the remaining debts of the ſtates; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that it will not be incompatible with the proviſion juſt mentioned, to retain, at the end of each quarter, during the progreſs of the farther ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of the money directed to be paid to each ſtate, a ſum correſponding with the intereſt upon ſo much of its debts as ſhall have been ſubſcribed to that period, paying the overplus, if any, to the ſtate. An abſolute ſuſpenſion of that payment does not appear conſiſtent with the nature of the ſtipulation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024926_0007_0FCD8E737AD61E58"/>
in that proviſion; for though the money to be paid to a ſtate be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly a truſt for the non-ſubſcribing creditors; yet as it cannot be certain beforehand, that they will elect to change their condition, the poſſibility of it will not juſtify a ſuſpenſion of payment to the ſtate, which might operate as a ſuſpenſion of payment to the creditors themſelves.</p>
            <p>A farther objection to ſuch a ſuſpenſion reſults from the idea, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in queſtion appears to have a ſecondary object; namely, as a pledge for ſecuring a proviſion for whatever balance may be found due to a ſtate on the general ſettlement of accounts. The payment directed to be made to a ſtate, is "to continue <hi>until</hi> there ſhall be a ſettlement of accounts between the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States and the individual ſtates; and incaſe a balance ſhould then appear in favour of a ſtate, <hi>until</hi> proviſion ſhall be made for the ſaid balance."</p>
            <p>This ſecondary operation as a pledge or ſecurity (conſiſtently with the intent of the funding act) can only be ſuperſeded in favour of the primary object, a <hi>proviſion for the creditors;</hi> and as far as may be neceſſary to admit them to an effectual participation of it. But as whatever money may be paid to a ſtate, is to be paid over to its creditors, proportional deductions may, with propriety, be made from the debts of thoſe creditors who may hereafter ſubſcribe; ſo as that the United States may not have to pay twice for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>If it ſhall be judged expedient, either to open again, or extend the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be neceſſary to vary the deſcription of the debts, which may be ſubſcribed, ſo as to comprehend all thoſe, which have relation to ſervices or ſupplies during the war, under ſuch reſtrictions as are requiſite to guard againſt abuſe.</p>
            <p>In the original propoſition for an aſſumption of the ſtate debts, and in the ſuggeſtions now made on the ſame ſubject, the Secretary has contemplated, and ſtill contemplates, as a material part of the plan, an effectual proviſion, for the ſale of the vacant lands of the United States. He has conſidered this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, as an important mean of ſinking a part of the debt, and facilitating ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate arrangements concerning the reſidue. If ſupplementary funds ſhall be rendered neceſſary, by an additional aſſumption, the proviſion will moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently be made, at the next ſeſſion of Congreſs, when the productiveneſs of the exiſting revenues, and the extent of the ſum to be provided for, will be better aſcertained.</p>
            <p>There is a part of the public debt of the United States, which is a cauſe of ſome perplexity to the treaſury. It is not comprehended within the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proviſion for the foreign debt which is confined to <hi>loans</hi> made abroad; and it is queſtionable, whether it is to be regarded as a portion of the domeſtic debt. It is not only due to <hi>foreigners,</hi> but the intereſt upon it is payable, by expreſs ſtipulation, in a foreign country, whence it becomes a matter of doubt, whether it be at all contemplated by the act making proviſion for the debt of the United States. The part alluded to is that, which is due to certain foreign officers, who ſerved the United States during the late war. In conſequence of a reſolution of Congreſs, directing their intereſt to be paid to them in France, the certificates which were iſſued to them ſpecify, that "in purſuance of and compliance with a certain reſolution of Congreſs of the third day of February 1784, the ſaid intereſt is to be paid, annually, at the houſe of Monſ. le Grand, banker in Paris." Intereſt has accordingly been paid to them at Paris, down to the 31ſt of December 1788, by virtue of a ſpecial reſolution of Congreſs of the 20th of Auguſt in that year; ſince which period, no payment has been made.</p>
            <p>It has been heretofore ſuggeſted as the opinion of the Secretary, that it would be expedient to cauſe the whole of this deſcription of debt to be paid off; among other reaſons, becauſe it bears an intereſt at ſix per centum per annum,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024926_0008_0FCD8E756F5589D8"/>
payable abroad, and can be diſcharged with a ſaving. The other reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to are of a nature both weighty and delicate, and too obvious, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, to need a ſpecification. Some recent circumſtances have ſerved to ſtrengthen the inducements to the meaſure. But if it ſhould, finally, be deemed unadviſeable, it is neceſſary at leaſt, that proviſion ſhould be made for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which is now ſuſpended, under the doubt that has been ſtated, and from the want of authority to <hi>remit</hi> it purſuant to the contract.</p>
            <p>The amount of this debt, with the arrears of intereſt to the end of the year 1791, is <hi>Dollars</hi> 220,646. 81</p>
            <p>IV. The act making proviſion for the debt of the United States has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated the proceeds of the weſtern lands as a fund for the diſcharge of the public debt. And the act making proviſion for the reduction of the public debt, has appropriated all the ſurplus of the duties on imports and tonnage, to the end of the year 1790, to the purpoſe of purchaſing the debt at the market price, and has authoriſed the Preſident to borrow the further ſum of two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars for the ſame object.</p>
            <p>Theſe meaſures ſerve to indicate the intention of the legiſlature, as early and as faſt as poſſible, to provide for the extinguiſhment of the exiſting debt.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of that intention, it appears adviſeable, that a ſyſtematic plan ſhould be begun for the creation and eſtabliſhment of a ſinking fund.</p>
            <p>An obvious baſis of this eſtabliſhment, which may be immediately contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated, is the amount of the intereſt on ſo much of the debt as has been or ſhall be, from time to time, purchaſed, or paid off, or received in diſcharge of any debt or demand of the United States, made payable in public ſecurities—over and above the intereſt of any new debt, which may be created, in order to ſuch purchaſe or payment.</p>
            <p>The purchaſes of the debt already made have left a ſum of intereſt in the Treaſury, which will be encreaſed by future purchaſes—certain ſums payable to the United States in their own ſecurities, will, when received, have a ſimilar effect. And there is ground to calculate on a ſaving upon the operations, which are in execution with regard to the foreign debt. The ſale of the Weſtern Lands, when proviſion ſhall be made for it, may be expected to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a material addition to ſuch a fund.</p>
            <p>It is therefore ſubmitted, that it be adopted as a principle, that all intereſt which ſhall have ceaſed to be payable, by any of the means above ſpecified, ſhall be ſet apart and appropriated in the moſt firm and inviolable manner, as a fund for ſinking the public debt, by purchaſe or payment; and that the ſaid fund be placed under the direction of the officers named in the ſecond ſection of the act making proviſion for the reduction of the public debt, to be by them applied towards the purchaſe of the ſaid debt, until the annual produce of the ſaid fund ſhall amount to two per cent. of the entire portion of the debt which bears a preſent intereſt of ſix per centum, and thenceforth to be applied, towards the redemption of that portion of the debt, according to the right which has been reſerved to the government.</p>
            <p>It will deſerve the conſideration of the Legiſlature, whether this fund ought not to be ſo veſted, as to acquire the nature and quality of a <hi>proprietary</hi> truſt, incapable of being diverted, without a violation of the principles and ſanctions of <hi>property.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A rapid accumulation of this fund would ariſe from its own operation; but it is not doubted, that the progreſſive developement of the reſources of the country, and a reduction of the rate of intereſt, by the progreſs of public credit, already exemplified in a conſiderable degree, will ſpeedily enable the government to make important additions to it, in various ways. With due
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024926_0009_0FCD8E771806DD18"/>
attention to preſerve order and cultivate peace, a ſtrong expectation may be indulged, that a reduction of the debt of the country will keep pace with the reaſonable hopes of its citizens.</p>

            <p>The amount of Stock funded at the Treaſury to 30th September, 1791, has been aſcertained with accuracy, but at that time many ſubſcriptions had been made which have not yet been adjuſted for want of proper powers of attorney and other documents.—It is therefore probable that on ſettlement of all the loans the amount will be found ſomewhat different from what is now repreſented.</p>
            <p>The ſums funded at the ſeveral loan-offices, it is preſumed, are aſcertained with accuracy; but as the loans had not been adjuſted in all inſtances when the returns were made, ſome immaterial differences will probably hereafter appear.</p>

            <p>NOTE.—The balance above ſtated to be outſtanding probably exceeds the real ſum. In the original eſtimate the old emiſſion bills were computed at 40 for 1, but they have been provided for at 100 for 1. There are alſo loan-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice certificates which were ſent to public officers to be applied to the public ſervice, and which were ſuppoſed to have been ſo applied, but which have ſince, upon ſettlements of their accounts at the Treaſury, been returned and cancelled.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, payments in public ſecurities are expected to be made into the Treaſury, which will thereupon be cancelled. And it is preſumable that in the courſe of the war, ſums have been loſt and deſtroyed which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the eſtimate. But as there is ſome arrearage of intereſt not included in the calculation, and as there are certain claims on the Treaſury, the event or amount of which is not yet determined, it is not poſſible <hi>now</hi> to make a preciſe eſtimate of the difference between the ſum computed to be outſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and what will be really found ſo.</p>

               <p>I. The ſums marked <hi>(a)</hi> in the column of remaining debts are inſerted upon recent official communications.</p>
               <p>II. Thoſe marked <hi>(b)</hi> are founded upon official ſtatements ſome time ſince received, and reported to the Houſe of Repreſentatives on the 9th of January, 1790, adding intereſt for the ſubſequent period.</p>
               <p>III. Thoſe marked <hi>(c)</hi> are founded on informal information, but ſuch as is deemed ſubſtantially authentic and accurate. The eſtimate for Rhode-Iſland includes a ſum not aſcertained, which has been cancelled in conſequence of former laws of the ſtate, enjoining the creditors to bring in their certificates and receive payment in paper-money, but has been revived by a late law of the State, directing the ſums paid to be liquidated according to a certain ſcale, and deducted from the original amount.</p>
               <p>IV. That marked <hi>(d)</hi> is founded on a report of a committee of the 11th November, 1791, to the Houſe of Delegates of Virginia, compared with a former return to the Treaſury and other information.</p>
               <p>V. That marked <hi>(e)</hi> is founded upon a ſtatement of the Comptroller of North-Carolina, of May 20th, 1790.</p>
               <p>VI. That marked <hi>(f)</hi> is founded on a ſtatement of the Treaſurer of Georgia of the 30th of April, 1790, compared with other information.</p>
               <p>VII. The ſums expreſſed in round numbers are not meant to be underſtood as preciſely accurate, but as very near the truth.</p>
               <p>VIII. The foreign as well as the domeſtic debt of the States is included.</p>
