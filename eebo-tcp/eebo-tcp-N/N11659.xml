            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have, my dear Countrymen, entered into the moſt ſolemn, weighty, and extraordinary affair, that ever concerned <hi>America</hi>; an affair that will termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in our final ruin, unleſs GOD be for us.— We have though I truſt with the greateſt reluctance, taken up arms againſt the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> who is the moſt powerful prince in the known world, who has been a terror to all nations, who is the ſtrongeſt by ſea, and can command the greateſt navy of any nation whatever; a great part of which is now employed in bringing ſoldiers, arms, ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>rther—have burned <hi>Falmouth,</hi> a place of vaſt value—men, women, and children, in the greateſt confuſion and conſternation, occaſioned by the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their cannon, the devouring flames of their buildings—obliged to leave their dwellings in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins—have immediate orders to burn all the ſea-ports from thence to <hi>Carolina</hi>—will certainly execute their cruel deſign, which in the iſſue will damage <hi>America</hi> not leſs than 50 millions of money. Now all this will certainly be effected, unleſs GOD be for us.—To have this great and mighty nation againſt us, and the great and dreadful GOD againſt us too, muſt be dreadful indeed! For if GOD be againſt us, all the victories we have already gained, will only ſerve to augment their fury, and bring all the power and force of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> on us, and perhaps joined with the ſtrength of other nations.— If GOD be againſt us, all the wiſe conſultations of aſſemblies and congreſſes will prove abortive, our armies will be defeated, our country will be ravaged, we ſhall be deſtroyed by the ſword, by the famine, and by the peſtilence; the ſword without, and terror within, will conſume us—a fire will be enkindled in his anger, that will burn to the loweſt hell— He will ſcatter us into corners—he will cauſe the remembrance of us to ceaſe, and deliver us up to the greateſt reproach—thoſe that hate us will rule over us, and we ſhall be treated as the worſt of rebels.—This will certainly be the fate of <hi>America,</hi> unleſs GOD be for us, and on our ſide.—Now, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things? If GOD be for us,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014737_0004_0F94DB52FB4F9030"/>
who can be againſt us?</hi> And if he be againſt us who can be for us, that is able to deliver us?</p>
            <p>Shewing the way, and the only way for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>America</hi> from the moſt diſtreſſing calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that ever befel any people.</p>
            <p>THUS we ſee, my dear friends and countrymen, that it is all-important that GOD be for us. Which brings us to conſider, in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Place, <hi>What muſt abſolutely be done on our part, that the bleſſed GOD may be for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND here, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Was is Liberty that firſt cauſed the ſettlement of this country?—Was this land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by God himſelf for a land of liberty?—Was this the tenor and condition of the grant of this country from God to our forefathers, that no tyrant ſhould ever reign here?—Is this the only thing the Americans are ſuing for?—Was it their aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their rights to this precious jewel, that has drawn the ſword againſt us?—Is it liberty that has ſet the nation in ſuch a terrible convulſion?—Then it will certainly appear, that all thoſe laws, cuſtoms, and practices, that infringe on the liberties of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and are repugnant to the law of God, muſt be done away. Every thing that has any tendency to bind the conſciences of God's Children, of what name or denomination ſoever, muſt be done away. As we would have the Lord on our ſide, we muſt ſet at Liberty thoſe vaſt numbers of <hi>Africans,</hi> which have ſo long time been inſlaved by us, who have as good a right to Liberty as we have—We muſt no longer exerciſe that Cruelty and Barbarity towards
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014737_0005_0F94DB53BA5BC608"/>
them, as we have heretofore done—We muſt put a final ſtop to all vexatious Law ſuits, and no longer exerciſe that Cruelty among ourſelves that even heathens would not be found guilty of—We muſt for ever ceaſe from this ſo ruinous a Practice—We muſt be kind and benevolent to the Poor—help and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them out of all their troubles and diſtreſſes— break every yoke, and every heavy burden, &amp; let the oppreſſed go free. See Iſa. 58, 7, and on—We muſt be ſincere in our endeavors for Liberty, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wicked or avaricious ends or deſigns for riches or honours to aggrandize ourſelves or children— We muſt faithfully improve all our ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and prize them above every thing elſe—We muſt have as much zeal to improve them as we have to contend for them, and then the Lord will never ſuffer them to be taken from us.—We muſt heartily aſcribe the glory of all the victories obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, to GOD alone; and go, if called to it, againſt our enemies, as King <hi>David</hi> went againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> in the name and ſtrength of the LORD GOD of Iſrael—We muſt continue that union and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that ſubſiſts between the colonies, and unite, as one man, in putting away all thoſe ſins and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations which is the cauſe of God's controverſy with us,—and continue to humble our ſelves in the united public manner as was once appointed by the Grand Continental Congreſs; which was the moſt extraordinary affair that ever happened in America: ſince which time we have been wonderfully defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and we have the greateſt incouragement to take this method for deliverance, whenever thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014737_0006_0F94DB5479BDDC40"/>
by thoſe wiſe Men who are ſet at the helm of affairs, and are appointed guardians for the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Colonies—We muſt break off all our ſins by righteouſneſs, and our iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the Poor;—then God will be for us, and all the powers of Earth and Hell will never deprive us of thoſe privileges. Now, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things? If GOD be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> If GOD be for us, he can eaſily defeat the cruel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of our enemies many ways: He can raiſe a tempeſt in the ſea, that ſhall toſs their ſhipping to the heavens, and bury them in the depths, and hurl them back from whence they came, or to ſome other remote part of the earth, or daſh them one againſt another, or againſt ſome unſeen reef in the ſea, and ſink them to the bottom. He can defeat them by ſending ſickneſs among them, and deſtroy them by the peſtilence, or by ſending faintneſs into their hearts, or granting us the victory if engaged in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. He that ſits at the helm of all the affairs of the univerſe, and rules in the court of heaven above, can ſo over-rule things in the court of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as to cauſe all thoſe cruel acts to be nullified, their ſhipping and armies recalled, our ſeaports all open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Boſton</hi> and other places all reſtored to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per owners, the great breach healed, that ancient union reſtored, and the Americans put into the poſſeſſion of all their rights on a laſting foundation.</p>
            <p>THUS we ſee, my dear friends and countrymen, how many ways the bleſſed GOD may interpoſe in our behalf—the laſt of which is to be the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by every American; for it ſeems a pity the

               <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation ſhould be broke like a potter's veſſel; the nation whom God has exalted to heaven—in which has been more of the glory of God to be ſeen, than in all the nations in the world beſides—the nation whom God has exalted to ſuch glory, honor and dignity.—O Britons! why wilt thou ruin thy ſelf, rip out thine own bowels, run the ſword into thine own heart, undo thy ſelf and thy moſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children, the moſt loyal ſubjects in all thy vaſt dominions! Why ſhouldeſt thou, who haſt been the glory of all nations, become the reproach to all nations! Why wilt thou do that which will provoke God to caſt off the nation forever, and withhold his glory forever! Thou who haſt been the admiration of all foreigners for thy moſt excellent conſtitution, and haſt excelled all nations for thy kindneſs and hoſpitality, even to ſtrangers! Witneſs the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of French and others in the City of London, from all parts of the world—diſtreſſed ſtrangers and foreigners have been receiv'd with the greateſt kindneſs and indulgence.—Great numbers of French and others have been naturalized and permitted to ſet up trade in the city of London, and have grown very rich thereby, by the unexampled beauty of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; for hither they came deſtitute of every thing, and by public and private charity were put into a way to provide for themſelves and families. From the Revolution to this time, fifteen or twenty thouſand pounds has been paid to them annually by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, towards ſupporting their poor. Now who could have thought the nation that has been ſo full of kindneſs and benevolence to ſtrangers, could become
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014737_0008_0F94DB55FA657680"/>
ſo cruel to their own Children? Who could have thought a few years paſt, that ſaw the Engliſh nation in her meridian glory—that ſaw the univerſities in England, Oxford and Cambridge, which conſiſted of near 40 Colleges, out of which proceeded ſwarms of the beſt men who have appeared moſt eminent both in Church and ſtate—that ſaw the preſent King aſcending the throne to ſway the Britiſh ſcepter —that ſaw the Proclamations iſſued forth from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his royal hand and ſeal, diſcountenancing vice and immorality, and encouraging virtue and true religion. Who was there, 20 years paſt, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the harmony that ſubſiſted between Britain and her Colonies—that ſaw the wide Atlantick full of veſſels laden with effects from America, bound to our native country—who could have thought, I ſay, that all the powers of Earth and Hell could have produced ſo ſudden an alteration, as to ſee the ſame ocean full of ſhipping from our mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, bound to America, laden with ſoldiers, arms and ammunition, and all manner of inſtruments of death and cruelty, to deſtroy her own Children! Who could have thought a little deteſtable Tea, thrown into the ocean by a factious mob, ſhould be the cauſe of an ocean of bloodſhed, and forever diſſolve that union that was worth more Tea than the Eaſt-Indies produced? How much below the dignity of the nation are thoſe ſevere proceedings? Conſider, whilſt thou art pouring out thy hot thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bolts on the Americans, what thou art doing, leſt the Almighty God pour out his wrath on thee for every drop of Blood ſhed in this unnatural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014737_0009_0F94DB56B9D48508"/>
binds the curſe of GOD on the nation, and will provoke GOD to leave it, and forever withdraw his glory from it never more to return, as he has from other nations and kingdoms. Methinks the words of the Prophet are applicable here, <hi>O thou ſword of the Lord, how long will it be, ere thou wilt be quiet? Put up thyſelf into thy ſcabbard, reſt and be ſtill</hi>—or turn thyſelf againſt ſome avowed enemy, not thy beſt friends: And thoſe of our Saviour, when he wept over the city of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaying, <hi>O Jeruſalem! hadſt thou but known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes!</hi> And, <hi>O Jeruſalem! Jeruſalem! how often would I have gathered thee, as a hen gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</hi> And as in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9. 8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim! How ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael! How ſhall I make thee as Admah! How ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim! My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together!—How ſhall I leave the nation whom I have taken into ſuch a near relation to myſelf, and made comely thro' my comelineſs; which I have put upon high!

was when there were thouſands of glorious churches there—Into <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſee from how many places GOD has removed his glory.—There was once in <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf a glorious church.—Look into <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> low countries, which had once the glorious goſpel in them; but how has the bloody inquiſition extinguiſhed the light of the glorious goſpel in that unhappy kingdom!—Into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and ſee now where is their glory?—Into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the great kingdom of <hi>France</hi>; how has their wickedneſs provoked God to leave that unhappy kingdom!—Time was when there were hundreds of proteſtant miniſters and churches there; but how has a <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> king made them an empty veſſel, ſwallowed them up like a dragon, and caſt them out! And now, muſt <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſhare the ſame fate? Muſt <hi>Great-Britain</hi> come to nothing, to deſtruction and diſſolution? for this is the certain fate of every kingdom divided againſt itſelf.—<hi>O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, then would I weep day and night for the ruin of the</hi> Engliſh nation.—Is there no way to prevent this ruin?— Is there no balm in <hi>Gilead</hi>? no phyſician there, for the healing this deadly wound?—Why wilt thou not hold out terms for reconciliation, and let the breach be healed?</p>

juſt, and righteous GOD?—Canſt thou caſt thine eye upon thy ſeaports, from <hi>Falmouth</hi> to <hi>Carolina,</hi> and ſee the ocean full of engines of death, deſtined for the deſtruction of <hi>America</hi>—look into <hi>Boſton,</hi> that fine metropolis—view it taken out of the hands of the proper owners—look into thoſe fine and beautiful houſes, once devoted to the worſhip and ſervice of GOD, once filled with his glorious preſence, now turned play-houſes and riding-houſes, places, to furniſh their horſe for our deſtruction!—Who was there that ſaw the burning <hi>Charleſtown</hi>—that ſaw the flames aſcending from the lofty ſteeples of thoſe beautiful buildings, once devoted to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the great GOD;—I ſay, to ſee the flames aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to the heavens—to hear the cracking and falling of the buildings—that heard the roaring of the cannon—the cries and groans of the wounded, they wallowing in their blood—the dead lying in heaps—look into <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and ſee thoſe colleges, which were once ſeminaries of learning, places to fit and train up perſons for the moſt ſacred work of the goſpel miniſtry, and to be phyſicians for wounded immortal ſouls—I ſay, ſhall we ſee thoſe colleges, that were once conſecrated to this ſacred and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant buſineſs, now turned into hoſpitals, full of wounded bodies, and not ſuſpect ſomething has been amiſs in thoſe colleges?—See the ruin that has come on thoſe churches, and not ſuppoſe there are things introduced contrary to the word of GOD, and very provoking to him?—Methinks we can have no greater precedent of the wrath of Almighty GOD, than theſe things are.

evidence that our ſins have reached to heaven, and cry for vengeance upon us; and that he will not be for us, but againſt us, unleſs we turn to him by unfeigned repentance: For ſo long as we hold faſt our ſins, and retain our iniquities, and do not turn to GOD, do not regard the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, notwithſtanding he has been ſpeaking to us by terrible things in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs—been threatning us with drought and ſore ſickneſs—taking away many by death;—and now, add to all this the withdrawing of GOD's holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit—ſuſpence of divine influence—hardneſs of heart —blindneſs of mind;—Now, all theſe together, makes it very evident there never was a people nigher the brink of final ruin than we are; and as long as we continue in this careleſs, ſtupid, and indifferent ſtate, we declare by our practice, we have not done amiſs, our ways are equal, we have not done any thing to merit thoſe evils from the hand of the Lord. We anſwer by our practice, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> anſwered <hi>Moſes, Who is the Lord, that we ſhould obey him?</hi>— By this means we reflect infinite diſhonor on the wiſe Governor of the univerſe, for puniſhing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent people. And here ariſes the controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the great GOD and us—juſt as when a kind father corrects a rebellious child, his aim is to bring him to obedience, and to his duty; now if the child is regardleſs of his father's corrections, and will not turn for the ſtripes his father gives him, there is an abſolute neceſſity for a more ſevere correction;— and if he will not finally turn, he caſts him off as a rebel, and lets him go on, and fill up the meaſure
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014737_0013_0F94DB59BB11C3E0"/>
of his cup: But if the child turns to his father, and to his obedience, the father's heart is full of pity, his bowels yearn with compaſſion, his arms are open to receive him, and treat him with the moſt parental affection.—Juſt ſo the bleſſed GOD has for many years been dealing with <hi>America</hi>—he has been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting his ſore diſpleaſure againſt us—he has been moſt ſeverely correcting us—his ſtripes have been moſt ſeverely laid upon us.—Now, if we ſtill go on, and will not remove the cauſe of his controverſy, there is a neceſſity of his ſtripes being laid on more ſevere; for GOD never began a controverſy with any people, that ever ended in any thing ſhort of their reformation or final ruin. And this is the caſe with us. If we turn to GOD, put away thoſe laws, cuſtoms and practices, thoſe ſins and abominations that are the cauſe of his controverſy, and turn to him by unfeigned repentance, take his word for our rule, ſhake the duſt from off our bibles, and let this be the compaſs to ſteer our courſe by, and walk ſo that our ways pleaſe the LORD; our calamities will ſoon ceaſe, our enemies will be at peace with us, the great and eternal GOD will be for us and on our ſide. 'Tis in this way, and no other, that we can have the LORD for us. Thus it was when God puniſhed <hi>Iſrael</hi> with three years famine, king <hi>David</hi> was very ſolicitous to know the cauſe of GOD's anger; and no ſooner had he found out, and done as the LORD required in this matter, the heavens could no longer withhold the rain, the earth was repleniſhed, and bro't forth her fruit. So it was with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> after his defeat at <hi>Ai.</hi> The next ſtep he takes, is to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014737_0014_0F94DB5A7997B6A0"/>
ſearch after the cauſe of GOD's anger; and as ſoon as he had put the accuſed thing out of the camp, GOD was for him, and with him, and his enemies could not ſtand before him. In like manner, when the mariners had taken <hi>Jonah</hi> into their ſhip, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a terrible ſtorm in the ſea, which mounted her to the heavens, and buried her in the depths, and filled them with dreadful diſtreſs; they were very ſolicitous to know the cauſe of GOD's anger, and as ſoon as they had thrown <hi>Jonah</hi> overboard, the ſea was a perfect calm.—So it would be with <hi>America</hi>— Could we find out the cauſe, and throw the <hi>Jonah</hi> overboard, the nation would be in a perfect calm, and GOD will certainly be for us, and on our ſide.</p>

            <p>AND now, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things?—If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi>—He will be a wall of fire round about us, and the glory in the midſt of us:—He will defend us from all the inſults of men or devils.—All thoſe wiſe and good men, who are at the helm of affairs, and are appointed guardians for the colonies, if they are inſtrumental of a thorough and univerſal reformation, will ſhine as lights in the world; their memories will be dear and precious to the lateſt poſterity; and they will not only ſhine in this world, but in the world to come, in the kingdom of glory, as ſtars of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude—Thoſe churches in this land will be favored with the divine preſence and glory of GOD—We ſhall be bleſſed in our baſket and ſtore, in our goings

out and comings in—We ſhall no longer hear the ſound of the trumpet, or alarm of war, nor ſee garments rolled in blood—thoſe inſtruments of cruelty ſhall be turned into the harmleſs utenſils of huſbandry—We ſhall be bleſſed with both peace and plenty—a foundation will be laid to enjoy them to the lateſt poſterity—our root ſhall be ſpread by the waters, and the dew ſhall lie on our branches— We ſhall enjoy all thoſe privileges that CHRIST has purchaſed for us, and which we have in conſequence of that eternal covenant that was made between God the Father and God the Son; which covenant was ratified in the counſel of his eternal peace and was fulfilled when he ſhed his precious blood on the croſs; through which channel flows every mercy and every favor that ever any of the human race ever did or ever will enjoy; for all was loſt by the fall and apoſtacy of our firſt head and repreſentative, and all was purchaſed by our ſecond; and in this ſenſe, and this only, he is ſaid to be the Saviour of all men.—Now, if GOD be for us, all thoſe mercies will as naturally flow to us, as the rivers flow into the ſea.—Now, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things?— If GOD be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi>—Surely, if GOD be for us, we need not apply to <hi>France, Spain,</hi> or <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> for protection; for the bleſſed GOD will protect us.</p>
            <p>THUS we have conſidered the importance of having GOD for us—We conſidered what muſt abſolutely be done, that GOD may be for us— And likewiſe, how bleſſed it will be to have GOD for us.</p>
