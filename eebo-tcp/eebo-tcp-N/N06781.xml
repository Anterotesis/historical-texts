            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE INTEREST OF GREAT BRITAIN, CONSIDERED With Regard to Her COLONIES.</head>
            <p>I Have peruſed with no ſmall pleaſure the <hi>Letter addreſſed to Two Great Men,</hi> and the <hi>Remarks</hi> on that letter. It is not merely from the beauty, the force and perſpicuity of expreſſion, or the general elegance of manner conſpicuous in both pamphlets, that my pleaſure chiefly ariſes; it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from this, that I have lived to ſee ſubjects of the greateſt importance to this nation publickly diſcuſſed without party views, or party heat, with decency and politeneſs, and with no other warmth than what a zeal for the honour and happineſs of our king and country may inſpire;—and this by writers whoſe underſtanding (however they may differ from each other) appears not unequal to their candour and the uprightneſs of their intention.</p>
            <p>But, as great abilities have not always the beſt information, there are, I apprehend, in the <hi>Remarks</hi> ſome opinions not well founded, and ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of ſo important a nature, as to render a few obſervations on them neceſſary for the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the publick.</p>
            <p>The author of the <hi>Letter,</hi> who muſt be every way beſt able to ſupport his own ſentiments, will, I hope, excuſe me, if I ſeem officiouſly to interfere; when he conſiders, that the ſpirit of patriotiſm, like
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008601_0003_102F965C038C3FB8"/>
other qualities good and bad, is catching; and that his long ſilence ſince the <hi>Remarks</hi> appeared has made us deſpair of ſeeing the ſubject farther diſcuſſed by his maſterly hand. The ingenious and candid remarker, too, who muſt have been miſled himſelf before he employed his ſkill and addreſs to miſlead others, will certainly, ſince he declares he <hi>aims at no ſeduction,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 6</note> be diſpoſed to excuſe even the weakeſt effort to prevent it.</p>
            <p>And ſurely if the general opinions that poſſeſs the minds of the people may poſſibly be of conſequence in publick affairs, it muſt be fit to ſet thoſe opinions right. If there is danger, as the remarker ſuppoſes, that "extravagant expectations" may embarraſs "a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and able miniſtry," and "render the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation for peace a work of infinite difficulty;" <note n="†" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 7.</note> there is no leſs danger that expectations too low, thro' want of proper information, may have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, may make even a virtuous and able miniſtry leſs anxious, and leſs attentive to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining points, in which the honour and intereſt of the nation are eſſentially concerned; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple leſs hearty in ſupporting ſuch a miniſtry and its meaſures.</p>
            <p>The people of this nation are indeed reſpectable, not for their numbers only, but for their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and their publick ſpirit: they manifeſt the firſt, by their univerſal approbation of the late prudent and vigorous meaſures, and the confidence they ſo juſtly repoſe in a wiſe and good prince, and an honeſt and able adminiſtration; the latter they have demonſtrated by the immenſe ſupplies granted in parliament unanimouſly, and paid through the whole kingdom with chearfulneſs. And ſince to this ſpirit and theſe ſupplies our "victories and ſucceſſes" <note n="‡" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 7.</note> have in great meaſure
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008601_0004_102F965F33C75348"/>
been owing, is it quite right, is it generous to ſay, with the <hi>remarker,</hi> that the people "had no ſhare in acquiring them?" The mere mob he cannot mean, even where he ſpeaks of the <hi>madneſs of the people;</hi> for the madneſs of the mob muſt be too feeble and impotent, arm'd as the government of this country at preſent is, to "over-rule," <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 7.</note> even in the ſlighteſt inſtances, the "virtue and moderation" of a firm and ſteady miniſtry.</p>
            <p>While the war continues, its final event is quite uncertain. The Victorious of this year may be the Vanquiſhed of the next. It may therefore be too early to ſay, what advantages we ought abſolutely to inſiſt on, and make the <hi>ſine quibus non</hi> of a peace, If the neceſſity of our affairs ſhould oblige us to accept of terms leſs advantageous than our preſent ſucceſſes ſeem to promiſe us, an intelligent people, as ours is, muſt ſee that neceſſity, and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce. But as a peace, when it is made, may be made haſtily; and as the unhappy continuance of the war affords us time to conſider, among ſeveral advantages gain'd or to be gain'd, which of them may be moſt for our intereſt to retain, if ſome and not all may poſſibly be retained; I do not blame the public diſquiſition of theſe points, as premature or uſeleſs. Light often ariſes from a colliſion of opinions, as fire from flint and ſteel; and if we can obtain the benefit of the <hi>light,</hi> without danger from the <hi>heat</hi> ſometimes produc'd by controverſy, why ſhould we diſcourage it?</p>
            <p>Suppoſing then, that heaven may ſtill continue to bleſs His Majeſty's arms, and that the event of this juſt war may put it in our power to retain ſome of our conqueſts at the making of a peace; let us conſider whether we are to confine ourſelves to thoſe poſſeſſions only that were "the <hi>objects</hi> for
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008601_0005_102F966399A59CE0"/>
which we began the war."<note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 19.</note> This the <hi>remarker</hi> ſeems to think right, when the queſtion relates to
<q>
                  <hi>Canada,</hi> properly ſo called, it having never been mentioned as one of thoſe objects in any of our memorials or declarations, or in any national or publick act whatſoever.</q>
But the gentleman him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will probably agree, that if the ceſſion of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> would be a real advantage to us, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it under his ſecond head, as an "<hi>indemnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> for the charges incurred" in recovering our juſt rights; otherwiſe according to his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the demand of <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> can have no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p>That
<q>our claims before the war were large enough for poſſeſſion and for ſecurity too,</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> tho' it ſeems a clear point with the ingenious remarker, is, I own, not ſo with me. I am rather of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, and ſhall preſently give my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But firſt let me obſerve, that we did not make thoſe claims becauſe they were large enough for ſecurity, but becauſe we could rightfully claim no more. Advantages gained in the courſe of this war, may increaſe the extent of our rights. Our claims before the war contain'd ſome ſecurity; but that is no reaſon why we ſhould neglect acquiring more when the demand of more is become rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. It may be reaſonable in the caſe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> to aſk for the ſecurity recommended by the author of the letter, <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 30 of the <hi>Letter,</hi> and p. 21 of the <hi>Remarks.</hi>
               </note> tho' it would be prepoſterous to do it in many other caſes: his propos'd demand is founded on the little value of <hi>Canada</hi> to the <hi>French;</hi> the right we have to aſk, and the power we may have to inſiſt on an indemnification for our expences; the difficulty the <hi>French</hi> themſelves
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008601_0006_102F9666C631B950"/>
will be under of reſtraining their reſtleſs ſubjects in <hi>America</hi> from encroaching on our limits and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing our trade; and the difficulty on our parts of preventing encroachments that may poſſibly exiſt many years without coming to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But the remarker
<q>does not ſee why the arguments employ'd concerning a ſecurity for a peaceable behaviour in <hi>Canada,</hi> would not be equally cogent for calling for the ſame ſecurity in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 24.</note> On a little farther reflection, he muſt I think be ſenſible, that the circumſtances of the two caſes are widely different. Here we are ſeparated by the beſt and cleareſt of boundaries, the ocean, and we have people in or near every part of our territory. Any attempt to encroach upon us, by building a fort, even in the obſcureſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of theſe iſlands, muſt therefore be known and prevented immediately. The aggreſſors alſo muſt be known, and the nation they belong to would be accountable for their aggreſſion. In <hi>America</hi> it is quite otherwiſe. A vaſt wilderneſs thinly or ſcarce at all peopled, conceals with eaſe the march of troops and workmen. Important paſſes may be ſeized within our limits and forts built in a month, at a ſmall expence, that may coſt us an age and a million to remove. Dear experience has taught us this. But what is ſtill worſe, the wide extended foreſts between our ſettlements and theirs, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by barbarous tribes of ſavages that delight in war and take pride in murder, ſubjects properly neither of the <hi>French</hi> nor <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but ſtrongly attach'd to the former by the art and indefatigable induſtry of prieſts, ſimiliarity of ſuperſtitions, and frequent family alliances. Theſe are eaſily, and have been continually, inſtigated to fall upon and maſſacre our planters, even in times of full peace
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008601_0007_102F966A157685A8"/>
between the two crowns, to the certain diminution of our people and the contraction of our ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>A very intelligent writer of that country, Dr. <hi>Clark,</hi> in his <hi>Obſervations on the late and preſent conduct of the French,</hi> &amp;c. printed at <hi>Boſton</hi> 1755, ſays,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Indians in the <hi>French</hi> intereſt are, upon all proper op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, inſtigated by their prieſts, who have generally the chief management of their publick councils, to acts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> even in time of profound peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two crowns. Of this there are many undeniable inſtances. The war between the Indians and the colonies of the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> in 1723, by which thoſe colonies ſuffered ſo much damage, was begun by the inſtigation of the <hi>French;</hi> their ſupplies were from them, and there are now original letters of ſeveral Jeſuits to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, whereby it evidently appears, that they were contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually animating the Indians, when almoſt tired with the war, to a farther proſecution of it. The <hi>French</hi> not only excited the Indians, and ſupported them, but joined their own forces with them in all the late hoſtilities that have been committed within His Majeſty's province of <hi>Nova-Scotia.</hi> And from an intercepted letter this year from the Jeſuit at <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> and from other information, it is certain that they have been uſing their utmoſt endeavours to excite the Indians to new acts of hoſtility, againſt His Majeſty's colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay,</hi> and ſome have been committed.—The <hi>French</hi> not only excite the Indians to acts of hoſtility, but reward them for it, by buying the <hi>Engliſh</hi> priſoners of them; for the ranſom of each of which they afterwards demand of us the price that is uſually given for a ſlave in theſe colonies. They do this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecious pretence of reſcuing the poor priſoners from the cruelties and barbarities of the ſavages; but in reality to encourage them to continue their depredations, as they can by this means get more by hunting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than by hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wild beaſts; and the <hi>French</hi> at the ſame time are thereby enabled to keep up a large body of Indians entirely at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
               </note> And tho' it is known they are ſupply'd by the <hi>French</hi> and carry their priſoners to them, we can by complaining obtain no redreſs, as the governors of <hi>Canada</hi> have a ready excuſe, that the Indians are an independent people, over whom they have no power, and for whole actions they are
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008601_0008_102F966BA7C76538"/>
therefore not accountable. Surely circumſtances ſo widely different may reaſonably authoriſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent demands of ſecurity in <hi>America,</hi> from ſuch as are uſual or neceſſary in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>remarker,</hi> however, thinks, that our real dependance for keeping
<q>
                  <hi>France</hi> or any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion true to her engagements, muſt not be in demanding ſecurities which no nation whilſt <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> can give, but on our own ſtrength and our own viligance.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 25.</note> No nation that has carried on a war with diſadvantage, and is unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it, can be ſaid, under ſuch circumſtances, to be <hi>independent;</hi> and while either ſide thinks itſelf in a condition to demand an indemnification, there is no man in his ſenſes, but will, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> prefer an indemnification that is a cheaper and more effectual ſecurity than any other he can think of. Nations in this ſituation demand and cede countries by almoſt every treaty of peace that is made. The <hi>French</hi> part of the iſland of St. <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher's</hi> was added to <hi>Great Britain</hi> in circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces altogether ſimilar to thoſe in which a few months may probably place the country of <hi>Canada.</hi> Farther ſecurity has always been deemed a motive with a conqueror to be leſs moderate; and even the vanquiſh'd inſiſt upon ſecurity as a reaſon for demanding what they acknowledge they could not otherwiſe properly aſk. The ſecurity of the frontier of <hi>France</hi> on the ſide of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> was always conſidered, in the negotiation that began at <hi>Getruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> and ended with that war.

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008601_0009_102F96724455F088"/>
her having no ambitious views, and which finiſhed by a treaty at which the miniſters of <hi>France</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly declared that ſhe deſired nothing for herſelf, in effect gained for her <hi>Lorrain,</hi> an indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification ten times the value of all her <hi>North A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, ſecurity and quiet of princes and ſtates have ever been deemed ſufficient reaſons, when ſupported by power, for diſpoſing of rights; and ſuch diſpoſition has never been looked on as want of moderation. It has always been the foundation of the moſt general treaties. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of <hi>Germany</hi> was the argument for yielding conſiderable poſſeſſions there to the <hi>Swedes:</hi> and the ſecurity of <hi>Europe</hi> divided the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, by the partition treaty, made between powers who had no <hi>other</hi> right to diſpoſe of any part of it. There can be no ceſſion that is not ſuppoſed at leaſt, to increaſe the power of the party to whom it is made. It is enough that he has a right to aſk it, and that he does it not merely to ſerve the purpoſes of a dangerous ambition. <hi>Canada</hi> in the hands of <hi>Britain,</hi> will endanger the kingdom of <hi>France</hi> as little as any other ceſſion; and from its ſituation and circumſtances cannot be hurtful to any other ſtate. Rather, if peace be an advantage, this ceſſion may be ſuch to all <hi>Europe.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war teaches us, that diſputes ariſing in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> may be an occaſion of embroiling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who have no concerns there. If the <hi>French</hi> remain in <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Louiſiana,</hi> fix the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as you will between us and them, we muſt border on each other for more than 1500 miles. The people that inhabit the frontiers, are generally the refuſe of both nations, often of the worſt morals and the leaſt diſcretion, remote from the eye, the prudence, and the reſtraint of government. Injuries
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008601_0010_102F9675620244B0"/>
are therefore frequently, in ſome part or other of ſo long a frontier, committed on both ſides. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment provoked, the colonies firſt engaged, and then the mother countries. And two great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can ſcarce be at war in <hi>Europe,</hi> but ſome other prince or ſtate thinks it a convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to revive ſome ancient claim, ſeize ſome advantage, obtain ſome territory, or enlarge ſome power at the expence of a neighbour. The flames of war once kindled, often ſpread far and wide, and the miſchief is infinite. Happy it prov'd to both nations, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were prevailed on finally to cede the <hi>New Netherlands</hi> (now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New York</hi>) to us at the peace of 1674; a peace that has ever ſince continued between us, but muſt have been frequently diſturbed, if they had retained the poſſeſſion of that country, border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral hundred miles on our colonies of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> weſtward, <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> eaſtward. Nor is it to be wondered at that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of different language, religion, and manners, ſhould in thoſe remote parts engage in frequent quarrels, when we find, that even the people of our own colonies have frequently been ſo exaſperated againſt each other in their diſputes about boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, as to proceed to open violence and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>remarker</hi> thinks we ſhall be ſufficiently ſecure in <hi>America,</hi> if we
<q>raiſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> forts at ſuch paſſes as may at once make us reſpectable to the <hi>French</hi> and to the <hi>Indian</hi> nations.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 25.</note> The ſecurity deſirable in <hi>America,</hi> may be conſidered as of three kinds; 1. A ſecurity of poſſeſſion, that the <hi>French</hi> ſhall not drive us out of the country. 2. A ſecurity of our planters from the inroads of ſavages, and the murders committed by them.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008601_0011_102F9676F3BF73A8"/>
3. A ſecurity that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation ſhall not be oblig'd on every new war to repeat the immenſe expence occaſion'd by this, to defend its poſſeſſions in <hi>America.</hi> Forts in the moſt important paſſes, may, I acknowledge be of uſe to obtain the firſt kind of ſecurity: but as thoſe ſituations are far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd beyond the inhabitants, the expence of maintaining and ſupplying the garriſons, will be very great, even in time of full peace, and immenſe on every interruption of it; as it is eaſy for ſkulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties of the enemy in ſuch long roads thro' the woods, to intercept and cut off our convoys, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs guarded continually by great bodies of men. The ſecond kind of ſecurity, will not be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch forts, unleſs they are connected by a wall like that of <hi>China,</hi> from one end of our ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the other. If the <hi>Indians</hi> when at war, march'd like the <hi>Europeans,</hi> with great armies, heavy cannon, baggage, and carriages, the paſſes thro' which alone ſuch armies could penetrate our country, or receive their ſupplies, being ſecur'd, all might be ſufficiently ſecure; but the caſe is widely different. They go to war, as they call it, in ſmall parties, from fifty men down to five. Their hunting life has made them acquainted with the whole country, and ſcarce any part of it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable to ſuch a party. They can travel thro' the woods even by night, and know how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their tracks. They paſs eaſily between your forts undiſcover'd; and privately approach the ſettlements of your frontier inhabitants. They need no convoys of proviſions to follow them; for whether they are ſhifting from place to place in the woods, or lying in wait for an opportunity to ſtrike a blow, every thicket and every ſtream fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes ſo ſmall a number with ſufficient ſubſiſtence. When they have ſurpriz'd ſeparately, and murder'd
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008601_0012_102F967888706680"/>
and ſcalp'd a dozen families, they are gone with inconceivable expedition thro' unknown ways, and 'tis very rare that purſuers have any chance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with them.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <q>Although the <hi>Indians</hi> live ſcattered, as a hunter's life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, they may be collected together from almoſt any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as they can find their ſubſiſtence from their gun in their travelling. But let the number of the <hi>Indians</hi> be what it will, they are not formidable merely on account of their numbers; there are many other circumſtances that give them a great advantage over the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> inhabitants, though numerous, are extended over a large tract of land, 500 leagues in length on the ſea-ſhore; and altho' ſome of their trading towns are thick ſettled, their ſettlements in the country towns muſt be at a diſtance from each other: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that in a new country, where lands are cheap, people are fond of acquiring large tracts to themſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the out ſettlements, they muſt be more remote: and as the people that move out are generally poor, they ſit down, either where they can eaſieſt procure land, or ſooneſt raiſe a ſubſiſtence. Add to this, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have fixed ſettled habitations, the eaſieſt and ſhorteſt paſſages to which the <hi>Indians,</hi> by conſtantly hunting in the woods, are perfectly well acquainted with; whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> know little or nothing of the <hi>Indian</hi> country, nor of the paſſages thro' the woods that lead to it. The <hi>Indian</hi> way of making war is by ſudden attacks upon expoſed places; and as ſoon as they have done miſchief, they retire, and either go home by the ſame or ſome different rout, as they think ſafeſt; or go to ſome other place at a diſtance, to renew their ſtroke. If a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient party ſhould happily be ready to purſue them, it is a great chance, whether in a country, conſiſting of woods and ſwamps, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are not acquainted with, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my do not lie in ambuſh for them in ſome convenient place, and from thence deſtroy them. If this ſhould not be the caſe, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould purſue them, as ſoon as they have gained the rivers, by means of their canoes, to the uſe of which they are brought up from their infancy, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently get out of their reach: further, if a body of men were to march into their country, to the places where they are ſettled, they can, upon the leaſt notice, without great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, quit their preſent habitations, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to new ones.</q>

                     <q>It has been already remarked, that the tribes of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> living upon the lakes and rivers that run upon the back of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettlements in <hi>North-America,</hi> are very numerous, and can furniſh a great number of fighting men, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well acquainted with the uſe of arms as ſoon as capable of carrying them, as they get the whole of their ſubſiſtence from hunting; and that this army, large as it may be, can be maintained by the French without any expence. From their numbers, their ſituation, and the rivers that run into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettlements, it is eaſy to conceive that they can at any time make an attack upon, and conſtantly annoy as many of the expoſed <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettlements as they pleaſe, and thoſe at any diſtance from each other. The effects of ſuch incurſions have been too ſeverely felt by many of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies, not to be very well known.

All other places that are expoſed are kept in continual terror; the lands lie waſte and uncultivated from the danger that attends thoſe that ſhall preſume to work upon them: beſides the immenſe charge the governments muſt be at in a very inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual manner to defend their extended frontiers; and all this from the influence the <hi>French</hi> have had over, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, a few of the <hi>Indians.</hi> To the ſame or greater evils ſtill will every one of the colonies be expoſed, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſame influence ſhall be extended to the whole body of them.</q>

               </note> In ſhort, long experience has taught our planters, that they cannot rely upon forts as a ſecurity againſt <hi>Indians:</hi> The inhabitants of <hi>Hackney</hi> might as well rely upon the tower of <hi>London</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:008601_0013_102F967BF757FBE8"/>
to ſecure them againſt highwaymen and houſebreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. As to the third kind of ſecurity, that we ſhall not in a few years, have all we have now done to do over again in <hi>America;</hi> and be oblig'd to employ the ſame number of troops, and ſhips, at the ſame immenſe expence to defend our poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions there, while we are in proportion weaken'd
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008601_0014_102F9681F6A063E8"/>
here: ſuch forts I think cannot prevent this. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a peace, it is not to be doubted the <hi>French,</hi> who are adroit at fortifying, will likewiſe erect forts in the moſt advantageous places of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try we leave them, which will make it more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult than ever to be reduc'd in caſe of another war. We know by the experience of this war, how extremely difficult it is to march an army thro' the <hi>American</hi> woods, with its neceſſary cannon and ſtores, ſufficient to reduce a very ſlight fort. The accounts at the treaſury will tell you what amazing ſums we have neceſſarily ſpent in the expeditions againſt two very trifling forts, <hi>Duqueſne</hi> and <hi>Crown Point.</hi> While the <hi>French</hi> retain their influence over the <hi>Indians,</hi> they can eaſily keep our long extended frontier in continual alarm, by a very few of thoſe people; and with a ſmall number of regulars and militia, in ſuch a country, we find they can keep an army of ours in full employ for ſeveral years. We therefore ſhall not need to be told by our colonies, that if we leave <hi>Canada,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever circumſcrib'd, to the <hi>French, "we have done "nothing;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 26.</note> we ſhall ſoon be made ſenſible our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this truth, and to our coſt.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood to deny that even if we ſubdue and retain <hi>Canada,</hi> ſome few forts may be of uſe to ſecure the goods of the traders, and protect the commerce, in caſe of any ſudden miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding with any tribe of <hi>Indians:</hi> but theſe forts will be beſt under the care of the colonies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the <hi>Indian</hi> trade, and garriſon'd by their provincial forces, and at their own expence. Their own intereſt will then induce the <hi>American</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to take care of ſuch forts in proportion to their importance; and ſee that the officers keep their corps full, and mind their duty. But any
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008601_0015_102F96839009B680"/>
troops of ours plac'd there and accountable here, would, in ſuch remote and obſcure places and at ſo great a diſtance from the eye and inſpection of ſuperiors, ſoon become of little conſequence, even tho' the <hi>French</hi> were left in poſſeſſion of <hi>Canada.</hi> If the four independent companies maintained by the Crown in <hi>New York</hi> more than forty years, at a great expence, conſiſted, for moſt part of the time, of faggots chiefly; if their officers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd their places as <hi>ſine cures,</hi> and were only, as a writer <note n="*" place="bottom">Douglaſs.</note> of that country ſtiles them, a kind of <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary monks;</hi> if this was the ſtate of troops poſted in a populous country, where the impoſition could not be ſo well conceal'd; what may we expect will be the caſe of thoſe that ſhall be poſted two, three or four hundred miles from the inhabitants, in ſuch obſcure and remote places as <hi>Crown Point, Oſwego, Duqueſne,</hi> or <hi>Niagara?</hi> they would ſcarce be even faggots; they would dwindle to meer names upon paper, and appear no where but upon the muſter rolls.</p>
            <p>Now all the kinds of ſecurity we have mention'd are obtain'd by ſubduing and retaining <hi>Canada.</hi> Our preſent poſſeſſions in <hi>America,</hi> are ſecur'd; our planters will no longer be maſſacred by the <hi>Indians,</hi> who depending abſolutely on us for what are now become the neceſſaries of life to them, guns, powder, hatchets, knives, and cloathing; and having no other <hi>Europeans</hi> near, that can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupply them, or inſtigate them againſt us; there is no doubt of their being always diſpos'd, if we treat them with common juſtice, to live in perpetual peace with us. And with regard to <hi>France,</hi> ſhe cannot in caſe of another war, put us to the immenſe expence of defending that long extended frontier; we ſhall then, as it were, have
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008601_0016_102F968521C439E0"/>
our backs againſt a wall in <hi>America,</hi> the ſea-coaſt will be eaſily protected by our ſuperior naval power; and here "our own watchfulneſs and our own ſtrength" will be properly, and cannot but be ſucceſsfully employed. In this ſituation the force now employ'd in that part of the world, may be ſpar'd for any other ſervice here or elſewhere; ſo that both the offenſive and defenſive ſtrength of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire on the whole will be greatly increaſed.</p>
            <p>But to leave the <hi>French</hi> in poſſeſſion of <hi>Canada</hi> when it is in our power to remove them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, as the remarker propoſes, on our own <hi>"ſtrength and watchfulneſs"</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 25.</note> to prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that may attend it, ſeems neither ſafe nor prudent. Happy as we now are, under the beſt of kings, and in the proſpect of a ſucceſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing every felicity a nation was ever bleſs'd with: happy too in the wiſdom and vigour of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of the adminiſtration, particularly that part whoſe peculiar province is the <hi>Britiſh</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, a province every true <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ſees with pleaſure under the principal direction of a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as much diſtinguiſh'd by his great capacity, as by his unwearied and diſintereſted application to this important department; we cannot, we ought not to promiſe ourſelves the uninterrupted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of thoſe bleſſings. The ſafety of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the ſtate, and the intereſt of the whole are not to be truſted to the wiſdom and vigor of future adminiſtrations, when a ſecurity is to be had more effectual, more conſtant, and much leſs expenſive. They who can be moved by the apprehenſion of dangers ſo remote as that of the future independence of our colonies (a point I ſhall hereafter conſider) ſeem ſcarcely conſiſtent

with themſelves when they ſuppoſe we may rely on the wiſdom and vigour of an adminiſtration for their ſafety.</p>
            <p>I ſhould indeed think it leſs material whether <hi>Canada</hi> were ceded to us or not, if I had in view only the <hi>ſecurity of poſſeſſion</hi> in our colonies. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely agree with the Remarker, that we are in <hi>North America</hi>
               <q>a far greater continental as well as naval power;</q>
and that only cowardice or ignorance can ſubject our colonies there to a <hi>French</hi> conqueſt. But for the ſame reaſon I diſagree with him widely upon another point. I do not think that our "blood and treaſure has been expended," as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, <hi>"in the cauſe of the colonies,"</hi> and that we "are making conqueſts <hi>for them:"</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 26.</note> yet I believe this is too common an error. I do not ſay they are altogether unconcerned in the event. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of them are, in common with the other ſubjects of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> anxious for the glory of her crown, the extent of her power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, the welfare and future repoſe of the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> people. They could not therefore but take a large ſhare in the affronts offered to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and have been animated with a truely <hi>Britiſh ſpirit</hi> to exert themſelves beyond their ſtrength, and againſt their evident intereſt. Yet ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate have they been, that their virtue has made againſt them; for upon no better foundation than this, have they been ſuppoſed the authors of a war carried on <hi>for their advantage only.</hi> It is a great miſtake to imagine that the <hi>American</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in queſtion between <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> is claimed as the property of any individuals or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick body in <hi>America,</hi> or that the poſſeſſion of it by <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is likely, in any lucrative view, to redound at all to the advantage of any perſon there.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008601_0018_102F968DAA9B6CC8"/>
On the other hand, the bulk of the inhabitants of <hi>North America</hi> are land-owners, whoſe lands are inferior in value to thoſe of <hi>Britain,</hi> only by the want of an equal number of people. It is true the acceſſion of the large territory claimed before the war began, eſpecially if that be ſecured by the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Canada,</hi> will tend to the increaſe of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, faſter than if they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd within the mountains: yet the increaſe within the mountains only, would evidently make the comparative population equal to that of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> much ſooner than it can be expected when our people are ſpread over a country ſix times as large. I think this is the only point of light in which this queſtion is to be viewed, and is the only one in which any of the colonies are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. No colony, no poſſeſſor of lands in any colony, therefore wiſhes for conqueſts, or can be benefited by them, otherwiſe than as they may be a means of ſecuring peace on their borders. No conſiderable advantage has reſulted to the colonies by the conqueſts of this war, or can reſult from confirming them by the peace, but what they muſt enjoy in common with the reſt of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; with this evident drawback from their ſhare of theſe advantages, that they will neceſſarily leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, or at leaſt prevent the increaſe of the value of what makes the principal part of their private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. A people ſpread thro' the whole tract of country on this ſide the <hi>Miſſiſſipi,</hi> and ſecured by <hi>Canada</hi> in our hands, would probably for ſome centuries find employment in agriculture, and thereby free us at home effectually from our fears of <hi>American</hi> manufactures. Unprejudic'd men well know that all the penal and prohibitory laws that ever were thought on, will not be ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent manufactures in a country whoſe inhabitants
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008601_0019_102F968F3B2290A8"/>
ſurpaſs the number that can ſubſiſt by the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry of it. That this will be the caſe in <hi>America</hi> ſoon, if our people remain confined within the mountains, and almoſt as ſoon ſhould it be unſafe for them to live beyond, tho' the country be ceded to us, no man acquainted with political and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial hiſtory can doubt. Manufactures are founded in poverty. It is the multitude of poor without land in a country, and who muſt work for others at low wages or ſtarve, that enables under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers to carry on a manufacture, and afford it cheap enough to prevent the importation of the ſame kind from abroad, and to bear the expence of its own exportation. But no man who can have a piece of land of his own, ſufficient by his labour to ſubſiſt his family in plenty, is poor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be a manufacturer, and work for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Hence while there is land enough in <hi>America</hi> for our people, there can never be manufactures to any amount or value. It is a ſtriking obſervation of a very <hi>able pen,</hi> that the natural livelihood of the thin inhabitants of a foreſt country, is hunting; that of a greater number, paſturage; that of a middling population, agriculture; and that of the greateſt, manufactures; which laſt muſt ſubſiſt the bulk of the people in a full country, or they muſt be ſubſiſted by charity, or periſh. The extended population, therefore, that is moſt advantageous to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> will be beſt effected, becauſe only effectually ſecur'd by our poſſeſſion of <hi>Canada.</hi> So far as the being of our preſent colonies in <hi>North America</hi> is concerned, I think indeed with the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> there are not
<q>an enemy to be aprehended,</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 27.</note> but the expreſſion is too vague to be applicable to the preſent, or indeed to any other caſe. <hi>Algiers, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Tripoli,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal

as they are to this nation in power and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people, are enemies to be ſtill apprehended; and the <hi>Highlanders</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> have been ſo for many ages by the greateſt princes of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Britain.</hi> The wild <hi>Iriſh</hi> were able to give a great deal of diſturbance even to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and coſt her more blood and treaſure than her war with <hi>Spain. Canada</hi> in the hands of <hi>France</hi> has always ſtinted the growth of our colonies: In the courſe of this war, and indeed before it, has diſturb'd and vex'd even the beſt and ſtrongeſt of them, has found means to murder thouſands of their people, and unſettle a great part of their country. Much more able will it be to ſtarve the growth of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſettlement. <hi>Canada</hi> has alſo found means to make this nation ſpend two or three millions a year in <hi>America;</hi> and a people, how ſmall ſoever, that in their preſent ſituation, can do this as often as we have a war with them, is methinks,
<q>an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to be apprehended.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>North American</hi> colonies are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the frontier of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire on that ſide. The frontier of any dominion being attack'd, it becomes not merely <hi>"the cauſe"</hi> of the people im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately affected, (the inhabitants of that frontier) but properly <hi>"the cauſe"</hi> of the whole body. Where the frontier people owe and pay obedience, there they have a right to look for protection. No political propoſition is better eſtabliſhed than this. It is therefore invidious to repreſent the "blood and treaſure" ſpent in this war, as ſpent in
<q>the cauſe of the colonies</q>
only, and that they are "abſurd and ungrateful" if they think we have done nothing unleſs we
<q>make conqueſts for them,</q>
and reduce <hi>Canada</hi> to gratify their "vain ambition," <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It will not be a conqueſt for them, nor gratify any vain ambition of theirs.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008601_0021_102F9697C73EF718"/>
It will be a conqueſt for the whole, and all our people will, in the increaſe of trade and the eaſe of taxes, find the advantage of it. Should we be obliged at any time to make a war for the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our commerce, and to ſecure the exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our manufactures, would it be fair to repreſent ſuch a war merely as blood and treaſure ſpent in the cauſe of the weavers of <hi>Yorkſhire, Norwich,</hi> or the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the cutlers of <hi>Sheffield,</hi> or the button-makers of <hi>Birmingham?</hi> I hope it will appear before I end theſe ſheets, that if ever there was a <hi>national war,</hi> this is truly ſuch a one: a war in which the intereſt of the <hi>whole</hi> nation is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and fundamentally concerned.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who would be thought deeply ſkilled in human nature, affect to diſcover ſelf-intereſted views every where at the bottom of the faireſt, the moſt generous conduct. Suſpicions and charges of this kind, meet with ready reception and belief in the minds even of the multitude; and therefore leſs acuteneſs and addreſs than the <hi>remarker</hi> is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, would be ſufficient to perſuade the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion generally, that all the zeal and ſpirit manifeſted and exerted by the colonies in this war, was only in "their own cauſe" to
<q>make conqueſts for themſelves,</q>
to engage us to make more for them, to gratify their own "vain ambition." But ſhould they now humbly addreſs the mother country in the terms and the ſentiments of the <hi>remarker,</hi> return her their grateful acknowledgments for the blood and treaſure ſhe had ſpent in

I ſay, ſhould ſuch an addreſs from the colonies make its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance here, though, according to the <hi>remarker,</hi> it would be a moſt juſt and reaſonable one; would it not, might it not with more juſtice be anſwered; We underſtand you, gentlemen, perfectly well: you have only your own intereſt in view: you want to have the people confined within your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent limits, that in a few years the lands you are poſſeſſed of may increaſe tenfold in value! you want to reduce the price of labour by increaſing numbers on the ſame territory, that you may be able to ſet up manufactures and vie with your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country! you would have your people kept in a body, that you may be more able to diſpute the commands of the crown, and obtain an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency. You would have the <hi>French</hi> left in <hi>Canada,</hi> to exerciſe your military virtue, and make you a warlike people, that you may have more confidence to embark in ſchemes of diſobedience, and greater ability to ſupport them! You have taſted too, the ſweets of TWO or THREE MILLIONS <hi>Sterling per annum</hi> ſpent among you by our fleets and forces, and you are unwilling to be without a pretence for kindling up another war, and thereby occaſion a repetition of the ſame delightful doſes! But, gentlemen, allow us to underſtand
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008601_0023_102F969AE72312D0"/>
our intereſt a little likewiſe: we ſhall remove the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Canada</hi> that you may live in peace, and we be no more drained by your quarrels. You ſhall have land enough to cultivate, that you may have neither neceſſity nor inclination to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to manufactures, and we will manufacture for you, and govern you.</p>
            <p>A reader of the remarks may be apt to ſay; if this writer would have us reſtore <hi>Canada</hi> on prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of moderation, how can we conſiſtent with thoſe principles, retain <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> which he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of ſo much greater value! I will endeavour to explain this, becauſe by doing it I ſhall have an opportunity of ſhowing the truth and good ſenſe of the anſwer to the intereſted application I have juſt ſuppoſed. The author then is only <hi>apparently</hi> and not <hi>really</hi> inconſiſtent with himſelf. If we can obtain the credit of moderation by reſtoring <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> it is well: but we ſhould, however, reſtore it at all events; becauſe it would not only be of no uſe to us, but
<q>the poſſeſſion of it (in his opinion) may in its conſequence be dangerous <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 50, 51.</note>.</q>
as how? Why, plainly, (at length it comes out) if the <hi>French</hi> are not left there to check the growth of our colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<q>they will extend themſelves almoſt without bounds into the inland parts, and increaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely from all cauſes;—becoming a numerous, hardy, <hi>independent</hi> people, poſſeſſed of a ſtrong country, communicating little or not at all with <hi>England,</hi> living wholly on their own labour, and in proceſs of time knowing little and enquiring little about the mother country.</q>
In ſhort, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this writer, our preſent colonies are large enough and numerous enough, and the <hi>French</hi> ought to be left in <hi>North America</hi> to prevent their increaſe, leſt they become not only <hi>uſeleſs</hi> but <hi>dangerous</hi> to <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:008601_0024_102F969C895F3350"/>I agree with the gentleman, that with <hi>Canada</hi> in our poſſeſſion, our people in <hi>America</hi> will increaſe amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. I know that their common rate of increaſe, where they are not moleſted by the enemy, is doubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their numbers every twenty-five years by natural generation only, excluſive of the acceſſion of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners. <note n="*" place="bottom">The reaſon of this greater increaſe in <hi>America</hi> than in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> is, that in old ſettled countries, all trades, farms, offices, and employments are full, and many people refrain marrying till they ſee an opening, in which they can ſettle themſelves, with a reaſonable proſpect of maintaining a family: but in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> it being eaſy to obtain land which with moderate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will afford ſubſiſtence and ſomething to ſpare, people marry more readily and earlier in life, whence ariſes a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous offspring and the ſwift population of thoſe countries, 'Tis a common error that we cannot fill our provinces or increaſe the number of them, without draining this nation of its people. The increment alone of our preſent colonies is ſufficient for both thoſe purpoſes.</note> I think this increaſe continuing, would probably in a century more, make the number of <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects on that ſide the water more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than they now are on this; but I am far from entertaining, on that account, any fears of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming either <hi>uſeleſs</hi> or <hi>dangerous</hi> to us; and I look on thoſe fears to be merely imaginary and without any probable foundation. The <hi>remarker</hi> is reſerv'd in giving his reaſons, as in his opinion this "is not a fit ſubject for diſcuſſion." I ſhall give mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I conceive it a ſubject neceſſary to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed; and the rather, as thoſe fears, how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and chimerical ſoever, may, by poſſeſſing the multitude, poſſibly induce the ableſt miniſtry to conform to them againſt their own judgment, and thereby prevent the aſſuring to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> name and nation, a ſtability and permanency that no man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with hiſtory durſt have hoped for, till
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008601_0025_102F96A2CE0A96D8"/>
our <hi>American</hi> poſſeſſions opened the pleaſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>The remarker thinks that our people in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
               <q>finding no check from <hi>Canada,</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves almoſt without bounds into the inland parts, and increaſe infinitely from all cauſes.</q>
The very reaſon he aſſigns for their ſo extending, and which is indeed the true one, their being
<q>invited to it by the pleaſantneſs, fertility and plenty of the country,</q>
may ſatisfy us, that this extenſion will continue to proceed as long as there remains any pleaſant fertile country within their reach. And if we even ſuppoſe them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd by the waters of the <hi>Miſſiſſipi</hi> weſtward, and by thoſe of <hi>St. Laurence</hi> and the lakes to the northward, yet ſtill we ſhall leave them room e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to increaſe, even in the <hi>ſparſe</hi> manner of ſettling now practis'd there, till they amount to perhaps a hundred millions of ſouls. This muſt take ſome centuries to fulfil, and in the mean time, this nation muſt neceſſarily ſupply them with the manufactures they conſume, becauſe the new ſettlers will be employed in agriculture, and the new ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will ſo continually draw off the ſpare hands from the old, that our preſent colonies will not, during the period we have mention'd, find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a condition to manufacture even for their own inhabitants, to any conſiderable degree, much leſs for thoſe who are ſettling behind them. Thus our <hi>trade</hi> muſt, till that country becomes as fully peopled as <hi>England,</hi> that is, for centuries to come, be continually increaſing, and with it our naval power; becauſe the ocean is between us and them, and our ſhips and ſeamen muſt increaſe as that trade increaſes.</p>
            <p>The human body and the political differ in this, that the firſt is limited by nature to a certain
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008601_0026_102F96A5E0C12D78"/>
ſtature, which, when attain'd, it cannot, ordinarily, exceed; the other by better government and more prudent police, as well as by change of manners and other circumſtances, often takes freſh ſtarts of growth, after being long at a ſtand; and may add tenfold to the dimenſions it had for ages been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to. The mother being of full ſtature, is in a few years equalled by a growing daughter: but in the caſe of a mother country and her colonies, it is quite different. The growth of the children tends to encreaſe the growth of the mother, and ſo the difference and ſuperiority is longer preſerv'd.</p>
            <p>Were the inhabitants of this iſland limited to their preſent number by any thing in nature, or by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable circumſtances, the equality of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between the two countries might indeed ſooner come to paſs: but ſure experience in thoſe parts of the iſland where manufactures have been introduced, teaches us, that people increaſe and multiply in proportion as the means and facility of gaining a livelihood increaſe; and that this iſland, if they could be employed, is capable of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten times its preſent number of people. In proportion, therefore, as the demand increaſes for the manufactures of <hi>Britain,</hi> by the increaſe of people in her colonies, the numbers of her people at home will increaſe, and with them the ſtrength as well as the wealth of the nation. For ſatisfaction in this point let the reader compare in his mind the number and force of our preſent fleets, with our fleet in queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> Forty ſail, none of more than 40 guns.</note> before we had colonies. Let him compare the ancient with the preſent ſtate of our towns and ports on our weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern coaſt, <hi>Mancheſter, Liverpool, Kendal, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, Glaſgow,</hi> and the countries round them, that trade with and manufacture for our colonies,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008601_0027_102F96A900009858"/>
not to mention <hi>Leeds, Halifax, Sheffleld</hi> and <hi>Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham,</hi> and conſider what a difference there is in the numbers of people, buildings, rents, and the value of land and of the produce of land, even if he goes back no farther than is within man's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Let him compare thoſe countries with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on this ſame iſland, where manufactures have not yet extended themſelves, obſerve the preſent difference, and reflect how much greater our ſtrength may be, if numbers give ſtrength, when our manufacturers ſhall occupy every part of the iſland where they can poſſibly be ſubſiſted.</p>
            <p>But, ſay the objectors, "there is a certain diſtance from the ſea, in <hi>America,</hi> beyond which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of carriage will put a ſtop to the ſale and conſumption of your manufactures; and this, with the difficulty of making returns for them, will oblige the inhabitants to manufacture for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; of courſe, if you ſuffer your people to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their ſettlements beyond that diſtance, your people become uſeleſs to you:" and this diſtance is limited by ſome to 200 miles, by others to the <hi>Apalachian</hi> mountains. Not to inſiſt on a very plain truth, that no part of a dominion, from whence a government may on occaſion draw ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and aids both of men of money, tho' at too great a diſtance to be ſupply'd with manufactures from ſome other part, is therefore to be deem'd uſeleſs to the whole; I ſhall endeavour to ſhow that theſe imaginary limits of utility, even in point of commerce, are much too narrow.</p>
            <p>The inland parts of the continent of <hi>Europe</hi> are much farther from the ſea than the limits of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment propoſed for <hi>America. Germany</hi> is full of tradeſmen and artificers of all kinds, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments there, are not all of them always fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the commerce of <hi>Britain,</hi> yet it is a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008601_0028_102F96ADB282CD28"/>
well-known fact, that our manufactures find their way even into the heart of <hi>Germany.</hi> Aſk the great manufacturers and merchants of the <hi>Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, Mancheſter</hi> and <hi>Norwich</hi> goods, and they will tell you that ſome of them ſend their riders frequently through <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> up to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and back through the middle and northern parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> to ſhow ſamples of their wares and collect orders, which they receive by almoſt every mail, to a vaſt amount. Whatever charges ariſe on the carriage of goods, are added to the value, and all paid by the conſumer. If theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions over whom we have no government, over whoſe conſumption we can have no influence, but what ariſes from the cheapneſs and goodneſs of our wares; whoſe trade, manufactures, or commercial connections are not ſubject to the controul of our laws, as thoſe of our colonies certainly are in ſome degree: I ſay, if theſe nations purchaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſuch quantities of our goods, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remoteneſs of their ſituation from the ſea; how much leſs likely is it that the ſettlers in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> who muſt for ages be employed in agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture chiefly, ſhould make cheaper for themſelves the goods our manufacturers at preſent ſupply them with; even if we ſuppoſe the carriage five, ſix, or ſeven hundred miles from the ſea as difficult and expenſive as the like diſtance into <hi>Germany:</hi> whereas in the latter, the natural diſtances are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doubled by political obſtructions, I mean the intermix'd territories and claſhing intereſts of princes. But when we conſider that the inland parts of <hi>America</hi> are penetrated by great navigable rivers; that there are a number of great lakes, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with each other, with thoſe rivers and with the ſea, very ſmall portages here and there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008601_0029_102F96B1E6F338D0"/>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">From <hi>New York</hi> into lake <hi>Ontario,</hi> the land carriage of the ſeveral portages altogether, amounts to but about 27 miles. From lake <hi>Ontario</hi> into lake <hi>Erie,</hi> the land carriage at <hi>Niagara</hi> is but about 12 miles. All the lakes above <hi>Niagara</hi> communicate by navigable ſtraits, ſo that no land carriage is neceſſary, to go out of one into another. From <hi>Preſqu'iſle</hi> on lake <hi>Erie,</hi> there are but 15 miles land-carriage, and that a good wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon road, to <hi>Beef River</hi> a branch of the <hi>Ohio,</hi> which brings you into a navigation of many thouſand miles inland, if you take together the <hi>Ohio,</hi> the <hi>Miſſiſſipi,</hi> and all the great rivers and branches that run into them.</note> that the ſea coaſts (if one may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the expreſſion) of thoſe lakes only, amount at leaſt to 2700 miles, excluſive of the rivers run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into them; many of which are navigable to a great extent for boats and canoes, thro' vaſt tracts of country; how little likely is it that the expence on the carriage of our goods into thoſe countries, ſhould prevent the uſe of them. If the poor <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> in thoſe remote parts are now able to pay for the linnen, woolen and iron wares they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent furniſh'd with by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, tho' <hi>Indians</hi> have nothing but what they get by hunting, and the goods are loaded with all the impoſitions fraud and knavery can contrive to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance their value; will not induſtrious <hi>Engliſh</hi> farmers, hereafter ſettled in thoſe countries, be much better able to pay for what ſhall be brought them in the way of fair commerce?</p>
            <p>If it is aſked, what can ſuch farmers raiſe, wherewith to pay for the manufactures they may want from us? I anſwer, that the inland parts of <hi>America</hi> in queſtion are well known to be fitted for the production of hemp, flax, potaſh, and above all, ſilk; the ſouthern parts may produce olive-oil, raiſins, currans, indigo, and cochineal.

the ſame time aſſiſt in conveying other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. That the commodities firſt mention'd, may eaſily by water or land carriage be brought to the ſea ports from interior <hi>America,</hi> will not ſeem incredible, when we reflect, that hemp formerly came from the <hi>Ukraine</hi> and moſt ſouthern parts of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> to <hi>Wologda,</hi> and down the <hi>Dwina</hi> to <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel,</hi> and thence by a perilous navigation round the <hi>North Cape</hi> to <hi>England</hi> and other parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> It now comes from the ſame country up the <hi>Dnieper</hi> and down the <hi>Duna</hi> with much land car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Great part of the <hi>Ruſſia</hi> iron, no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priced commodity, is brought 3000 miles by land and water from the heart of <hi>Siberia.</hi> Furs, [the produce too of <hi>America</hi>] are brought to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> from all parts of <hi>Siberia,</hi> even the moſt remote, <hi>Kamſchatſka.</hi> The ſame country furniſhes me with another inſtance of extended inland commerce. It is found worth while to keep up a mercantile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between <hi>Peking</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> And none of theſe inſtances of inland com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce exceed thoſe of the courſes by which, at ſeveral periods, the whole trade of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> was carried on.

From thence thoſe goods were carried down the <hi>Amû,</hi> the ancient <hi>Oxus,</hi> to the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea, and up the <hi>Wolga</hi> to <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> from whence they were carried over to, and down the <hi>Don</hi> to the mouth of that river, and thence again the <hi>Venetians</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> indirectly by way

of <hi>Kaffa</hi> and <hi>Trebiſonde,</hi> diſpers'd them thro' the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and ſome other parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Another part of thoſe goods was carried over-land from the <hi>Wolga</hi> to the rivers <hi>Duna</hi> and <hi>Neva;</hi> from both they were carried to the city of <hi>Wiſbuy</hi> in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> ſo eminent for its ſea-laws; and from the city of <hi>Ladoga</hi> on the <hi>Neva,</hi> we are told they were even carried by the <hi>Dwina</hi> to <hi>Archangel,</hi> and from thence round the <hi>North Cape.</hi>

            <p>If the growths of a country find their way out of it, the manufactures of the countries where they go, will infallibly find their way into it. They who underſtand the oeconomy and principles of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, know, that it is impoſſible to eſtabliſh them in places not populous; and even in thoſe that are populous, hardly poſſible to eſtabliſh them to the prejudice of the places already in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them. Several attempts have been made in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> countenanced by the Government, to draw from us and eſtabliſh in thoſe countries, our hard-ware and woolen manufactures, but without ſucceſs. The reaſons are various. A manufacture is part of a great ſyſtem of commerce, which takes in conveniences of various kinds, methods of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding materials of all ſorts, machines for expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and facilitating labour, all the channels of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence for vending the wares, the credit and confidence neceſſary to found and ſupport this correſpondence, the mutual aid of different arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans, and a thouſand other particulars, which time and long experience have gradually eſtabliſhed. A part of ſuch a ſyſtem cannot ſupport itſelf without the whole, and before the whole can be obtained
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008601_0032_102F96BC4EDAB818"/>
the part periſhes. Manufactures where they are in perfection, are carried on by a multiplicity of hands, each of which is expert only in his own part, no one of them a maſter of the whole; and it by any means ſpirited away to a foreign country, he is loſt without his fellows. Then it is a matter of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremeſt difficulty to perſuade a complete ſet of workmen, ſkilled in all parts of a manufactory, to leave their country together and ſettle in a foreign land. Some of the idle and drunken may be enticed away, but theſe only diſappoint their employers, and ſerve to diſcourage the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. If by royal munificence, and an expence that the profits of the trade alone would not bear, a complete ſet of good and ſkilful hands are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and carried over, they find ſo much of the ſyſtem imperfect, ſo many things wanting to carry on the trade to advantage, ſo many difficulties to overcome, and the knot of hands ſo eaſily broken, by death, diſſatisfaction and deſertion, that they and their employers are diſcouraged together, and the project vaniſhes into ſmoke. Hence it happens, that eſtabliſhed manufactures are hardly ever loſt, but by foreign conqueſt, or by ſome eminent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior fault in manners or government; a bad police oppreſſing and diſcouraging the workmen, or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſecutions driving the ſober and induſtrious out of the country. There is in ſhort, ſcarce a ſingle inſtance in hiſtory of the contrary, where manufactures have once taken firm root. They ſometimes ſtart up in a new place, but are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupported like exotic plants at more expence than they are worth for any thing but curioſity, until theſe new ſeats become the refuge of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers driven from the old ones. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and final reduction of the <hi>Greek</hi> empire, diſperſed many curious manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008601_0033_102F96BF54454CF0"/>
into different parts of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conqueſts of its provinces had before done the ſame. The loſs of liberty in <hi>Verona, Milan, Florence, Piſa, Piſtoia,</hi> and other great cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> drove the manufacturers of woolen cloth into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> The latter firſt loſt their trade and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers to <hi>Antwerp</hi> and the cities of <hi>Brabant,</hi> from whence by perſecution for religion they were ſent into <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> The civil wars during the minority of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> which ended in the loſs of the liberty of their great towns, ended too in the loſs of the manufactures of <hi>Toledo, Segovia, Salamanca, Medina del Campo, &amp;c.</hi> The revocation of the edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, to all the Proteſtant parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> the paper, ſilk, and other valuable manufactures of <hi>France,</hi> almoſt peculiar at that time to that country, and till then in vain attempted elſewhere.</p>
            <p>To be convinced that it is not ſoil and climate, or even freedom from taxes, that determines the reſidence of manufacturers, we need only turn our eyes on <hi>Holland,</hi> where a multitude of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſtill carried on (perhaps more than on the ſame extent of territory any where in <hi>Europe</hi>) and ſold on terms upon which they cannot be had in any other part of the world. And this too is true of thoſe growths, which by their nature and the labour required to raiſe them, come the neareſt to manufactures.</p>
            <p>As to the common-place objection to the <hi>North American</hi> ſettlements, that they are in the ſame climate and their produce the ſame as that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> in the firſt place it is not true; it is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not ſo of the countries now likely to be added to our ſettlements; and of our preſent colonies, the products, lumber, tobacco, rice, and indigo, great articles of commerce, do not interfere with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008601_0034_102F96C0E3956000"/>
of <hi>England:</hi> in the next place, a man muſt know very little of the trade of the world, who does not know, that the greater part of it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on between countries whoſe climate differs very little. Even the trade between the different parts of theſe <hi>Britiſh</hi> iſlands, is greatly ſuperior to that between <hi>England</hi> and all the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> iſlands put together.</p>
            <p>If I have been ſucceſsful in proving that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable commerce may and will ſubſiſt between us and our future moſt inland ſettlements in <hi>North America,</hi> notwithſtanding their diſtance, I have more than half proved no other inconveniency will ariſe from their diſtance. Many men in ſuch a country, muſt <hi>"know,"</hi> muſt <hi>"think"</hi> and muſt <hi>"care"</hi> about the country they chiefly trade with. The juridical and other connections of government are yet a faſter hold than even commercial ties, and ſpread directly and indirectly far and wide. Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be ſolicited and cauſes depending, create a great intercourſe even where private property is not divided into different countries, yet this diviſion will always ſubſiſt where different countries are ruled by the ſame government. Where a man has landed property both in the mother country and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, he will almoſt always live in the mother country: this, though there were no trade, is ſingly a ſufficient gain. It is ſaid, that <hi>Ireland</hi> pays near a million <hi>Sterling</hi> annually to its abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees in <hi>England:</hi> The ballance of trade from <hi>Spain</hi> or even <hi>Portugal</hi> is ſcarcely equal to this.</p>
            <p>Let it not be ſaid we have no abſentees from <hi>North America.</hi> There are many to the writer's knowledge; and if there are at preſent but few of them that diſtinguiſh themſelves here by great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, it is owing to the mediocrity of fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the inhabitants of the <hi>Northern colonies;</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008601_0035_102F96C273B4F040"/>
a more equal diviſion of landed property, than in the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> iſlands, ſo that there are as yet but few large eſtates. But if thoſe who have ſuch eſtates, reſide upon and take care of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are they worſe ſubjects than they would be If they lived idly in <hi>England?</hi> Great merit is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed for the gentlemen of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 47, 48, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>, on the ſcore of their reſiding and ſpending their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in <hi>England.</hi> I would not depreciate that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; it is conſiderable, for they might, if they pleaſed ſpend their money in <hi>France:</hi> but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between their ſpending it <hi>here</hi> and <hi>at home</hi> is not ſo great. What do they ſpend it in when they are here, but the produce and manufactures of this country; and would they not do the ſame if they were at home? Is it of any great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> farmer, whether the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> gentleman comes to <hi>London</hi> and eats his beef, pork, and tongues, freſh, or has them brought to him in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> ſalted; whether he eats his <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> cheeſe and butter or drinks his <hi>Engliſh</hi> ale at <hi>London</hi> or in <hi>Barbadoes?</hi> Is the clothier's, or the mercer's, or the cutler's, or the toy-man's profit leſs, for their goods being worn and conſumed by the ſame perſons reſiding on the other ſide of the Ocean? Would not the profits of the merchant and mariner be rather greater, and ſome addition made to our navigation, ſhips and ſeamen? If the <hi>North American</hi> gentleman ſtays in his own country, and lives there in that degree of luxury and expence with regard to the uſe of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, that his fortune entitles him to; may not his example (from the imitation of ſuperiors ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to mankind) ſpread the uſe of thoſe manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures among hundreds of families around him, and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008601_0036_102F96C4057DDA70"/>
occaſion a much greater demand for them, than it would do if he ſhould remove and live in <hi>London?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However this may be, if in our views of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate advantage, it ſeems preferable that the gentlemen of large fortunes in <hi>North America</hi> ſhould reſide much in <hi>England,</hi> 'tis what may ſurely be expected as faſt as ſuch fortunes are acquired there. Their having
<q>colleges of their own for the education of their youth,</q>
will not prevent it: A little knowledge and learning acquired, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the appetite for more, and will make the converſation of the learned on this ſide the water more ſtrongly deſired. <hi>Ireland</hi> has its univerſity likewiſe; yet this does not prevent the immenſe pecuniary benefit we receive from that kingdom. And there will always be in the conveniencies of life, the politeneſs, the pleaſures, the magnificence of the reigning country, many other attractions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe of learning, to draw men of ſubſtance there, where they can, apparently at leaſt, have the beſt bargain of happineſs for their money.</p>
            <p>Our trade to the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> iſlands is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly a valuable one: but whatever is the amount of it, it has long been at a ſtand. Limited as our ſugar planters are by the ſcantineſs of territory, they cannot increaſe much beyond their preſent number; and this is an evil, as I ſhall ſhow hereafter, that will be little helped by our keeping <hi>Guadaloupe.</hi> The trade to our <hi>Northern Colonies,</hi> is not only greater, but yearly increaſing with the increaſe of people: and even in a greater proportion, as the people increaſe in wealth and the ability of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well as in numbers. I have already ſaid, that our people in the <hi>Northern Colonies</hi> double in about 25 years, excluſive of the acceſſion of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. That I ſpeak within bounds, I appeal to the

for the plain frugal manner of living of its inhabitants, and the moſt ſuſpected of carrying on manufactures on account of the number of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> artizans, who are known to have tranſplanted themſelves into that country, though even theſe, in truth, when they come there, generally apply themſelves to agriculture as the ſureſt ſupport and moſt advantageous employment. By this account it appears, that the exports to that province have in 28 years, increaſed nearly in the proportion of 17 to 1; whereas the people themſelves, who by other authentic accounts appear to double their numbers (the ſtrangers who ſettle there included) in about 16 years, cannot in the 28 years have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in a greater proportion than as 4 to 1: the additional demand then, and conſumption of goods from <hi>England,</hi> of 13 parts in 17 more than the additional number would require, muſt be owing to this, that the people having by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry mended their circumſtances, are enabled to indulge themſelves in finer cloaths, better furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a more general uſe of all our manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures than heretofore. In fact, the occaſion for <hi>Engliſh</hi> goods in <hi>North America,</hi> and the inclination to have and uſe them, is, and muſt be for ages to come, much greater than the ability of the people to pay for them; they muſt therefore, as they now do, deny themſelves many things they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe chuſe to have, or increaſe their induſtry to obtain them; and thus, if they ſhould at any time manufacture ſome coarſe article, which on account
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008601_0039_102F96CE451E7C60"/>
of its bulk or ſome other circumſtance, cannot ſo well be brought to them from <hi>Britain,</hi> it only enables them the better to pay for finer goods that otherwiſe they could not indulge themſelves in: ſo that the exports thither are not diminiſhed by ſuch manufacture but rather increaſed. The ſingle article of manufacture in theſe colonies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the <hi>remarker,</hi> is <hi>hats</hi> made in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It is true there have been ever ſince the firſt ſettlement of that country, a few hatters there, drawn thither probably at firſt by the facility of getting beaver, while the woods were but little clear'd, and there was plenty of thoſe animals. The caſe is greatly altered now. The beaver ſkins are not now to be had in <hi>New England,</hi> but from very remote places and at great prices. The trade is accordingly declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, ſo that, far from being able to make hats in any quantity for exportation, they cannot ſupply their home demand; and it is well known that ſome thouſand dozens are ſent thither yearly from <hi>London,</hi> and ſold there cheaper than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants can make them of equal gohdneſs. In fact, the colonies are ſo little ſuited for eſtabliſhing of manufactures, that they are continually loſing the few branches they accidentally gain. The working braſiers, cutlers, and pewterers, as well as hatters, who have happened to go over from time to time and ſettle in the colonies, gradually drop the working part of their buſineſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their reſpective goods from <hi>England,</hi> whence they can have them cheaper and better than they can make them. They continue their ſhops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the ſame way of dealing, but become <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> of braſiery, cutlery, pewter, hats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> brought from <hi>England,</hi> inſtead of being <hi>makers</hi> of thoſe goods.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:008601_0040_102F96CFD3849CD0"/>Thus much as to the apprehenſion of our colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies becoming <hi>uſeleſs</hi> to us. I ſhall next conſider the other ſuppoſition, that their growth may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them <hi>dangerous.</hi> Of this I own, I have not the leaſt conception, when I conſider that we have already fourteen ſeparate governments on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime coaſt of the continent, and if we extend our ſettlements ſhall probably have as many more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them on the inland ſide. Thoſe we now have, are not only under different governors, but have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent forms of government, different laws, different intereſts, and ſome of them different religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions and different manners. Their jealouſy of each other is ſo great that however neceſſary an union of the colonies has long been, for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defence and ſecurity againſt their enemies, and how ſenſible ſoever each colony has been of that neceſſity, yet they have never been able to effect ſuch an union among themſelves, nor even to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in requeſting the mother country to eſtabliſh it for them. Nothing but the immediate command of the crown has been able to produce even the imperfect union but lately ſeen there, of the forces of ſome colonies. If they could not agree to unite for their defence againſt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who were perpetually haraſſing their ſettlements, burning their villages, and murdering their people; can it reaſonably be ſuppoſed there is any danger of their uniting againſt their own nation, which protects and encourages them, with which they have ſo many connections and ties of blood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and affection, and which 'tis well known they all love much more than they love one another? In ſhort, there are ſo many cauſes that muſt operate to prevent it, that I will venture to ſay, an union amongſt them for ſuch a purpoſe is not merely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, it is impoſſible; and if the union of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008601_0041_102F96D315743000"/>
the whole is impoſſible, the attempt of a part muſt be madneſs: as thoſe colonies that did not join the rebellion, would join the mother country in ſuppreſſing it.</p>
            <p>When I ſay ſuch an union is impoſſible, I mean without the moſt grievous tyranny and oppreſſion. People who have property in a country which they may loſe, and privileges which they may endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; are generally diſpos'd to be quiet; and even to bear much, rather than hazard all. While the government is mild and juſt, while important civil and religious rights are ſecure, ſuch ſubjects will be dutiful and obedient. The waves do not riſe, but when the winds blow. What ſuch an admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration as the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> might produce, I know not; but this I think I have a right to deem impoſſible. And yet there were two very manifeſt differences between that caſe, and ours, and both are in our favour. The firſt, that <hi>Spain</hi> had already united the ſeventeen provinces under one viſible government, tho' the ſtates continued independent: The ſecond, that the inhabitants of thoſe provinces were of a nation, not only different from, but utterly unlike the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> Had the <hi>Netherlands</hi> been peopled from <hi>Spain,</hi> the worſt of oppreſſion had probably not provoked them to wiſh a ſeparation of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It might and probably would have ruined the country, but would never have produced an independent ſovereignty. In fact, neither the very worſt of governments, the worſt of politicks in the laſt century, nor the total abolition of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining liberty, in the provinces of <hi>Spain</hi> itſelf, in the preſent, have produced any independency that could be ſupported. The ſame may be obſerved of <hi>France.</hi> And let it not be ſaid that the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of theſe to the ſeat of government has
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008601_0042_102F96D91443AAF8"/>
prevented a ſeparation. While our ſtrength at ſea continues, the banks of the <hi>Ohio</hi> (in point of eaſy and expeditious conveyance of troops) are nearer to <hi>London,</hi> than the remote parts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> to their reſpective capitals; and much nearer than <hi>Connaught</hi> and <hi>Ulſter</hi> were in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> No body foretels the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> monarchy from its extent, yet I will venture to ſay, the eaſtern parts of it are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready much more inacceſſiable from <hi>Peterſburgh,</hi> than the country on the <hi>Miſſiſſipi</hi> is from <hi>London;</hi> I mean more men, in leſs time, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the latter than the former diſtance. The rivers <hi>Oby, Jeneſea</hi> and <hi>Lena,</hi> do not facilitate the communication half ſo well by their courſe, nor are they half ſo practicable as the <hi>American</hi> rivers. To this I ſhall only add the obſervation of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> in his <hi>Prince,</hi> that a government ſeldom long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves its dominion over thoſe who are foreigners to it; who on the other hand fall with great eaſe, and continue inſeparably annex'd to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own nation, which he proves by the fate of the <hi>Engliſh conqueſts</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet with all theſe diſadvantages, ſo difficult is it to overturn an eſtabliſhed government, that it was not without the aſſiſtance of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that the <hi>United Provinces</hi> ſupported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: which teaches us, that if the viſionary dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of independence in our colonies is to be feared, nothing is more likely to render it ſubſtantial than the neighbourhood of foreigners at enmity with the ſovereign government, capable of giving either aid or an aſylum, as the event ſhall require. Yet againſt even theſe diſadvantages, did <hi>Spain</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve almoſt ten provinces, merely through their want of union, which indeed could never have taken place among the others, but for cauſes, ſome
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:008601_0043_102F96DAA0F8DB60"/>
of which are in our caſe impoſſible, and others it is impious to ſuppoſe poſſible.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> well underſtood that policy which teaches the ſecurity ariſing to the chief government from ſeparate ſtates among the governed, when they reſtored the liberties of the ſtates of <hi>Greece,</hi> (op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed but united under <hi>Macedon</hi>) by an edict that every ſtate ſhould live under its own laws. <note n="*" place="bottom">Omnes Graecorum civitates, quae in Europa, quaeque in Aſia eſſent, libertatem ac ſuas leges haberent, &amp;c. <hi>Liv. lib. 33. c. 30.</hi>
               </note> They did not even name a governor. <hi>Independence of each other, and ſeparate intereſts,</hi> tho' among a people united by common manners, language, and I may ſay religion, inferior neither in wiſdom, bravery, nor their love of liberty to the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, was all the ſecurity the ſovereigns wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their ſovereignty. It is true, they did not call themſelves ſovereigns; they ſet no value on the title; they were contented with poſſeſſing the thing; and poſſeſs it they did, even without a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army. What can be a ſtronger proof of the ſecurity of their poſſeſſion? And yet by a policy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to this throughout, was the <hi>Roman</hi> world ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and held: a world compos'd of above an hundred languages and ſets of manners different from thoſe of their maſters. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſubdu'd <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Illyricum,</hi> they were both form'd into republicks by a decree of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and <hi>Macedon</hi> was thought ſafe from the danger of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, by being divided, into a diviſion common among the <hi>Romans,</hi> as we learn from the tetrarchs in ſcripture. <hi>Omnium primum liberos eſſe placebat Macedonas atque Illyrios; ut omnibus gentibus apareret, arma populi Romani non liberis ſervitutem, ſed contra ſervientibus libertatem afferre.

               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:008601_0044_102F96DC2CF0D260"/>But what is the prudent policy inculcated by the <hi>remarker,</hi> to obtain this end, ſecurity of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over our colonies: It is, to leave the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Canada,</hi> to <hi>"check"</hi> their growth, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our people may
<q>increaſe infinitely from all cauſes.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 50, 51.</note> We have already ſeen in what manner the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians check the growth</hi> of our colonies. 'Tis a modeſt word this, <hi>check,</hi> for maſſacring men, women and children. The wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would, if he could, hide from himſelf as well as from the public, the horror ariſing from ſuch a propoſal, by couching it in general terms: 'tis no wonder he thought it a
<q>ſubject not fit for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion" in his letter, tho' he recommends it as a point that ſhould be the conſtant object of the miniſter's attention!</q>
—But if <hi>Canada</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored on this principle, will not <hi>Britain</hi> be guilty of all the blood to be ſhed, all the murders to be committed in order to check this dreaded growth of our own people?

as it requires their obedience? Is not this the moſt likely means of driving them into the arms of the <hi>French,</hi> who can invite them by an offer of that ſecurity their own government chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not to afford them? I would not be thought to inſinuate that the <hi>remarker</hi> wants humanity. I know how little many good-natured perſons are affected by the diſtreſſes of people at a diſtance and whom they do not know. There are even thoſe, who, being preſent, can ſympathize ſincerely with the grief of a lady on the ſundden death of her fovourite bird, and yet can read of the ſinking of a city in <hi>Syria</hi> with very little concern. If it be, after all, thought neceſſary to <hi>check</hi> the growth of our colonies, give me leave to propoſe a method leſs cruel. It is a method of which we have an example in ſcripture. The murder of huſbands, of wives, of brothers, ſiſters and children, whoſe pleaſing ſociety has been for ſome time enjoyed, affects deeply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſurviving relations: but grief for the death of a child juſt born is ſhort and eaſily ſupported. The method I mean is that which was dictated by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> policy, when the "infinite increaſe" of the <hi>children of Iſrael</hi> was apprehended as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the ſtate.<note n="*" place="bottom">And <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſaid unto his people, behold the people of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are more and mightier than we; come on, let us deal <hi>wiſely</hi> with them; <hi>leſt they multiply</hi> and it come to paſs that when there falleth out any war, they join alſo unto our enemies and fight againſt us, and ſo get them up out of the land. —And the king ſpake to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> midwives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </note> Let an act of parliament, then be made, enjoining the colony midwives to ſtifle in the birth every third or fourth child.

for <hi>checking</hi> their growth, I dare anſwer for them, they would prefer the latter.</p>
            <p>But all this debate about the propriety or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of keeping or reſtoring <hi>Canada,</hi> is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly too early. We have taken the capital indeed, but the country is yet far from being in our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and perhaps never will be: for if our M—rs are perſuaded by ſuch counſellors as the <hi>remarker,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> there are "not the worſt of neighbours," and that if we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Canada,</hi> we ought for our own ſakes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, as a <hi>check</hi> to the growth of our colonies, I am then afraid we ſhall never take it. For there are many ways of avoiding the completion of the conqueſt, that will be leſs exceptionable and leſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious than the giving it up.</p>
            <p>The objection I have often heard, that if we had <hi>Canada,</hi> we could not people it without draining <hi>Britain</hi> of its inhabitants, is founded on ignorance of the nature of population in new countries. When we firſt began to colonize in <hi>America,</hi> it was neceſſary to ſend people, and to ſend ſeed-corn; but it is not now neceſſary that we ſhould furniſh, for a new colony, either one or the other. The annual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement alone of our preſent colonies, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing their numbers, or requiring a man from hence, is ſufficient in ten years to fill <hi>Canada</hi> with double the number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> that it now has of <hi>French</hi> inhabitants. <note n="*" place="bottom">In fact, there has not gone from <hi>Britain</hi> to our colonies theſe 20 years paſt, to ſettle there, ſo many as 10 families a year; the new ſettlers are either the offspring of the old, or emigrants from <hi>Germany</hi> or the north of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> Thoſe who are proteſtants among the <hi>French,</hi> will probably chuſe to remain under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> government; many will chuſe to remove, if they can be allowed to ſell their lands, improvements and effects: the reſt in that thin-ſettled

country, will in leſs than half a century, from the crouds of <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettling round and among them, be blended and incorporated with our people both in language and manners.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> the caſe is ſomewhat different; and though I am far from thinking <note n="*" place="bottom">Remark, p. 30, 34.</note> we have ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land enough <note n="†" place="bottom">It is often ſaid we have plenty of ſugar-land ſtill unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in <hi>Jamaica:</hi> but thoſe who are all well acquainted with that iſland, know, that the remaining vacant land in it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſituated among mountains, rocks and gullies, that make carriage impractiable, ſo that no profitable uſe can be made of it unleſs the price of ſugars ſhould ſo greatly increaſe as to enable the planter to make very expenſive roads, by blowing up rocks, erecting bridges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every 2 or 300 yards.</note>, I cannot think <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable an increaſe of it, as other objects the enemy would probably be infinitely more ready to part with. A country <hi>fully inhabited</hi> by any nation is no proper poſſeſſion for another of different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, manners and religion. It is hardly ever tenable at leſs expence than it is worth,—But the iſle of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> and its appendix <hi>Equinoctial-France,</hi> would indeed be an acquiſition every way ſuitable to our ſituation and deſires. This would hold all that migrate from <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> the <hi>Leeward Iſlands,</hi> or <hi>Jamaica.</hi> It would certainly recal into an <hi>Engliſh</hi> government (in which there would be room for millions) all who have before ſettled or purchaſed in <hi>Martineco, Guadaloupe, Santa-Cruz</hi> or <hi>St. John's;</hi> except ſuch as know not the value of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> government, and ſuch I am ſure are not worth recalling.</p>
            <p>But ſhould we keep <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> we are told it would enable us to export <hi>£.</hi> 300,000 in ſugars. Admit it to be true, though perhaps the amazing increaſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſumption might ſtop moſt of it here, to whoſe profit is this to redound? to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:008601_0048_102F96E9E4847708"/>
the profit of the <hi>French</hi> inhabitants of the iſland: except a ſmall part that ſhould fall to the ſhare of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> purchaſers, but whoſe whole purchaſe-money muſt firſt be added to the wealth and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant, however, much of this £. 300,000 would be expended in <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, too, a few of the land-owners of <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> might dwell and ſpend their fortunes in <hi>Britain,</hi> (though probably much fewer than of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>North America</hi>). I admit the advantage ariſing to us from theſe circumſtances, (as far as they go) in the caſe of <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> as well as in that of our other <hi>Weſt India</hi> ſettlements. Yet even this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is little better than that of an allied na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be, who ſhould take our manufactures and ſupply us with ſugar, and put us to no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in defending the place of growth.</p>
            <p>But though our own colonies expend among us almoſt the whole produce of our ſugar, <note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 47.</note> can we or ought we to promiſe ourſelves this will be the caſe of <hi>Guadaloupe.</hi> One 100,000 £. will ſupply them with <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures; and ſuppoſing we can effectually prevent the introduction of thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> (which is morally impoſſible in a country uſed to them) the other 200,000 will ſtill be ſpent in <hi>France,</hi> in the education of their children and ſupport of themſelves; or elſe be laid up there, where they will always think their home to be.</p>
            <p>Beſides this conſumption of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, much is ſaid of the benefit we ſhall have from the ſituation of <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> and we are told of a trade to the <hi>Caraccas</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Main.</hi> In what reſpect <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> is better ſituated for this trade than <hi>Jamaica,</hi> or even any of our other iſlands, I am at a loſs to gueſs.

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:008601_0049_102F96EFE1B42898"/>
not ſo well ſituated for that of the windward coaſt, as <hi>Tobago</hi> and <hi>St. Lucia,</hi> which in this as well as other reſpects, would be more valuable poſſeſſions, and which, I doubt not, the peace will ſecure to us. Nor is it nearly ſo well ſituated for that of the reſt of the <hi>Spaniſh Main</hi> as <hi>Jamaica.</hi> As to the greater ſafety of our trade by the poſſeſſion of <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> experience was convinced us that in reducing a ſingle iſland, or even more, we ſtop the privateer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſineſs but little. Privateers ſtill ſubſiſt in equal if not greater numbers, and carry the veſſels into <hi>Martinico</hi> which before it was more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to carry into <hi>Guadaloupe.</hi> Had we all the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbees,</hi> it is true, they would in thoſe parts be without ſhelter. Yet upon the whole I ſuppoſe it to be a doubtful point and well worth conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether our obtaining poſſeſſion of all the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbees,</hi> would be more than a temporary benefit, as it would neceſſarily ſoon fill the <hi>French</hi> part of <hi>Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniola</hi> with <hi>French</hi> inhabitants, and thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it five times more valuable in time of peace, and little leſs than impregnable in time of war; and would probably end in a few years in the uniting the whole of that great and fertile iſland under a <hi>French</hi> government. It is agreed on all hands, that our conqueſt of <hi>St. Chriſtopher's,</hi> and driving the <hi>French</hi> from thence, firſt furniſh'd <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> with ſkilful and ſubſtantial planters, and was conſequently the firſt occaſion of its preſent opulence. On the other hand, I will hazard an opinion, that valuable as the <hi>French</hi> poſſeſſions in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> are, and undeniable the advantages they derive from them, there is ſomewhat to be weighed in the oppoſite ſcale. They cannot at preſent make war with <hi>England,</hi> without expoſing thoſe advantages while divided among the numerous iſlands they now have, much more than they would, were they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed

of <hi>St. Domingo</hi> only; their own ſhare of which would, if well cultivated, grow more ſugar, than is now grown in all their <hi>Weſt India</hi> iſlands.</p>
            <p>I have before ſaid I do not deny the utility of the conqueſt, or even of our future poſſeſſion of <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> if not bought to dear. The trade of the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> is one of our moſt valuable trades. Our poſſeſſions there deſerve our greateſt care and attention. So do thoſe of <hi>North America.</hi> I ſhall not enter into the invidious taſk of comparing their due eſtimation. It would be a very long and a very diſagreeable one, to run thro' every thing material on this head. It is enough to our preſent point, if I have ſhown, that the value of <hi>North America</hi> is capable of an immenſe increaſe, by an acquiſition and meaſures, that muſt neceſſarily have an effect the direct contrary of what we have been induſtriouſly taught to fear; and that <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe</hi> is, in point of advantage, but a very ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to our <hi>Weſt India</hi> poſſeſſions, rendered many ways leſs valuable to us than it is to the <hi>French,</hi> who will probably ſet more value upon it than upon a country that is much more valuable to us than to them.</p>
            <p>There is a great deal more to be ſaid on all the parts of theſe ſubjects; but as it would carry me into a detail that I fear would tire the patience of my readers, and which I am not without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions I have done already, I ſhall reſerve what remains till I dare venture again on the indulgence of the publick.</p>

TABLES of the proportion of marriages to births, of deaths to births, of marriages to the numbers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> formed on obſervations made upon the bills of mortality, chriſtenings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of populous cities, will not ſuit countries; nor will tables formed on obſervations made on full ſettled old countries, as <hi>Europe,</hi> ſuit new countries, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For people increaſe in proportion to the number of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and that is greater in proportion to the eaſe and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſupporting a family. When families can be eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, more perſons marry, and earlier in life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In cities, where all trades, occupations and offices are full, many delay marrying, till they can ſee how to bear the charges of a family; which charges are greater in cities, as luxury is more common; many live ſingle during life, and continue ſervants to families, journeymen to trades, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hence cities do not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural generation ſupply themſelves with inhabitants; the deaths are more than the births.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In countries full ſettled, the caſe muſt be nearly the ſame; all lands being occupied and improved to the heighth; thoſe who cannot get land, muſt labour for others that have it; when labourers are plenty, their wages will be low; by low wages a family is ſupported with difficulty; this difficulty deters many from marriage, who therefore long continue ſervants and ſingle.— Only as the cities take ſupplies of people from the country, and thereby make a little more room in the country, marriage is a little more encouraged there, and the births exceed the deaths.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Great part of <hi>Europe</hi> is full ſettled with huſbandmen, manufacturers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore cannot now much increaſe in people: <hi>America</hi> is chiefly occupied by <hi>Indians,</hi> who ſubſiſt moſtly by hunting.—But as the hunter, of all men, requires the greateſt quantity of land from whence to draw his ſubſiſtence, (the huſbandmen ſubſiſting on much leſs, the Gardener on ſtill
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:008601_0052_102F96F7D3C245F8"/>
leſs, and the manufacturer requiring leaſt of all) the <hi>Europeans</hi> found <hi>America</hi> as fully ſettled as it well could be by hunters; yet theſe having large tracts, were eaſily prevailed on to part with portions of territory to the new comers, who did not much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the natives in hunting, and furniſhed them with many things they wanted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Land being thus plenty in <hi>America,</hi> and ſo cheap as that a labouring man, that underſtands huſbandry, can in a ſhort time ſave money enough to purchaſe a piece of new land ſufficient for a plantation, whereon he may ſubſiſt a family; ſuch are not afraid to marry; for if they even look far enough forward to conſider how their children when grown up are to be provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, they ſee that more land is to be had at rates euually eaſy, all cirmcumſtances conſidered.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Hence marriages in <hi>America</hi> are more general, and more generally early, than in <hi>Europe.</hi> And if it is reckoned there, that there is but one marriage <hi>per annum</hi> among 100 perſons, perhaps we may here reckon two; and if in <hi>Europe</hi> they have but four births to a marriage (many of their marriages being late) we may here reckon eight; of which if one half grow up, and our marriages are made, reckoning one with another, at twenty years of age, our people muſt at leaſt be doubled every twenty years.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But notwithſtanding this increaſe, ſo vaſt is the territory of <hi>North America,</hi> that it will require many ages to ſettle it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and till it is fully ſettled, labour will never be cheap here, where no man continues long a labourer for others, but gets a plantation of his own; no man continues long a journeyman to a trade, but goes among thoſe new ſettlers, and ſets up for himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence labour is no cheaper now, in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> than it was thirty years ago, tho' ſo many thouſand labouring people have been imported from <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. The danger therefore of theſe colonies interfering with their mother country in trades that depend on labour, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is too remote to require the attention of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. But in proportion to the increaſe of the colonies, a vaſt demand is growing for <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures; a glorious market wholly in the power of <hi>Britain,</hi> in which foreigners cannot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere, which will increaſe in a ſhort time even beyond her power of ſupplying, tho' her whole trade ſhould be to her colonies.* * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p n="12">12. 'Tis an ill-grounded opinion that by the labour of ſlaves, <hi>America</hi> may poſſibly vie in cheapneſs of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with <hi>Britain.</hi> The Labour of ſlaves can never be ſo cheap here as the labour of working men is in <hi>Britain.</hi> Any one may compute it. Intereſt of money is in the colonies from 6 to 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Slaves one with another coſt 30 <abbr>

Reckon then the intereſt of the firſt purchaſe of a ſlave, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance or riſque on his life, his cloathing and diet, expences in his ſickneſs and loſs of time, loſs by his neglect of buſineſs (neglect is natural to the man who is not to be benefited by his own care or diligence) expence of a driver to keep him at work, and his pilfering from time to time, almoſt every ſlave being from the nature of ſlavery a thief, and compare the whole amount with the wages of a manufacturer of iron or wool in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> you will ſee that labour is much cheaper there than it ever can be by negroes here. Why then will <hi>Americans</hi> purchaſe ſlaves? Becauſe ſlaves may be kept as long as a man pleaſes, or has occaſion for their labour; while hired men are continually leaving their matter (often in the midſt of his buſineſs) and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up for themſelves. § 8.</p>
            <p n="13">13. As the increaſe of people depends on the encouragement of marriages, the following things muſt diminiſh a nation, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The being conquered; for the conquerors will engroſs as many offices, and exact as much tribute or profit on the labour of the conquered, as will maintain them in their new eſtabliſhment; and this diminiſhing the ſubſiſtence of the natives, diſcourages their marriages, and ſo gradually diminiſhes them, while the foreigners increaſe. 2. Loſs of territory. Thus the <hi>Britons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven into <hi>Wales,</hi> and crouded together in a barren coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try inſufficient to ſupport ſuch great numbers, diminiſhed till the people bore a proportion to the produce, while the <hi>Saxons</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed on their abandoned lands, till the iſland became full of <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> now driven into <hi>Wales</hi> by ſome foreign nation, there would in a few years be no more <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> than there are now people in <hi>Wales.</hi> 3. Loſs of trade. Manufactures exported, draw ſubſiſtence from foreign countries for numbers; who are thereby enabled to marry and raiſe families. If the nation be deprived of any branch of trade, and no new employment is found for the people occupy'd in that branch, it will ſoon be deprived of ſo many people. 4. Loſs of food. Suppoſe a nation has a fiſhery, which not only employs great numbers, but makes the food and ſubſiſtence of the people cheaper: if another nation becomes matter of the ſeas, and prevents the fiſhery, the people will diminiſh in proportion as the loſs of employ, and dearneſs of proviſion makes it more difficult to ſubſiſt a family. 5. Bad government and inſecure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. People not only leave ſuch a country, and ſettling abroad incorporate with other nations, loſe their native language, and become foreigners; but the induſtry of thoſe that remain being diſcouraged, the quantity of ſubſiſtence in the country is leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſupport of a family becomes more difficult. So heavy taxes tend to diminiſh a people. 6. The introduction of ſlaves. The negroes brought into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſugar iſlands,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:008601_0054_102F9701D9ACEFE0"/>
have greatly diminiſhed the whites there; the poor are by this means deprived of employment, while a few families acquire vaſt eſtates, which they ſpend on foreign luxuries, and educating their children in the habit of thoſe luxuries; the ſame income is needed for the ſupport of one, that might have maintained one hundred. The whites, who have ſlaves, not labouring, are enfeebled, and therefore not ſo generally prolific; the ſlaves being worked too hard, and ill fed, their conſtitutions are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the deaths among them are more than their births; ſo that a continual ſupply is needed from <hi>Africa.</hi> The northern colonies having few ſlaves, encreaſe in whites. Slaves alſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorate the families that uſe them; the white children become proud, diſguſted with labour, and being educated in idleneſs, are rendered unfit to get a living by induſtry.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Hence the prince that acquires new territory, if he finds it vacant, or removes the natives to give his own people room; the legiſlator that makes effectual laws for promoting of trade, increaſing employment, improving land by more or better tillage, providing more food by fiſheries, ſecuring property, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the man that invents new trades, arts or manufactures, or new improvements in huſbandry, may be properly called <hi>Fathers of their Nation,</hi> as they are the cauſe of the generation of multitudes, by the encouragement they afford to marriage.</p>
            <p n="15">15. As to privileges granted to the married, (ſuch as the <hi>jus trium liberorum</hi> among the <hi>Romans</hi>) they may haſten the filling of a country that has been thinned by war or peſtilence, or that has otherwiſe vacant territory, but cannot increaſe a people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the means provided for their ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Foreign luxuries and needleſs manufactures imported and uſed in a nation, do, by the ſame reaſoning, increaſe the people of the nation that furniſhes them, and diminiſh the people of the nation that uſes them.—Laws therefore that prevent ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations, and on the contrary promote the exportation of manufactures to be conſumed in foreign countries, may be called (with reſpect to the people that make them) <hi>generative laws,</hi> as by increaſing ſubſiſtence they encourage marriage. Such laws likewiſe ſtrengthen a country doubly, by increaſing its own people and diminiſhing its neighbours.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Some <hi>European</hi> nations prudently refuſe to conſume the manufactures of <hi>Eaſt-India:</hi>—They ſhould likewiſe forbid them to their colonies; for the gain to the merchant is not to be compared with the loſs by this means of people to the nation.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Home luxury in the great increaſes the nation's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers employed by it, who are many, and only tends to diminiſh the families that indulge in it, who are few. The greater the common faſhionable expence of any rank of people, the more cautious they are of marriage. Therefore luxury ſhould never be ſuffered to become common.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:008601_0055_102F970380A6CF20"/>19. The great increaſe of offspring in particular families, is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature, but ſometimes to examples of induſtry in the heads, and induſtrious education; by which the children are enabled to provide better for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their marrying early is encouraged from the proſpect of good ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p n="20">20. If there be a ſect therefore, in our nation, that regard frugality and induſtry as religious duties, and educate their children therein, more than others commonly do; ſuch ſect muſt conſequently increaſe more by natural generation, than any other ſect in <hi>Britain.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="21">21. The importation of foreigners into a country that has as many inhabitants as the preſent employments and proviſions for ſubſiſtence will bear, will be in the end no increaſe of people, unleſs the new comers have more induſtry and frugality than the natives, and then they will provide more ſubſiſtence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the country; but they will gradually eat the natives out.—Nor is it neceſſary to bring in foreigners to fill up any occaſional vacancy in a country; for ſuch vacancy (if the laws are good, § 14, 16) will ſoon be filled by natural generation. Who can now find the vacancy made in <hi>Sweden, France,</hi> or other warlike nations, by the plague of heroiſm 40 years ago; in <hi>France,</hi> by the expulſion of proteſtants; in <hi>England,</hi> by the ſettlement of her colonies; or in <hi>Guinea,</hi> by 100 years exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſlaves that has blackened half <hi>America?</hi>—The thinneſs of the inhabitants in <hi>Spain,</hi> is owing to national pride and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and other cauſes, rather than to the expulſion of the <hi>Moors,</hi> or to the making of new ſettlements.</p>
            <p n="22">22. There is in ſhort no bound to the prolific nature of plants or animals, but what is made by their crowding and interfering with each other's means of ſubſiſtence. Was the face of the earth vacant of other plants, it might be gradually ſowed and overſpread with one kind only; as for inſtance, with Fennel; and were it empty of other inhabitants, it might in a few ages be repleniſhed from one nation only; as for inſtance with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen.</hi> Thus there are ſuppoſed to be now upwards of one Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſouls in <hi>North America,</hi> (tho' 'tis thought ſcarce 80,000 have been brought over ſea) and yet perhaps there is not one the fewer in <hi>Britain,</hi> but rather many more, on account of the employment the colonies afford to manufacturers at home. This million doubling, ſuppoſe but once in 25 years, will in another century be more than the people of <hi>England,</hi> and the greateſt number of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> will be on this ſide the water.</p>
            <p>What an acceſſion of power to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire by ſea as well as land! What increaſe of trade and navigation! What numbers of ſhips and ſeamen! We have been here but little
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:008601_0056_102F97050F0B0748"/>
more than 100 years, and yet the force of our privateers in the late war, united, was greater, both in men and guns, than that of the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> navy in queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time.— How important an affair then to <hi>Britain,</hi> is the preſent treaty <note n="†" place="bottom">1751.</note> for ſettling the bounds between her colonies and the <hi>French,</hi> and how careful ſhould ſhe be to ſecure room enough, ſince on the room depends ſo much the Increaſe of her people?</p>
            <p n="23">23. In fine, a nation well regulated is like a polypus; <note n="‡" place="bottom">A water-inſect, well-known to naturaliſts.</note> take away a limb, its place is ſoon ſupply'd; cut it in two, and each deficient part ſhall ſpeedily grow out of the part remaining. Thus if you have room and ſubſiſtence enough, as you may by dividing, make ten polypuſes out of one, you may of one make ten nations, equally populous and powerful; or rather increaſe a nation tenfold in numbers and ſtrength. * * * * * * * * * *</p>

            <p>AN <hi>Hiſtorical Review</hi> of the Conſtitution and Government of Pensylvania, from its <hi>Origin;</hi> ſo far as regards the ſeveral Points of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy which have, from Time to Time, ariſen between the ſeveral <hi>Governors</hi> of that Province, and their ſeveral <hi>Aſſemblies.</hi> Founded on <hi>authentic Documents.</hi> Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Right Honourable ARTHUR ONSLOW, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Speaker of the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Houſe of COMMONS.</p>
            <q>Thoſe who would give up ESSENTIAL LIBERTY to purchaſe a little TEMPORARY SAFETY, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve neither Liberty nor Safety.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> Dedication <hi>are theſe Words:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Cauſe we bring is in Fact the Cauſe of all the Provinces in one: It is the Cauſe of every Britiſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in every Part of the Britiſh Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions. It is the Cauſe of every Man who deſerves to be free every where.</q>
            </p>
            <q>To the above Quotation from the Dedication, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paragraphs are added, as a Specimen of the Author's Ability to handle and apply thoſe authentic Documents in an accurate and juſt Manner.</q>
            <p>"TO obtain an infinite Variety of Purpoſes, by a few plain Principles, is the Characteriſtic of Nature. As the Eye is affected, ſo is the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Objects at diſtance ſtrike us according to their Dimenſions, or the Quantity of Light thrown upon them; near, according to their Novelty or Familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; as they are in motion or at reſt. 'Tis the ſame
<pb facs="unknown:008601_0060_102F9716963BF0B8"/>
with Actions. A Battle is all Motion; a Hero all Glare: While ſuch Images are before us, we can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to nothing elſe. <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> would make no Figure in the ſame Scene with the King of <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> and we are at preſent ſo loſt in the military Scramble on the Continent <hi>next</hi> us, in which it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed we are deeply intereſted, that we have ſcarce Time to throw a Glance towards <hi>America,</hi> where we have alſo much at Stake, and where, if any where, our Account muſt be made up at laſt. <hi>Introduct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"We love to ſtare more than to reflect, and to be indolently amus'd at our Leiſure, than to commit the ſmalleſt Treſpaſs on our Patience by winding a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tedious Maze, which would pay us in nothing but Knowledge. <hi>Introduction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Surely, to a Nation born to Liberty like This, bound to leave it unimpair'd as they received it from their Fathers in Perpetuity to their Heirs, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in the Conſervation of it in every Appendix of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire, the Particulars of ſuch a Conteſt cannot be wholly indifferent. <hi>Intro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"On the contrary, it is reaſonable to think,the firſt Workings of Power againſt Liberty, and the natural Efforts of unbiaſſed Men to ſecure themſelves againſt the firſt Approaches of Oppreſſion, muſt have a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating Power over every Man of Senſibility and Diſcernment amongſt us. <hi>Introd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"It is a known Cuſtom among Farmers to change their Corn from Seaſon to Seaſon for the Sake of filling the Buſhel: And in Caſe the Wiſdom of the Age ſhould condeſcend to make the like Experiment in another Shape, from hence we may learn, whither to repair for the proper Species. <hi>Intro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Courage, Wiſdom, Integrity and Honour are not to be meaſured by the Sphere aſſigned them to act in, but by the Trials they undergo, and the Vouchers they furniſh: And if ſo manifeſted, need neither Robes or Titles to ſet them off. <hi>Intro.</hi>

            <p>"There is ſomething in Connection and Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which gives a ſecret Biaſs to all we think and with, as well as what we ſay: And in all Diſputes this muſt be duly allowed for on both Sides.</p>
            <p>"Men who want a preſent Convenience muſt not be over-ſolicitous about future Contingencies; and, in general, we chuſe to be blind to ſuch Obſtacles as we fear we have not Strength enough to remove.</p>

            <p>"Power, like Water, is ever working its own Way; and wherever it can find or make an Opening, is altogether as prone to overflow whatever is ſubject to it.</p>
            <p>"And tho' Matter of Right overlooked, may be reclaimed and re-aſſumed at any Time, it cannot be too ſoon reclaimed and re-aſſumed.</p>
            <p>"To unite the Subtilty of the Serpent with the Innocence of the Dove, is not ſo eaſily done as ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Speaking of a Party-Diſpute, the Author ſays—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Thus Heat kindled Heat: Animoſity excited Animoſity: And each Party reſolving to be always in the Right, were often both in the Wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Speaking in Juſtification of the Conduct of the ſeveral Aſſemblies, in a certain Diſpute, he ſays,</hi> "Men they were: Paſſions and Intereſts they conſequently had: And if they were ſometimes carried away a little too far by them, it is obvious the Paſſions and Intereſts of others worked up the Ferment firſt, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lented to the laſt.</p>
            <p>"It is true, an over-rigid Performance of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is not to be expected of Government, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can be exacted from it. But then if the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Part is not tenacious, almoſt to a Fault, of the Rights and Claims of a People, they will in a Courſe of Time loſe their very Pretenſions to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He alſo affirms,</hi> that "Of all political Cements, Reciprocal Intereſt is the ſtrongeſt: And the Subjects Money is never ſo well diſpoſed of as in the Mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Order and Tranquility, and the Purchaſe of good Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Towards the Concluſion are the following Paragraphs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"The TRUE STATE of <hi>Penſylvania</hi> is now before us.—It is apparent the Aſſemblies of that Province have acted from the Beginning on the <hi>defenſive only:</hi> The Defenſive is what every Man, by the Right and Law of Nature, is intitled to.— Jealouſy is the firſt Principle of Defence: If Men were not to ſuſpect, they would rarely, if ever, be upon their Guard. — <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is apparently founded upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; nay, provides, That Oppoſition ſhould be always at Hand to confront and obviate Danger.— <hi>Penn,</hi> the Founder of the Colony, founded it upon <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> And, as we have ſeen, the Birth-Rights of his Followers were rather enlarged than
<pb facs="unknown:008601_0062_102F9719B1F09778"/>
diminiſhed by his Inſtitutions.— That the latter Part of his active Life, therefore, was employed in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining his own Foundations, only ſerves to excite our Concern, That ſo few ſhould be of a Piece with themſelves; and to make him anſwerable in Part for the Treſpaſſes of his Heirs.</p>
            <p>"Fatally verified, however, we ſee, both there and every where elſe, the Fable of the <hi>Ax,</hi> which having been gratified with as much Wood only as would ſerve it for a Handle, became immediately the Inſtrument to hew down the Foreſt, Root and Branch, from whence it was taken.</p>
            <p>"It is as apparent, on the other Hand, That theſe <hi>Proprietaries</hi> have acted an <hi>offenſive Part;</hi> have ſet up unwarrantable Claims; have adhered to them by Inſtructions yet more unwarrantable; have availed themſelves of the Dangers and Diſtreſſes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and made it their Buſineſs (at leaſt their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have) to increaſe the Terrors of the Times, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to unhinge the preſent Syſtem; and, by the Dint of Aſſumptions, Snares, Menaces, Aſperſions, Tumults, and every other unfair Practice whatſoever, would have either bullied or wheadled the Inhabitants out of the Privileges they were born to: Nay, they have actually avowed this perfidious Purpoſe, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowing and diſperſing thoſe Pamphlets in which the ſaid Privileges are inſolently, wickedly, and fooliſhly pronounced repugnant to Government, the Sources of Confuſion; and ſuch as, having anſwered the great End of cauſing an expeditious Settlement, for which alone they were granted, might be reſumed at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as incompatible with the <hi>Dictatorial</hi> Power they now challenge and would fain exerciſe.</p>
            <p>"And This being the Truth, the plain Truth, and Nothing but the Truth, there is no need to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Cenſures of the Public; which, on proper Information, are always ſure to fall in the right Place.</p>
            <p>"The Parties before them are the <hi>Two Proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of a <hi>Province,</hi> and the <hi>Province</hi> itſelf.—And Who or What are theſe <hi>Proprietaries?</hi> In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince unſizeable Subjects and unſufficient Lords.— At Home, Gentlemen, 'tis true, but Gentlemen ſo very private, that in the Herd of Gentry they are hardly to be found:—Not in Court; not in Office; not in Parliament.</p>
            <p>"And which is of moſt Conſequence to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity;</hi> Whether <hi>their private Eſtate</hi> ſhall be <hi>taxed,</hi> or the <hi>Province</hi> ſhall be <hi>ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:008601_0063_102F971B4391AE58"/>"Whether theſe Two private Gentlemen, in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their <hi>abſolute Proprietaryſhip,</hi> ſhall convert ſo many <hi>Fellow-Subjects,</hi> born as free as themſelves, into <hi>Vaſſals?</hi> Or, Whether ſo noble and uſeful a <hi>Province</hi> ſhall for ever remain an <hi>Aſylum</hi> for all that wiſh to remain as free as the Inhabitants of it have, hitherto, made a Shift to preſerve themſelves?</p>
