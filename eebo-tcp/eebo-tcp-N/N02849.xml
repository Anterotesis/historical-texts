         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE <hi>New-England</hi> Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>PON my ſearching for Materials for our Chronology, the <hi>following Piece</hi> with others coming to hand; I cannot but think it worthy of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick View. Not that I ſuppoſe it will pleaſe the Eye of the politer World: But becauſe it gives a ſtrong and lively Image of the extraordinary pious Spirit and Deſign of thoſe <hi>Engliſh People,</hi> who firſt came over and dwelt in this <hi>Indian Wilderneſs;</hi> and in every ſerious Mind cannot but raiſe a Veneration for them, and a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to review their bright Examples.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> was One among them; an Eye-witneſs of the things he writes of; and by the publick and continued Eſteem his Country paid him in his Day, his Teſtimony comes with Power upon us; and the Style ſo plain and natural, that in the Reading, it ſeems as if we came over with Him, and were living in thoſe pious Times.</p>
            <p>He ſhows the mighty Spirit of Love to GOD and Zeal for his <hi>inſtituted Worſhip</hi> that mov'd &amp; wrought in our Predeceſſors: How heavenly-minded, how humble, and how contented under all the Straits and Difficulties of a new Plantation, at ſo great a Diſtance from any humane Succour.</p>
            <p>He was deſirous that GOD ſhould have the Glory of his Providence, in bringing Him with ſo many pious People into this hideous Land, in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving &amp; ſupplying them, increaſing, proſpering,
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003403_0004_1003155583A7EDA8"/>
and working wonderful Salvations for them. And he was greatly concerned that <hi>Poſterity,</hi> and eſpecially his own, ſhould both <hi>know</hi> theſe things and <hi>walk</hi> in the good ways of their Forefathers: To this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He therefore moſt pathetically charges and commands them; warning them of Evil, and relating his own Experience for their Direction and Encouragement.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Account ſubjoined</hi> is drawn by another hand: and tho't adviſeable to be Publiſhed alſo; that his Offspring may know the religious Anceſtor from whom they come, and their awful Obligations to fear and ſerve the GOD of their Fathers.</p>
            <p>And on this Occaſion, I can't but recommend to our grave and pious <hi>Heads of Houſholds,</hi> the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Practice of <hi>Leaving in Writing</hi> their ſolemn Charges to their Poſterity: That when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſpeak and live no more on Earth, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after them may frequently review both their Examples and Inſtructions, and preſerve them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their Minds. I can't but think that this, with the Divine Bleſſing would be an happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of preventing the Declenſion of many Families, and of keeping alive the things that remain among us, and are ready to Die. And methinks, as every pious <hi>Father</hi> would in a lawful way deſire to ſpeak to his Children after his Deceaſe; He can do no leſs for the Preſervation of the Life of Religion, and for the Souls of his ſurviving Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. His oral Counſels are too like the Wind, which quickly paſſes: But impreſs'd in written Monuments, remain to excite them every Day; and if neglected, to witneſs againſt them.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thought good, my dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to leave with you ſome Account of God's remarkable <hi>Providences</hi> to me, in bringing me into this Land, and placing me here among his dear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and in his Houſe, who am moſt unworthy of the leaſt of his Mercies. The Scripture requireth us to tell God's wondrous Works to our Children, that they may tell them to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that God may have Glory throughout all Ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was Born in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Sallcom</hi> in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1609. My Father was a Man fearing God, and in good eſteem among God's faithful Servants: His outward Eſtate was not great; I think not above <hi>Eighty Pounds</hi> per <hi>Annum.</hi> We were <hi>Five Brethren</hi> (of which I was the youngeſt) and <hi>Two Siſters.</hi> God was
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003403_0006_1003155897D24FF8"/>
graciouſly pleaſed to breathe by his holy Spirit (I hope) in all our Hearts, if in mine; which I am not altogether without hopes of. <hi>Four</hi> of us <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> lived at <hi>home</hi>: I did deſire my dear Father (my dear Mother being dead) that I might live <hi>abroad,</hi> which he conſented to: So I firſt went for tryal to live with a worthy Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Southcot,</hi> who lived about <hi>Three Miles</hi> from the City of <hi>Exon.</hi> He was careful to keep a Godly Family. There being but a very mean Preacher in that Place, we went every Lord's-Day into the <hi>City,</hi> where were many famous Preachers of the Word of God. I then took ſuch a liking unto the Revd. Mr. <hi>John Warham,</hi> that I did deſire to live near him: So I removed (with my Father's Conſent) into the <hi>City,</hi> and lived with one Mr. <hi>Moſſiour,</hi> as famous a Family for Religion as ever I knew: He kept Seven or Eight Men, and divers Maid-Servants; and he had a Conference up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Queſtion propounded once a Week in his own Family: With him I Covenanted. I never ſo much as heard of <hi>New-England</hi> until I heard of many godly Perſons that were going there, and that Mr. <hi>Warham</hi> was to go alſo. My Maſter asked me whether I would go? I told him were I not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged unto him I would willingly go: He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, that ſhould be no hindrance, I might go for him or for my ſelf which I would. I then wrote to my Father who lived about <hi>Twelve Miles</hi> off, to Intreat his leave to go to <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; who was ſo much diſpleaſed at firſt, that he wrote me no Anſwer, but told my Brethren that I ſhould not go. Having no Anſwer, I went and made my Requeſt to him, and God ſo Inclined his Heart, that he never ſaid me Nay: For now God ſent the Reverend Mr. <hi>Maverick,</hi> who lived <hi>Forty
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003403_0007_10030526094F8F68"/>
Miles</hi> off, a Man I never ſaw before: He having heard of me, came to my Father's Houſe, and my Father agreed that I ſhould be with him and come under his Care, which I did accordingly.</p>
            <p>Mind by what I have already expreſſed, That it was God that did draw me by his Providence out of my Father's Family, and weaned me from it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; It was God put it into my Heart to incline to Live abroad; and it was God that made my Father willing. God by his Providence brought me near Mr. <hi>Warham,</hi> and inclined my Heart to his Miniſtry: God by his Providence moved the Heart of my Maſter <hi>Moſſiour</hi> to ask me whether I would go to <hi>New-England</hi>: It was God by his Providence that made me willing to leave my dear Father, and dear Brethren and Siſters, my dear Friends and Country: It was God that made my Father willing upon the firſt Motion I made in Perſon, to let me go: It was God that ſent Mr. <hi>Maverick</hi> that pious Miniſter to me, who was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, to ſeek me out that I might come hither. So God brought me out of <hi>Plymouth</hi> the 20th of <hi>March</hi> in the Year, 1620, 30, and landed me in Health at <hi>Nantasket</hi> on the 30th of <hi>May.</hi> 1630, I being then about the Age of <hi>Twenty one</hi> Years. <hi>Bleſſed be God that brought me Here</hi>!</p>
            <p>Now coming into this Country, I found it a vacant Wilderneſs, in reſpect of <hi>Engliſh.</hi> There were indeed ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Solem,</hi> and ſome few at <hi>Charlſtown,</hi> who were very deſtitute when we came aſhore; and Planting Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt, ſhortly after Proviſion was not to be had for Money. I wrote to my Friends, namely to my dear Father to ſend me ſome Proviſion, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did; and alſo gave order to one of his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003403_0008_1003155A7367AEE8"/>
Neighbours to ſupply me with what I needed (he being a Seaman) who coming hither ſupplied me with divers things. But before this Supply came, yea and after too (that being ſpent) and the then unſubdued Wilderneſs yielding little Food, many a Time if I could have filled my Belly, tho' with mean Victuals, it would have been ſweet unto me. <hi>Fiſh</hi> was a good help unto me, and others. <hi>Bread</hi> was ſo very ſcarce, that ſometimes I tho't the very Cruſts of my Father's Table would have been very ſweet unto me. And when I could have <hi>Meal &amp; Water and Salt</hi> boiled together, it was ſo good, who could wiſh better?</p>
            <p>I took Notice of it, as a great Favour of God unto me, not only to preſerve my Life, but to give me Contentedneſs in all theſe Straits; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I do not remember that ever I did wiſh in my Heart that I had not come into this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or wiſh my ſelf back again to my Father's Houſe: Yea I was ſo far from that, that I wiſhed and adviſed ſome of my dear Brethren to come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo; which accordingly <hi>one</hi> of my Brothers and thoſe <hi>two</hi> that married my <hi>two</hi> Siſters, ſold their Means and came hither. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt was ſo plainly held out in the Preaching of the Goſpel unto poor loſt Sinners, and the abſolute Neceſſity of the <hi>New Birth,</hi> and God's holy Spirit in thoſe Days was pleaſed to accompany the Word with ſuch Efficacy upon the Hearts of many; that our Hearts were taken off from <hi>Old-England</hi> and ſet upon <hi>Heaven.</hi> The Diſcourſe, not only of the Aged, but of the Youth alſo, was not, <hi>How ſhall we go to</hi> England? (tho' ſome few did not only ſo Diſcourſe, but alſo went back again) but <hi>How ſhall we go to Heaven? Have I true Grace
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003403_0009_1003155F13431F30"/>
wrought in my Heart? Have I</hi> Chriſt <hi>or no?</hi> O how did Men and Women, young and old, Pray for Grace, beg for <hi>Chriſt</hi> in thoſe Days; and it was not in vain: Many were Converted, and others eſtabliſhed in Believing: many joined unto the ſeveral Churches where they lived, confeſſing their Faith publickly, and ſhewing before all the Aſſembly their Experiences of the Workings of God's Spirit in their Hearts to bring them to <hi>Chriſt</hi>: which many Hearers found very much Good by, to help them to try their own Hearts, and to conſider how it was with them; whether any work of God's Spirit were wrought in their own Hearts or no? Oh the many Tears that have been ſhed in <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> Meeting-Houſe at ſuch times, both by thoſe that have declared God's Work on their Souls, and alſo by thoſe that heard them. In thoſe days, <hi>God, even our own God,</hi> did <hi>Bleſs</hi> New-England. I find by what I heard from thoſe that have publickly declared what God had done for their Souls in bringing them unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith, that God doth work divers ways upon the Hearts of Men, even as it pleaſes him; upon ſome more ſenſibly, and upon others more inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; verifying that Text in the 3d Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> 8th Verſe, <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> Tho' we may hear the Sound of it, that is, be ſenſible that the Spirit works, or has been at work; yet not know whence it comes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If ever there were the Work of Grace wrought ſavingly in my Heart; the Time when, the Place where, the manner how, was never ſo apparent unto me, as ſome in their Relations ſay it hath been unto them.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003403_0010_100315624DD90F28"/>I ſhall hint a little unto you what I have found. I remember God did long ago convince me of my Sin, (I cannot tell you how) and alſo of a corrupt Nature, whereby I feel my ſelf prone to Sin. I had in my younger Days a love to Sin; and had it not been for the Fear of Hell, and of my Parents and Friends, I doubtleſs ſhould have been as Vile as the worſt of Men. The Care &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of my dear Friends, by the Reſtraining Grace of God, kept me from committing of thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Abominations that ſome fell into; yet am I not thereby Juſtified. I had ſuch a love to Play with Children and Youth, that I did too often Play with them upon the Lord's-Day, if I could hide it from my dear Relatives. But God was pleaſed to make my Conſcience to be out of quiet, which made me Pray to God many Times in Secret; yet I had a Love to the Pleaſure of Sin, and did love to ſee others Play though it were on the Lord's Day. But on a Time on the Lord's-Day, when I was ſtanding by, and ſeeing ſome Youths Play, they gave me thoſe <hi>Points</hi> which they played for, to hold for them until their Game was out; and my Conſcience not being quiet, God brought that ſaying of <hi>Saul,</hi> afterwards <hi>Paul,</hi> to my Mind, who did acknowledge that he was guilty of the Death of <hi>Stephen; for he ſtood by, and kept the Garments of them that ſlew him</hi>: I then put down that which I had in keeping for them, and went away; and God did help me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to delight more in Them that fear'd him. I did often go to hear the Word of God preached, with my Brethren and others abroad, when we had no Preaching at home; and God inclined my Heart to love thoſe that fear'd him. That Text in

               <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> and in <hi>Families</hi>; and ſound, godly, learned Men for the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and others that were very precious Men and Women, who came in the Year 1630. Them that came then were MAGISTRATES; Men of Renown were, Mr. <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp</hi> Governour, Mr. <hi>Dudley,</hi> Deputy Governour, Sir <hi>Richard Saltonſtall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ludlow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nowel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi>: Mr. <hi>Endicott</hi> came before, and others came then, beſides thoſe named.

            <p>Then in thoſe Days did God manifeſt his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence among us, in converting many Souls, in gathering his dear Ones into Church-Fellowſhip each with other, by ſolemn Covenants; wherein they gave up themſelves and their Seed to the Lord, chooſing Him to be their God, who hath freely promiſed ſo to be, and to our Seed for ever, if we &amp; they do not forſake him.

Him; and He will never fail you nor forſake you. In thoſe Days great was the Tranquillity &amp; Peace of this poor Country: And there was great Love one to another: very ready to help each other; <hi>not ſeeking their own, but every one another's Wealth.</hi> Then Sin did not ſo openly abound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: Drunkenneſs, Adultery, Fornication, Oppreſſion, and abominable Pride which now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds among us, and threatens our Ruin, was then loathſome almoſt in every ones Eyes. Then God did Bleſs us in the Fruits of the Earth, but eſpecially in ſpiritual Things; many Souls were converted to God, and very often many added to the Churches.</p>
            <p>But this glorious Work of God towards his People here was ſoon maligned by Satan; and he caſt into the Minds of ſome corrupt Perſons very erronious Opinions, which did breed great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance in the Churches. And he puffed up his Inſtruments with horrible Pride, inſomuch that they would oppoſe the Truth of God delivered Publickly: and ſome times, yea moſt times they would do it by way of Query, as if they deſired to be informed: but they did indeed accuſe <hi>our godly Miniſters</hi> of not preaching Goſpel, ſaying they were <hi>Legal Preachers,</hi> but themſelves were for <hi>free Grace,</hi> and Miniſters did Preach a <hi>Covenant of Works</hi>; which was a falſe Aſperſion on them. The Truth was, they would willingly have lived in Sin, and encouraged others ſo to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet think to be ſaved by Chriſt, becauſe his Grace is free; forgetting (it ſeems) that thoſe whom Chriſt doth ſave from <hi>Hell,</hi> he alſo freely of his Grace doth ſave from <hi>Sin</hi>; for he <hi>came to ſave his People from their Sins, to give Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins.</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:003403_0018_1003157D159859D0"/>In our beginning many were in great Straits, for want of Proviſion for themſelves and their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ones.

We did quickly build Boats, and ſome went a Fiſhing: But <hi>Bread</hi> was with many a very ſcarce thing: and <hi>Fleſh</hi> of all kind as ſcarce. And in thoſe Days, in our Straits, though I cannot ſay God ſent a <hi>Raven</hi> to feed us, as He did the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi>; yet this I can ſay to the I raiſe of God's Glory, that He ſent not only poor <hi>ravenous Indians,</hi> which came with their Baskets of Corn on their Backs, to Trade with us, which was a good Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unto many; but alſo ſent <hi>Ships</hi> from <hi>Holland</hi> and from <hi>Ireland</hi> with Proviſions, and Indian Corn from <hi>Virginia,</hi> to ſupply the Wants of his dear Servants in this Wilderneſs, both for Food and Rayment. And when Peoples Wants were great, not only in one Town but in divers Towns; ſuch was the godly Wiſdom, Care and Prudence (not Selfiſhneſs but Self-Denial) of our Governour <hi>Winthrop</hi> and his <hi>Aſſiſtants,</hi> that when a Ship came laden with Proviſions, they did Order that the whole Cargo ſhould be bought for a <hi>general Stock</hi>: And ſo accordingly, it was, and Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made to every Town, and to every <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in each Town, as every Man had need. Thus God was pleaſed to care for his People in Times of Straits, and to fill his Servants with Food &amp; Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Then did all the Servants of God Bleſs his holy Name, and love one another with pure Hearts fervently.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed any further, I will inform you that God ſtirred up his poor Servants to uſe Means

in their beginning for their Preſervation; though a low and weak People, yet a willing People to lay out their Eſtates for the Defence of themſelves and others. They having Friends in divers Places who thought it beſt for our ſafety to build a <hi>Fort</hi> upon the Iſland now called <hi>Caſtle-Iſland</hi>; at firſt they built a <hi>Caſtle</hi> with <hi>Mud-Walls,</hi> which ſtood divers Years: Firſt Capt. <hi>Simpkins</hi> was Commander thereof, and after him, Lieut. <hi>Moniſh,</hi> for a little ſpace. When the <hi>Mud-Walls</hi> failed, it was built again with <hi>Pine Trees and Earth</hi>; and Capt. <hi>Davenport</hi> was Commander. When that decayed, which was within a little Time, there was a ſmall Caſtle built with <hi>Brick Walls,</hi> and had <hi>three Rooms</hi> in it; a dwelling Room below, a lodging Room over it, the Gun Room over that, wherein ſtood <hi>Six</hi> very good <hi>Saker Guns,</hi> and over it upon the Top <hi>Three leſſer Guns.</hi> All the Time of our Weakneſs, God was pleaſed to give us Peace, until the Wars with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>Charles the</hi> II's Time. At that Time our Works were very weak, and Intelligence came to us that <hi>Durother</hi>

that was ſlain. But behold God wrought for us; for although <hi>Durother</hi> intended to come here, yet God by contrary Winds kept him out; ſo he went to <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> and did great ſpoil there. And again when Danger grew on us by reaſon of the late Ware with <hi>Holland,</hi> God permitted our <hi>Caſtle</hi> at that very Time to be <hi>Burnt down</hi>; which was on the 21ſt Day of <hi>March</hi> 1672, 3: But ſtill God was pleaſed to keep this Place in Safety: The Lord enlarge our Hearts unto Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p>I will now return unto what I began to hint unto you before; namely, that <hi>Satan</hi> and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments did malign us, and oppoſe our <hi>Godly Preachers,</hi> ſaying they were <hi>legal</hi> Preachers, but themſelves were for free Grace, and for the Teachings of the Spirit: And they prevailed ſo by their Flatteries and fair Speeches, that they led away not only <hi>Silly Women laden with their Luſts,</hi> but many <hi>Men</hi> alſo, and ſome of ſtrong Parts too; who were not aſhamed to give out that our Miniſters were but <hi>legal</hi> Preachers, and ſo endeavoured to bring up an evil Report upon our faithful Preachers, that they themſelves might be in high Eſteem. And many of them would preſume to Preach in private Houſes, both Men and Women, much like the Quakers. They would talk of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of <hi>Revelations</hi> by the Spirit without the Word, as the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers do, talk of the Light within them, rejecting the holy Scriptures. But God by his Servants aſſembled in a Synod at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in 1637, did diſcover his Truth moſt plainly, to the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his People, and the changing of ſome, and to the recovery of not a few, which had been drawn away with their Diſſimulations. Thus God
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003403_0021_100315445A04F708"/>
delivered his People out of the Snare of the <hi>Devil</hi> at that Time. Let <hi>Us,</hi> and do <hi>You</hi> in your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Bleſs the holy Name of the Lord: <hi>the Snare is broken, and we and ours are delivered.</hi> There were ſome that not only ſtood out obſtinate againſt the Truth, but continually reviled both our godly Miniſters and Magiſtrates, and greatly troubled our <hi>Iſrael</hi>: But by Order of the <hi>General Court</hi> they were Baniſhed out of this Jurisdiction.

            <p>Many Years after this, <hi>Satan</hi> made another Aſſault upon God's poor People here, by ſtirring up the Quakers to come amongſt us, both Men &amp; Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; who pretended Holineſs and Perfection, ſaying they ſpake and acted by the <hi>Spirit</hi> &amp; <hi>Light within,</hi> which (as they ſay) is their Guide: And moſt Blaſphemiouſly ſaid, that the <hi>Light within</hi> is <hi>the Chriſt the Saviour</hi>; and deceived many to their Perſwaſion. But, bleſſed be God, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Churches both, did bear witneſs againſt them, and their loathſome and pernicious Doctrine; for which they were Baniſhed out of this Juriſdiction, not to return without Licence, upon pain of Death. The Reaſon of that Law was, becauſe God's People here, could not Worſhip the true and living God, as He hath appointed us in our publick Aſſemblies, without being diſturbed by them: And other weighty Reaſons; as the Dangerouſneſs of their Opinions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some of them preſumed to Return, to the loſs of their Lives, for breaking that Law, which was made for our Peace and Safety.</p>

            <p>Now as <hi>Satan</hi> has been a lying Spirit to deceive and enſnare the Mind to draw us from God by Error, ſo hath He ſtirred up evil Men to ſeek the Hurt of this Country; but God hath delivered his poor People here from Time to Time: Sometimes by putting Courage into our Magiſtrates to puniſh thoſe that did Rebel; and ſometimes God hath wrought for us by his Providence other-ways. Here was one <hi>Ratcliff</hi> ſpake boldly and wickedly againſt the Government and Governours here, uſing ſuch words, as ſome judged, deſerved Death. He was for his Wickedneſs Whipt, and had both his Ears cut off in <hi>Boſton</hi> A.D. 1631; I ſaw it done. There was one <hi>Morton</hi> that was a peſtilent Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, a Troubler of the Country, who did not only ſeek our Hurt here, but went to <hi>England,</hi> and did his utmoſt there, by falſe Reports againſt our Governour; but God wrought for us, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003403_0023_100315931C194C60"/>
ſaved us, and cauſed all his Deſigns to be of none Effect. There aroſe up againſt us one <hi>Bull,</hi> who went to the Eaſtward a Trading, and turned Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and took a Veſſel or two, and plundred ſome Planters thereabouts, and intended to return into the <hi>Bay,</hi> and do Miſchief to our Magiſtrates here in <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> and other Places: But as they were weighing Anchor, one of Mr. <hi>Short</hi>'s Men ſhot from the ſhore, and ſtruck the principal Actor dead, and the Reſt were filled with Fear and Horror. They having taken, one <hi>Anthony Dicks</hi> a Maſter of a Veſſel, did endeavour to perſwade him to Pilot them unto <hi>Virginia;</hi> but he would not. They told him that they were filled with ſuch Fear and Horrour, that they were afraid of the very Rattling of the Ropes: This Mr. <hi>Dicks</hi> told me with his own Mouth. Theſe Men fled Eaſtward, and <hi>Bull</hi> himſelf got into <hi>England</hi>; but God deſtroyed this wretched Man. Thus the Lord ſaved us at this time, from their wicked Device againſt us. There was alſo one Capt <hi>Stone</hi> about the Year 1633 or 1634 who carried himſelf very proudly, and ſpake contemptuouſly of our Magiſtrates, and carried it lewdly in his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. For his Miſdemeanour, his Ship was ſtayed, but he fled and would not obey Authority; and there came Warrants to <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> to take him dead or alive; ſo all our Souldiers were in Arms, and Centinals were ſet in divers Places; and at length he was found in a great Corn-Field, where we took him and carried him to <hi>Boſton</hi>; but for want of one Witneſs, when he came to his Trial, he eſcaped with his Life. He was ſaid to be a Man of great Relation, and had great Favour in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and he gave out threatning Speeches. Tho' he eſcap'd with his Life, not being hanged for
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003403_0024_100315949F5BFC10"/>
Adultery, there being but one Witneſs; yet for other Crimes he was fined, and payed it: And being diſmiſſed he went towards <hi>Virginia</hi>; but by the way putting into the <hi>Pequot Country</hi> to Trade with them, the <hi>Pequots</hi> cut off both him and his Men, took his Goods and burnt his Ship. Some of the Indians reported, That they Roaſted him alive. Thus did God deſtroy him that ſo proudly threatned to ruin us by complaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us when he came to <hi>England</hi>: Thus God deſtroyed <hi>him</hi>; and delivered <hi>us</hi> at that time alſo.</p>
            <p>About that time, or not long after, God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Satan</hi> to ſtir up the <hi>Pequot Indians</hi> to kill divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, as Mr. <hi>Oldham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tilly</hi> and others: And when the Murtherers were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, inſtead of delivering them, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to deſtroy more of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> about <hi>Connecticut</hi>; which put us upon ſending out Souldiers, once and again; whom God proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in their Enterprises, until the <hi>Pequot Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> were deſtroy'd. See Mr. <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi>'s <hi>Relation of the Troubles which have happened in</hi> New-England <hi>by reaſon of the</hi> Indians, <hi>from</hi> 1634, <hi>to</hi> 1675. I ſay nothing to you of the <hi>late War,</hi> but refer you to the Hiſtories in Print. Thus was the Lord pleaſed to deliver us at that time alſo, and to put a Fear and Dread of Us into the Hearts of the <hi>Indians</hi> round about us: And many of them did voluntarily put themſelves under the Government of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It alſo pleaſed God to put it into the Hearts of ſome of our Worthies, to conſider that one End of our coming hither was to Preach the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to the <hi>Indians,</hi> for the ſaving
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003403_0025_10031597A4E3D130"/>
of God's Elect, and for the bringing into Chriſt's Kingdom thoſe that were as in High-ways and Hedges. Some did therefore ſet themſelves to learn the <hi>Indian Language,</hi> and ſo taught them to know GOD and the LORD JESUS CHRIST, whom they never knew or heard of before, nor their Fathers before them; and to know <hi>Themſelves,</hi> namely their Miſery by Nature and by reaſon of Sin. Among others, the principal was that Revd. Man of God Mr. <hi>John Eliot,</hi> Teacher of the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Roxbury</hi>; whoſe great Labour and Pains in Catechiſing, preaching the Word, and tranſlating the BIBLE into the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Language,</hi> God has bleſſed, I doubt not, to the converting of many among them. <hi>He that Converteth Souls ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.</hi> Oh how glorious will the ſhining of that Star be in Heaven! I rejoice to think of it.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, know ye, that God wrought won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully for our Preſervation, when Men Abroad (and doubtleſs ſome at Home) endeavoured to overthrow our Government; and prevailed ſo far, that <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> were ſent from <hi>England</hi> hither with ſuch Power and Authority, that doubtleſs put themſelves, (and too many among us) in Hopes that they had attained their Ends. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far that they ſet up a Court, appointed the Time and Place, and gave out their Summons; yea for our then Honoured Governour &amp; Company, Perſonally to appear before them: But the Lord our God was for us, tho' Troubles were very near: He ſtirred up a mighty Spirit of Prayer in the Hearts of his People, <hi>This poor Country cryed and the Lord heard and delivered them from all their Fears.</hi> And the Lord put Wiſdom and Courage
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003403_0026_1003159926C429F0"/>
into the Hearts of his Servants then ſitting in the General Court, to give ſuch <hi>Anſwers,</hi> and to make ſuch a <hi>Declaration,</hi> publiſhed by a Man appointed on Horſe-back, with the Trumpet ſounding before the Proclamation to give the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple notice that ſomething was to be publiſhed, which was done in three ſeveral Places in <hi>Boſton</hi>; that it put an End to their Court, and (through God's Goodneſs) to our Troubles at that time about that matter. And as our Court did aſſert our <hi>Privileges</hi> granted unto us by <hi>Patent,</hi> and did adhere thereto, ſo our God hath hitherto continued the ſame unto us: Bleſſed be his glorious Name! I humbly beg of God that He will in Mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thoſe Priviledges unto You and Yours in your Generations, for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I gave you a hint towards the beginning, that I came out of <hi>Plymouth</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> the 20th of <hi>March,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Nantasket</hi> (now <hi>Hull</hi>) the 30th of <hi>May</hi> 1630. Now this is further to inform you, that there came <hi>many Godly Families</hi> in that Ship: We were of Paſſengers <hi>many in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> (beſides Sea-men) of <hi>good Rank</hi>: Two of our <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> came with us, viz. Mr. <hi>Roſſiter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ludlow.</hi> Theſe godly People reſolved to live together; and therefore as they had made Choice of thoſe two Revd. Servants of God, Mr. <hi>John Warham</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Maverick</hi> to be their Miniſters, ſo they kept a ſolemn <hi>Day of Faſting</hi> in the <hi>New Hoſpital</hi> in <hi>Plymouth</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſpending it in Preaching and Praying: where that worthy Man of God, Mr. <hi>John White</hi> of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> in <hi>Dorſet</hi> was preſent, and Preached unto us the Word of God, in the fore-part of the Day; and in the latter part of the Day, as the People
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003403_0027_1003159ADA2CFD20"/>
did ſolemnly make <hi>Choice</hi> of, and call thoſe godly Miniſters to be their <hi>Officers,</hi> ſo alſo the Revd. Mr. <hi>Warham</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maverick</hi> did <hi>accept</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and expreſſed the ſame. So we came, by the good Hand of the Lord, through the Deeps comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably; having Preaching or Expounding of the Word of God <hi>every Day</hi> for <hi>Ten Weeks</hi> together, by our Miniſters. When we came to <hi>Nantasket,</hi> Capt. <hi>Squeb,</hi> who was Captain of that great Ship of <hi>Four Hundred</hi> Tons, would not bring us into <hi>Charles River,</hi> as he was bound to do; but, put us aſhore and our Goods on <hi>Nantasket Point,</hi> and left us to ſhift for our ſelves in a forlorn place in this Wilderneſs. But as it pleaſed God, we got a Boat of ſome old Planters, and laded her with Goods; and ſome able Men well Armed went in her unto <hi>Charleſtown</hi>: where we found <hi>ſome Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams</hi> and <hi>one Houſe,</hi> and in the Houſe there was a Man which had a boiled <hi>Baſs,</hi> but no <hi>Bread</hi> that we ſee: but we did eat of his Baſs, and then went up <hi>Charles River,</hi> until the River grew nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſhallow, and there we landed our Goods with much Labour and Toil, the Bank being ſteep. And Night coming on, we were informed that there were hard by us <hi>Three Hundred Indians</hi>: One <hi>Engliſh Man</hi> that could ſpeak the <hi>Indian Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> (an old Planter) went to them and adviſed them not to come near us in the Night; and they hearkened to his Counſel, and came not. I my ſelf was one of the Centinals that firſt Night: Our Captain was a Low Country Souldier, one Mr. <hi>Southcot,</hi> a brave Souldier. In the Morning ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> came and ſtood at a diſtance off, looking at us, but came not near us; but when they had been a while in view, ſome of them came and held out a great <hi>Baſs</hi> towards us; ſo we ſent
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003403_0028_100315A29FD21670"/>
a Man with a Bisket, and changed the Cake for the Baſs. Afterwards they ſupplyed us with Baſs, exchanging a Baſs for a Bisket-Cake, and were <hi>very friendly</hi> unto us.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Dear Children</hi>! Forget not what Care God had over his dear Servants, to watch over us, and protect us in our weak beginnings. Capt. <hi>Squeb</hi> turned aſhore Us and our Goods, like a mercyleſs Man; but God, even <hi>our merciful God,</hi> took pity on us; ſo that we were ſupplied, firſt with a Boat, and then cauſed many <hi>Indians,</hi> (ſome <hi>Hundreds</hi>) to be ruled by the Advice of <hi>one Man,</hi> not to come near us: Alas had they come upon us, how ſoon might they have deſtroyed us! I think <hi>We</hi> were not above <hi>Ten</hi> in Number. But God cauſed the <hi>Indians</hi> to help us with Fiſh at very cheap Rates. We had not been there many Days, (although by our Diligence we had got up a kind of Shelter, to ſave our Goods in) but we had Order to come away from that Place, (which was about <hi>Watertown</hi>) unto a Place called <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapan</hi> (now <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>) becauſe there was a <hi>Neck of Land</hi> fit to keep our Cattle on: So we removed and came to <hi>Mattapan</hi>: The <hi>Indians</hi> there alſo were kind unto us.</p>
            <p>Not long after, came <hi>our renowned &amp; bleſſed Governour,</hi> and divers of <hi>his Aſſiſtants</hi> with him. Their Ships came into <hi>Charles River,</hi> and many Paſſengers landed at <hi>Charlſtown,</hi> many of whom died the Winter following. Governour <hi>Winthrop</hi> purpoſed to ſet down his Station about <hi>Cambridge,</hi> or ſomewhere on the River; but clewing the Place, liked that <hi>plain Neck</hi> that was called then <hi>Black-ſtones-Neck,</hi> now <hi>Boſton.</hi> But in the mean
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003403_0029_100315A422EFC960"/>
time, before they could build at <hi>Boſton,</hi> they lived many of them in Tents and Wigwams at <hi>Charlſtown</hi>; their <hi>Meeting-Place</hi> being abroad under a <hi>Tree</hi>; where I have heard Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi> Preach many a good Sermon.</p>
            <p>In thoſe Days God did cauſe his People to truſt in him, and to be contented with mean things. It was not accounted a ſtrange thing in thoſe Days to drink <hi>Water,</hi> and to eat <hi>Samp</hi> or <hi>Homine</hi> without Butter or Milk. Indeed it would have been a ſtrange thing to ſee a piece of Roaſt Beef, Mutton or Veal; though it was not long before there was Roaſt <hi>Goat.</hi> After the firſt Winter, we were very Healthy; though ſome of us had no great Store of Corn. The <hi>Indians</hi> did ſometimes bring Corn, and Truck with us for Cloathing and Knives; and once I had a Peck of Corn or thereabouts, for a little Puppy-Dog. <hi>Froſt-fiſh, Muſcles</hi> and <hi>Clams</hi> were a Relief to many. If our Proviſion be better <hi>now</hi> than it was <hi>then,</hi> let us not, (and do you dear Children take heed that you do not) forget the Lord <hi>our</hi> God. You have better <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Raiment,</hi> than was in former Times; but have you better <hi>Hearts</hi> than your Fore-fathers had? It ſo, Rejoice in that Mercy, and let <hi>New-England</hi> then ſhout for Joy. Sure all the People of God in other parts of the World, that ſhall hear that the Children and Grand-Children of the firſt Planters of <hi>New-England,</hi> have better Hearts, and are more heavenly than their Predeceſſors; they will doubtleſs greatly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, and will ſay, <hi>This is the Generation whom the Lord hath Bleſſed.</hi>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:003403_0030_100315A6CCA75588"/>And now, <hi>Dear Children,</hi> I know not the Time of my <hi>Death</hi>; my Time is in God's Hands; but my Age ſhows me it cannot be far off. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, while I am in Health and Strength, I tho't good to put into Writing and leave with you, what I have deſired in my Heart, and oftentimes expreſſed to you with my Tongue. I ſay, I do here <hi>Charge you ſolemnly,</hi> and every one of you, as if I did Charge you every one by Name: <hi>Sons, Daughters</hi> and <hi>Grand-children,</hi> that now are capable of Underſtanding, and as you ſhall be capable from time to time; and <hi>Servants,</hi> or any other whom God hath placed within my Gates: I ſay, I <hi>Charge you</hi> that every one of you <hi>Fear the Lord our God, and Obey his Cowmandments</hi>; which is the Duty of <hi>every Man,</hi> and much more <hi>Yours,</hi> whom He hath graciouſly taken into <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with Himſelf, and hath promiſed to be a God to you in your Generations. The Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>his Seed</hi> in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, doth extend it ſelf to the Believer and his Seed in the Goſpel Times: for the Apoſtle ſaith, Acts 2.39. <hi>For the Promiſe is to You, and to your Children.</hi> He ſpake this in Goſpel Times, after Chriſt was gone to Heaven: and he doth not ſay, The Promiſe <hi>was,</hi> but the Promiſe <hi>is,</hi> and ſhall be ſo hereafter, to thoſe <hi>that are afar off</hi> alſo, yea <hi>to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> to the end of the World; the Promiſe is to them and to their Seed. Oh then, if God be <hi>your</hi> God, you are his People: Then ſee that you <hi>Fear</hi> him, and ſtand in awe and Sin not: See that you do <hi>Honour</hi> him; <hi>A Son Honoureth his Father</hi>: See that you <hi>Love</hi> Him with all your Souls and Strength. If you do truly Love God, you will keep all his Commandments, and you will hate

Evil: <hi>Ye that Love the Lord hate Evil.</hi> You cannot Love the <hi>Lord,</hi> and Love <hi>Sin</hi> too: No Man can ſerve two contrary Maſters. If you Love the Lord, you will very often think of Him: How do Lovers think of one another, though far abſent? but God is not far abſent from a Believer. I Charge you, <hi>Think often on God</hi>: Thoſe that forget God, are wicked Men and Women, and ſhall be turned into Hell. And if you truly Love God, you will Love the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and all his holy Appointments, <hi>the Habitation of his Holineſs.</hi> And if you Love God dearly, as you ought to do, it will grieve your Hearts to ſee Him diſhonoured, and his Laws Tranſgreſſed: <hi>David</hi>'s Eyes ran down with Tears, becauſe Men tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed God's Laws. And if you Love God, you will delight to have Communion with Him, and to pour out your Hearts into his Boſom. Beg of God, that He would put his Fear into your Hearts, and that He would cauſe you to Love Him. Intreat Him to Love you freely. God muſt Love <hi>Us</hi> firſt, before we can Love <hi>Him</hi>: And I can tell you, The Love of God unto your Souls is better than all the World: <hi>His loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is abundantly better than Life.</hi> Oh prize it; ſeek for it more than for earthly Treaſure: <hi>Seek and you ſhall find: God will give his</hi> Holy Spirit <hi>to thoſe that ask it.</hi> If you ask the Spirit of God out of a deep Senſe of the Want of it; if you ask it in Chriſt's Name and for his ſake; if you ask the Holy Spirit to Sanctify you, and cleanſe you from your Sins; if you ask the Spirit to lead you into all Truth, and to guide you in all the Ways of God, and to enable you to do all that Duty God requires of you; Doubt not, but know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, God will give his Holy Spirit unto you.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>Study to</hi> Know <hi>your own</hi> Hearts, <hi>to know the</hi> Plague <hi>that there is in them.</hi> There is a Plague in every Man's Heart, the deadly Plague of Sin; which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> by ſtudy and diligent ſearch found in himſelf, which made him cry out, <hi>Oh wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Death:</hi> And again, <hi>In me, that is, in my Fleſh, dwelleth no good thing.</hi> And bleſſed <hi>Job</hi> alſo by ſearching, found it out; which made him ſay, <hi>Behold I am vile</hi>: And again, <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> Surely when Men ſee the Plague of Sin in their Hearts, and the Danger of Death thereby, (for the Plague is a deadly Diſeaſe) it will make them cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved</hi>?</p>

            <p n="5">V. Another Thing which I Charge you to obſerve, is, <hi>To Worſhip GOD in your</hi> Families. Do not neglect Family Prayer, Morning and Evening. And be ſure to Read ſome part of the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> every Day in your Families, in ordinary Courſe. And be ſure to Inſtruct your Families in the Grounds of Religion. And be your ſelves <hi>Patterns,</hi> by your holy Lives and Converſations, unto your Children. And as you ought to follow and imitate good Examples in any godly Men or Women, ſo eſpecially in your <hi>Parents</hi>: you ought to follow them as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt, and in nothing elſe. Where you have ſeen them <hi>miſſing</hi> the Rule, as doubtleſs you have often done; let them be your <hi>Warnings,</hi> not your Patterns. I ſay where I miſſed the Rule in Word or Deed, (for I am a weak imperfect Creature, one of the worſt of Men) be you ſure to avoid that Rock, and follow not me in any Evil, but avoid it. And if you obſerved any Virtues in your Parents, (though they were but few) Imitate them in that which is Good, that God may be with you, as He was with your Fathers.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And I lay it as a ſolemn Charge upon you, <hi>That you Pray to God in Secret; and that often too.</hi> Our Lord and Saviour bids us, <hi>Enter into our Cloſets, and ſhut the Door, and Pray
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003403_0036_100315BD6477DC78"/>
to our</hi> Father <hi>in Secret.</hi> There you may tell God your very Hearts, and lay open to Him your worſt Plague-Sore, your vileſt Sins, which no Man knoweth, neither is it meet they ſhould know. Yet all Men ſhall know your vileſt, lewdeſt, moſt notorious Wickedneſs, both of Heart and Life that ever was committed by you, tho' never ſo long ago, or never ſo ſecretly done; except you confeſs them to God, and make your Peace with Him, in and through Jeſus Chriſt, by Repentance and Faith: <hi>Then the Blood of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the Righteous cleanſeth us,</hi> and will you from all your Sins: Otherwiſe God will bring every ſecret Thing into Judgment. I ſay again, <hi>Pray in Secret,</hi> though you have not a Cloſet or Door to ſhut; you need none: You may Pray alone in the Woods, as Chriſt did in the Mountain: You may Pray as you walk in the Field, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did: When imployed in Buſineſs, you may lift up your Hearts in Prayer, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did. And when you are alone at any Time, Think with your ſelf, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly God is preſent tho' none elſe; I will Confeſs my Sins, and I will beg God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Grace, I will Wreſtle with God by Faith and Prayer. And you may every one of you prevail, if you Pray ſincerely, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in it: If Importunity prevailed with the unjuſt Judge, will it not much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. And I do alſo Charge you, <hi>To live in</hi> Love <hi>and</hi> Peace <hi>among your ſelves.</hi> Love is of God; but bitter Envy and Strife is of the Devil. <hi>Love as Brethren</hi>: Brethren muſt Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003403_0037_100315BEE86D80A8"/>
Oh! <hi>How amiable a thing is it, for Brethren to dwell together in Unity! It is like the precious Ointment that was poured on</hi> Aaron's <hi>Head</hi>; and <hi>that Ointment</hi> was ſuch, as none might be made like it for other Uſes. Doth not <hi>Love</hi> exceed other Graces? Then ſtrive after that which is moſt excellent. So ſtrive to live in Love and Peace with all Men, as much as poſſible in you lies. [<hi>Be at Peace with all Men</hi>:] That is, if there be any Breach of Peace, let not the Fault be yours. You muſt not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, delight in, nor connive at, the ſinful, pernicious, wild Practices of Men, to be at Peace with theſe. Thoſe that are God's Children and muſt dwell in God's Tabernacle, a vile Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt be contemned in their Eyes. Sure, his Vileneſs will make him loathſome; yet if it be poſſible, be at Peace with Him: Endeavour to Reclaim him from his Wickedneſs, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving him plainly for ſinful Practices; and if nothing elſe will do, complain to <hi>Authority</hi>; and if that will not do, complain to God, and mourn for him.</p>
            <p>Finally, <hi>Be</hi> good Examples <hi>unto others.</hi> Walk humbly with God. Be Holy in all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Be Courteous; be Sober; be Charitable; Ready to Diſtribute, given to Hoſpitality. Be humble-minded. Set your Affections on Things above, not on Things below; not on Riches, Honours and Pleaſures. Prize highly the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the <hi>Preachers</hi> of it. Labour to draw others to Love and Fear God. Flee the Luſts of Uncleanneſs, and the Occaſions of it.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003403_0038_1003052A2AD368D0"/>
Abhor Drunkenneſs, and exceſſive Drinking. Come not into a Tavern, but on juſt and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Occaſions. Chooſe God to be your Portion: Receive Chriſt by Believing on Him; ſo you ſhall be the Children of GOD. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>CApt. <hi>Roger Clap</hi> the worthy Author of the foregoing Diſcourſe, was a Man generally known, honoured and eſteemed by thoſe that were contemporary with him; but moſt of thoſe are alſo removed by Death, and the preſent Generation, (among whom he hath a numerous Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of Grand-Children and Great-Grand-Children,) know but little of him: And there being no Memoirs preſerved of this good Man, and his Poſterity being likely otherwiſe to have little or no Knowledge of this their Progenitor; it is thought highly proper, and deſir'd by ſome who are no way Related, that a ſhort Account might be given of <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Family.

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003403_0040_100315CA6107DF20"/>He was Born in <hi>Salcom</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> on the 6th Day of <hi>April, Anno Domini</hi> 1609, of pious and creditable Parents; whoſe religious Education God was pleaſed to accompany with the early Strivings and Convictions of his Holy Spirit, that ended in his happy Converſion. In his younger Years, while he was under the immediate Government of his Father, he had ſuch a Love to the <hi>Word of God</hi> and the moſt eminent <hi>Preachers</hi> of it; that he obtained leave of his Father to live in the City of <hi>Exon,</hi> under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Rev. Mr. <hi>John Warham,</hi> with whom he afterwards came to <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1629, when many of the moſt godly <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People</hi> were driven out of the Kingdom for their conſcientious Nonconformity to the <hi>Eſta, bliſhed Way of Worſhip,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Warham</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verick.</hi> (who were afterwards Colleague Paſtors of the Church of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>) and with them a conſiderable Number of pious Perſons were preparing for a Remove into this Country; Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> found in himſelf a ſtrong Inclination to go with thoſe good People, and caſt in his Lot with them. He had taken a great liking unto the Miniſtry of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Warham,</hi> and was not willing to be left behind, when He was to go: and therefore having with ſome Difficulty obtained his Father's Conſent, he ſet himſelf to aſſiſt in the great and good Work the People of God then had in hand.—He with thoſe good People that came over with him, (who were the firſt Inhabitants of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>) ſet ſail from <hi>Plymouth</hi> in <hi>England</hi> the 20th Day of <hi>March</hi> 1629, 30; and after a comfortable (tho' long) Paſſage of <hi>Ten Weeks,</hi> they arrived at <hi>Hull</hi> the 30th of <hi>May</hi> 1630. This was the <hi>Firſt Company</hi> that ſetled on this ſide <hi>Salem:</hi> and therefore beſure they met with Trials &amp; Difficulties enough, which did not at all diſhearten Mr. <hi>Clap</hi>; for his Heart was ſo taken off from temporal Things, and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003403_0041_100315CDA2A9DB08"/>
ſet upon ſerving and glorifying God, and finding here ſuch Advantages and Opportunities therefor, beyond what he had in <hi>England,</hi> that he could not forbear crying out in a ſort of Extaſy of Joy, <hi>Bleſſed be God that brought me here</hi>!</p>
            <p>In the ſame Year that He came over here, He join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf a Member of the Church in <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> where he lived, and continued a Member of this Church for the ſpace of <hi>Sixty Years</hi>; being a uſeful Inſtrument both in Church and Town. When he had been about <hi>Two Years and half</hi> in the Country, in the Year 1633, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 6th in the 25th Year of his Age, he married the vertuous Mrs. <hi>Johanna Ford,</hi> Daughter of Mr. <hi>Thomas Ford</hi> of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> when ſhe was but in the 17th Year of her Age: who with her Parents came over in the ſame Ship with himſelf, and ſetled alſo here in <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>; with whom he lived in the Conjugal Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſpace of 57 Years. She was a godly and exemplary Woman, given to Hoſpitality: She aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Acts of Charity; ſo that when proper Objects of Pity and Charity came to her Knowledge, ſhe never failed to relieve them herſelf, or procure them Relief from others: <hi>Thus the Bleſſing of thoſe that were ready to Periſh came upon her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among other Bleſſings wherewith it pleaſed God to Bleſs this pious Couple, the Bleſſings of the Breaſts and of the Womb were not the leaſt; for they had Fourteen <hi>Children,</hi> Ten <hi>Sons</hi> and Four <hi>Daughters.</hi> But God was pleaſed to prove theſe his Servants with Afflictions alſo, as well as Mercies; for <hi>Five</hi> of their <hi>Children</hi> Died in their Infancy; their Son <hi>Thomas</hi> died at 15 Years of Age, and their Son <hi>Unite</hi> at 7 Years. And in the Year 1686, their Son <hi>Supply,</hi> a hopefull young Man in the Flower and Prime of his Age, was ſuddenly taken out of the World, by the Accidental

               <hi>Firing a Gun</hi> at the <hi>Caſtle</hi>; where his Father was then the Captain, and himſelf an Officer, in the 23d Year of his Age. The reſt of their Children being <hi>Four Sons</hi> and <hi>Two Daughters,</hi> lived to fulfill the ordinary Courſe of Nature, and were great Bleſſings in their Generations.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> being thus ſetled as he himſelf expreſſeth it, <hi>in God's Houſe and among his People,</hi> he ſet himſelf to ſerve God and his Generation according to the Will of God. His Qualifications were quickly obſerved by the People of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>; and they early Improved him in the Affairs of their new Plantation. He ſuſtained both Civil and Military Offices in the <hi>Town</hi>; being <hi>Captain</hi> of the Militia, <hi>Repreſentative</hi> for the Town, and Authorized to <hi>Join Perſons in Marriage.</hi> And on the 10th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1665, the <hi>General Court</hi> appointed him <hi>Captain of the Caſtle</hi> (the principal Fortreſs in the Province) upon the Death of Capt. <hi>Davenp<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </hi> who was kill'd with Lightning the Month before.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Clap</hi> having now the Command of the Caſtle, diſcharged that Truſt with great Fidelity; and was therein ſerviceable to the whole Province, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally Reſpected and Honoured. He continued in that Command for the ſpace of 21 Years, even until the Year 1686; when by the <hi>Loſs of our Charter</hi> there was a Change of Government, and ſome things were required of Him that were grievous to his pious Soul and foreſeeing a Storm of Troubles coming on the Country, and he now in his old Age, voluntarily reſigned his Command.</p>
            <p>There is another Inſtance that ſhows what an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt Capt. <hi>Clap</hi> had in the Hearts of God's People, and what an extenſive Bleſſing they accounted him: it is this; In the Year 1672, he being then <hi>Captain of the Caſtle,</hi> it pleaſed God to viſit him with a Fit of Sickneſs; and the good People of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> unto
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003403_0043_100315D26EACA390"/>
which Church he belonged, kept a <hi>Day of Faſting and Prayer,</hi> to beg his Life of God: And God was pleaſed to hear and anſwer their Prayers; and when he was reſtored to Health, they kept a <hi>Day of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he commanded the Caſtle, he reſided there with his Family; and a well ordered Family it was: Capt <hi>Clap</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> were Examples of Piety: <hi>Their Light ſhone before others, to the Glory of their heavenly Father.</hi> He was a very Prayerful Man, and was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to retire often for Secret Duties: And in his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> (unto which all the Souldiers under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand alſo belonged) he daily offered up the Sacrifices of Prayer and Thanksgiving; in which, if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his Prolixity were diſagreeable to any, he would be Troubled thereat. He with his Family were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Hearers of the Word preached; going (I think) commonly to <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> Meeting, when the Weather permitted, and ſometimes to <hi>Boſton.</hi> He bear a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Love and Reſpect to <hi>Godly Miniſters,</hi> honouring them for their Works ſake: and alſo he bare an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared Love to <hi>all the People of God</hi>; ſo that the very <hi>Indians</hi> whom he thought to be Fearers of God were welcome to him, and he would inſtruct them in the Principles of Religion. He conſtantly attended the <hi>Lectures</hi> in the Towns of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> and <hi>Boſton:</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>Lecture</hi> at <hi>Boſton</hi>; concerning which, if any of the Souldiers or young People asked, <hi>Whoſe Lecture it was?</hi> intimating thereby (as Capt. <hi>Clap</hi> very well knew) that they thought ſome were not ſo excellent Preachers as others, and ſo had leſs Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hear them; He would anſwer, <hi>Let the Preacher be who he will, if be Preach the</hi> Word of God <hi>I will go and hear him.</hi> His <hi>Eyes were upon the Faithful of the Land, that they might dwell with</hi> him: He choſe thoſe to ſerve him that walked in a perfect way; and He would entertain none in his Service, but thoſe that He could reduce to good Orders. He would often

recommend to his <hi>young People</hi> the Example of his pious <hi>Gunner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> when he was abſent, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The Walls of the Caſte would testify how many Prayers that good Man made to God in Secret.</hi> In his time it might be ſeen, that <hi>Religious</hi> and well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Men, might take upon them the calling of a <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,</hi> without danger of hurting their Morals, or their good Name, or leſsning their Advantages and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for the Services of Religion. He had a great <hi>Averſion to Idleneſs,</hi> would warn his Family againſt it, and made Conſcience of imploying himſelf and all about him in ſome lawful Buſineſs. He was a hearty <hi>Lover of his Country,</hi> a well wiſher to it, one that Prayed often for it, being chiefly concerned that pure &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled Religion might flouriſh here: and was a good Inſtrument in his Place and Station to promote and encourage that which was <hi>Good,</hi> and to diſcountenance <hi>Evil,</hi> and keep out <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Hereſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a meek &amp; humble Man, of a very quiet and peaceable Spirit, not apt to reſent Injuries; but where he thought the Honour of God was concerned or juſt and lawful Authority oppoſed, he was forward enough to exert himſelf. His <hi>Parts</hi> as well as his <hi>Piety,</hi> and his Knowledge of the Word of God and the true Chriſtian Religion, may be ſeen in the foregoing Diſcourſe; which is only the Subſtance of thoſe <hi>verbal Counſels,</hi> Warnings and Exhortations which he frequently In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated on his Children, committed to Writing: Which Diſcourſe is doubtleſs worthy any ſerious Man's Peruſal, and eſpecially thoſe of his Poſterity.</p>
            <p>As to his <hi>natural Temper,</hi> it is ſaid, He was of a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; pleaſant Diſpoſition, courteous and kind in his Behaviour, free and familiar in his Converſation, yet attended with a proper Reſervedneſs; &amp; he had a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity &amp; Preſence that commanded Reſpect from others.</p>
