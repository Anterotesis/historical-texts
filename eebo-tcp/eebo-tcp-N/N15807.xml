            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>St. Mark, XVI.15, 16.</bibl>
                  <p>AND HE SAID UNTO THEM, GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD, AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE: HE THAT BELIEVETH AND IS BAPTIZED, SHALL BE SAVED; BUT HE THAT BELIEVETH NOT, SHALL BE DAMNED.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is the important commiſſion given by the bleſſed Head of the Church to the apoſtles, the firſt miniſters in his kingdom; and in them to all who ſhould be in future au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to publiſh the glad tidings of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in all ſucceeding generations to the end of the world. In theſe words, the extent of our miſſion is mentioned—the nature of our errand unfolded,—and the conditions of ſalvation, we are to publiſh in the name of our bleſſed maſter, are expreſsly declared. To this divine rule you are then to look, would you know whether we deviate from our commiſſion or not</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe is not deſigned to prove the truth of the chriſtian religion: It is addreſſed to thoſe only who declare themſelves chriſtians, and profeſs to believe that the goſpel is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charter of hope to men: It therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon chriſtian principles, takes for granted that the bible is true, and undertakes to ſhew by ſcripture what the goſpel promiſeth to do for men, and upon what terms we may hope for the rewards of it.</p>
            <p>The goſpel ſcheme is built upon a ſufficient
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020201_0005_0FAE3CED558118B0"/>
atonement, which is already made to divine juſtice for ſin. The bible informs, that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally <hi>God made man upright,</hi> put him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a certain law, and declared death to be the award of diſobedience to it—that man how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tranſgreſſed, and ſtood expoſed to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty—but that Jeſus Chriſt, the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the ſacred trinity, undertook his reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and accompliſhed it by his own ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and death in the place of the offender.</p>
            <p>The generally received doctrine of the chriſtian church is, and has been, that Jeſus Chriſt, having ranſomed human nature by paying the price of our redemption, ſteps forth in his own right, as our Proprietor, King and Judge; enacts laws for us to obſerve; and offers all the rewards of his purchaſe upon ſuch terms as to his infinite wiſdom ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. In a word, that the terms propoſed are repentance of ſin, and faith in the Redeemer.</p>
            <p>In conformity to this faith of the Church of God, judging it to be fully and clearly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in divine revelation: I have conſtantly maintained, that there is no other name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, than that of Jeſus Chriſt, by which men can be ſaved—that HE hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed mankind—paid the price of our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; and is become our law-giver and judge— that in conſequence of his dominion over us, he has treated us as agents; enacted laws to bind us; and condeſcended to make a gracious
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020201_0006_0FAE3CEE9431E048"/>
covenant with us in the goſpel, in which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant he promiſes to give us his ſalvation, upon condition that we believe in him, ſubmit to his laws, and repent of our ſins—but has threatened to exclude us from the benefits of his purchaſe, if we continue in impenitence and unbelief—and that we muſt therefore comply with theſe conditions, or ſubmit to a miſerable eternity.</p>
            <p>Many of you are my witneſſes, that <hi>this</hi> has uniformly been the great burden of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from my youth to the preſent day. The doctrine has alſo been univerſally believed in this ſociety, where, for a courſe of many years, unleſs I am miſtaken, there has been as perfect an uniformity of religious ſentiment, as ever was in any congregation.</p>
            <p>Happy, I ſincerely believe, it had been for the town at large, and for this ſociety in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, had the doctrine never been oppoſed: Of late, however, there are thoſe who deny the human race to be agents—that the goſpel is a covenant between God and men—or that it has any conditions of life in it—and who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that Jeſus Chriſt having paid the whole debt to divine juſtice, which every human creature had contracted by ſin, that a ſecond payment cannot be juſtly required; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, however men may live here, the whole human nature muſt and will be finally happy. This doctrine is in direct oppoſition to what
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020201_0007_0FAE3CF0198B2B58"/>
you have early and ever been taught. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to claſh with the words of our text; and it oppoſeth the whole ſyſtem of the faith, I have ever believed and taught. Can I do leſs than to examine it candidly by the word of God?</p>
            <p>I am now to take my final leave of my country, and of this my charge; upon both which I earneſtly wiſh and implore every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bleſſing, which may conduce to their comfort here, and their happineſs forever. But how can I expect the accompliſhment of this wiſh, unleſs I leave them eſtabliſhed in the truth?—rooted and grounded in the faith and order of the goſpel? Should the doctrine I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe be found true, I ſhould think it an honor to retract my preſent miſtake; and this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I hope to find in others. However, ſhould the doctrine you all have till of late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, be found ſupported by God's word, it muſt be my duty to call upon you, to <hi>hold faſt the beginning of Your confidence and hope.</hi> My obligation to you as a ſpiritual inſtructor, and my higher obligation to the great Head of the Church as his embaſſadour, conſpire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand this of me.</p>
            <p>"Men, Brethren and Fathers, hear ye therefore my defence, which I now make unto you". The words of the text prove, that all men ſhall not be ſaved by goſpel, unleſs all men ſhall believe it.—They are the very words
<pb n="9"
                   facs="unknown:020201_0008_0FAE3CF0B0D0EAF0"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the great Redeemer himſelf, who has ran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſomed us from death; and they contain the terms upon which only HE has ordered the goſpel to be publiſhed</p>
            <p>The words are addreſſed to the apoſtles; and theſe firſt chriſtian miniſters are directed to <hi>go into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature</hi>; then follow the very words of the goſpel they were to publiſh. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> When we know the true import of theſe words, we ſhall alſo know what the conditions of ſalvation are, which Chriſt has fixed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To believe and be baptized</hi> muſt ſignify, not only to believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt; but to repent of our ſins, and ſubmit to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for ſo much Chriſt hath elſewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſsly required. So, to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> 'as this is Chriſt's gift,' muſt intend the enjoyment of <hi>his</hi> ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And on the other hand, not to <hi>believe,</hi> muſt ſignify, not only to deny Chriſt before men, but to reject his government: And to be <hi>damned</hi> muſt be, to be rejected from the above ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Let the meaning of the word <hi>damned</hi> be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</hi> or <hi>judged,</hi> or however you interpret it, it ſtands in direct oppoſition to the word <hi>ſaved.</hi> And if the unbeliever is not rejected from the ſalvation to which the believer is admitted, the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020201_0009_0FAE3CF179B10B00"/>
paſſage if left without meaning, nor can it be reconciled with common ſenſe. In the paſſage above, Chriſt admits the believer to his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he condemns, or judgeth the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to be unworthy of his ſalvation; and this is to reject him from it. Neither does this interpretation reſt upon my authority; but upon the authority of the Redeemer himſelf, for thus he hath explained it. <note n="*" place="bottom">John 3d, 36th.</note> 
               <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life; and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not on the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Chriſt here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, the unbeliever ſhall not ſee the life, which is given to the believer. Chriſt's ſalvation is the life he has given to the believer, therefore he has rejected the unbeliever from his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He has declared he ſhall not even ſee it. Can we have higher evidence that all men ſhall not be ſaved by goſpel, unleſs all men ſhall finally believe it, that is, fulfil the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it, than this explicit declaration of our bleſſed Redeemer and final Judge? But why do I mention conditions, when it is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there are conditions in the goſpel? or indeed, that men are agents? or the goſpel a covenant between God and men? We will examine theſe particulars, before we proceed to the principal enquiry; which is, whether all men ſhall finally believe the goſpel?</p>
            <p>The firſt inquiry is, whether men are <hi>agents?</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:020201_0010_0FAE3CF22B1CE550"/>
What we underſtand by an agent is, a being capable of inſtruction, or able to underſtand, and to be governed by laws, or to be influenced by the ſanctions of law. The laws and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil conſtitutions of every country prove, it is, and has been, the common conſent of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that <hi>we</hi> are ſuch beings; that is, beings capable to learn the meaning of law, and to be governed by the precepts of it; otherwiſe why were civil conſtitutions ever framed? To give men laws, is to treat them as agents: that is, as beings capable of government by law, and to acknowledge it proper to enact laws to bind us, is to grant we are agents, or proper ſubjects of law: but God has given laws to bind us: he therefore has treated us as agents.</p>
            <p>Should it be ſaid, though we can obey the laws of <hi>men,</hi> we cannot obey the laws of <hi>God</hi>; therefore, though we are agents under human laws, we are not agents, or proper ſubjects of divine laws. This objection muſt ſuppoſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God <hi>has</hi> given us no laws: or that he he has not treated us properly according to our condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We grant (as indeed we ought to do) that in our own ſtrength we are unable to keep even thoſe divine laws on which our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is ſuſpended: But Chriſt in the goſpel has declared, that the aids of his ſpirit ſhall be of equal extent with his laws—that we ſhall not be tempted above our ability—that his ſtrength ſhall be perfected in our weakneſs—
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020201_0011_0FAE3CF2ED7CE9A8"/>
and that it ſhall be ſufficient for us. However impotent we are in ourſelves, we want no other ſtrength than that which is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for us— and as the goſpel promiſes to give us <hi>ſufficient</hi> ſtrength, though it did not find us agents, it has raiſed us to that capacity. All who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God has given a revelation to teach men their duty, muſt believe them able to learn it: and they who grant that God has given laws to regulate our lives, ought to grant that we are agents, and able to be governed by law.</p>
            <p>Will any men then, who acknowledge the authority of revelation, deny that God has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en laws to mankind? Who can deny that God gave a law to the firſt two in innocency, and declared death to be the penalty of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it? Who can deny the Decalogue, and the whole law of Moſes, to be divine laws given to regulate the manners of men? Who will deny that God by Moſes ſet life and death before the Jewiſh nation, and referred it to them which they would chuſe, as though they really had the power of choice. Finally, who can deny that faith and repentance are laws of the goſpel, deſigned to bind men, when Chriſt commands men to repent and believe the goſpel, declares they ſhall be ſaved, if they do, but affirms they ſhall not ſee life, if they do not? The truth is, from the day God made man to the preſent time, he has uniformly given laws to govern us: he has treated us as
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020201_0012_0FAE3CF3AE7AF4D0"/>
beings capable of government by law, or as creatures able to chooſe and refuſe. And this is to treat us as agents. Clearly nothing more can be neceſſary to make man an agent, than to be able to be governed by laws, inforced by rewards and puniſhments. God has always given ſuch laws to men. However long we contend therefore, it will follow, either that we are agents, or that God has treated us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly. Which ſide of the alternative ſhall we take?—we ought not, and we dare not ſay, God has treated us improperly: We therefore muſt believe we are agents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince God has treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us as ſuch.</p>
            <p>But the next point is, whether there are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of life in the goſpel? A condition, is any thing upon which the enjoyment of a favour is ſuſpended. When we do the thing required, we receive the benefit: When we do it not, we are rejected from the favour. The thing thus required is a condition of enjoyment; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the enjoyment is not to take effect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a compliance with the condition. Let us examine whether ſuch conditions of life are not to be found in the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Lord came to ſave men by the remiſſion of their ſins When he entered upon his public miniſtry, he declared the approach of his kingdom, and commanded men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe his goſpel. That he requires faith and repentance is clearly legible to every
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020201_0013_0FAE3CF48D01DD50"/>
one who looks into his bible: He hath made faith and repentance the terms of his pardon and ſalvation, and requires them, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of life which himſelf has fixed. Luke 24, 47. <hi>He has commanded repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins to be preached in his name,</hi>—not remiſſion of ſins without repentance, but repentance firſt, as a condition without which there ſhould be no remiſſion. As <hi>repentance</hi> is one condition of life in the goſpel; ſo <hi>faith</hi> is another: Our bleſſed Redeemer ſaith, St. John, 3, 16, and 36. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſon, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. He that believeth on the ſon, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life; and he that believeth not the ſon, ſhall not ſee Life.</hi> Chriſt, the purchaſer and giver of life, has promiſed it to the believer; but declared the unbeliever ſhall not ſee life, but ſhall remain under the wrath of God. Is not faith then a condition of life? Without faith, life is not promiſed in the goſpel;—with faith, it is promiſſed. Faith is then a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which the enjoyment of life is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by the goſpel. If we expect ſalvation by Chriſt, we muſt look for it in the way in which he has promiſed it. Chriſt has not ſaid, we ſhall be ſaved without faith: Who dare ſay we ſhall? Chriſt has declared the believer ſhall receive his ſalvation; but that the unbeliever ſhall not receive it: Who dare ſay he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020201_0014_0FAE3CF5283390A0"/>
it? To cloſe the argument:—If the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ſhall enjoy life, and the unbeliever ſhall not enjoy it, then faith is a condition of life. Jeſus Chriſt has expreſsly declared this to be the caſe: therefore Jeſus Chriſt has made faith a condition of life.</p>
            <p>Having proved that there are conditions of life in the goſpel, it will ſoon appear that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is a <hi>covenant</hi> between God and men. A co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is an agreement between two or more parties. In this caſe God is one party, and men are the other. On his part, God promiſes life to men, upon the conditions of faith and repentance: On men's part, when they take the chriſtian profeſſion upon them, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to comply with the above conditions, as the way to enjoy the good things promiſed. They who take this profeſſion upon them, are ſaid to enter into covenant,—nay, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, the rite by which we compleat this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, is called the <hi>ſeal</hi> of the covenant. A covenant then there muſt be, or there could be no <hi>ſeal</hi> to it. But who are the parties in the covenant? Unqueſtionably God and men are the parties: For they are the two parties which agree. Indeed, it is impoſſible the covenant ſhould be betwixt God and Chriſt. Tho' there might originally have been a covenant between the Father and the Son; yet this of which we now ſpeak, is not: For we are told, that Chriſt is the <hi>mediator</hi> of this covenant. A me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020201_0015_0FAE3CF850383CA8"/>
is a middle perſon, and an interceſſor: But Chriſt cannot intercede betwixt God and himſelf,—nor can he ſtand in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and himſelf: But he muſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate between God and his people, the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who have entered into the agreement. In conformity to this idea, the apoſtle obſerves, that Chriſt is a mediator; but ſaith, that <note n="*" place="bottom">Galations 3d, 20th.</note> 
               <hi>a mediator is not a mediator of</hi> ONE; <hi>but God is one,</hi>—therefore he tells us, both that <note n="‖" place="bottom">1ſt Timothy, 2d, 5th.</note>
               <hi>he is the mediator betwixt God and men,</hi> and <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. 12, 24th.</note>
               <hi>the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the new covenant.</hi> I ſee not then why it does not follow, with a force of evidence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually convincing with a mathematical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that ſince Chriſt is the mediator of the new covenant—ſince he cannot be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of one, nor mediator betwixt God and himſelf,—but is the mediator between God and men, that the new covenant of which he is mediator, muſt be a covenant between God and men.</p>
            <p>The above obſervations ſhew, that men are agents, becauſe God treats them as ſuch—that the goſpel is a covenant between God and men, that it contains conditions of life—and that faith and repentance are the conditions of this covenant. It will from hence follow, that we muſt fulfil the conditions of the covenant, or not expect the rewards of it. As we are agents, we are accountable to God for the improvement
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020201_0016_0FAE3CF9B15A1C08"/>
of the powers he has given us. As goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are conditional, we muſt comply with the conditions, or not inherit the promiſes. Jeſus Chriſt has paid the price of our ranſom: We are his in right of purchaſe: and he has an undoubted authority to diſpoſe of us as he ſhall judge proper.</p>
            <p>Chriſt has promiſed his ſalvation to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: he has rejected the unbeliever from it. In the text he declares, he that believeth ſhall be <hi>ſaved</hi>; and he who believeth not, ſhall be <hi>damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> If we diſagree in the meaning of this laſt word, our Lord has declared it ſignifies, not to ſee or enjoy the life he has given to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. Theſe are his words: <hi>He that believeth on the ſon, hath everlaſting Life; he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the ſon, ſhall not ſee Life.</hi> Theſe are the words of our final judge, and they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely exclude the unbeliever from the life which is given to the believer; they declare he <hi>ſhall not ſee</hi> or enjoy it. The life here promiſed to the believer is Chriſt's ſalvation. Chriſt's ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is eternal life: For ſpeaking of his ſheep, he ſaith <note n="*" place="bottom">St. John 10th, 28th.</note> 
               <hi>I give unto them eternal Life.</hi> The ſalvation then, which is given to the believer, is eternal life; the unbeliever is rejected from the ſalvation given to the believer; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is rejected from eternal life; and this too by the declaration of the judge himſelf.</p>
            <p>It follows, either that we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020201_0017_0FAE3CFB005F5640"/>
the final unbeliever is rejected from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, or deny the poſitive, clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs declaration of our Redeemer and Judge.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this ſentence of the judge will be executed upon the final unbeliever in the great day of retribution. For judgment is then to proceed according to the goſpel: And the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of that important day is only to execute the promiſes and threatnings of the goſpel. As the unbeliever is totally excluded from eternal life, it will follow, either that all men will not be finally happy; or that all men will finally believe; Since without faith no one can be happy, no one can pleaſe God, or enjoy him.</p>
            <p>We therefore enquire whether all men ſhall finally believe, or fulfil the conditions of the goſpel? That all men do not fulfil theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the preſent life, may be thus argued. St. John obſerves, that <hi>without</hi> (or out of the kingdom of Heaven) <note n="‡" place="bottom">Revelations 22d, 15th</note> "are ſorcerers, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, murderers, and idolaters." Had theſe men obeyed the goſpel in this life, they had not been excluded from Heaven: but would have taken part of the inheritance given to <hi>him who overcometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame thing may be argued from the caſe of Dives and Lazarus. Lazarus died, and was carried by Angels into Abraham's boſom— a place of joy and comfort. The other died, and lift up his eyes in torment. Why is this
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020201_0018_0FAE3CFB2B0847F8"/>
difference made betwixt the two? The only reaſon which can be given is, the one had fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conditions of life, and the other had not. The one had faith, the other had it not. Had Dives in this life fulfiled the conditions to which Chriſt had promiſed his ſalvation, we now ſhould not find him in torment, and hear him beg in vain for releif; but we ſhould find him with Lazarus in a place of comfort. Theſe inſtances are a demonſtration, that all men do not fulfil the conditions of the goſpel in this life, becauſe we find ſome men excluded from the rewards of it at death.</p>
            <p>As all men do not fulfil goſpel conditions in this life, it remains to be done after death, if it is ever done. But ſurely it cannot be done between death and the reſurrection. For our bleſſed Lord <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> us, death is a <note n="§" place="bottom">St. John 9th, 4th.</note>

                  </gap>.</hi> And the apoſtle, that we are to be judged, for <hi>the things only</hi> which are <hi>done in the body.</hi> Soul and body are ſeparated at death, and will remain in a ſeparate ſtate till the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall commence:—then they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united—not for a ſecond probation however; but to receive the juſt award of the deeds done in the body before its ſeparation from the ſoul. Hence the apoſtle, <note n="‖" place="bottom">20. Corin. 5th, 10th.</note>
               <hi>we muſt all appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> So in the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020201_0019_0FAE3CFBEDDD68C8"/>
deſcription of the final judgment recorded by Sr. Matthew, our bleſſed Redeemer awards thoſe on his right hand to happineſs, becauſe they had fed the hungry, &amp;c. Things which could be done no where but here in the body: and he alſo ſentences thoſe on the left to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for no other reaſon than becauſe they had neglected to do ſuch good deeds upon earth.</p>
            <p>I know it has been ſaid, that <hi>devils</hi> only are on the left hand, and all mankind, bad and good, on the right: But this interpretation deſtroys the great deſign, both of this paſſage, and of the goſpel at large. For doubtleſs the deſign of both is, to encourage virtue, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage vice, by the different awards they ſhould receive at this grand period: But place all men, good and bad, on the right hand, and adjudge them indiſcriminately to happineſs, and this great deſign is totally loſt. It contains no motive to virtue, or diſcouragement to vice; nor can you reconcile it with the wiſdom of God, or the reaſon of men. Beſides, the crime for which thoſe on the left hand are puniſhed, does not agree with devils, but with men. Men are expected to feed the hungry; I never knew that devils were: Nor is this the crime for which they are to ſuffer. The apoſtle tells us, that "God ſpared not the angels which ſinned, but caſt them down to hell" They ſinned before they were caſt down; and they are reſerved in chains to the judgment of the great day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020201_0020_0FAE3CFCAE65F9B8"/>
cauſe they rebelled againſt God in Heaven;— not becauſe they did not viſit the ſick upon earth.<note n="†" place="bottom">In the paſſage of ſcripture referred to above, it is ſaid that <hi>all nations</hi> ſhall be gathered before the Judge. The objector ſaith, the devils are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the words <hi>all nations.</hi>—Matt. 28th, 19th, the apoſtles are commanded to go and teach <hi>all nations,</hi> and baptize them. If impure ſpirits are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the above expreſſions; <hi>all nations</hi> they are within the commiſſion given to the apoſtles, and ſhould have been inſtructed and baptized by them did they miſunderſtand their commiſſion? or did they perverſely neglect to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute one grand part of it; or finally did they underſtand it better than the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector?</note>
            </p>
            <p>From the above obſervations it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the judgment of the great day is the award of the things done in the body, and only of the things ſo done. This award is made according to the terms of the goſpel.— For the apoſtle teſtifies, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2d. 16.</note>
               <hi>that God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the goſpel.</hi> It appears further, that all men do not fulfil the terms of the goſpel in this life— that between death and judgment they cannot fulfil them, becauſe in this period nothing can be done for which we are to be judged: And it muſt follow, that as ſome men are not within the conditions of life at the time of judgment, they muſt then be rejected from ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The concluſion is unavoidable. The word of God is expreſs, that the ſentence of the laſt judgment is given according to the goſpel, for thoſe things only which are done in the body. The goſpel has in plain words rejected the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer from ſalvation. Some men die unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. At this period they therefore muſt be
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020201_0021_0FAE3CFD7933FF48"/>
rejected by the judge; becauſe the goſpel has already rejected them, and judgment is only the execution of the goſpel ſentence.</p>
            <p>We have now arrived at the period of the general judgment. We have found that ſome men at this period have not fulfiled the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life—that in conſequence they are, and muſt be, rejected from Chriſt's ſalvation by this judgment. It alſo appears that Chriſt's ſalvation is <hi>eternal</hi>; that they therefore are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from eternal ſalvation by the laſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the judge; becauſe they have not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed the conditions of life. Theſe conditions then remain to be fulfiled after the general judgment, when the ſentence of rejection from eternal life is paſſed, or they never can be fulfiled. But after the general judgment there will be no goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel conditions; therefore there can be none to fulfil. Judgment is the laſt act of goſpel. It is to fix the condition of thoſe who have been tryed by the goſpel—to reward its friends and puniſh its enemies. It is to put all things in ſubjection to Chriſt. And when this is done, goſpel has accompliſhed its whole deſign, and muſt ceaſe.</p>
            <p>As judgment is the execution of goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and threatnings, it cannot take place till the end of the diſpenſation. It is not time to reward or puniſh men by goſpel, till they have been firſt proved by it. Therefore the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the laſt day cannot commence, till
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020201_0022_0FAE3CFE2556A3B8"/>
all thoſe have ſtood their trial by goſpel, whom the wiſom of God hath decreed to try by it. firſt to inflict goſpel puniſhments upon men, and after this to put them under tryal by the goſpel, would be like puniſhing a man for a breach of law which was never given him; and after this putting him under the law, to try if his future diſobedience would not merit the unjuſt ſentence already executed upon him:</p>
            <p>In the nature of the thing, we muſt begin with probation, and end with judgment, and thus God has repreſented the judgment of the great day. <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. 13th, 49th.</note>So ſhall it be in the <hi>end of the world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; <hi>the Angels ſhall come forth, and ſever the wicked from among the juſt.</hi> In the parable of the tares of the field, our bleſſed Lord being the interpreter, the harveſt, or judgment, is the <hi>end of the world:</hi> And the repreſentation is, that as the reapers do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin harveſt till the corn is fully ripe; ſo judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall not commence till all the ſubjects of it have finiſh'd their probation, and are ripe for the award. Hence judgment is alſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a work of the <hi>laſt day.</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">St. John 12th, 48th.</note> 
               <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: The word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him</hi> IN THE LAST DAY. The ſentence Chriſt has pronounced againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer ſhall condemn him in the general judgment, the <hi>laſt day,</hi> the winding up and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020201_0023_0FAE3D0138344670"/>
concluſion of the goſpel diſpenſation. "The laſt enemy to be deſtroyed is death:" And this enemy is deſtroyed by the reſurrection: Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follows, and puts all enemies under Chriſt's feet. Devils and wicked men receive their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal doom. And then the apoſtle ſaith, the end cometh: then Chriſt will deliver up his kingdom, as mediator, into the hands of the father. The <hi>ſecond death</hi> is not the laſt enemy here intended. The ſecond death muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed before the final judgment, or never— It muſt be deſtroyed by the effect the goſpel has upon our lives. If we believe, it has no power over us. If we believe not, we ſhall be hurt of the ſecond death. For thus ſaith God, <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 21, 7, 8.</note>
               <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my ſon: But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable murderers, &amp;c. ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reaſon and revelation unitedly declare, that judgment is the laſt act of goſpel, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſcene of the diſpenſation. When the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ceaſes, the conditions of it muſt ceaſe. Judgment ſhuts up the goſpel: It therefore muſt ſhut up the conditions of the goſpel. Faith is a condition or law of the goſpel. Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cloſes the goſpel. After judgment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, faith is not rewardable by the goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not required by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:020201_0024_0FAE3D031DEF77A8"/>The ſum of all is, that there can be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation under the goſpel after the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe goſpel itſelf is then at an end, and ceaſes to command. Between death and judgment nothing can be done to alter our ſtate. Nothing can be done for which we are to be judged; for judgment only takes cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the things done in the body. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that if we ever fulfil the conditions of the goſpel, it muſt be in this life, while we are in the body. We have adduced ſeveral inſtances, which prove inconteſtably that ſome men do not fulfil theſe conditions in this life, and as they cannot be fulfiled after death or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it muſt follow, that ſome men, at the final judgment, muſt have the ſentence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection executed upon them; and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filthy muſt remain filthy, and the wrath of God abide upon them. Where then is <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation?</hi> It is not found in the goſpel, the laſt act of which excludes ſome men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever from a poſſibility of it.</p>
            <p>We will anſwer a few <hi>objections,</hi> and cloſe the ſubject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt objection is, that Jeſus Chriſt has paid the <hi>whole debt</hi> which we had contracted by ſin; and that juſtice cannot demand a ſecond payment.</p>
            <p>Chriſt has indeed ranſomed us from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the law of innocence. He has paid the whole debt to this law, and redeemed us
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020201_0025_0FAE3D050BAAA220"/>
from the curſe of it. If we are condemned therefore, it will be by another law. Chriſt has redeemed us from the <hi>Law</hi>; but has he redeemed us from the <hi>Goſpel</hi> too? If we are under no obligation to the law, who dare ſay we are under none to the goſpel? The goſpel was given to us: But why was this done, if we are under no obligation to obey it? Tho' the law has been fulfiled, Chriſt who did ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it, has placed us under the goſpel which is not fulfiled, and has threatened to exclude us from his ſalvation, if we do not comply with the conditions of it. If we are finally condemned then, it will be by the goſpel, from the laws of which Jeſus Chriſt has never excuſed us. Our Lord could neither believe nor repent. Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency forecloſed him from repentance; and infinite knowledge from faith:—Theſe two are the leading terms of the goſpel,—Terms adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to ſinners, and beings of limited know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge—which can be fulfiled only by ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;—and as they are required of us, will remain a debt upon us till we comply with them; and if we do not comply, we may be condemned by the goſpel, without the charge of a ſecond payment.</p>
            <p>The next objection is, that puniſhment is a <hi>medicine,</hi> deſigned by God for the cure of offence; and that it will have its effect either in this, or in ſome future trial. We grant, the puniſhments of this life are deſigned to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020201_0026_0FAE3D05D1FBD220"/>
purge from offence; but that this is the caſe with the puniſhments of the future ſtate, is not a doctrine of the goſpel. In the book of God, the puniſhments of the future judgment are uniformly repreſented, not as the <hi>cure,</hi> but the <hi>award</hi>—the proper wages and deſert of ſin, as a judicial recompence which the juſtice of God is concerned to execute upon the offender. Thus the apoſtle <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 6, 23d.</note>"The <hi>wages</hi> of ſin is death." And in the laſt day Chriſt is to appear <note n="‖" place="bottom">2d Theſſ. 1, 8, 9.</note>
               <hi>in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: who ſhall be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should it be ſaid, God is not a Being of <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> The reply is, he is a Being of <hi>juſtice</hi> however; and has told us, if his mercy does not reclaim us, his vengeance or his juſtice ſhall purſue us; that there ſhall be no remedy or eſcaping.</p>
            <p>As the poſition, that future puniſhment is purgative, is unſcriptural: ſo the hope of a <hi>ſecond trial</hi> under goſpel is merely viſſionary and ideal. For it has been proved, that after judgment there can be no trial, becauſe goſpel is then cloſed. Indeed, that after the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſoul and body there can be none—for judgment takes cogniſance only of the things done in the body. It therefore follows, that this life is the only time of probation under the goſpel,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020201_0027_0FAE3D067986AF40"/>
and that NOW only <hi>is the accepted time and day of ſalvation,</hi> agreeably to the expreſs words of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is objected, that we are <hi>finite</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; our crimes therefore muſt be finite; but the puniſhment of them is repreſented to be <hi>infinite,</hi> and muſt exceed the weight of the offence. No being knows the weight of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſo perfectly, as <hi>he</hi> who has adjuſted the puniſhment to it: This being hath declared that <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 12, 47, 48th.</note>
               <hi>that ſervant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes—but he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes, for unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much required.</hi>—<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. 25, 28, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>9, 30th.</note> 
               <hi>Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents, For unto every one that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance; but from him that hath not ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath. And caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> If the offender remains an offender forever, it is as juſt to continue his puniſhment, as it was at firſt to inflict it. Whether any ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue offenders forever is then the queſtion.— Were men machines, the puniſhment God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts in this life, would infallibly reclaim the vicious. But as we are agents, the concluſion will not follow. The puniſhments inflicted upon Pharaoh were by infinite wiſdom adapted
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020201_0028_0FAE3D07337B4A70"/>
to the cure of his proud and ſtubborn heart; they did however prove ineffectual. Experience teaches, and the word of God declares, that the longer habits of vice are continued, the more inflexible they grow. The truth is, all men are not reclaimed in this world, either by human or divine puniſhments. Every man muſt be reclaimed in the time of his trial, or never. It has been proved, that this life is the only time of trial: for judgment takes cogniſance of the things only which are done in this life: and after judgment there can be no time of trial under goſpel: for the goſpel itſelf is then cloſed. It follows then, that ſome men are not reclaimed by goſpel in the only time of trial under it, and therefore muſt forever remain offenders againſt it. And ſurely it is as juſt to <hi>continue</hi> as to <hi>begin</hi> to puniſh an offender. It has been proved that judgment is the laſt act of goſpel. As men muſt be firſt tried, before they can be judged by goſpel, they who plead for a time of probation after judgment, plead for a thing clearly impoſſible under the goſpel: becauſe at this period, there will be no goſpel to prove us.</p>
            <p>If theſe future trials are ſuppoſed to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome future diſpenſation of grace, the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel knows nothing of them: nor will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern myſelf further with the hypotheſis than to obſerve, that though it may be ingenious, it hath nothing but conjecture to ſupport it. To ſuppoſe goſpel has told us of ſuch future
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020201_0029_0FAE3D0801694848"/>
trials, is to ſuppoſe it militates againſt itſelf, and has rendered its own motives feeble. They therefore who build their hopes of happineſs upon ſuch conjectures, are <hi>removed from the hope of the goſpel,</hi> and place their expectations only in <hi>cunningly deviſed fables,</hi> built upon mere dream and enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>It has been proved, that we are probationers, that faith and repentance are conditions of the goſpel—that our redeemer and judge has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded us from his ſalvation, if we refuſe to comply with them—that judgment muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the conditions of the goſpel, that all men do not, in this life fulfil theſe conditions—that after death they cannot be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, till goſpel is finally cloſed—audit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follows, that all men ſhall not be finally ſaved by goſpel,</p>
            <p>After the moſt critical examination, in the fear of God, I ſincerely believe theſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are fairly drawn from undoubted princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if the cleareſt and moſt poſitive declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God's word are granted to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted principles. And indeed the capital arguments are founded upon the expreſs decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of our bleſſed Redeemer and judge. Can it be denied, that our Redeemer has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the unbeliever from his ſalvation? as judgment takes cogniſance only of the things done in the body. Can it be denied that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt execute the above ſentence of the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:020201_0030_0FAE3D08AC856E30"/>
Redeemer upon all who die in unbelief? Can it be denied that we are bound to obey the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the goſpel, though Chriſt has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the demands of the law of innocence? Can it be denied that judgment is the laſt act of goſpel, as it is deſigned only to reward or puniſh thoſe who have had their trial under it? Can it then be denied that after judgment all probation under goſpel muſt be at an end? Can it be denied that judgment takes cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the things only which are done in the body, and executes ſentence according to the conditions of the goſpel? And can it be denied that Dives and others have died deſtitute of the conditions of life? But if there is one perſon rejected from ſalvation by the goſpel, there may be more, and muſt be as many as die in impenitence and unbelief. <note n="*" place="bottom">Perhaps it may be objected, that the inſtance of Dives is a parable, and therefore improperly adduc'd.—But the circumſtance of its being a parable adds weight to the argument<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: for though D<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From the above reaſons it appears, that the ancient doctrine of the Church of God is the true doctrine—that the doctrine we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed is deſtitute of goſpel ſupport—and that faith and repentance are conditions of the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020201_0031_0FAE3D0991BCD138"/>
goſpel which we muſt fulfil, or be rejected from the hope of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>As the doctrine I have here attempted to maintain, is (at leaſt in my own judgment) founded in truth, and ſupported by the word of truth; but has lately, however, been warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed by ſome, I ſhall publiſh the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adduced in ſupport of the ancient doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Church, and leave the world to judge of the validity of them. I do this the rather, in teſtimony of affection to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and particularly to the reſpected people of my charge, to whom I ſhall leave this Diſcourſe as a legacy. Let me entreat them all, let me entreat you in particular before whom I have walked from childhood to this day, to conſider ſeriouſly, and examine impartially the arguments here advanced. I claim this as due for long and unremitted friendſhip. I claim it as your inſtructor for many years, and one who has never failed to attend you, and take a part with you in every diſtreſs; and I claim it as a meſſenger from God, an ambaſſador of the bleſſed Jeſus. I believe the doctrine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in this Diſcourſe to be contrary to God's holy and eternal truth, and ſubverſive of the great deſign of the goſpel of Chriſt; and how can I bid you a final adieu, while I fear any of you, by imbibing this doctrine, may be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the hope of the goſpel.</hi> I am clear in it, that faith and repentence are neceſſary to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:020201_0032_0FAE3D0A36D523D0"/>
goſpel ſalvation. Imbibe this doctrine, both in theory and practice, and then I have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the name of my bleſſed maſter, <hi>whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve,</hi> to promiſe you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and endleſs happineſs. But as I expect ſalvation upon no other terms myſelf, I dare not encourage you to hope for it in any other way.</p>
            <p>This, probably, is the laſt time we ſhall meet in a united aſſembly, till we meet before the awful tribunal of the final Judge. Let us then examine for truth with ſuch care and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, that we all may be rooted and grounded in the faith and order of the goſpel, that when we meet again, we may adore God, and congratulate one another, in the bleſſed victory and triumph we have by the blood of Chriſt gained through faith.</p>
            <p>How happy, happy ſhould I be, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, at that important hour, could I with aſſurance, ſay to my infinite Judge, "Lo, here am I, and the ſpiritual children thou haſt given me!

            <p>Should we meet once again upon this bleſſed foundation, our joy muſt be full. In hope of this happy event, with the moſt affectionate entreaty to you to ſtand with your <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
