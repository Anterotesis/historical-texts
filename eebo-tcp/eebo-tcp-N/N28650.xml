            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>WITH the time, or circumſtances of our removal from life, we are not acquainted; but of the ultimate certainty of the event, there is no ground to doubt.</p>
                  <p>PERSONS may conjecture that they ſhall not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live a particular ſeaſon; or that they ſhall die by a particular diſorder, or calamity: and yet be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported through that ſeaſon, and ſaved from the evil they apprehended.—On the other hand to preſume on a courſe of years, imagining that we are exempt from diſeaſe, or caſualties, would not only be a ſin, but might prove an experimental miſtake. By cauſes not foreſeen, or which were not conſidered dangerous, we might be arouſed from ſecurity, and brought to the grave.</p>
                  <p>THE hour of death, like the coming of the Son of man to judgment, is known to no one; but of the certainty of death there is the fulleſt evidence from the experience of man in all ages, and the general ſtate of nature: from the indications of frailty in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038196_0004_101141BCCD6AC8B0"/>
our own conſtitution, and the teſtimony of the word of GOD.</p>
                  <p>THE grave is repreſented as <hi>the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> appointed for</hi> ALL <hi>living.</hi> The characters and conditions of mankind are exceedingly diverſified in a number of reſpects; but whatever diſtinctions may ſubſiſt between them, they are all alike in this, that they muſt die, and make their bed in the duſt. Here <hi>the rich and poor meet together,</hi> and the <hi>servant is free from his master.</hi> In this place all diſtinctions are obliterated, all relations diſſolved, all acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions relinquiſhed: <hi>Naked came</hi> we from the earth, <hi>and naked</hi> do we <hi>return thither,</hi> Job i.21. <hi>All go to one place: All are of the dust, and all return to dust again,</hi> Eccles. iii.20.</p>
                  <p>IT is ſaid, "<hi>I know, that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house</hi> APPOINTED <hi>for all living;</hi> implying that it is the certain, unchanging purpoſe of GOD, that all ſhall die. Death is not an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional event; but is pre-determined in the plan of divine providence, is the fixed ordination of Heaven. In conformity with this, no proviſion is made in nature, by which any one can poſſibly avoid the change. Frequently when a perſon lies in death, we behold an example of the inefficacy of all created expedients to preſerve life. None of the productions of the fields could afford nouriſhment: and the powers of medicine, aided by the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſkill, and ſympathetic kindneſs, could not relieve and heal; but the appointment of GOD was carried, without interruption, into full effect.</p>
                  <p>THIS paſſage of ſcripture leads us to conſider, not only the <hi>certainty</hi> and <hi>universality</hi> of death, but that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038196_0005_101141BFCF095D80"/>
it is a diſpenſation of the divine hand, <hi>I know that</hi> THOU <hi>wilt bring me to death.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>GOD, though infinitely exalted and bleſſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the ſtate of the children of men. He appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the general frailty of their nature, and determines the order, and manner in which it ſhall be executed, exerciſing over each one a providential care. <hi>It is not in man, who walketh, to direct his steps; but in the hand of</hi> GOD <hi>are all his ways,</hi> Jer. x, 22. He obſerves our going out, and coming in: he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our ſtate in proſperity and adverſity; in ſickneſs and health: in the various relations we ſuſtain—and it is not without a due conſideration of all connected circumſtances, that any change is produced, and that death is experienced.</p>
                  <p>IF perſons be brought to death, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and will of GOD, there is infinite wiſdom in the diſpenſation. To conſider any event as under his government; and yet oppoſed to infinite wiſdom, is inconſiſtent. Though death in itſelf is evil and afflictive, and a reverſion of the original order of nature; yet that it is ſubordinated to wiſe and holy purpoſes, is evident from the infinite perfection of Deity, and from the declared and known reaſons of the appointment.</p>
                  <p>THE entrance of ſin into the world rendered the ſentence of death juſt.—Wiſely to adapt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of mankind to a ſeaſon of trial, finally to be terminated, it was ordained that the ſyſtem of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be frail, and with all other objects that human life ſhould be tranſitory. If we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the wiſdom of GOD in determining that the heavens ſhould wax old as a garment, and the foundations of the earth be removed, and that all
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038196_0006_101141C26292D098"/>
the human race ſhould die; then we may reconcile with wiſdom his removing particular perſons from life; for in theſe inſtances he gives an example of the general ſentence, and carries it, as it reſpects the human race, into effect.</p>
                  <p>SHOULD it be objected, that the time and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a perſon's death appear, in ſome inſtances, to militate againſt divine wiſdom in the production of it? To this it may be replied, that what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the weakneſs and frailty of man in old age, is nothing more than the appointment <hi>that he shall die,</hi> exhibited in example. There is no neceſſity, in the conſtitution of his nature, that he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come feeble at threeſcore years and ten, or that he ſhould be at all impaired by age, more than that the Sun, by continuing to ſhine, ſhould finally loſe his luſtre. Indeed, but for experience, it would be thought more ſtrange that the ſun, a vaſt body of fire, ſhould be kept burning for many thouſand years, without the leaſt apparent diminution, than that the human body ſhould be ſuſtained in vigor, forever.</p>
                  <p>IF it be owing ſolely to the decree of death, that man becomes feeble and helpleſs at a certain age, then it may conſiſt with divine wiſdom, that he ſhould experience ſickneſs and death in an earlier ſeaſon. If the decree find man in vigor, though a thouſand years old—intereſted in a variety of relations, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in important labors, with ſcenes of enjoyment and hope around him, GOD alone can determine when that vigor ſhall abate, when thoſe relations ſhall be diſſolved, and thoſe proſpects cloſed. To plead the importance of relations and purſuits againſt the time of removal deſignated in Divine Providence, may ever delay the ſtroke of death, and is an implied claim to immortality on earth. If wiſdom be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038196_0007_101141C59873E340"/>
in the general ſentence of death, it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs expreſſed in the particular time and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which it is executed.</p>
                  <p>IT may further be obſerved, that if death be the appointment of GOD, it is ſubſervient to infinite goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>THE goodneſs of GOD is as unqueſtionable as his wiſdom, or power. In the permiſſion of ſin, and in all the evils which reſult from it, he was influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by benevolence as truly as in the creation of the world. Unleſs he were, there is a contrariety in his character; or he is leſs glorious and excellent in the government of creatures than in giving them exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>IT is aſſerted in ſcripture, <hi>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof,</hi> Eccles. vii.8.— Exiſtence is good, or evil, chiefly in reference to its objects. If GOD do not exerciſe goodneſs in gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erning, he exerciſed none in creating. Unleſs it were his object that creatures ſhould be ſubſervient to wiſe and holy purpoſes, no advantages would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from their exiſtence: for however curiouſly they might be formed, or liberally endowed, their end would be vain, and thus their organization and endowments would be uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>THE object of GOD in governing is the higheſt general good. In purſuing this he indulges no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons; but is impartial, juſt and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable. The condition of no one on earth, nor of any creature in the univerſe is the ſame, as if his intereſt were alone conſulted: as if it were the ſole object of GOD to exalt him, and promote his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:038196_0008_101141C85AFED7C8"/>CREATURES are viewed by GOD not as ſeparate individuals, but in a collective capacity, and are all ſubordinated to the greateſt good. By this the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of each one is determined, whether proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or adverſe: whether life, or death.</p>
                  <p>TO chooſe the accompliſhment of this object, and voluntarily to conform to it, is a univerſal duty, and in this conſiſt the higheſt dignity, and the higheſt happineſs of which a creature is capable. In the temper here defined a perſon will be willing to live, or die, as GOD ſhall determine: he will be happy in the bleſſings with which he is favored, and content to reſign them when required in Divine Providence: he will acquieſce in the removal of his friends, in the calamities which befal the world, and in all the evils of which creatures are the ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>AS the general is ſuperior to individual good, and is ever purſued by GOD, death in being inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him in ſubſervience to this, is ſubſervient to good, even the higheſt of which we can conceive.</p>
                  <p>HAVING attempted to illuſtrate the text, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the certainty and univerſality of death, and that it is a diſpenſation of infinite wiſdom and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, productive in every inſtance, of the greateſt good, I would conclude my diſcourſe with an</p>

                     <p>INNUMERABLE are the teſtimonies given in Divine Providence, that the moſt intimate relations muſt be diſſolved: that perſons of ſkill and generoſity, of eminence and great uſefulneſs, muſt be removed. Of this we have witneſſed a number of inſtances: but few have been ſo impreſſive as the one which lately took place among us; by which not only a family is overwhelmed in ſorrow, but the town is ſenſible of a loſs.</p>
                     <p>HE is juſtly to be regretted, as a man ſuſtaining many important relations,<note n="*" place="bottom">He left an affectionate wife and five children—was honorary Member of the Philadelphia and London Medical Societies, and President of the <hi>Cincinnati,</hi> of this State.</note> and of a great, generous, humane ſpirit. He will be lamented as a huſband, father, and benefactor: He will be regretted as at the head of a claſs of citizens, diſtinguiſhed for their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the late revolutionary war, and on whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is placed in the future emergencies of the country, among whom he preſided with affectionate ſolicitude and dignity. He will be deeply regretted, as eminent in the very uſeful and important profeſſion in which he was extenſively employed; and for which he was qualified, not only by the acuteneſs of his diſcernment and accuracy of his opinions—by his deciſion and judgment; but by a choice of the moſt inſtructive books, an extenſive correſpondence, and great experience.</p>

                     <p>TRUE reſignation is founded on a belief, not that man, from a neceſſity of nature, muſt die; but that this and every change is appointed, and carried into effect by GOD: in a belief, not that our particular wiſhes and intereſts are conſulted; but that the higheſt good is promoted.—It implies ſenſibilities correſponding to the nature of events; but, both in what is pleaſing and in what is afflictive, that we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit with chearfulneſs to the divine will.</p>

                  <p>MAY we ſuitably conſider, that we are <hi>Strangers and pilgrims on earth:</hi> that <hi>thou wilt bring</hi> us <hi>to death, and to the house appointed for all living:</hi> that <hi>man, at his best estate, is altogether vanity:</hi> that his <hi>days are an hand's breadth</hi>—his life, as a <hi>tale that is told.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>MAY we conſider thy condeſcenſion, in regarding our ſtate:—thy care and infinite compaſſion:—and truſt thee in all ſeaſons and circumſtances:—and, though we <hi>walk through the valley of the shadow of death,</hi> may we <hi>fear no evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR life, and all worldly bleſſings, we offer thee a tribute of gratitude. We praiſe thee for the richer bleſſings of the goſpel: for the pardon of ſin, for

ſpiritual life, and ſupport:—that ſubmitting to thy will, and truſting in thy Son, we ſhall be ſubjects of thy love, ſhall be led from ſtrength to ſtrength, and admitted to never ending glory and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>WE acknowledge, and bemoan that principle of depravity, which is productive of diſorder and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and is diſpleaſing in thy ſight.

                  <p>SANCTIFY to us the diſpenſations of thy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: particularly the afflictive event we have been called lately to experience, and at this time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.

                  <p>REGARD in mercy the bereaved children—pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their wants. Reward into their boſoms the liberality of thy ſervant to others.—May they be trained to uſefulneſs and honor, to virtue and piety.

                  <p>MAY this loſs be ſanctified to the inhabitants of the town: and wilt thou, in mercy, raiſe up one, whoſe heart thou wilt endue with equal diſcretion and fortitude, and whoſe hand thou wilt guide with equal ſkill, in relieving the diſtreſſes of thy people.</p>
                  <p>LOOK in compaſſion on all who mourn.

                  <p>THE Nation of Iſrael was favoured with a ſucceſſion of characters, eminent in wiſdom, and in all thoſe talents and virtues by which human nature is exalted and adorned.</p>
                  <p>MOSES was the firſt of Prophets and Legiſlators: Aaron the moſt venerable of Prieſts: Joſhua the moſt intrepid, regular and ſucceſsful of Generals: Samuel the moſt equitable of Judges: David the moſt paternal and pious of Kings, and Solomon the wiſeſt of men.</p>
                  <p>THE characters which aroſe in that nation, will not only appear with luſtre to the end of time; but are a model to which ſucceeding generations may be referred, for greatneſs in civil rule, in war, and in piety.</p>
                  <p>IN the reign of Saul, and part of the reign of David, there was a perſon of diſtinction, Abner, the ſon of Ner, Saul's Uncle. After Saul was inveſted with regal authority, he appointed Abner, Captain
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038196_0018_101141E4A1F0D7C0"/>
of his hoſt. His talents were tried in a variety of enterprizes, againſt Moab, againſt Ammon, againſt Edom, againſt Zohath, againſt the Philiſtines and againſt the Amalakites; and his ſpirit and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct juſtified the appointment; <hi>he was a valiant man,</hi> and there was <hi>none like</hi> him <hi>in all Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ON the death of Saul, though the right of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonged to David, but one tribe acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that of Judah. Abner, from his reputation and great influence, was the moſt proper perſon to attempt the reconciliation of the other tribes: and having made a ſolemn league with David, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a commiſſion and entered on the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. —But before he had proceeded far on the journey, Joab, Captain of the hoſt of David, ſent for him in the name of the King, and as he returned met him, and taking him aſide, treacherouſly ſlew him.</p>
                  <p>DAVID greatly lamented his death. He appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an honorable burial, and followed the bier: and in the language of our text, addreſſed his Officers and the People, <hi>Know ye not that there is a Prince and a Great Man fallen this day in Israel?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS country, like the ancient Jewiſh Nation, has been bleſſed with characters, eminent in civil and religious offices: diſtinguiſhed as Stateſmen and Divines; as Legiſlators, Philoſophers, Judges, and Generals. It would be preſumptuous as it were vain, to attempt to point them out, or exhibit the proofs of their talents, their virtues and uſefulneſs.</p>
                  <p>OUR attention is, at this time, called to <hi>one,</hi> not only on account of his diſtinguiſhed greatneſs and excellence; but the afflictive event of his death.—
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038196_0019_101141E7D3343E98"/>
So publicly known, ſo illuſtrious, ſo beloved was <hi>Washington,</hi> that the pathetic exclamation muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſentiments and feelings of every heart, <hi>Know ye not, that there is a Prince, and a Great Man, fallen this day in</hi> our <hi>Israel!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>JUSTLY to delineate his virtues and endowments, would be a difficult taſk in the calmeſt hours of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; but is much too critical to be executed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the confuſed and tumultuous preſſure of grief.— The rationality of our ſorrows, and the duty of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly improving them, require that we pay a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral attention to his character.</p>
                  <p>HE may truly be ſtiled <hi>great,</hi> if abilities to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duties of the moſt important ſtations in ſociety conſtitute greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>NOT to take a more diſtant retroſpect—in the commencement of the revolutionary war he was appointed to the chief command of the armies of the country. Not long after, Congreſs, "maturely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the criſis, and having perfect reliance in his wiſdom, vigor and uprightneſs," inveſted him with extraordinary powers; which were renewed from time to time, ſo long as the exigency of affairs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it neceſſary.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Journals of Congress, Dec. <hi>27, 1776;</hi> Nov. <hi>14,</hi> Dec. <hi>10, 1777,</hi> and April <hi>23, 1778.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE juſtice of this reliance, and the ability with which he executed the truſt, are evident from the ſupport and diſcipline of the army, and its various and important operations in the courſe of eight cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns: and from the iſſue of its ſucceſſes, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of our Sovereignty and Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the return of peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:038196_0020_101141EA956C4890"/>HIS greatneſs, as General, compriſed courage and ſkill, moderation and enterprize, and reſources of mind ſuited to ſeaſons and circumſtances. His courage was not leſs to be doubted, than his prudence was conſpicuous. He hazarded no intereſts by raſhneſs: he loſt no advantages by delay. He was patient in trials, fortunate in deciſions, had great ſelf command —was great in his authority over others, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for diſintereſtedneſs and humanity.</p>
                  <p>BY his public communications and example, he relieved the country from many diſcouragements, and in ſeaſons of embarraſſment and danger was the greateſt ſupport of its hopes; and animated his fellow-citizens in arms, ſharing their burdens, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling their differences, directing their ardor to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects moſt uſeful to the Country and conducive to <hi>their</hi> honor, teaching them effectually to preſerve the character of <hi>citizens</hi> in the armour of <hi>soldiers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT was not the majeſty of his appearance, the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his eye, nor the high authority of his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that influenced the troops to endure hardſhips and meet the enemy with fortitude—it was a ſenſe of the union of the moſt endearing virtues in his heart, with the moſt enlightened ſkill: a conviction that in their General they had a Father, who was ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to mitigate their diſtreſſes, and in toils and dangers would appear at their head; and that in the love of him they loved their Country—it was theſe ſentiments and feelings, which rendered them pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in ſufferings, and in the day of battle inſpired them with ſuch courage, that though their bodies might be cut down, their ſpirit could not be ſubdued.</p>
                  <p>HE was great, not only in the character of <hi>General</hi>; but, when the neceſſity of military labours was over, in retiring to the rank of a <hi>private citizen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:038196_0021_101141ED58193468"/>WITH the higheſt objects of perſonal grandeur and authority that ever ſtimulated ambition, and with peculiar advantages to ſecure thoſe objects, that like an affectionate, faithful ſon, he ſhould bow to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Country, rejoicing only in her protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſteem, laying at her feet thoſe honors which kings could not confer, nor take from him—was an act of greatneſs which ſanctified his former exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and atchievements, and gave the faireſt luſtre to his character.</p>
                  <p>CONSIDERED in his political capacity and as a <hi>civil Ruler,</hi> he was likewiſe great.</p>
                  <p>HE muſt early have been diſtinguiſhed in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to be choſen to the firſt Congreſs which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened on the grievances and intereſts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.<note n="*" place="bottom">Chosen a Delegate by the then Colony of Virginia, Aug. <hi>5, 1774.</hi>—Took his seat in Congress, Sept. <hi>5, 1774.</hi>
                     </note> His character is more fully illuſtrated in his numerous letters, and other writings: it is ſtill more highly atteſted in his being a member and Preſident of the Convention by which our preſent Conſtitution of Government was formed;—but it is moſt clearly diſplayed in his adminiſtration as Preſident of the United States.</p>
                  <p>THAT he ſupported this high Office with dignity, and faithfully executed its very important and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated duties, not only the voice of the conſtituted authorities, and of the country at large; but the proſperity of the country is a teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>HE was the <hi>first</hi> Preſident on the preſent ſyſtem of Government. Under him, the public regulations in general, in our internal and external relations, were adjuſted: thoſe officers who have conducted,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038196_0022_101141F020AA3690"/>
and continue to conduct, the public buſineſs, with ſo much diſcretion, vigilance and integrity, were appointed: that decree of neutrality, which has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented our being involved in the perils and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a fruitleſs war, was promulged—and our relations to foreign nations ſettled, in a manner as conducive as poſſible to our proſperity and peace.</p>
                  <p>A FURTHER inſtance of his greatneſs appears, after he had retired from public ſervice, in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the command of the forces, to be raiſed for the ſupport of our rights and privileges as Citizens, and the defence of the country.</p>
                  <p>WHEN he had labored, with little intermiſſion, for a long time in the moſt arduous fields of public action; when he had long borne the weight of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic cares and intereſts, even till he had become old and grey headed: and when, from confidence in the ability and experience of others, he had reſigned his public Office, and withdrawn to the ſhade of his patrimonial dwelling—that, at the appearance of danger, and his country's call, he ſhould again come forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he ſhould ariſe from his ſeat and gird on his armour, willing to ſacrifice the repoſe of his laſt days to the public good—was an inſtance of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not exceeded in any of his former actions, and which only ſuch peculiar circumſtances admit of being exhibited to view.</p>
                  <p>IT may further be obſerved, that he was great in <hi>reputation,</hi> and in <hi>influence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HIS <hi>fame went into all lands, and the fear of him was upon all nations,</hi> 1 Chron. xiv.17.—No other perſon on earth was ſo univerſally loved and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His influence was particularly great in this

Many, who appear to miſtake the public intereſts, were convinced of his merit; and though not apprehending the force of his example in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laws, liſtened to his advice and approved of his conduct and opinions. As <hi>Abner,</hi> from his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and reputation, might manage the tribes of Iſrael as he pleaſed; and as it was ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> on a certain occaſion, II Sam. iii, 36, that <hi>all the people took notice</hi> of his behaviour, <hi>and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people:</hi> ſo it may be ſaid, the people were diſpoſed to obſerve the words and actions of <hi>Washington</hi>; and all that he ſaid, or did, gave general ſatisfaction. His opinion, with few exceptions, was the public ſentiment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated the public will.</p>
                  <p>THIS confidence reſulted, not only from his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed endowments and reputation: but from the <hi>integrity</hi> of his heart. No one could accuſe him of a wrong intention; or miſtruſted, that he would be biaſſed by ſelf-intereſt, or party zeal, or any other perverſe and injurious principle.</p>
                  <p>INDEED, my afflicted, reſpected Auditors, if any thing great in its nature, or conſequences, have taken place in the political experience of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſince <hi>Washington</hi> came on the ſtage of action, then he was great: for he was the chief inſtrument, in the hand of Heaven, of accompliſhing the events, and effecting the changes, for which that epoch is diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>IF it were great, for an infant people to aſſert their own rights, and thoſe of mankind; and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one of the moſt formidable, and to us, before, the moſt venerated of earthly powers: then was

                     <hi>Washington</hi> great; for he aſſiſted in the counſel, and took command of our armies.</p>
                  <p>IF it were great, for a people to form and amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly agree in a Conſtitution of general Government, comprehending a great diverſity of diſpoſitions, manners and habits, and harmonizing an infinite variety of intereſts: a conſtitution the boaſt of our country and reaſon, and beneficial to mankind as an example of regard, in freemen, to order and civil rule, then was <hi>Washington</hi> great: for in that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Convention, where this Conſtitution was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he Preſided.</p>
                  <p>IF it were great, to introduce the operation of this new ſyſtem of government; to execute the higheſt Office, with approbation and applauſe, and leave an example, which it is one of the firſt wiſhes, both for the good of the country and <hi>their</hi> honor, that his ſucceſſors may imitate, then was <hi>Washington</hi> great: for with his adminiſtration, the operation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution commenced; and on his final reſignation, the public regret was more expreſſive, than their profuſe applauſes, of the ability with which he had diſcharged its duties.</p>
                  <p>IF it were great, for a perſon advanced in years, and worn with labour, and bleſſed with the privileges of domeſtic peace, to return to public ſervice; to take the command of a <hi>patriotic</hi> army, to guard the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and government of the country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to reſiſt, if neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, a perverted, licentious, threatening <hi>world</hi> in arms—then was <hi>Washington</hi> great; for, from the calm retreat, where he hoped to cloſe his days, he came at the call of his country. Her dangers, and the thought of meeting her ſons, with here and there a veteran, in the field, ſtrengthened his knees, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038196_0025_101141F86188F218"/>
invigorated his arm, renewing <hi>his youth like the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle's:</hi> and he was ſtill conſidered the ſafeſt of guides, and our greateſt earthly defence.</p>
                  <p>HIS character, in the various ſtations and lights in which it has been viewed, was great. Had he appeared in only one of them, he would have been thought diſtinguiſhed. How is his greatneſs enhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced when his character is collectively conſidered!</p>
                  <p>HIS talents muſt have been pre-eminent. He muſt have been formed by Heaven, to give an example of greatneſs and goodneſs—expreſſive of divine benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſeful to us and inſtructive to the human race. Of true greatneſs, goodneſs is the ſupport and luſtre. The greatneſs of this perſon was connected with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the reſult of it. He appears to have acted with a view to the approbation of conſcience, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a belief of the being and ſuperintending provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and government of God, and the principles and repreſentations of the Goſpel: and his character, in its diſintereſtedneſs and generoſity, its utility, its ſelf-diffidence, its deciſion, its piety, its faithfulneſs and glory, is a ſtriking example of what is the object of the Goſpel to produce.</p>
                  <p>THIS character is removed from among us. <hi>Know ye not, that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in</hi> our <hi>Israel! Washington</hi> is dead! Let us pauſe a moment—Our feelings are chilled at the reflection—utterance fails me.</p>

                  <p>IF the divine favor were expreſſed, in raiſing up ſuch a perſon, and continuing him for ſuch important purpoſes, that he ſhould be taken away is a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ought to be deplored, as we ſhould feel the afflictive hand of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>AS we venerated and admired his talents and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, we muſt lament his removal: for though in its conſequences an infinite acquiſition, as we truſt and and believe to him, the evil to us is great: we ſhall behold his face, be inſtructed by his counſels, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted by his exertions no more.</p>
                  <p>THE love of our Country juſtifies our ſorrow at his death. Great to her were the advantages of his character in what he had done, and might do. He was not only a chief inſtrument of the political bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we enjoy, and the head of our military forces; but more than any other individual character a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of union to all claſſes of citizens; and might be an important means of prolonging our peace, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

cloſed thine eyes, may yet ſupport our hearts: may teach them to ſubmit: may grant them conſolation and peace: may avert the evils which we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and continue the bleſſings we enjoyed in thee!</p>
                  <p>THIS event likewiſe exhibits in an impreſſive light, that we ſhould not place our confidence in man.</p>
                  <p>IN all ages, the great and good have, with other characters, been brought to death. <hi>Our fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?</hi> The grave is <hi>without any order:</hi> the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>small</hi> are there. Abner, the important character and chief General mentioned in our ſubject, was prematurely ſlain. David, who lamented him, and was far his ſuperior in virtues and ſtation, became old and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave up the ghoſt. <hi>Washington,</hi> who has long been a ſubject of public confidence, an object of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic admiration and eſteem, is gone. <hi>Man is not to be accounted of, whose breath is in his nostrils. The days of his years are threescore years and ten: and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years; yet is their strength, labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we flee away.</hi> From the frailty of human life, we ought not to rely on man. If we cannot depend on his exiſtence, it is evident we cannot depend on his exertions for our good.</p>
                  <p>THE ſubject further teaches, the reaſon for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that the character we have conſidered was brought into exiſtence, and ſo long continued.</p>
                  <p>SUCH a character was of great importance—was neceſſary to our welfare, as a people. It was an act of great goodneſs in GOD, that he ſhould form his
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038196_0028_101141FFBAB59E08"/>
ſervant with ſuch endowments, and lead the public mind to obſerve them: that he ſhould continue his ſervant through a ſeries of trials; ſupport him in his <hi>labors,</hi> till he had arrived at old age, and in his uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs till death.</p>
                  <p>IN ſome inſtances perſons of talents, and capable of promoting the public welfare, are not diſcriminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They are like thoſe flowers which, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Poet, are
<q>
                        <l>"—born to blush, unseen;</l>
                        <l>"And waste their sweetness on the desert air."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN ſome inſtances, when called into action, and public expectations are excited, and the public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence engaged, they are prematurely cut down, either by treachery, or diſeaſe, and thus are like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>carried from the cradle to the grave.</hi> But the talents of this perſon did not eſcape public obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and he was continued in public office till his principles and modes of conduct could be aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and marked; forming an example, in fair and full proportion, calculated to inſtruct and engage imitation.</p>
                  <p>WE have likewiſe reaſon for gratitude, that he was left to no action by which his reputation would be fullied, and his example rendered pernicious.— Many perſons outlive their characters; but his was uniform till <hi>death</hi> put the ſeal upon it, and precluded the poſſibility of its being tarniſhed. The public eye will ever behold it with admiration and pleaſure, and the imitation of it will conduce to individual great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellence, and the general good.</p>
                  <p>FINALLY, the ſubject, in its various parts, enforces the duty of truſting alone in GOD.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:038196_0029_10114204B530A748"/>WHEN a created being is removed, the divine arm is not ſhortened: to think it is, implies that we viewed the creature in the place of the Creator. When a created being is removed, he, indeed, is deprived of ability to aſſiſt us; but the ability of God is not impaired. He is infinite and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: the ſource of all power and goodneſs. As diſtinguiſhed public characters are a teſtimony of his merciful agency, ſo their removal ſhould lead us to make him the ſole object of confidence.—In this temper, we may be certain of his ſupport and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
                  <p>THAT he is able to relieve and bleſs, appears, not only from his infinite perfection, and from his forming characters, once uſeful and important; but from his raiſing up others to ſupply the place of theſe, when removed. In many inſtances, when great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluential characters were taken from the people of Iſrael, and they appeared in danger of anarchy and ruin, the Lord interpoſed, and preſerved them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and peace. When Moſes died, Joſhua was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the command: when Elijah was taken, his <hi>spirit rested on Elisha:</hi> when David ſlept with his fathers, Solomon was eſtabliſhed on his throne: and reigned with wiſdom and glory, and in peace. The ſame divine power and goodneſs which formed <hi>Washington,</hi> may bleſs us with continued advantages in other characters, and increaſe our proſperity and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>THE welfare of our Country is an object too dear and important to be reſigned, but from neceſſity:— and added to the preſent loſs, would render it truly overwhelming. If it were a maxim with heathens, that "no one ought to deſpair reſpecting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public;" it is ſtill more improper that we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038196_0030_101142064305FCA0"/>
as Chriſtians—as ſubjects of the higheſt civil and religious privileges.</p>
                  <p>UNGRATEFUL would it be, not to perceive and acknowledge, the various teſtimonies, which GOD is yet giving, in favour of our ſupport.</p>
                  <p>IT was a bleſſing, in this ſenſe, that the perſon we this day lament, was not taken while at the head of government; but from a ſtation, where his example of obedience to the laws is calculated to ſtrengthen, rather than interupt the public harmony.</p>
                  <p>WE have reaſon to be thankful, in this ſenſe, for the Conſtitution of general government; which is now eſtabliſhed, and is armed with power to ſilence faction, as well as repel foreign invaſion.</p>
                  <p>WE have likewiſe a teſtimony of divine goodneſs in the character of the preſent Chief Magiſtrate, the <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>United States</hi>; to whoſe hands <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,</hi> with ſatisfaction, ſaw the reigns of government committed; and in whoſe high talents, and tried integrity, and regard to religion, we may not only be aſſured of a faithful and honorable diſcharge of the duties of that office, but the beneficial influence of an example, far more extenſive than his authority.</p>
                  <p>WE have likewiſe encouragement from the public ſpirit, the talents and experience of our Officers in general, civil and military; and the patriotiſm of a large majority of the people.</p>
                  <p>THE grief which overſpreads the country; which pervades all orders of characters, and appears in mourning in every place, is an evidence, we truſt, that the example of <hi>Washington</hi> will be imitated.— Then, under the divine bleſſing, our councils will be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038196_0031_10114207CC8F2DF0"/>
wiſe, our arms invincible; government will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and our intereſts will proſper.</p>
                  <p>MAY the Lord ſanctify his example, and his death, to theſe important purpoſes. May he bleſs the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Relict</hi> of his deceaſed ſervant: and be her God and never failing portion—and ſupport with his favor, the particular connections, under this bereavement. May he bleſs the Preſident of the United States, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the light of his countenance and his direction. May he bleſs all our Rulers and Officers, with the people of the country, and build us up as a nation.— May he ſubdue the ſpirit of ſin and violence, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the evils which reſult from it; and cauſe the earth to be the ſuburbs of that glorious ſtate, where love has univerſal influence, and peace eternal reigns —where all tears are wiped forever from the eye, and the righteous reſt in the boſom of God.</p>
