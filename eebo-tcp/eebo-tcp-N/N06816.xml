            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A JOURNAL, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Indians</hi> having made ſeveral Incurſions upon <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and the neighbouring Provinces, all who lived in the frontier Parts, were diſmaid and moſtly Aſſembled the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Familys unto ſome Houſe, they apprehended moſt convenient, and raiſed a kind of Stockade about the Houſe they Aſſembled unto: Such a ſort of Strength was, by a few Neighbours, raiſed about <hi>William M'Card's</hi> Houſe, in <hi>Rocky-Spring</hi> Settlement: And thither my Husband (<hi>John Lowry</hi>) had carried me and our Six Children, thinking it a place of greater Safty than our own Cottage: But alas! we were ſoon convinced of the Contrary.</p>
            <p>For on the 1ſt of <hi>April</hi> 1756, about One o'clock in the Afternoon, the Savage <hi>Indians</hi> ſurrounded the Houſe. My Husband being below and a good Marks-man, (as I've ſince been informed) killed one of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and was inſtantly killed himſelf. And there being no other Man at that Time preſent, the Barbarians ruſhed into the Houſe, (the Women and Children were moſtly up Stairs,) plundered the Houſe of what they pleaſed, and ſeized two of my Children that were below. Then moſt rudely calling unto us that were above. the young <hi>Indians</hi> ſhooting Arrows in at the upper Windows, which wounded ſome: Then ſuddenly they ſet the Houſe on fire, which was quickly all in a Blaze, while with my Three ſmall Children, I was ſtill in the upper Room in the utmoſt Confuſſion of Mind and Body. Oh! how my tortur'd Mind was hurry'd! Horrer of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Barbarities and Rudneſſes made me think of pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

the thouſandth Part of my Agony for my trembling Children: But divine Providence determined me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver myſelf and Children up into their cruel Hands, not knowing how the Lord might over-rule them and diſpoſe of us, rather than inſtantly periſh in the devouring flames: For now we were ſuffocated with the Smoke, burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thro' every where upon us, and terrify'd with the Thundering noiſe of the aſcending Flame. Another diſtreſſing thing to my overwhelmed Mind at this Time was, my being big with Child, and knowing that it was the uſual <hi>Indian</hi> Manner, to kill every Woman they took in that Condition; yet I adventured to open a Window and called out to the Barbarians to receive my Children, while I put them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But what reply I made, cannot now recollect; I'm only ſure that I made conſcience of Lying, but indeed its like enough there was an Endeavour to deceive them in the Anſwer I made, by concealing as much as I could my Pregnancy: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I blame my Conduct in my Circumſtances at that Time, when I conſidered of the divine Direction unto the Prophet <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

I was now in the Hands of the Savage <hi>Indians</hi> with my five Children, they immediately Commanded us Priſoners to March right over the Blew Mountain; ſo many of them going before us, and ſo many after us, as they thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Oh what a diſtreſſing Journey was this, to an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares'd and overwhelmed Mind! my Husband was Slain, his Sealp, with others carried before me by an <hi>Indian;</hi> his
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008642_0004_10FA524923E0758"/>
Gun, which I well knew, they had and ſeemed to prize much, and my five dear Children; with much Difficulty I got to the Top of the Mountain, where we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to reſt for ſome Time, and then were hurry'd down the Backſide of it, which was no leſs Difficult than aſcending its oppoſite Side, conſidering its Steepneſs and the huge Rocks, low Bruſh and old Trees and no path: When we arrived at the Bottom, it was equally diſtreſſing to poor me, being one continued Mire; where we loged that Night, but was obliged again next Morning to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend a Mountain no leſs Difficult than the former, while my barbarous Maſters ſuffered ſome young <hi>Indians</hi> to whip and puſh us along. Thus, near three Days was I hurried over Mountains and miry Vales.</p>
            <p>But on the 5th of the Month, being the Lords Day, about 50 Men, many of them my former Neighbours, came upon us, about Sun riſe or ſooner, and fired upon the <hi>Indians:</hi> At the firſt Attack only one <hi>Indian</hi> was killed and another wounded, upon which they all fled, and were ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id among the Laurel, (a great deal of it growing it the Place) our People then came up and untied me, and removed us to a riſing Ground at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: No expreſſions can ſufficiently ſhew my Joy, when inſtead of Savage <hi>Indians</hi> I found myſelf in the midſt of Friends and Neighbours, who had Aſſembled ſo quickly and purſued ſo diligently for our Reſcue: But alas! my Joy was very ſhort; for while our People was buſy in untying myſelf and Children, taking care of us, none of the Priſoners being bound beſides me that Night, as I can remember, juſt then did our ſavage Enemy's return upon and ſurround our People; this gave them great Advantage, altho' our People did the beſt they then could for two Hours. A great many of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were killed and wounded: One poor Man they caught alive, and bound him to a ſmall Tree, ſo ſoon as our People were fled; they brought me about 200 Perches back to the fire Place, that I might behold the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008642_0005_102FA527C7ECCF00"/>
poor Man tortured, here my trembling Soul was in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of quiting the Body: Yet this I was forced by the cruel Savages to endure; and glory to God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, he enabled beyond all Expectation. For being ſeated before the Tree unto which the poor Man was bound, I heard him ſay every thing he could think of, to excite them to pity and be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Its eaſier for any conſidering Perſon to imagine, than for me to tell what Horror I felt at this inhuman Barbarity, which I was obliged to behold, his Looks, his Groans, his Shrieks pierced my Heart, and I expected to be immediately to uſed: But God had mercifully ordered otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>About Twelve o'Clock this Day, the <hi>Indians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the diſtreſſing Place both to me and many of my former Neighbours and Countrymen, who fell gallantly Fighting there.

Skirmiſh, ſtanding up among all the Twenty-one Captives and his Savage Brethren with a fierce Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he ſaid <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Now God has delivered you all into our Hands, and not one of us hurt.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>—But we knew one was Shot dead at the firſt Attack,—howb it was fact, that for our many Sins, no doubt a juſt God delivered us into thier cruel Hands—This I had oftentimes before this thought of.—I further Mind the cruel Savages, when calling me to behold the Tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the poor Man, an <hi>Indian</hi> ſtruck me with the Butt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>end of his Gun, which occaſioned my being in a Swoon for ſome Time; but hearing them call me again, got up and when come to the Place where they were Torturing the Man, one <hi>Indian</hi> gave me ſome Bread, while another threw the Scalps in my Face, ſnarching away the Bread, bid me Eat theſe, if I was Hungary: One of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>in they had beheaded, and at the ſame Time this bloody Head was thrown in my Face; while my Life was in great doubt, with the Fright and late barbarous Blow I had received.</p>
            <p>About Twelve o'Clock, as before, was obliged to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel again, and to add to my affliction, I was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry my own youngeſt Child, near two Years old; which I did: But with very great Difficulty in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the Deſarts we went thro'; Mountains and miry Vales as before; near Sun ſetting we came to a fierce running Creek, which the <hi>Indians</hi> who where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and moſt of the other Priſoners paſſed over: Another party of the <hi>Indians</hi> being behind me; I was ſo faint and weary, the Creek ſo fierce and deep, that I durſt not adventure to Wade it, and ſo ſat down untill the other Party ſhould come up to help me over. One of the <hi>Indians,</hi> called by the reſt Captain, cryed to me inſtantly, to come over, which I did not comply with; he Shot at me, that I heard the Ball go over me, then thinking it as good to periſh in the Water, as among their Hands, went into the Creek, ſtill carrying my

Here two other <hi>Indians,</hi> that had been left to Hunt, got ſome freſh Veniſon, and ſtruck up Fire and prepared Victuals, after their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and reſted here all Night.</p>
            <p>Upon the 5th Traveled as before, untill Night, they lodged by a little Run. Nothing very remarkable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that Day; we were not allowed to halt for Drink, but behoved without ſtoping to lift a little in our Hands. One thing often and deeply affected me, was the young Child crying for Bread, and I had none to ſupply her.</p>
            <p>The 6th repeated our oppreſive Travelling, over Rocks, &amp;c. This Day Snow'd from Morning to Night, yet was obliged to go on all that Day, ſave once they ſtopt, and cut a few Buſhes to fit upon, and ſoon went along upon huge Stones, the whole Day. the Cold and hardneſs of ſteping ſtill upon Stones this Day, cauſed the Nails to come off my great Toes, ſome Time after this.</p>
            <p>The 7th we moved from a ſmall Run, (nigh to a Creek, Spring or Run, theſe Pagans always, I found encamped) and traveled with great Difficulty till After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, altho' my Savage Maſters had taken the Child from me the Day before, they ſeeing that I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to carry her; and indeed I had load enough to bear my own weary Body and oppreſs'd Mind, with the Child in my Belly.</p>
            <p>I now found that while we are at eaſe and ſtrugling with the common affairs of Life, with the cares and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of a ſmall Family, we are apt to think, we could bear no more burdens, endure no more toils; But Oh! what burdens cares and toils did I now undergoe, by divine Aſſiſtance? And yet a new courſe of them took place that Afternoon, for I think it was then, the <hi>Indians</hi>

came unto one of their Hunting places, conſiſting of a few ſorry Hutts, and I being weak and behind with an old <hi>Indian</hi> attending me, theſe in the Hutts being warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, came out againſt me with the moſt hideous Shrieks, having each a Rod prepared (I ſuppoſe) on purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing painted and their Hair dreſſed or rather diſfigured with Feathers; they uſed me moſt cruelly, by laying upon me with theſe Rods, and I being ſo weak and ſpent with former fatigue, could not run into the Hutt; ſo they had leiſure to exerciſe their Barbarous cuſtom upon my feeble Body, this Barbarity left many wounds upon me. Yet Glory to God, I was ſupported under it, and had more Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of that ſort to undergo, Here.

about ſix Years old, next Morning they took from me my oldeſt Daughter about ten Years old. Then they carried me over the <hi>Alegenty River.</hi> In this my diſtreſſed condition, the Lord ſupported me wonderfully, like him of old, who ſaid, and if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.</p>
            <p>On the 17th, continuing ſtill at aforeſaid place, I heard the Death hollow, and apprehending it was more poor Priſoners like myſelf coming to a beating or to Death, I retired into a Wigwam, and preſently my Son came in to me, with his Head bloody; Altho' he had been juſt then beaten, he rejoiced to ſee me, caught me by the Hand, ſaying, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Dear Mother, I know it's for our Sins, that God has delivered us into the Hands of the <hi>Indians;</hi> but he is able to deliver us out of their Hands again. I will not do as they, altho they ſhould kill me; when they bid me ſing, I ſing Hymns. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he was called off, parting with the following words farewell Mammy, may be I'll be back here in four Days. But ſaw him no more ſince; he hung weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about my Neck the Minute he ſtay'd. Thus my ſorrow was renewed a freſh, my three oldeſt Children and fellow Captives were taken away.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>
            </p>
            <p>Sabbath day the 18th ſtill in the ſame place by the River, they ordered me to make out a Shirt I had been at the Day before; this I refuſed to do, which occaſioned contreſting betwixt the <hi>Indian</hi> and me, he ſaid I was no white Woman now, but an <hi>Indian,</hi> and that there was no Sabbath among <hi>Indians</hi> &amp;c. he inſiſted I ſhould do his Shirt for him or die, refuſing he got a Rod and laid upon me moſt Inhumanly; then took his Tomme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk and the Shirt, threatening preſent Death unleſs I would preſently work. But ſtill refuſing, he threw away both and drag'd me down into the River, and held me under the Water untill near choaked, three ſeveral Times; then he drag'd me almoſt lifeleſs aſhore and ſo left me. So ſoon as able to ſtand, I crawled up to the Wigwam, and thought upon that Days ſufferings, firſt beaten

untill I fainted away, and had Water thrown on; than threatened with preſent Death, at laſt to be three Times held down under Water. And yet the Lord ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me; Glory to his Name. On the 20th, I was taken away with my poor young Children, to go to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Indian Town,</hi> in this Journey ſuffered as before, only were more pinched for Proviſions, howbeit got along, having my former little cruel guard of two young <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> who buſied themſelves in beating me all the Journey. Where we arrived on the 23d, at Night, and here as I underſtood afterwards, ſome Men of that Town had been killed; and after their manner the Squaws or Wives aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled about me, and with their fiſts fell upon me in a moſt fearful ſort, with hideous ſhouts; while I had to run about 30 Perches or more, and ſeem'd to endeavour to beat my Brains out, once I fell over a Log amidſt this beating, and know not how I recovered my feet again, at laſt I got into a Wigwam, almoſt bereft of my ſenſes.</p>
            <p>On the Lords Day, 24th, they Commanded me to go and work, which I refuſed, as I had done at the ſide of the River <hi>Alegemey,</hi> the former Lords Day. I then took my two young Children, and went a little way into the Woods and ſat down with them; when ſuddenly the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> came furiouſly up to me and beat me unmercifully, taking my poor Babes from me, telling me, I ſhould have nothing to do with them any more, for they were theirs. What could be more diſtreſſing to a tender hearted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? I had formerly three taken from me; and now the Remaining two were likewiſe to be wholly under the Care, or rather Cruelty of theſe Savages! the poor Children cryed moſt bitterly when taken.</p>
            <p>On the 3d, of <hi>May,</hi> was a violent Rain which put us all in Confuſion, being ſurrounded in an Iſland by the ſwelling of the River, the <hi>Indians</hi> then Commanded me to take up my Bed, <abbr>viz</abbr> a Dear skin, and my youngeſt Child but one, and go over the River (they had carried off my youngeſt Child, that Morning) this was another diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

thing; the River was high, and I weakened with hunger &amp;c. But their was no reaſoning with them; came therefore, not knowing how the Lord might diſpoſe of me, to the Rivers brink, expecting that both my ſelf and Child would periſh: But my ever kind Lord, had other wiſe ordered in his adorable Providence; for juſt when I was about to ſtep into the River, a great bodied <hi>Mingo</hi> Squaw came to me, and without ſpeaking a Word took up the Child and carried her over, while I came over cloſe after her; and thus got ſafe over. But when over, our condition was diſtreſſing ſtill, had no Fire, no Wigwam, no Vituals of any ſort.</p>
            <p>On the Lords Day the 4th, the <hi>Indians</hi> ſent me to gather wild Onions to eat: I went gladly off from them, and had an agreeable opportunity of eſſaying to Cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and pour out my Complaints before him, and returned without gathering any. But Providence ordered other Food that Afternoon, <abbr>viz.</abbr> two young Fawns, &amp; And then as at other occaſions, I could perceive the Love and Sympathy of the Savages among themſelves; for all was divided, and what was firſt boiled, was preſently divided, to ſupply the preſent Neceſſity. In this place we ſtayed another Sabbath, and I retired as before; but was followed by my <hi>Indian</hi> Maſter, who threatned me much, as I apprehended by his ſigns and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, this was a great Affliction to me; likewiſe on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 12th, as the <hi>Indians</hi> had often threatened to fell me to the <hi>French,</hi> and what cruel Uſage I would meet with from them; that I really feared it might be ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But there was not a Woman there beſides my ſelf, not had they any Interpreter in the place; which was a great Affliction unto me. I was now ſeparated from all my Children, which was an inexpreſſible trouble unto me, for the <hi>Indians</hi> detained them all among them, Oh! how

diſtreſſing to think that the fruit of my Body, and the delight of my Mind, as my Children were, that they ſhould be brought up in Paganiſm, who were dedicated unto God and to be brought up in his fear and Service. Here I remained in a very peaceful and undiſturbed way as could be expected untill the 4th of <hi>July,</hi> that I was taken in Child labour; this was an awful affliction, as there was not another Woman in the Place, nor could I underſtand a word they ſaid, at that Time; but at length they found a Woman and brought her to me, who indeed was of very little Service any way; yet God in his adorable Providence, after 24 Hours labour, delivered me of a Daugher, without the Ordinary aſſiſtance of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for which I deſire ſtill to praiſe the Lord. But it pleaſed the Sovereign diſpoſer of all things, to call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Death this Child, on the 4th Day after her Birth. Notwithſtanding the Kindneſs and Civility I met with here, whenever my Maſter the Officer, and the reſt underſtood that the Child was like to die, they would have it Baptized, which I oppoſed, whereat the Officer ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mightily: But neither he nor I could underſtand one another.

After the Childs Death they made a Coffin, and buried in it the Fort, ſetting a Croſs of Wood at the Head, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In this Place I continued from the 15th of <hi>May</hi> 1756 untill the 27th of <hi>July,</hi> the next Year, being all this while a Servant, I had ſometimes the pleaſure of ſeeing and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of converſing with my three youngeſt Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but had the additional affliction unto their ſlavery of ſeeing them poorly, both for Food and Cloathing, &amp;c.</p>

I then ſaw there was no way for me, but wait the Diſpoſal of divine Providence. Here I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in quality of Servant to the aforeſaid Lady for ſome Time. My anxiety after Liberty, at length, put me upon conſulting with ſome others of my Sex, who were alſo in ſervitude, about Running-away from them; when about 10 Men and 4 Women of us, provided ourſelves as well as we could, and ſet off on the 25th of <hi>October,</hi> But e'er we had gone a Mile were apprehended and I only was put in the Guard-Houſe, where I was very well uſed; on the Morrow, ſent for the Interpreter who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined me, where I was going when apprehended?

Sir ſays I, I don't deny Baptiſm; ſaid he you would not have your Child Baptiz'd Sir ſays I, I had all the reſt of my Children Baptized when I had a faithful Miniſter to Adminiſter the Ordinance, and I eſteem them worſe than a Savage who will neglect that Duty in deſpite to the Ordinance, but when God in his all wiſe Providnece, deprives me of an Opportunity, it will neither be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to me, nor the Child; for I do not eſteem Baptiſm ſo abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, that a Child connot be ſav'd without it. the Interpreter told the Officer that I denied Original Sin; Sir ſaid I you miſconſtrue my Words, for I maintain that all the fallen Race is guilty of Orginal ſin: Replies he, what waſhes it away, ſeeing Baptiſm does not. Sir anſwer'd I, the Blood of Chriſt, But Sir ſays I do you maintain that a Child dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm is enternally Damn'd, a Woman that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent replies, it ſhould not dye without it, if I ſhould do it myſelf, Oh! Friend ſays I there are ſome extraordinary Caſes, ſuch as Children dying in the Womb, to whom it is impoſſible to Adminiſter the Ordinance of Baptiſm, do you maintain that theſe Children are eternally miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at this he pauſed, I inſiſted for his anſwer. Replies he they will never ſee Light, Sir ſays I this is more than you know, for by this your diſcourſe you would make their eternal Salvation or Damnation to depend upon the Adminiſtration or non Adminiſtration of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>

            <p>On the Sabbath the commanding Officer of the ſaid Fort order'd me to Work, I told him No, not on the Lords Day, he told me as we muſt Eat on the Sabbath ſo we muſt Work. I told him ſuch unneceſſary ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity in Cooking (which was the Work then required) was not a Work of neceſſity, and therefore was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained, he told me that upon my non Compliance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he wou'd impriſon me, I told him if he would, I would not comply, for I had not done it for the <hi>Indians</hi> neither wou'd I for him; then he made a pauſe and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſtedfaſtly in the Face, ſaid, poor Women, put the in Goal for not Working on the Sabbath Day? No no, and ſo inſtantly enquired who I was, and whence I came, and ſo went out. Then a little while after came an Officer and enquired who and what I was as to my Religion. I readily told him. Oh! ſays he you are not acquaint with my Religion or then you would ſoon embrace it and forſake your own. Oh! Sir ſays I, I am not ignorant of your Principles, altho' I am unacqnain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with your Nation. Says he there is but one true Religion. Sir ſays I, I own it there is but one God, one Faith, and one Baptiſm. Aha ſays he, and is your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

that only true one, yes Sir ſaid I it is, Ah then ſays he and what is ours, Sir ſays I you may judge of that as you pleaſe but as for mine it is agreeable to the Word of God which is to be the Rule and Standard that we are to be governed by, and adhere to, Oh! ſays he, if you were in <hi>Montreal</hi> you would ſoon change your Mind and alter your Religion, for ſaid he I will bring it to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, ſuppoſe there was both white and black Bread ſerved up at Table; wou'd you not rather chuſe the White than the Black, yes Sir ſays I, for I chuſed the White when at home and I intend to uſe the ſame Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at <hi>Montreal,</hi>

            <p>He enquired whether I was a Lutheran, a Calviniſt or a Roman-Catholick, I anſwered, Sir, I am a Calviniſt, ſaid he, you Lutherans and Calviniſts who ſeperate from the true Church on Pretence of Reformation, have fallen into groſs Errors, ſaid I, I know the Roman Church was once a pure and true one, but then I would enquire if it might not have fallen into Error and Defection ſo as to require Reformation; he anſwer'd no it could not, and further aſked me if I denied the Scripture. I anſwered no, I do acknowledge the Scriptures an infallible Rule of Faith. Then he repeated the Scripture from which they alledge their Church to be founded on <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore was infallible &amp;c. I told him that Scripture did not nor could imply that the Church was builded on <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and on this Rock, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Faith of <hi>Peter</hi> will I build my Chuch &amp;c. thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> that is thou art that <hi>Peter</hi> who profeſſeth thy Faith in me as the Saviour and Redeemer of the World, and upon that Rock namely upon him whom thou believeſt will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt it, Then ſaid he, you will not take the Miniſter for your Rule, I ſaid, I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 words">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008642_0021_102FA5523972E0F0"/>
to explain them, ſaid he, then you take the Prieſts Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for your Rule, I told him, if the Prieſts Explanation of theſe miſtical Scriptures was agreeable with the other Parts more plain, I was bound to beleive him, otherways not, then ſaid he, you are a Judge of the Miniſters; I told him no, the Word of God was their Judge, then I aded and aſked him if he thought the Prieſt was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he anſwered no, well ſaid I, you ſhall not be my Rule for I have a perfect one, which is the Law and the Teſtimony; ſaid he you muſt know, that as we ſpeak in the Miniſterial Office we are perfect, but as we are Men we many be Damned for our Sins notwithſtanding. I aked him by what Rule I ſhould jugde who was in the Right but by the Word of God; ſaid he, you muſt look back to the old Standard which never erred from the Truth, ſaid I we have no commad for that, and relying on them would be very uncertain becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> has told us, falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe in the latter Days to deceive if poſſible even the very Elect, ſaid he, that was in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Time not in this Period, and added that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be with his Miniſters even to the End of the World; ſaid I, he undoubtedly will be with his own Church whereſoever they may be ſcattered, but not with any one ſet of Men in particular, ſaid I, you know the <hi>Jews</hi> are a damned People and forſaken of God, altho they were once his peculiar People, ſaid he, as to the <hi>Jews</hi> it is true they have a conditional Promiſe, but we have an abſolute one, ſaid I, the <hi>Jews</hi> only had the Promiſe that as long as they were for God he would be for them, and certainly we have not other promiſe. So you will not take the Prieſt for your Rule you ſay, but you both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict yourſelf in that as well as the Word of God. I begged him to tell me wherein that did appear, he ſaid in the Begining of the Bible, I deſired him to repeat the Words; the Tranſlation ſays he, informs you that this is a new Tranſlation, you accept what they did as right, and yet now deny the Authority of the Prieſt to

judge for you, Sir ſaid I, only except of the Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as my Rule, not their Word. Suppoſe ſaid I, there was a piece of Latin of divine Inſpiration which few underſtand, and you give a Tranſlation of it into my Tongue, pray would that make any alteration as to the Matter thereof or could my Faith be ſaid to be more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit for adhering to that as a Rule; beſides is it not expedient to Tranſlate ſeeing many People are only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of common and not a liberal Education; ſaid he ignorat People ought not to read the Word, and added that <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Commiſſion to his Diſciples, go teach all Nations, imply'd that all Nations were only to be taught, not admitted to read. I told him I could not ſee how that could be imply'd, ſince we are commanded to ſtarch the Scriptures, and beſides the Apoſtles as inſpired from on high, were commanded to Teach and Preach the Word of God, and were not only admitted but oblig'd by their Authority and command to read and believe the ſame, which Authority no other Mortal has unleſs they confirm it by miraculous Works as they did; ſaid he, the People are commanded to have the Word at the Prieſts mouth, ſaid I, that does not forbid the Reading of it, alſo what need the Prieſt be afraid that the People ſhould read the Word if the Prieſt acted according to that Word, and beſides we are commanded not only to be hearers of the Word but doers alſo, now what an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is it to me to be admitted to read that Word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to which Precepts I am to form my Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I further aſked him whether he did not think that ſome part of his true Church as he called it, might at ſome Time be left deſtitute of a Teacher; he anſwered no, for where there was People they would always have a Teacher, true ſaid I, the Lord always has and always will have a Church upon Earth, but the true Church may be brought very low as it was when none appeared Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic for it but <hi>Eliſha,</hi> yet added I, ſuppoſing it to be the Caſe that ſome part of your Land or People were left deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute

of a Prieſt by Death or ſome other Means that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Circumſtances your Church muſt be dead alſo, but here is the Bleſſed Excellency of ours, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our glorious Head lives for evermore, and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end: At this he pauſed for ſome Time and then ſaid that yet it was ſome part of the Church, yes ſaid I where two or three are gethered togther in the Name of the Lord there is their Church. He after told me that he could not talk <hi>Engliſh</hi> well, and deſir'd that I might help him, I told him we ought not then to talk together, ſaid he, I only want to inſtruct you as it is my Office, and ſhould gladly go to your Country for that purpoſe, could I be admitted as I am now going to convert the <hi>Indians</hi> and am willing to convert all Nations, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to his going to my Country I knew of no hindrance as yet, then he got up off the Chair and ſaid I was in a damnable Condition. Sir ſaid I, I hope in God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Mercy ſaid he, who think you have a right to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, many talk of the Mercy of God, but who think you have a right to it? I anſwered, all they that believe in God and turſt in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and accept of him alone for Salvation as he is offered in the Goſpel, they, and they only have a ſpecial right to the Mercy of God. Then he aſked me of what Country I was by right, I told him, what ſaid he, you an <hi>Iriſhwoman</hi> and a Calviniſt, had I Time I would talk with you further, and he again ſat down and we had a Repitition of the former nearly.</p>
            <p>After my arrivalat <hi>Montreal</hi> they enquired if I was a Catholick, I anſwered yes, no further equiry was made for ſome Time, untill the Interpreter came; ſaith a <hi>French</hi> Woman to the Interpreter this Woman is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, Ah ſays he but not a Roman Catholick, Sir ſays I, I have not a Genealogy, to tell whether I am come of <hi>Paul</hi> or of <hi>Appolas</hi> and ſays I <hi>Paul</hi> was a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and for ought I know <hi>Appolas</hi> was a Gentile, and whether I proceeded from <hi>Paul</hi> or from <hi>Appolas</hi> I can't tell, but I maintain the ſame Doctrine <hi>Paul</hi> did; Sir
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008642_0024_102FA55CA3F696B8"/>
ſaid I what was <hi>Paul</hi> and what was <hi>Appolas</hi> they were both the Servants of God ſays he, Sir ſays I why do you make exception where God makes none, for God to not a Reſpecter of Perſons, true ſaid he, Sir ſaid I what do you mean by that word, Roman Catholick, Oh ſays he I can readily reſolve you that Queſtion, for I myſelf was taught to be a Prieſt, but wou'd not the take Oath of Continuance, and therefore was not admitted to the Charge, ſaid he ſuch as are Roman Catholicks own the Pope to be the Head of the Church, Sir ſays I, I abſolutely deny it, for there is none that is head of the Church but Chriſt, Sir ſays I, whether is it from the old or the new Teſtament that you prove the bringing of Prieſts under the Oath of Continuance, as for my part I know no precept either form old or new for it, Sir, you can only inſtance that one caſe of <hi>Paul;</hi> and he declares his Liberty ſaying, know ye not that I have Liberty to lead a Wife or a Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well as any other Apoſtle; Oh ſays he, they have their Liberty to chuſe when they are come to maturity, Sir ſaid I, as Man is changeable and as God has left Man his free choice, it is a ſin for him to enter into a Yoke of Bondage! He then gave me two of their Books. which was a Declaration of their Principles, one tituled a Vindication of the Roman Catholick Religion, againſt the Preſbyterian proved out of Scripture, thus take and read. This was filled with proofs, mentioning Book, Chapter and Verſe, but not expreſſing the Words, but after I peruſed it a little, and found the proofs to be quite contrary to the thing to be proved I deſired the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſpend a part of a Day to look over it and obſerve the Cunningneſs of the Prieſts, in telling the Chapter and Verſe, but not rehearſing the Words nor allowing them the uſe of the Bible. the next was an explanation of the Catechiſm giving only the Prieſts belief for ſuch and ſuch things without any proofs.</p>
            <p>In one particular place of which that I obſerved he ſaith, I believe that Chriſt went down to the torments of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008642_0025_102FA55E2CECEE48"/>
Hell and ſuffred there three Days, Sir ſays I, that is a dowright falſhood, what ſaith he, will you deny the Scriptures; Sir ſaid I, you can give me no Scripture for that, but ſays he do you deny the Creed; Sir ſaid I, look at the Explanation of our Creed, that, that only meant the Grave, for as Hell is only a place of puniſhment ſo in various parts of Scripture, puniſhment is made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of as an Hell, do you be believe ſaid I, that <hi>Jonah</hi> was in Hell when in the Whales Belly; he expoſtulates and ſays, out of the Belly of Hell have I cried unto thee. And that is a memorable compariſon, where it is ſaid as <hi>Jonah</hi> was three Days and thee Nights in the Whales Belly, ſo ſhall the Son of Man be three Days and three Nights in the Heart of the Earth.</p>
            <p>And according to that your Doctrine, the damned in Hell had three Days Heaven, for where Chriſt is, there is a Heaven, and the Goſpel preach'd; which is horrid abſurdity and contradictory to Scripture, for we have it plain in the Evangiliſts, whoſoever goes to Hell, cannot return back to Heaven, neither he that goes to Heaven, can't return to Hell, he added no more. Being aſſaulted by another after much the ſame, only added how contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory it is to Chirſts own Words to the Thief on the Croſs, who ſaid to Day thou ſhall be with me in Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>They inſiſted hard that I ſhould attend Maſs Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Evening, as that is an Evening in which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form much of their ſuperſtious Worſhip, I refuſed to go, they told me if I would attend I would ſee ſtrange things ſuch as I never yet had ſeen; I told them I was not fond of ſeeing that which would be an aggravation of my grief; why ſaid they an aggravation to your grief, how can that be, ſaid I what is diſhonouring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>umphant, and the meaning of that Text is Church diſcipline which our Miniſters obſerve; for if any of our members are guilty of any publick ſcandal the Satiſfaction muſt be as publick as the Crime, and upon their obſtinancy in not complying with the Diſcipline uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> they are caſt out of the Church by excommunication untill ſuch Times as they repent of their Crimes, and make publick Satisfaction, and then not claiming Gods prerogative to forgive their Sins, but telling them if their Repentance be real God will forgive them. Oh ſays the Interpreter your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is harder than ours: For we maintain that feigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will do, but they, that nothing but unfeigned.</p>
            <p>On a certain Night a Company of them being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Subject of their Diſcourſe was concerning the Priſoners, Ah ſays my Landlady all the Reſt of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners has been at Maſs, except my <hi>Jennet</hi> (for ſo ſhe uſed to ſtile me) and I will have her along, indeed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam ſays I you ſhall, ſhall I go there to pleaſe you and mock God? Oh, no ſays ſhe not to mock God but to ſerve him, ſaid I if it were a Place where I could ſerve God I would go, out of obedience to his Command, and I am ſorry that so many complies to go to your Maſs. But as for my part I ſhall endeavour to be ſtedfaſt, and what I profeſs'd as home to adhere to, or ſtick by here, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the Company began to mock at the Manner of our receiving the Lords Supper, you ſays ſhe Eat a little Bread and Drink a little Wine, but ſays ſhe if I was dry I wou'd Drink hearty.

do not touch it with my Teeth, for I lay it upon my Tongue and it melts away. Then ſaid I, your Body contains the Body of Chriſt and by your Opinion you will make Chriſt a monſter, for how many think you may pertake at one Time, ſome Times there may be perhaps a Thouſand ſome Times more and ſome Times leſs, and by your Diſcourſe Chriſt muſt have a diſtinct Body for each of theſe, which is horrid Blaſphemy. Do ye imagine ſay I, that his Deciples eat his real Body and drunk his real Blood when he ſat with them at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſaith this is my Body which was broken for you and my Blood which was ſhed for you the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Crucifiction, this was only done in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance as he ſaith as oft as you do eat this Bread and drink this Cup, you do it in Remembrance of me, and ſo our Miniſters according to the example of Chirſt (whoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors they are) after bleſſing the Bread, they Break it and give it unto the People, and the Wine after the ſame Manner; and that only as a Repreſentation of Chriſts Body being broken and his Blood ſhed for the Remiſſion of our Sins; but if we Eat by Faith we receive him Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally; and whoſoever do not receive him after this Manner, they Eat and Drink Judgment to themſelves.

confeſs it is for Sin in Practice not walking agreeable to our Principles that God is afflicting us now.

Wife, and the Child from the Mother and to embrue their Hands in their Blood; for War it is not, but mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the moſt henious Degree, and yet you plead yourſelves Guiltleſs, becauſe, ſay you we are not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at this murder, but in verity ye are more guilty than they, for they are poor ignorant People, deprived of the means of Grace which you have, and you employ them and pays them: And are you not then, as you are the Maſters and Employers more guilty than they.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid he I ſhould be glad if your People would come and take the Country. Ah ſay I, and take your Liberties from you, as to your Religon, and that is a Priviledge that I would not give for the World. Sir ſaid I, I think more pity of you than all the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal.</hi> For why ſaid he, becauſe ſaid I you know better and yet Practice as they do, for you have had the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Scriptures, and has ſeeming been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of their Idolatry in ſome meaſure, ſaid he what would you have me to do, for I have not confeſs'd to the Prieſt, nor received their Sacrament for ſeveral Months, ſays I, do agreeable to the Commandment of God come out from among them, my People: Touch not, taſte not, hand not. Said he there can be no harm in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Preach, ſaid I, it is a countenancing of them and ſo you are a ſtumbling Block to others that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, you ought to ſeperate from them, teſtify againſt them. Oh ſaid he if it were Peace, I would go to your Country, and I never had another opportunity of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with him untill I left the Country.</p>

Madam ſaid I, allow me to ſpeak a little from your Reference for this great Prince, he gives out a Proclamation that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deſires a requeſt to aſk it of him and none other, and the meaneſt, pooreſt and moſt deſpiſed of the Human Race, ſhall have their Requeſt if they aſk it: I out of Rebellion againſt the Kings Command, will go and aſk of another, when he has Commanded that we ſhall aſk of none elſe, will this not incur his Wrath and not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſo to diſobey his Command. This is the caſe with the Bleſſed King <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who has Commanded to aſk of him, who giveth liberally, and upbraideth none, and there is no other Mediator or Dayſman: Another who was preſent anſwered, ſhe has you now, ſo they added no more.</p>
