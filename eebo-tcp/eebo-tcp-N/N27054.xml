            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>—:BUT ONE SINNER DESTROYETH MUCH GOOD.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE tendency of our holy religion to promote or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, good government, and ſocial happineſs is indiſputable. To invalidate this proof of the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſcriptures, we find the infidel pleading, that this excellent ſyſtem of doctrines was doubtleſs the contrivance of ſome crafty politician to reſtrain, the otherwiſe ungovernable paſſions of the human heart. Let him enjoy his argument—ſtill will we glory in a Revelation, which, while it opens the way to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bliſs, affords the moſt important maxims of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to direct our preſent conduct, and the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual reſtraints for the corrupt propenſities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature. In his word, no leſs than by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is Jehovah pleaſed to expreſs a parental care for our happineſs in this world. There we are taught the important leſſons of induſtry, economy, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and warned againſt thoſe ruinous paths to which youth and inexperience, as well as a wrong temper often expoſe us. The ſacred volume is indeed a ſtranger to that machivalian policy, ſo neceſſary to promote the purpoſes of a lawleſs ambition; but in every ſphere in which we can be called to act, he who wiſhes to unite dignity and uſefulneſs, with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, may find in the ſcriptures a light to his feet, and a lamp to his paths. Copying after the model there preſcribed, he will ever act honorably, he will compel reſpect, he cannot fail to be uſeful. Infinite

wiſdom made uſe of the obſerving and penetrating genius of Solomon to communicate thoſe ethical and political remarks, which more immediately relate to the economy of human life, and which ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in his writings.—Among theſe, the aphoriſm in the text leads to ſeveral obſervations not entirely foreign to the preſent occaſion.—The object of the following diſcourſe will be—</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate the general obſervation in the text, that one ſinner deſtroys much good.</p>
            <p>AND, to attempt an anſwer to this queſtion, which the ſubject naturally ſuggeſts, viz. whence wicked men derive their ability of deſtroying good, or doing miſchief.</p>
            <p>AGREEABLY to the propoſed method let us</p>
            <p>FIRST attend to the illuſtration of this truth, that one ſinner deſtroys much good.</p>
            <p>IT is obſervable that no particular kind of good is here ſpecified. We are left to apply the obſervation to every ſpecies of good which creatures can enjoy, and ſtill it will be found a truth that one ſinner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys much good.—Sin is miſery.—It is the bane of every thing which deſerves the appellation of good; and blaſts every bleſſing, which the kind parent of the univerſe beſtows upon his creatures.—It has expelled the morning ſtars of glory from their original heaven, and baniſhed man from his primeval paradiſe. Of all the multiplied ſorrows attendant on human life, ſin is the fruitful ſource.—The celebrated Milton did not exhibit the creature of a poetical fancy, but a ſolemn truth, when he repreſented ſin bringing forth death. But however general the obſervation, the inſpired writer doubtleſs had ſome particular kind of good more ſpecially in view; and which, from the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, appears to be political or national good.—The text ſtands in connection with this ſentence, "wiſdom is better than weapons of war;" that is, wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent meaſures often ſecure to a nation ſpeedily, and honorably, without danger, and without expence, thoſe bleſſings and privileges, which raſh and fooliſh men plunge into all the horrors of war to obtain. A truth happily illuſtrated, I conceive, by the conduct of our
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036049_0005_10080BEF3089ACA8"/>
Federal Government under the cruel injuries, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial depredations, both of England and France, wiſdom is better than weapons of war; this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is immediately followed by the text; but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good;—When in ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional embarraſſments the voice of wiſdom is diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and ſome raſh counſellor prevails to hurry a nation into arms, we then have a glaring conviction of this truth, that one ſinner deſtroyeth much good. Glory to him who ſtill affords America his divine guidance and protection, that he has preſerved us from following ſuch pernicious counſels; by many ſo ſtrenuouſly advocated.</p>
            <p>But granting that the inſpired writer had a more particular reference to political good, which it appears he had, ſtill, the unlimited nature of the expreſſion was doubtleſs deſigned to teach us, that ſin is deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of every good.</p>
            <p>OF this truth, the proofs are ſo numerous, that the only taſk is to ſelect thoſe which are calculated to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the mind with the deepeſt conviction.—Every page in the hiſtory of man is a comment on the text, and the experience of every day affords a new confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of its truth.</p>
            <p>WHAT ruin does the ſinner bring upon himſelf? "He who doeth this deſtroyeth his own ſoul, is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of inſpiration." Such is the nature and faculties of the human ſoul, its vaſt ſuſceptibility both of pleaſure and ſuffering, its amazing activity, and growing capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, its high deſtination, and endleſs exiſtence, that its importance exceeds all calculation.—The enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the ſufferings of a kingdom, and indeed of the whole human race, as it reſpects the preſent life, cannot be compared with what each individual ſoul in the whole duration of its exiſtence, will either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in the poſſeſſion of the Supreme Good, or ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tokens of his diſpleaſure. He who rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his maker—hardens his heart in impenitency, and rejects the offers of reconciliation and peace, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troys his own ſoul, and with it, all that good which he is capacitated to receive in the enjoyment of his Maker. The mind under the influence of a wicked
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036049_0006_10080BF16C978700"/>
temper is no leſs incapacitated for happineſs, than the blind of enjoying the pleaſures of ſight; or the deaf of receiving entertainment from the harmony of ſounds.</p>
            <p>BUT theſe conſiderations, ſubſtantiated as they are by the declarations of eternal truth, are no proofs of the point in the view of the unbeliever.—He regards them as the dreams of enthuſiaſm, and demands evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of which he can feel the force.—Such evidence there is in a melancholy abundance as will convince him, if he is not as deſtitute of reaſon as he is of faith.</p>
            <p>WHEN we ſee the ſlave of avarice, or ambition, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying the comfort of life to hoard uſeleſs wealth, and acquire an empty name; or the prodigal, waſting his goods and deſtroying his health in riotous living. When we look into families where boiſterous paſſion reigns, and drives far away peace and domeſtic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort—or into families where the vicious courſes of a parent has introduced poverty and diſtreſs, and entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſeaſes on his poſterity, how naturally do ſuch ſcenes evidence the propriety of the wiſe man's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that one ſinner, &amp;c.—Whence flow the tears of the weeping penitent but from a reflection on the far greater good he might have enjoyed himſelf, and been inſtrumental of to others, had he not harkened to the allurements of folly? and oft at the gloomy cloſe of a guilty life has the ſinner himſelf been compelled, by the torturing reflections of his own mind to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the ways of tranſgreſſors are hard. As we raiſe our views to the higher ſcenes of life, we find, as men became poſſeſſed of power, or are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for their abilities, their capacities for doing miſchief are proportionably increaſed. How often do we find the heavy calamities which fell an antient Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael attributed to the corrupting influence of Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam and Ahab? When we trace the victories of an Alexander, and the ambition of a Caeſar, or take a view of the more modern lives of Louis XIV, or the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Pruſſian Frederick, we find the groans of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved millions, of depopulated kingdoms, and nations bleeding at a thouſand wounds atteſting the truth of the

               </gap>s on the human race. What ſeeds of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did Mahomet bring from his cell, when he came forth a pretended prophet of the Moſt High, to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by fire and ſword his fabulous revelation? Of what incalculable miſchiefs was Loyola the author when he invented the celebrated order of the Jeſuits, which, for ſo many years were the diſturbers of the peace, and corruptors of the morals of mankind? And judging from what has already taken place, may we not predict ſtill greater evils from the jeſuitical author of the preſent exiſting order of the Illuminati.—An order profeſſedly founded on Atheiſm, at war with every religious principle and moral ſentiment, and with every Government which refuſes ſubmiſſion to its influence. But it is needleſs to recur to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances, which might be multiplied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number. What is the hiſtory of mankind but pages of mourning, of lamentation and woe; ſcenes of tyranny, oppreſſion, carnage and deſtruction, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fruit of the unreſtrained luſts of the human heart?</p>
            <p>IT may be proper however to obſerve here, that no leſs deſtructive is the poiſon which ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The writings of a Shaftſbury, a Volney, a Voltaire, a Cheſterfield, and a Paine, among many others, will be conſidered as proofs of this truth by all who believe that virtue and piety are the baſis of happineſs.</p>
            <p>IT will alſo doubtleſs be expected, that ſo convincing an inſtance of the pernicious tendency of corrupt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and practices as the French nation has exhibited in their late revolution, will not be paſſed in ſilence. This inſtance is indeed perfectly in point; but the ſpeaker muſt beg leave to refer the application of it to your private reflections; as time, and abilities would both fail him in the attempt to deſcribe ſuch ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſcenes of horror. Scenes, in which every princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both of natural and revealed religion, every moral ſentiment, and dictate of humanity have been proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the duſt; and in which every effort of that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

which the Apoſtle characterizes as earthly, ſenſual, and deviliſh has been exerted to obtain univerſal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and to rivet heavier chains on thoſe whom ſhe had lulled into ſecurity with promiſes of freedom. Happy will be America, if the injuries which we have received, do but teach us to avoid her crimes, to eſcape her deſtructive policy, and to cheriſh thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſentiments, the annihilation of which in France, has rendered her wretched in herſelf, and a ſcourge to mankind. But ſome may aſk with ſurprize, can France, ſurrounded with a train of victories; be wretched! Yes, if the deteſtation of the good and virtuous part of mankind, if a moſt unjuſt and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical government, if religious perſecution, a ruined commerce, and exhauſted finances, if a boundleſs ambition, if robbery and injuſtice in their blackeſt forms, or the blood of innocent millions crying for vengeance, if theſe things can make a nation wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then is France wretched—and if we draw juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from the ſacred volume, what ſhe has already ſuffered will be but the beginning of ſorrows.</p>
            <p>AND wretched every nation muſt be where ſimilar principles prevail. With as much reaſon may it be aſſerted, that poiſon may be taken without danger, and that fevers and conſumptions have no tendency to effect the diſſolution of the body, as, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of wickedneſs is not deſtructive to the body politic.—Indeed the moſt mortal diſeaſes may be lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering, and poiſon may not produce immediate death; ſo thoſe corruptions which ſap the foundations of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional exiſtence may be gradual in their operation—internal ſtrength or weakneſs of conſtitution, and many foreign conſiderations, may either retard or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate the final cataſtrophe, and the ableſt State phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians may be diſappointed in prognoſticating the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular period of its diſſolution; but, that national wickedneſs tends to, and perſiſted in will produce na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ruin, is as ſure as the truth of hiſtory, as the truth of revelation.</p>

the moral perfections of the Supreme Governor, as exhibited in his word.</p>
            <p>FIRST, this event reſults from the natural conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tendency of things—the progreſs of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and its connection with the ruin of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among whom it prevails, may be eaſily traced. We find, that in proportion as the principles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and morality are weakened, thoſe luſts and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which are ſo prevalent in the human heart come into operation. Vice begins to lay aſide her maſk, and come forward with open face. The humble do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic virtues are deſpiſed, and plainneſs and ſimplicity of manners become the objects of ridicule. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this depraved taſte the youthful mind is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to grow up, unformed by inſtruction, unreſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diſcipline; or inſtructed only to aim at frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſhowy accompliſhments. A generation riſes up which "fears not GOD, nor regards man; ſelf willed are they, and not afraid to ſpeak evil of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties." The ſocial feelings give place to ſelfiſhneſs, envy, and emulation; an emulation to excel, not in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial virtues, but in titles, in wealth, and ſplendid appearance. Every thing now yields to a rage for ſhow and parade; and honeſt induſtry fails to ſupply the waſte of prodigality. The next conſequence is, that public taxes, however reaſonable or neceſſary, become a ground of complaint, and every expence, which is not devoted to luxury is ſubmitted to with reluctance. Extortion, oppreſſion, and all the tricks of fraud and knaviſh ſpeculation are reſorted to, for a ſupply to the demands of extravagance. Bribery and corruption are of courſe introduced—juſtice becomes venal—the moſt important intereſts of the public, are compeled to give way to private and ſelfiſh views—and pretended patriots become as numerous, as real ones are rare; that is, perſons who are ſeeking public favor and emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ument, under the covert of a pretended zeal for the public good. This is the proper criſis for ambitious men to promote parties and factions, to miſlead the unwary multitude, and to turn the tide of public o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium againſt thoſe virtuous few, who are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining props of a ſinking State. And this is the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036049_0010_10080BFAACD4FD60"/>
time for any foreign enemy, by the ſecret influence of bribery, by ſupporting internal enemies, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding and diſtracting the Counſels of a nation, to effect that, which the moſt powerful armaments, in a virtuous ſtate of ſociety would have attempted in vain. This is the progreſs, and evident tendency of vice; and by this progreſs it has overturned Empires and States deemed unconquerable. The efforts by which the ſmall republics of Athens and Sparta with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and finally defeated, the almoſt incredible arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Darius and Xerxes, are inſtances never to be forgotten, of the irreſiſtable force which republican virtues give to a nation. And the ſequel of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian hiſtory affords an equally memorable proof of the fatal effects of a prevailing thirſt for gold, and the enfeebling influence of luxury and diſſipated manners. The Perſians had long found them invincible in arms, they at length applied their gold and ſilver to obtain partiſans, and promote diviſions among them. By theſe weapons they ſucceeded. The heroic virtues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played at Marathon, and the ſtraits of Thermopyloe, were found no more in Greece. Their Councils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came divided, every meaſure of defence was weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if not entirely defeated, and thoſe arms, which had been ſo ſucceſsfully employed againſt their enemies, were turned upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>As a further evidence of the tendency of ſinful practices to deſtroy national good; we may aſk, why is not America quiet and happy? In the enjoyment of every priviledge and bleſſing which any human government can beſtow, ſurrounded with the rich bounties of an indulgent providence, and poſſeſſing reſources, which, properly applied, would leave us nothing to fear from the united powers of Europe, yet why, in ſuch circumſtances of ſecurity, are we filled with continual alarms? Why are men of the moſt approved wiſdom and fidelity, men who have been firm to their country's cauſe in her moſt trying ſcenes, and whom we have juſtly acknowledged as our political ſaviours, yet, why are theſe men, without the leaſt apparent cauſe, held up as objects of ſuſpicion; and every art uſed to fill the minds of the citizens
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036049_0011_10080BFC3477F608"/>
with groundleſs jealouſies? Why is every meaſure of our Federal Government, though evidently marked with wiſdom, and eſpecially every meaſure calculated for our defence, the object of cenſure? Why in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cannot a dangerous alien be required to depart, nor a ſeditious citizen puniſhed, who has been convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of having invented and propagated known falſhoods, with a deſign to injure the government, and raiſe a prejudice againſt its officers, but immediately a cry of unconſtitutional oppreſſion is ſounded through the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? And ſtill more to aſtoniſh us, we find thoſe very perſons who have ſuch a refined ſenſe of the liberties of the ſubject, and ſuch a jealous concern for the freedom of mankind, approving in the groſs all the meaſures of the French Government—even of that moſt arbitrary act of oppreſſion which drove her worthieſt, and moſt honorable citizens into baniſhment, without the form of a trial—and of that, which compels every citizen to open his doors to cuſtomers on the chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, however diſpoſed he may be to ſpend the ſacred hours in devotion. And why, we may further aſk, are the greateſt exertions of the yet firm friends of America, neceſſary to prevent her from flying, like a faſcinated bird, into the ravenous maw of that monſter, which has already devoured ſo many nations, whom ſhe had firſt deceived with her wiles?—Theſe are queſtions which any one can anſwer; and they lead to the ſentiment expreſſed in the text, that one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, from the moral perfections of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Ruler, as exhibited in his word, no leſs than from the evident tendency of things, we are aſſured, that national iniquities are connected with national ruin, and therefore, that he who is inſtrumental in corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the morals of a nation, is a ſinner who deſtroys much good. As ſocieties do not exiſt, as ſuch, in a future ſtate, it ſeems reaſonable in this view to expect, that God in his righteous providence will reward, or puniſh nations here with a degree of exactneſs, which, we are not to expect will take place with reſpect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, in this preſent life. This idea is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the account the ſacred hiſtory has tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036049_0012_10080BFFB43F61A8"/>
to us of the divine diſpenſations towards the Jews, and other nations. Even the choſen people of God, could not obtain poſſeſſion of the promiſed land, until the inhabitants had filled the meaſure of their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but when in the judgment of infinite wiſdom, it became neceſſary to make them a public example, in vain they looked for ſafety to their chariots of iron, or their cities walled to heaven. The ſame divine impartiality, and moral rectitude appears in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards his favored Iſrael; when they forgot his benefits, and forſook their GOD, they fell an eaſy prey to every invader, but when by unfeigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance they ſought his favor, again they were bleſſed with his indulgent ſmiles. But it is needleſs to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply particular inſtances, for Jehovah has publiſhed the following as the fixed univerſal rule of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that "when I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it, if it ſhall do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them." From this principle, that nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al guilt is connected with national miſery, the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is plain, that the ſinner is virtually the enemy of his country, and a deſtroyer of its good. In this view we find both Achan, and Ahab denounced, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of Iſrael. The ſinner is eminently a troubler of Iſrael when he is a perſon in authority, and entruſted with the important intereſts of a people. The wiſe advice of Jethro to Moſes was, to ſelect for his copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in government, not only able men, but ſuch as feared GOD, men of truth, and hating covetouſneſs; ſuch only will prove truly bleſſings to their country. One of the important advantages reſulting from the ſtudy of hiſtory is, the ſtriking view it gives of the dangerous conſequences of entruſting men with power, who are deſtitute of any fixed principle of morality and religion. As far as a regard to intereſt and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will ſtimulate, we may expect a degree of fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; but in thoſe critical and trying periods, when, to be faithful to his truſt, would probably deprive him of an honorable poſt, injure his worldy intereſt, or draw upon him the odium of the public, what, in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036049_0013_10080C02271AA690"/>
ſuch circumſtances, can induce a magiſtrate, who fears not GOD, has no reſpect to the rights of conſcience, nor feels the powers of the world to come, to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his country's cauſe? And beſides, the examples of unprincipled men will be more or leſs contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Their immoral feelings, and their contempt of thoſe inſtitutions, which are the great ſupports of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, will unavoidably influence their conduct; and we need not be told how powerfully the examples of exalted characters, and eſpecially their bad examples operate on the public mind.</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps the ſinner will conſider the text as compliment to his abilities, and be pleaſed with the idea, that he is capable of deſtroying ſo much good: for moſt men conſider great capacities as more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary than a good heart; and do miſchief, merely to raiſe themſelves into conſequence; as he who burned the temple of Diana to perpetuate his name.—Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a capacity to do miſchief is ſo honorable as ſome imagine, will appear in the conſideration of a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ariſes from the ſubject, and to which the propoſed method leads us,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, to attend, viz. Whence ſinners derive their ability of deſtroying good. The ſucceſs of the evil doer is no evidence of his abilities; but reſults from the excellent nature of good—and the various means and inſtruments of miſchief which this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate affords.</p>
            <p>FIRST. The excellent nature of good, and the delicacy of its conſtitution renders it very liable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.—All good depends on the exiſtence of certain proportions, and exact relations, and which muſt be kept compleat, or the good they produce is at an end. To deſtroy good is but to derange that order, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that nice proportion; to ſtop a wheel, or to draw a pin.—What a trifling cauſe may diſorder that ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing diſplay of wiſdom, the human frame.—A ſpark, which a child may communicate, may deſtroy what the moſt ingenious artiſts have been years in erecting. And we are not inſenſible what diſturbances, very contemptible agents have been able to produce both in this, and other nations.—Hence, to do good, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036049_0014_10080C046BD03790"/>
more excellent, and requires unſpeakably grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abilities than to do miſchief. Good, can reſult only from proportionate power, wiſdom, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence; but ignorance, or malice, with a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of power, may deſtroy much good.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. It is further obſervable, that in this imperfect ſtate the means of doing good are few, and the difficulties to be overcome are great, whereas, the ignorance, the weakneſs, and wickedneſs of mankind, afford innumerable ready inſtruments to the workers of iniquity—The way of doing good, like the way of ſalvation is ſtrait and narrow.—Much patience, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and perſeverance are neceſſary.—We muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to encounter the prejudices, the paſſions, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of mankind—we ſhall find but few to aſſiſt, but many to oppoſe and counteract us.</p>
            <p>But he who is ſet on doing miſchief has both wind and tide. No ſcruples uſually reſtrain ſuch men from uſing any means which will beſt promote their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Falſhood, and all the baſe arts of deception are their common weapons. The evil doer will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace you as a friend that he may better direct the fatal dagger to your heart, and appear as an Angel of Light, to give the ſurer ſucceſs to his infernal purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Inſtruments of miſchief are eaſily found. The prejudices, the luſts, and paſſions of men, all which ſtrongly oppoſe him who wiſhes to promote any good deſign, lend their willing aid to the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. For inſtance, is the ſinner aiming to blaſt the reputation of his neighbor? He can ſcarce invent any thing ſo abſurd, or notoriouſly falſe, but he will find many eager to hear, and as eager to propagate, and to give credibility to the ſcandal. Or is he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to foment diviſions in Church or State? In one he meets with a reſtleſs factious ſpirit, whoſe ſoul is an enemy to peace.—In another he finds a man of a ruined fortune who pants for revolutions, and public diſturbances, in which he can loſe nothing, but may gain much. A third, according to his wiſhes, is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy looking up with a mixture of envy and ambition, to thoſe poſſeſſing ſtations of dignity, of which his vanity tells him he alone is worthy. And a large
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036049_0015_10080C064224D7E8"/>
multitude, who, through want of information lie open to all the arts of deception. Theſe, and many ſimilar characters, which exiſt in every ſociety, are the ready inſtruments of the evil doer, and willingly join their forces to promote his pernicious deſigns. Therefore, that wicked men of weak capacities are capable of doing much miſchief, is no juſt ground of exultation to them, nor of ſurpriſe to others.</p>
            <p>THIS view is calculated to excite caution in thoſe who wiſh to counteract their devices.</p>
            <p>THE works of evil-doers are works of darkneſs. They often obtain their ends by arts too ſecret to be ſeen, and too abominable to be ſuſpected.—Hence, good men have oftener been foiled by the arts, than by the arms of their enemies. Inexperienced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in fraud, it is not eaſy for them to believe, what they are often compeled, when too late, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for truth.</p>
            <p>THE virtuous Swiſs could not believe that the French Government had no regard to treaties; nor could the King of Naples credit the idea, that the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his army were in the pay of the Directory. And who in America could have credited a few years paſt, what is now abundantly ſubſtantiated, that, while France apparently eſpouſed our intereſts with ſo much warmth, its real objects were, not ſimply the humiliation of her hated rival, but to reduce A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica itſelf to a ſtate of dependance, more abject than that from which ſhe pretended to raiſe it. That, their utmoſt policy was exerted to exhauſt all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources by continuing the war; or otherwiſe to have ſubjected us to terms of peace far more diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, than our profeſſed enemies themſelves would have impoſed. Such arts are uſual weapons of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, and againſt theſe weapons a wakeful caution is a neceſſary ſhield. It is far from the object of theſe remarks to introduce a ſpirit of jealouſy into ſociety; a ſpirit productive of none of thoſe advantages ſome attribute to it, but generating endleſs tumults and diſorders, feuds and inſurrections. There is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever another extreme, a ſupine negligence, an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous confidence, which is at no time a real virtue,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036049_0016_10080C0952913068"/>
and is often found a dangerous weakneſs. To ſuſpect thoſe who merit our confidence, is hateful jealouſy; to repoſe confidence in one who has evidenced a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to betray and injure us, is certainly a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The countenance given to thoſe whoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and practiſes are notoriouſly unfriendly to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of America, and the backwardneſs of many to contribute to the neceſſary means of defence, even while they acknowledge the danger which threatens their country, indicate, that we need to be more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſed with the dangers which ſurround us, and more attentive to this truth, that one ſinner may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy much good.</p>
            <p>THE addreſſes, which the occaſion dictates, will now cloſe the ſubject.—In the firſt place, I would beg leave to addreſs myſelf to your Excellency, whom the free, and general ſuffrages of your fellow-citizens, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain called to the firſt office in the State. Poſſeſſed with ſentiments of ſincere eſteem for your perſonal virtues, with a grateful ſenſe of the important ſervices you have already rendered your country, and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your official character as the miniſter of high heaven, and the repreſentative of the Supreme Ruler, I cannot in this addreſs be guilty of intentional rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but ill ſhould I diſcharge the duties of this day, were I to ſubſtitute flattering titles, for thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn truths, the occaſion is calculated to inſpire.</p>
            <p>YOU will, therefore, permit me ſir, to remark, that proportionate to the dignities, are the duties of your exalted ſtation. Power, and authority are perverted talents, when they are not exerciſed in doing good. In the expreſſive language of the poet.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>" <hi>Heaven's favors here are trials, not rewards;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>" <hi>A call to duty, not releaſe from care."</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>O SIR, you will not forget that He who has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us our reſpective ſtations, and has furniſhed us with capacities and opportunities for doing good, obſerves our conduct; that at his impartial tribunal we muſt render our final account, and receive accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our works. You will not be unmindful of the ſolemn truſt with which you are inveſted; while the moſt important concerns of your county, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036049_0017_10080C0C5EAD4D50"/>
of religion, and all that is dear to man are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your care, in connection with the other guardians of the State, and at a period ſo intereſting as the preſent, when the powers of darkneſs are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting all their ſubtilty to involve this happy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, this aſylum of religion and liberty, in ruin; and when the danger is ſo much increaſed by the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py prevalence of a jealous diſorganizing ſpirit, which has infected not individuals only, but too viſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in our public councils. To do good is as labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as it is eaſy to deſtroy it. Weighty are the cares of Government when their importance is felt. No ſmall degree of ſelf denial is neceſſary to encounter the prejudices and paſſions of mankind. But how ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the reflection, that our Glorious Maſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds with an eye of approbation the trials and conflicts of thoſe, who are faithfully endeavoring to do good, and that his rich rewards are the bleſſings of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving conſcience, and crowns of immortal bliſs. Animated and ſupported by theſe views, ſtill may it be your Excellency's higheſt honor to do good. As a benefactor of your country, may you long live in the grateful feelings of Americans; and at ſome far diſtant period, poſſeſs the more ſubſtantial rewards which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait the friends and benefactors of mankind.</p>
            <p>To the honorable Council, the honorable Senate, and Houſe of Repreſentatives, would I alſo beg leave to preſent reſpectful addreſſes, and cordial congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this pleaſing occaſion. To promote the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſs of your happy country, to lead her in the paths of peace, to protect her important rights, and counteract the devices of her enemies, is the arduous, but honorable taſk to which you, our political fathers are now called. If the obſervations which have been made are productive of the effects moſt earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by the ſpeaker, you will enter on thoſe important ſervices with minds penetrated with theſe ſentiments—that ſin is miſery—that religion is the ſource, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of all human bleſſings—and that laws are but weak reſtraints, where the fear of GOD, and the moral ſenſe of right and duty have ceaſed to exiſt. Under this view you will labor by your private influence and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036049_0018_10080C0DE52D74C0"/>
example, no leſs than by your official tranſactions to encourage virtue, and to diſcountenance vice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality.</p>
            <p>MORE effectually to counteract the devices of evil doers, the importance of united Councils is obvious. The preſent, is one of thoſe intereſting periods, when a ſenſe of common danger tends to draw to a cloſer union the real friends of their country. May theſe ſentiments be fervently cheriſhed, and all local preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and party views be made to yield to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt.</p>
            <p>RELIGION has become, if poſſible, of increaſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to Americans, in conſequence of an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon connection between our political and religious intereſts. Our enemies are evidently ſeeking the deſtruction of our civil priviledges, by undermining their ſureſt defence, our religious and moral ſyſtems. This fortreſs taken, we fall their prey without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. To advance the intereſts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> religion and virtue, and as a direct means thereto, to promote uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and moral inſtruction, we flatter ourſelves will be a leading object in your deliberations.</p>
            <p>ON the preparations for this occaſion, it has been my fixed purpoſe, to avoid the arrogance of appearing to dictate to the ſuperior wiſdom of this venerable body, the political meaſures proper to be purſued. I cannot however, leave this place, with a mind free from guilt, ſhould I neglect to beg your attention to the exiſting act of this State for the obſervation of the chriſtian ſabbath. I ſhall not pretend to enter into the merits of the queſtion, whether the civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can properly give their legiſlative ſupport to an inſtitution, which has been juſtly conſidered, not only as the great palladium of religion, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing, in a variety of ways, to promote the civil intereſts of mankind; and as particularly favorable for communicating moral inſtruction to the public mind. The exiſtence of the act is a proof, that the interference of government was conſidered as proper. But if any interference was proper, why not an effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual one? The act referred to, is manifeſtly loaded with embarraſſments, apparently deſigned to prevent
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036049_0019_10080C101E339910"/>
its efficacy. Whether an act of this nature, is more injurious, or beneficial I ſhall not pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but it is devoutly to be wiſhed, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of a chriſtian country would appear as engaged to ſupport the chriſtian ſabbath, as the government of France is to ſupport the honors of their decadi. The call of duty is obeyed, and your wiſdom muſt decide. Feeling the dependance of all created nature on its glorious author, you will ſeek, and I pray that you may receive, inſtruction from the great fountain of light.</p>
            <p>A few obſervations to this numerous aſſembly will conclude this diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>WITH pleaſure we recognize on this joyful oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, this great leading principle both in our State and Federal Government, that the ſcource of power is the people. This day brings into view the pleaſing truth, that we are ſtill in the full, and undiſturbed poſſeſſion of the important privilege of chooſing to whom, among many worthy citizens, we will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our moſt precious political intereſts. You now ſee before you thoſe venerable characters to whoſe ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior wiſdom, information and patriotiſm you have committed the weighty concerns of government.—Let me aſk! are they not men in whom you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide? men of known wiſdom, and approved fidelity? men of your own choice? Let them then have your confidence; and cordially and firmly unite with them in maintaining the authority of the laws, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violability of the conſtitution. As we would exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit a character becoming men and chriſtians, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ourſelves capable of enjoying the bleſſings of a rational freedom, let us fixedly diſcountenance a practice, which has unhappily become too prevalent, of ſpeaking evil of dignities, of indulging groundleſs ſuſpicions of our rulers, and criminating, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded licentiouſneſs, the meaſures of Government. A practice as unreaſonable and wicked, as it is ruinous and deſtructive. Our enemies have diſcovered this weakneſs, and have made it their principal point of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036049_0020_10080C11E847DFD8"/>
attack, to ſeperate us from our Government, and to deſtroy our confidence in thoſe exalted characters, whoſe faithful exertions in the cauſe of their country, have juſtly rendered them the admiration of the world. It is of no ſmall importance to Americans to diſtinguiſh their real from their pretended friends. In a political, no leſs than a religious ſenſe, does the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine caution merit your attention; <hi>beware of falſe prophets who come to you in ſheeps cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</hi> The man who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you that religion is calculated to enſlave the free born mind, and atheiſm the only baſis of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; that a ſpirit of jealouſy is neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a republican government, that France is a friend to the rights of mankind in general, or of America in particular; that the venerable character who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides over theſe States, is either ignorant of, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to their intereſts, and that WASHINGTON is betraying the country he ſo gloriouſly preſerved from ruin at the hazard of life, and by the ſacrifice of every domeſtic comfort, of men, who would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs you of ſuch ſentiments, beware. They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of your good. It would be unjuſt indeed to attach the odious epithet of ſinner to all who advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſuch political opinions—many doubtleſs who are real friends to the intereſts of their country, are led aſtray, <hi>by the cunning craftineſs of thoſe who lie in wait to deceive,</hi> but the prevalence of ſuch principles will aſſuredly reduce us to a level with thoſe unhappy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from whom we are now ſo gloriouſly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
                  <p>O my countrymen! can you endure to ſee the riſing glories of America eraſed, and the beautiful fabric which you have erected at ſuch expence ſinking into ruins? will you renounce that GOD who has been ſo remarkably the GOD, and Benefactor of America, for the vain phantom of philoſophy; and abjure your religion, that precious boon, for which our pious anceſtors prefered a dreary wilderneſs, to all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of cultivated Europe? Will you ſervilely bow the neck to a foreign yoke, and give up your dear poſterity to the fraternal embraces of Frenchmen?

To conſent to ſin, is virtually to conſent to this; for in ſomething thus reproachful, thus deplorable will ſin end. We have no enemy to fear but ſin. The united powers of earth and hell cannot wreſt from us theſe important priviledges, until by our own folly and wickedneſs, we have thrown down our guard. The perfections of the Supreme Diſpoſer aſſure us, that he will not withdraw the bleſſings his goodneſs has beſtowed, unleſs our prevailing iniquities render ſuch a diſpenſation neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>ROUSE then, my countrymen, from your ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſeize the moment of ſalvation—fly from ſin as from deſtruction and death—fear GOD and keep his commandments.—Let not the arts of infidelity rob you of your religion—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

In this, and in no other way can we reaſonably expect to enjoy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our civil and religious priviledges, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to remote poſterity; and hope for the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of our Judge.</p>
