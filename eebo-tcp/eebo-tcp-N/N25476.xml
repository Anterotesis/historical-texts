            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>MOST of the following pages were written in the year</hi> 1795, <hi>and pronounced, on the Anniversary of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Independence, before the Cincinnati of Connecticut, at New-Haven. The invitation, which the writer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to prepare an Oration for the same occasion, at Litchfield, was given at so late a period, as to rend it impossible for him to finish, in season, an entirely new composition, of any suitable length. For the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, those topics, which, at the present crisis of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical affairs of the United States, are most interesting to the public, occupy a smaller proportion of the whole performance, than would, otherwise, have been devoted to them.</hi>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>THE attention of mankind was never directed to political events, more important than those, which have signalized the present age. At this time, especially, national revolutions are following each other, in hasty succession; the civil establishments of the earth are daily assuming different forms; and maxims of government, till lately unknown, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly transforming the political aspect of the world. So extraordinary in their nature, progress, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, have been those great events, which have characterized the present century, as an <hi>age of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,</hi> that they can scarcely be contemplated, but as preparatory to some general change in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the human race.</p>
            <p>While violent commotions are agitating many parts of the political world, it becomes the duty of a people, far removed from scenes of havoc and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, and confirmed in the enjoyment of those blessings, for which others are languishing, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their peculiar advantages, in such a manner, as shall most effectually conduce to their own lasting benefit, and to that of mankind.</p>
            <p>The objects, which particularly on this occasion, solicit our attention, are numerous and important.—
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033811_0005_0FF94EBEC1A28888"/>
To acknowledge, with gratitude to the Great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser of all events, our national prosperity; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the important ends of civil society; to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarize the relation, in which we individually stand to each other, as members of the same common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and to trace the obligations thence resulting; to cherish those sentiments, and encourage those offices, of benevolence and patriotism, which mark the character of a free, enlightened, and generous people; to promote, in our several spheres, a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful submission to the laws, a ready co-operation with the laudable measures of our government, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral harmony, in the community, of which we form a part; and finally, to realize the justice, which we owe to our country, and to the world; are among the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which it becomes us to associate with the festivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this anniversary. On this auspicious day, which patriotism has consecrated to the celebration of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Freedom, the voice of our Country emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally reminds us of the many obligations, under which we are laid, to prove ourselves worthy of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable privileges, in the possession of which we are eminently distinguished from other nations. Civil liberty is a plant, which can never flourish, without careful and assiduous culture. The invaluable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which accrue to mankind, from governments, wisely organized, and laws, faithfully administered, cannot be perpetuated, where their importance is not duly regarded. In the present state of things, bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not to be secured, nor are evils to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by unremitted care and prudence. It, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, behooves the citizens of the United States, while in the enjoyment of national prosperity, to be studiously cautious, lest, by neglecting to preserve, or by misimproving it, they betray an unworthiness of the rich possession.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper to repeat, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, what has already indeed, been often repeated,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033811_0006_0FF94ED2C4111F58"/>
that our condition, as a people, is such, as any other nation existing, might justly covet. Our civil and religious rights are secured, as far, perhaps, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutional securities can avail, against the assaults of ambition, injustice, and venality: Education, indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the useful arts, unite their influence, to promote our national respectability, strength, and opulence: Our extent of territory is amply sufficient for the population of remote posterity: The soil, which we cultivate, as fertile, as is consistent with the salutary habits of industry, in the necessaries, the conveniences, and many of the delicacies of life: And the voice of health and prosperity is heard in our borders. If blessings, like these, are worthy of preservation; the means of preserving them demand our constant, and most serious attention.</p>
            <p>To place our present political condition in a more impressive point of view, let us turn our attention, for a moment, to the situation of those unhappy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on which the sun of liberty never shone, or from which his genial beams have been long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn. Contemplate the degraded native of South-America; who, through the severity, or connivance, of government, is doomed to wear out, in chains of servitude, the miserable span of an existence, which Nature designed for the enjoyment of freedom and happiness. In that treasury of nations, behold MAN, the pride of this lower creation, literally reduced to a passive instrument of his own oppression,—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to toil upon the sultry surface, or in the noxious caverns, of the earth; to groan under loads of wealth, which he cannot enjoy; to purchase, by his personal hardships, delicacies, which he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taste; and to perform the drudgeries of a beast of burden, for the convenience, or criminal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, of a being, like himself! Unless we believe, what daily experience contradicts, that Nature has been strangely partial to the favorites of Fortune,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033811_0007_0FF94EEC769488C0"/>
may we not rationally suppose, that, under the veil of this servile condition, there have been concealed from view, talents, which, if duly improved, might have enlarged the sphere of knowledge, and virtues, which, if nurtured by education, and called into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, might have reflected honor upon humanity?</p>
            <lg>
               <l>" Full many a gem of purest ray serene,</l>
               <l>" The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear;</l>
               <l>" Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</l>
               <l>" And waste its sweetness on the desart air.<note n="*" place="bottom">GRAY.</note>"</l>
            </lg>
            <p>In a condition, still more abject, is human nature exhibited, in many parts of Africa. The natives of those torrid regions, seized, like timid animals of chase, and, by their tyrannical brethren, devoted to servile labors; or converted into mere merchandize, and transferred to those, on whom the accident of birth has bestowed a fairer complexion, stand forth, miserable monuments of the perversion of the laws of nature, and of the complicated calamities, which avarice and ambition have entailed upon mankind. And even of those African tribes, which are exempt from this peculiarly ignominious fate, little more can be said, for the consolation of the philanthropist, than, that their condition is barely preferable to that of the greater part of their bartered brethren. Among the most fortunate of these comparatively favored communities, we can hardly discover any semblance of civil liberty, or rational happiness. Ignorance, barbarism and tyranny, combine to perpetuate their depression. Even those once flourishing states, which extended along the Northern confines of Africa, and which emulated the over-bearing power of Rome herself, have been, long since, reduced, from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional independence, to provincial slavery.</p>
            <p>If we turn our view to Asia, we behold, compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033811_0008_0FF8D0E2CE6925E0"/>
speaking, less, perhaps, of personal, but more, if more be possible, of civil, bondage. In that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and fruitful quarter of the globe, our attention is attracted, principally, by a voluptuous, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited race of men, prostrating themselves, in ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, at the feet of their earthly Deity, an ignorant, effeminate, but imperious, monarch. To the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and caprice of this royal automaton, the services and lives of obsequious millions are implicitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted: The winged messenger of fate awaits his nod; his glance spreads terror, and his word dispenses death. Exulting in his own unhallowed splendor, and in the humiliation of his species, he conceals, under the garb of royalty, the meanness of a slave to pleasure, and dissipates, in sloth and riot, the wealth of his stupid and obedient subjects. "The dishes of luxury cover his table; the voice of harmony lulls him to rest in his bowers; he breathes the fragrance of the groves of Java; and sleeps on the down of the cygnets of Ganges.<note n="*" place="bottom">JOHNSON.</note>" But how impious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible is that spurious, artificial greatness, which is built upon the miseries of human kind, and on the ruins of whatever is dignified or estimable in the character of man! Yet, such is the description of Asiatic royalty. Among those immense multitudes of human beings who compose the Oriental nations, there are none, who enjoy even the appearance of freedom, except the piratical banditti, who scour, for prey, the Arabian desart, and the barbarous hordes, who traverse the inhospitable forests of Tartary.</p>
            <p>In those three divisions of the globe, already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, we discover little else of human nature, than its ignorance, oppression, and degradation.</p>
            <p>On turning our eyes to Europe, we are presented with a different prospect. We here cease to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate that unvaried picture of human debasement;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033811_0009_0FF94F1B8320FEB0"/>
which, in the present survey, has, thus far, engrossed our attention. The character and condition of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean nations, like the surface of the territory, which they inhabit, are greatly diversified. Without particularizing individual governments, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, of the European people in general, that they are placed in an intermediate state, between absolute slavery and rational freedom. But, though Europe affords not more than one example of a government, literally despotic, it cannot be denied, that, in most of her states and kingdoms, oppression, under vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous forms, has, in a great measure, defeated the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal designs of civil society. It is much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted, that in that quarter of the world, in which the intellectual powers of man have made the most extraordinary advances, in the attainment of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the rights of human nature should have been, so long, but imperfectly understood, and still more imperfectly enjoyed. Europe has been, both in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern times, the nursery of liberal science, and of all the useful improvements of civilized life. The researches of the human mind have been there pursued to an extent, which has distanced the boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inventions and discoveries of Oriental sages: But, amidst this glow of intellectual improvement, the laws of moral right have been too frequently pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by governmental logic, or superseded by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing power.</p>
            <p>But, notwithstanding the comparative elevation of Europe, in point of civil liberty, and mental im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, the present posture of her affairs has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come "a subject of awful meditation." The hopes, which were once entertained, of an accession to her liberties, from a revolution, which has lately attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the attention, and excited the astonishment, of the world, are now at an end: "From the tomb of the murdered monarchy of France, there has arisen
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033811_0010_0FF94F2CAE026D58"/>
a vast, tremendous, unformed spectre," which riots among the neighbouring nations, without control. The beauties of nature are blasted by his presence; the invaluable works of art and industry are trampled down, in his career; the bounties of providence are scattered, by his touch, to the winds of heaven; and the haggard retinue of Poverty, Famine, Rapine, Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Death, attend his progress.—The nations of Europe have long experienced, from the enormities the French Revolution, evils, which, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, cannot be known. <hi>Public</hi> disasters are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to excite general and anxious attention: But, by a distant spectator, whose mind is employed, in calculating the political tendencies of the great events, which have lately taken place, on the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean continent, the humble, but numberless dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses, which the progress of "this dreadful inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation" has imposed upon <hi>private</hi> life, are, in a great measure, unpitied, and over-looked. These, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are the calamities, which are most exquisitely felt: Calamities, which national disgrace, though it may conceal them from distant view, cannot bury in oblivion; and for which the empty pomp of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional triumph can never compensate.</p>
            <p>It would be useless, in this place, to trace, minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the character, and present consequences, of this revolution, through the painful history, which it has furnished, of civil and domestic discord; of religion and virtue, disgraced and banished; of independent governments, made tributary and subverted; of towns and cities, demolished and burnt; of fruitful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, pillaged and desolated; of defenceless and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inhabitants, expelled from their dwellings, viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and murdered. These are but a few of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbered evils, for which the world is indebted to the revolutionists of France; and under which many of the nations of Europe are, at this time; groaning.</p>

When we survey the miserable depression of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, in the unenlightened parts of the world, and the prevailing oppression, together with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent temporary calamities, of more civilized foreign countries, we must surely discover much reason to rejoice in our own political fortune.</p>
            <p>But while we enjoy the most valuable blessings of civil society, it concerns us to beware, lest public prosperity betray us into a heedless imitation of the destructive habits and practices of those nations, whose fate we hope to shun. Propitious fortune has, too often, proved a Syren to public, as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, virtue. But, it is devoutly to be wished, that the United States of America may, by their own example, prove to mankind, that the enjoyment of national prosperity is not, by any fatality in human affairs, connected with its abuse; that the arts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement may subsist, without its usual vices; and, that the exaltation of a people is not, necessarily, the harbinger of their decline.</p>
            <p>I shall not, probably, advance a novel idea, by observing, that, in many of those fond predictions, which, since the establishment of our independence, have been hazarded by our countrymen, with respect to the future unrivaled greatness and glory of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, there is too strong a tincture of political en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm. It is of great importance, that the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a people should be directed, rather to their actual condition and prospects, than to fanciful and extravagant anticipations of future aggrandizement.</p>
            <p>That, notwithstanding the unfavorable aspect of our foreign relations, our present situation, as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is singularly fortunate, cannot, indeed, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. The continuance of our prosperity, and the increase of our importance and respectability, among the nations of the earth, we ought, as friends to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033811_0012_0FF94F5BA82279A0"/>
our country, to desire, and, from our national re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sources, may rationally expect. But when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how many of those great changes, which have taken place among mankind, were entirely, or in a great measure, unforeseen, till they were nearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, we shall, perhaps, deem it the part of prudence, not to rely, implicitly, upon the preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious credit of political prophecies, or the flattering promises of mere probability; but rather, to depend, for the preservation of those blessings, which we have already acquired, and for the attainment of whatever else is essential to our national welfare, on a steady perseverance in those laudable and manly efforts, which set difficulty and opposition at defiance.</p>
            <p>The great and frequent revolutions of empire, holden forth to view, in the history of mankind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate this obvious, but interesting truth, <hi>That the fortune of every community must depend, chiefly, upon the character and conduct of its members.</hi> Public pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity can never be long enjoyed, where it has ceased to be deserved. From the earliest ages of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Empire, like Science, has been, literally, an itinerant upon earth. In the course of national events, obscure and barbarous tribes of men, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from their neighbours, by no other remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able characteristics, than those of ignorance, poverty and apparent weakness, have, in contradiction to all human probability, risen, in the period of a few ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, to overbearing greatness, and given laws to the obedient world. These new favorites of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, having, like their predecessors in power, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a degree of strength and pre-eminence, which appeared to exempt them from the danger of humiliation, have, in the heedless enjoyment of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive dominion, insensibly generated their own destruction, and in their turn, submitted, like unwi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>lly sensualists, to the domination of new and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent rivals. The once flourishing and powerful
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033811_0013_0FF94F70448C8D00"/>
empires of Semiramis, Cyrus, and Alexander, have been, long since, buried in the ruins of their ancient greatness. Babylon and Persepolis, Balbec and Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myra, the former boasts of Oriental wealth and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, have, respectively, bowed beneath the arm of desolation. "The fortresses or their high towers are brought low; and their gates of brass are broken down."<note n="*" place="bottom">ISAIAH.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the most illustrious example, with which the history of the world presents us, of the instability of national power and prosperity, when unsupported by wisdom and public virtue, is exhibited in the fate of Imperial Rome. Founded in a barbarous age, by a slender band of obscure, but enterprizing characters, under the guidance of a youthful adventurer; bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon neighbours, more powerful than herself, and who regarded her, as an object, rather of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, than jeasousy; protected, by her poverty, against the attempts of foreign rapacity, but, in a great measure, destitute of the ordinary means of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizement; she suddenly rose, from a state of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significance, to a degree of opulence and strength, unequalled, perhaps, by any other nation of ancient or modern times. Her jurisdiction embraced the most valuable regions of the Eastern hemisphere; and her banners waved in triumph, from the Tigris to the Atlantic, from the Danube to the confines of Zaara. Her name was proverbial for national great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; her senate was distinguished for political wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; her citizens for patriotism, and her soldiery for valor. Her wealth and power, her dominion over tributary nations, her military prowess, her victories and triumphs, long excited the terror and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind; and later ages have designated her empire, by the appellation of the Roman World.—But the laurels of her conquests have faded; and the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033811_0014_0FF94F855486F970"/>
insolence of her power has been humbled by those, whom she long despised. A train of fatal causes, silently and gradually produced, by the abuse of wealth and dominion, have leveled her grandeur with the dust; and her former existence can now be traced, only in scattered ruins, and historical records,—"The spider hath wove his web in the Imperial palace; and the owl hath sung her watch-song on the towers of Afrasiab!"</p>
            <p>On the causes of these memorable revolutions it is unnecessary to enlarge. It may suffice to observe, that the loss of national power and prosperity has usually, if not always, resulted, in a great measure, from popular degeneracy. These reverses in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of nations inculcate, therefore, upon us, who enjoy the opportunity of deriving warning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from former examples, the great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of guarding, with unremitted care and vigilance, against the influence of those silently-operating causes, which undermine the basis of public virtue, relax the springs of national energy, and turn the scale of Empire.</p>
            <p>From these, and the many similar changes, which, in different ages, have taken place among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of the earth, it has, indeed, been generally inferred, that national greatness and prosperity are, in their nature, transient, and necessarily connected with the causes of their own decline. It is still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to be hoped, that future experience may prove the fallacy of this unqualified conclusion: A conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which, if universally believed, must forever damp the ardor of patriotic virtue, and, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring useless, discourage, the laudable endeavours of the philanthropist, to promote the dignity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the happiness, of his species.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:033811_0015_0FF94F97D37EA960"/>
A late philosopher<note n="†" place="bottom">HUME.</note> has asserted, that "here is an ultimate point of exaltation, as well as of depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, from which human affairs naturally return, in a contrary progress:" That "every government must come to a period;" and that "death is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable by the political, as well as by the animal body."</p>
            <p>That there is, short of perfection, a point, which the human race, in their present state of imperfection, cannot pass, is a proposition, which needs not the support of argument. But that, having attained to the highest degree of exaltation and improvement, of which, in their present state, they are capable (if such an attainment can be ever made) they cannot, according to the constitution of things, continue sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary, but must, necessarily, revert towards their primitive condition, is not yet demonstrated. We have, indeed, much reason to believe, that, in the improvements of the mind, mankind will continue to advance, without arriving, and perhaps, without the possibility of arriving, at an impassable limit. And that these improvements will greatly contribute to the order, stability, and happiness of civil society, cannot reasonably be doubted. It would, therefore, be a difficult task, to define the exact boundary, which the mind of man will reach, but never <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; or the ultimate degree of melioration, of which the condition of human society will admit. To consider the past, or present, as a standard for the future, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of mankind, either in the science of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or in whatever else may contribute to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial happiness, is, surely, in the highest degree, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational. It is observed by a modern writer, that no man ever knew to what an extent, or to what effect, his own faculties, either mental, or corporal, might be xerted. This remark may, with propriety, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033811_0016_0FF94FAD1E8199D0"/>
to nations, or to the collective body of the human race. It has frequently happened, that one generation has boldly pronounced visionary, absurd, and impossible, what the experience of its immediate posterity has shewn to be real, rational, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. There is too strong a propensity in human nature, to confound difficulty with impossibility. That man should ever be able, by artificial means, to measure the distance of a planet, to hold his course unerring through the pathless ocean, or to draw the lightning from the clouds, would, once, have been as incredible, as is, now, the most improbable of all events, not demonstrably impossible. It is not fully known, nor will speculative reasoning ever decide, how far those institutions, which are intended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and perpetuate whatever is estimable in the human character, or useful in society, may, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be rendered subservient to the ends of their formation. It is, however, in the highest degree, probable, and has already been partially taken for granted, that the progress of knowledge and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, if not interrupted by adverse causes, will continually tend to the advancement of rational li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, civil order, and general happiness. And when we consider the vast advantages, which modern ages enjoy, over those of antiquity, for enlarging the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and perpetuating the duration, of useful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, we discover much reason to distrust the humiliating hypothesis, That, in human affairs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression must forever succeed exaltation.</p>
            <p>The analogy between the "animal and political body," is rather fanciful, than real: And the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that the latter, like the former, is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily subject to dissolution, from causes, universally operating, is built on experience, too slender to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablish any general doctrine, not supported by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, drawn from reason, and the nature of things. The animal system is the workmanship of the <hi>God of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033811_0017_0FF8D12839CC0D10"/>
nature;</hi> and, as such, cannot, by human efforts, be essentially altered, or subjected to any inherent laws or principles, not ordained by its Author. Political fabrics being, on the contrary, the creatures of <hi>man's</hi> invention, are capable of being modified, or radical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed, by his powers. The institutions, which human folly has framed, human wisdom may surely improve; and to what extent the improvement may be carried, the experience of the world has not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. That former governments have been perpetually fluctuating, is a very inadequate proof of the necessary instability of all others: And though the most flourishing and powerful dynasties of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have fallen; there has, yet, been discovered no physical or moral impossibility, that others may experience a different fortune.</p>
            <p>Of all the sciences, cultivated among mankind, that of civil government has made, indeed, the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est progress. The reason, however, is obvious; and the fact affords a very insufficient support to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, of which it has been made the basis.—Most other kinds of practical science, being sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of illustration, from such examples and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, as the ingenuity and observation of an <hi>individual</hi> may furnish, have been, and still may be, greatly improved, by the native energy of a single mind. But national policy is a fabric, the construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which requires the collected wisdom and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of successive enlightened ages. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, from which political maxims are deduced, as they are necessarily the result of long experience, have consequently, been too rare, to establish a complete system of principles, which may, with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be universally adopted. We may, however, on rational grounds, suppose, that, as this branch of knowledge has made slower advances, it is still capable of greater additional improvements, than any other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:033811_0018_0FF94FC7A4C4DB68"/>
On the subject of civil government, theory and experience have, indeed, been often at variance. But unless, in the constitution of things, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable wall of partition, between the researches of the human mind, and the laws, which regulate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs; these inconsistencies may, probably, be removed. Instead of checking, they should, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, animate, the spirit of rational enquiry, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the patriot to perseverance, in his laudable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to promote the happiness, by improving the institutions, of civil society. While every other human science is rapidly advancing, from one degree of refinement, to another; what fatality, in the eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of nature, has rendered that of national policy, the most important of all, insusceptible of similar im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements? We have surely the highest reason to believe, that, as the knowledge of the world increases, many of those evils and defects, which have long been represented, as interwoven with the very exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of civil government, may, in a great measure, be remedied, by the application of new principles to practice.</p>
            <p>Of modern policy, in its most improved state, and as distinguished from the prevailing constitutions of antiquity, the most remarkable characteristic is the doctrine of <hi>Representative Legislation.</hi> This late and invaluable improvement, like the discoveries of an Archimedes, or a Newton, has wrought an almost total change in the science, upon which it has been ingrafted. Exempt, on one hand, from the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive rigor of monarchical and aristocratic sway, and from the licentious turbulence of democracy, on the other, it forms the most rational, and, as experience has shewn, the most effectual, plan, that human wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has ever yet devised, for the purpose of uniting social liberty with social order. The extremes of absolute monarchy, and simple democracy, are, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, calculated to operate, though by different
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033811_0019_0FF94FD6835A3EF0"/>
means, their own dissolution: The former, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking rebellion; the latter, especially in extensive communities, by indulging licentiousness. The one enforces unconditional obedience, till it becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to obey; the other is, from its nature, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of those primary and indispensable properties, order, stability, energy, and coherence. These op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite systems, therefore, comprize in themselves, the efficient principles of their own downfal: And the more enlightened the people, among whom such forms of dominion prevail, the more probable, in either case, will be the event of a speedy dissolution. Under any political system, less simple than these, and among a people, who can form any adequate notions of rational liberty, the probability of such an event will, perhaps, in the common course of things, be greater, or less, as the principles of that system are friendly, or hostile, either to despotism, or anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. There will, therefore, be no great hazard, it is presumed, in concluding, that a well-organized <hi>representative government</hi> is, of any, hitherto devised, the best adapted to an enlightened state of society, the most stable in its nature, and at the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from those opposite evils, which originate in the excess, or the weakness, of civil power.</p>
            <p>If these remarks are founded in truth, we may justly regard the political fortune of our own country, as singularly prosperous. It may be safely affirmed, that no system of government was ever framed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der circumstances, more auspicious, or ever promised greater length of duration, than that of the United States of America. It did not, like many others, originate in accident, or considerations of temporary convenience: It was not accepted by the implicit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescence of an ignorant ancestry, and ratified by the hereditary and unquestioned usage of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ages; nor imposed by the hand of lawless pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: But formed by the wisdom, and sanctioned by
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033811_0020_0FF94FE40FCE7A70"/>
the deliberate approbation, of a free and enlightened people. It was not reared upon the mouldering foundation, nor composed of the jarring materials, of ancient political structures; but founded on that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable basis, the rights of human nature, and construct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the genuine spirit of public justice and rational freedom. To preserve from violation, to improve, by future experience, and to transmit, with improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to posterity, this Palladium of civil liberty and social order, should be the object of our united endeavours.</p>
            <p>It is not intended, nor is it necessary, to attempt a panegyric on the constitution, under which we live. It has answered, in practice, the expectations of those, who were friends to its adoption, and, in a great measure, removed the objections of such, as, from honest motives, originally opposed it. It has sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the scrutiny, and received the approbation, of the wisest of men, both in this, and in foreign countries; and its principles have already acquired an unrivaled celebrity among the remotest nations of the civilized world.</p>
            <p>But, whatever may be the excellencies of our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical economy, let us still remember, that it is not solely to constitutional forms, that this, or any other nation must, eventually, owe its preservation and prosperity. The great ends of civil government cannot be answered, <hi>without</hi> a wise and equitable system of fundamental laws; nor by these <hi>alone.</hi> The people themselves are the ultimate guardians of their own civil welfare. Their character and conduct must, at length, determine their political condition. Without their co-operation, therefore, every consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional, and legislative provision for national happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, will eventually be vain.</p>
            <p>The justice, which a free people owe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033811_0021_0FF94FFCC6D80B70"/>
involves a catalogue of duties, too numerous, to be severally considered. The first of these, is to vindicate and defend the rights of their national so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, against the claims and aggressions of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign powers. To oppose such claims, and chastise such aggressions, are measures, not merely of local, or temporary expediency; but of general and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal justice. In the conduct of nations, as in that of individuals, there are certain extreme limits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which, forbearance under injury and insult, loses its name, as well as character, and becomes, not only contemptible, but criminal. It is a moral duty, incumbent on every sovereign community, to resent indignities, offered to its national character, and, more especially, to resist usurpations upon its independence. This duty, always sacred and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, becomes more peculiarly so, when the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing nation is formidable, not merely for its power, but for its principles, and detestable for its crimes: When, if uncontrolled, it threatens, not only to subvert the liberties of the world, and to bring the human race into subjection; but to force them into a practical contempt for religion, laws, and moral principle.</p>
            <p>It can hardly be necessary to remark, that these observations are most emphatically applicable to the present situation of the United States, in relation to the government of France. The course of events in that country, has lately exhibited to the world, a most awful and alarming spectacle: An immense and powerful nation, once civilized and respectable, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally transformed, by the ascendancy of pernicious principles, and the prevalence of lawless passions, into a horde of robbers, incendiaries, violators, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, blasphemers, and atheists! In attempting to delineate the character, or describe the transactions, of the French republic, the historian, the orator, and the poet, must forever feel and deplore the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033811_0022_0FF950121C960DE0"/>
of language in terms of abhorrence and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Her history is a continued, and dreadfully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variegated tissue of all, that is cruel and rapacious; all, that is base and perfidious; all, that is insolent and impeiorus; all, that is audacious and impious; all, that can degrade and brutalize the human character.</p>
            <p>The way was prepared, for the introduction of her present system of vice and impiety, violence and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, by a scandalous renunciation of all those rules of action, which form the basis of civil order and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial happiness. Her <q>whole revolutionary system is, not only not the same, but the very reverse, and the reverse fundamentally, of all the laws, by which civil life has been hitherto upheld, in the governments of the world.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">BURKE.</note> All the baser pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the human soul have been cultivated with care, and pressed into her service; crimes of the darkest dye have been countenanced and rewarded, as <hi>civic virtues;</hi> while every appearance of religious faith, of moral virtue, of sympathizing humanity, or even of remorse, has been tortured into treason against the "Indivisible Republic!" Encouraged to the commission of enormities, by the abolition of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral discipline, by the example of those in power, by an assurance of temporal impunity, and by a reliance on the future immunities of "death and eternal sleep," it is not, indeed, surprising, that the French peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of all descriptions, should have been abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared, for the perpetration of those "deeds of horror," those numberless and nameless crimes, for examples of which we shall search in vain, in the histories of all other nations, ancient or modern, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized or barbarous.</p>
            <p>We here discover the origin of that pernicious system of policy, which, for a long time past, has

spread havoc and desolation throughout many parts of Europe: A system, which has entombed religion, morals, laws, and freedom, together; and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed France into one vast altar, for the immolation of human victims. The government of that country, unlike all others, which have ever yet existed, has not only openly derided, and delighted to shock, the moral sentiments of the rest of mankind; but, with shameless effrontery, has even boasted of its vices, courted the indignation of the world, and set the vengeance of heaven at defiance! In addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ordinary crimes, which mark the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of tyrants, robbers, and assassins, the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionists of France have dared, through mere wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness of impiety and sacrilege, to proscribe the religion of their fathers, to ridicule the Saviour of mankind, to violate the sanctuary of the Almighty, and to disturb, with atheistical orgies, the mansions of the dead!</p>
            <p>It is not my intention to attempt, it would exceed my powers to execute, a detail of the countless atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, which stain the history of the French Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: They have been perpetrated, and are daily repeated, in the view of the world; they are already written in characters of crimson, and must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly roused the indignation of every honest man, who has heard the name of the French Republic.</p>
            <p>The subsisting controversies between that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and our own, have now arrived at a crisis, in which, our choice of measures is confined to a manly resistance, or unconditional submission.

human race; however fondly the American people may have anticipated the effects of such a change; we are, at present, to contemplate France, in no other character, than that, in which she presents her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to our view, and to that of the world.</p>
            <p>The present is, indeed, a period, critical and event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the United States. The French revolutionists, after having conquered, pillaged, and laid waste, in their mad career, many of the most free and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing states of Europe, are now meditating the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their power and usurpation to this favored country, the last, and only remaining, refuge of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional liberty. One, among the many preposterous novelties, which have signalized the triumphs of Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin fury and infidel philosophy, is, that a nation, styling itself a <hi>republic,</hi> and proudly boasting to be the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troness of freedom, has subverted, within a span of time, almost every government in Europe, great and small, which partook of a <hi>republican</hi> form; plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its treasury, desolated its territory, and murdered its citizens; while every <hi>throne</hi> upon earth, the Papal excepted, has been permitted to rest upon its basis. These champions of the rights of man consider <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> under whatever form she appears, as their natural game. They have scented her through all her secret retreats; they have chased her into her strong holds, and strangled her with the cords of jacobin fraternity. No object is too small to invite, none so great as to discourage, their rage and rapacity. <q>They have tigers to fall upon animated strength; they have hyenas to prey upon carcasses.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">BURKE.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The views of France, with respect to the United States, are no longer a matter of doubt. Her scheme of usurpation and universal dominion, is imprinted upon all her acts, in characters so legible and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033811_0025_0FF9505A42CE71E0"/>
that "he who runs, may read" them.—Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless of that vivid enthusiasm, which, from the dawn of her revolution, the American people and government felt, and manifested, in her favour; of the lively interest they took in the cause, for which she professed to be contending; of the joy, which they displayed, ather triumphs over the powers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined against her; of the rigid fidelity, and even munificence, with which her conventional claims on this government have been allowed and anticipated; and of the pacific and friendly disposition, which the executive of the Union has discovered towards her, in its repeated overtures for an amicable adjustment of differences; she has inflexibly persevered, in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, as a nation, every indignity, which the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less versatility of French insolence could devise, and every injury, which her resources have enabled her, with safety, to inflict. She has shamelessly violated, at the expense of the United States, and in almost numberless instances, the laws of nations, and the faith of treaties. She has insulted and calumniated our national rulers; excited sedition against our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; levied war upon our commerce; made captive, scourged, and imprisoned our fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; and is now endeavouring, by arts of intrigue, and menaces of violence, to wrest from our hands, our political independence!</p>
            <p>After such a display of national villainy, nothing more could reasonably have been expected from our diplomatic overtures, than we have actually received. On our repeated and importunate appeals to her jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, she girds herself with terrors; repudiates our messengers of peace; and insolently bids the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can government, become <hi>tributary,</hi> to obtain the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of <hi>being heard,</hi> or <hi>suffer,</hi> and <hi>be silent!</hi> Nay more: She threatens vengeance, in the event of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance; and boasts of her "means" to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033811_0026_0FF950744F273620"/>
the American people, to distract their councils, and to subvert their government!—But I am weary of ascending the climax of her wickedness and infamy.—If that ardent and manly spirit, which, in SEVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIX, animated some of us, and many of our fathers, still slumbers; if our resentments are not roused into energy, by injuries and indignities, like these; we richly merit the contempt and pity of the world: We deserve, I had almost said, to be <q>hurried out of the high-way of heaven, into all the vices, crimes, horrors, and miseries, of the French Revolution.</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">BURKE.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But, however justly we may execrate the measures of the French Republic, we ought to remember, that the evils, which we suffer from her insolence and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, are not altogether without a <hi>domestic</hi> origin. Her claims and depredations have long been encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and invited, by the language and conduct of a faction, intoxicated with her principles, and devoted to her views, in our own country, and even in our public councils. The principal implements, which she is now wielding, to sap the basis of our national honor and independence, are wrought from materials of <hi>American</hi> growth!—If, after all, that we have seen and heard; if, after the disclosures, made in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent communications of our ministers from Paris, any American can disbelieve this fact; his incredulity may be pronounced incorrigible.</p>
            <p>In such a state of things, the good sense and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotism of the American people will, it is hoped, point out, and lead them to adopt, the course, which their duty, their safety, and the honor of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, require them to pursue. To support the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their choice, and to repel, with prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude and firmness, whatever attempts are made, to humble and disgrace it, are the first duties, which,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033811_0027_0FF950940AB65EE0"/>
as freemen, they owe to themselves, and to the world. Fortunately, a spirit of indignation has gone forth among them, which, we trust, will spread and glow, till it withers the hopes of those, who have combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to prostrate in the dust, our private rights, and our national independence.</p>
            <p>Our prospects, though alarming, are not discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. The people of America, if united, may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, with success, the hostile attacks of any foreign power. The present, therefore, is a season, not for despondency, but for preparation to meet danger, and repel it.—On the anniversary of that ever-me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable day, on which our fathers executed the Great Charter of our independence, and boldly proclaimed it to the world, may all the active energies of their posterity rally around it, and guard it from violation!</p>
            <p>But, while we contemplate the civil obligations, which are imposed upon us, by the situation of our foreign connexions, let us not be unmindful of those equally sacred duties, which spring more immediately from our internal relations. Among these, may be ranked that debt of approbation and gratitude, which we owe to an administration, nobly tenacious of our rights, and ever watchful over our welfare.—The right of a free and well-informed people, to approve and arraign the conduct of their rulers, is productive of this two-fold benefit: That it not only guards against the errors and abuses of delegated power; but affords to a virtuous administration the highest rewards of patriotism—the applause and benedictions of a grateful people. It is necessary, however, to be remembered, that this privilege, though one of the most valuable, that freemen can enjoy, is liable to extreme abuse. A due attention to the preservation of our civil rights, is equally distant from causeless suspicion, and thoughtless security. Habitual vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance towards the conduct of rulers, may be laudable
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033811_0028_0FF94E3E6C7FC8E0"/>
and necessary; but hasty jealousy, towards those, to whom we ourselves have voluntarily committed the management of our national concerns, impeaches our own rectitude, in exercising the right of suffrage.</p>
            <p>With a proper attention to the duties, already enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, every people ought to unite a constant and scrupulous regard to the real honor and dignity of their own national character: And it is, perhaps, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary to observe, that these are inseperably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with habits of public virtue. Under given circumstances, whatever would, in a moral view, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the name of an individual, would tarnish the honor of a nation; and whatever stains the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will eventually injure the welfare, of either. If, therefore, under the most perfect system of national policy, there be a want of integrity, in those to whom the immediate administration of government is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted, or, of <hi>public virtue</hi> in the people, by whom the important trust is conferred; the most valuable interests of the latter must inevitably languish. The voice of history, and the examples of many degraded nations, now existing, announce, in expressive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the ruinous consequences of <hi>popular vices,</hi> those poisonous inhalations, which corrode the vitals of community. If the source, from which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of government is originally derived, be itself contaminated, the streams must be impure, and their influence destructive.</p>
            <p>In effecting the decline of national prosperity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine vice has usually been a more operative prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, than external violence. It, therefore, concerns the citizens of the United States, to be continually on their guard, against the introduction of those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive habits and practices, which originate in the abuse of propitious fortune, and which are diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally opposed, not only to the spirit of republican virtue, but to the welfare of every community. Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033811_0029_0FF950BC49D44410"/>
dissipation, venality, and the arts of popular intrigue, are among the most formidable engines of national ruin. The secret, slow, and silent attacks, which vices and practices like these, make upon the interests of society, are distinguished from the assaults of direct and open violence, by this dangerous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity, that, like "the pestilence, which walketh in darkness," they seldom excite alarm, till to be alarmed, is unavailing. Like the dagger of an insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious enemy, they wound, ere danger is suspected; and, before opposition is meditated, become irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible. These, if not watched with a jealous eye, and seasonably repressed, may give to this nation, as they have given to others, a deadly blow. And since, by the unforeseen relation of causes and effects, our greatest ills have, thus far, been converted to our greatest glory; it highly concerns us to beware, lest we "lose by gaining, and by rising, fall."</p>
            <p>The most stable props of public virtue are <hi>honest industry,</hi> and <hi>good education.</hi> Idleness in community, is the parent and nurse, not only of poverty and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy, but of every immoral habit: And immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, of every description, even though not punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the laws, is still an offence against the welfare, of society. It is, therefore, the part of a wise peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to imitate that bright example of wisdom and patriotism, the illustrious CINCINNATUS, by encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging and honoring useful labor. This is the only original source of wealth, and of every acquired en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. The implements of industry, if polished by use, reflect the images of plenty, temperance, health, and prosperity.</p>
            <p>The importance of education, especially in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican government, though universally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, can scarcely be too often inculcated. The dissemination of useful knowledge among all ranks in society, is one of the most worthy objects of public
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033811_0030_0FF950F97AEACF38"/>
encouragement; and by their early and singular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to this momentous concern, several of the United States have already raised themselves to a distinguished rank, among the communities of the earth.—The human race were not surely formed for ignorant, selfish, and merely sensitive beings. Their mental faculties and social affections were designed, by the Author of nature, for cultivation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>—" Why was man so eminently raised</l>
               <l>" Amid the vast creation; why ordained</l>
               <l>" Through life and death to dart his piercing eye,</l>
               <l>" With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame;</l>
               <l>" But, that the Omnipotent might send him forth,</l>
               <l>" In sight of mortal and immortal powers,</l>
               <l>" As on a boundless theatre, to run</l>
               <l>" The great career of justice; to exalt</l>
               <l>" His generous aim to all diviner deeds,</l>
               <l>" To chase each partial purpose from his breast;</l>
               <l>" And through the mists of passion and of sense,</l>
               <l>" And through the tossing tide of chance and pain,</l>
               <l>" To hold his course unfaultering; while the voice</l>
               <l>" Of truth and virtue, up the steep ascent</l>
               <l>" Of nature, calls him to his high reward,</l>
               <l>" The applauding smile of Heaven?"<note n="*" place="bottom">AKENSIDE.</note>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>It is unnecessary to dilate upon the salutary influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which useful knowledge produces on the mind, by enlarging those narrow views, and by restraining and correcting those perverse habits, sentiments, and passions, which, in a state of ignorance and barbarism, disgrace the human character. "There is no effectual method," says a late writer, "of preventing vice of all kinds, but by deeply inculcating the principles of integrity, honor, and religion, upon the minds of youth, in a severe and virtuous education." Where the laws of morality are not theoretically known, it is indeed irrational to expect, that they will be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally obeyed.—The general diffusion of knowledge
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033811_0031_0FF9512DABD77708"/>
is an object, no less important in a political, than in a moral view. Whatever conduces to the support of morality, and to the dignity of the human character, is invariably subservient to the highest interests of civil society. Ignorance, being, by nature, allied to one of those odious extremes, licentiousness, or sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, cannot long consist with the enjoyment of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional freedom. That government must be deemed the best, which combines the greatest reconcilable degrees of liberty and order: But order and liberty can never be united, where wisdom to form the union is wanted. And it is morally impossible, that the rights of human nature should be preserved among those, by whom they are not understood.</p>
            <p>From the earliest ages of the world, liberty and learning have, generally, risen and declined together. And even in those singular instances, in which the latter has flourished under despotic governments, it has been uniformly confined to a very inconsiderable part of community; while the people at large have been as destitute of information, as of freedom. But it is inconceivable, that any people, among whom the elements of useful knowledge are generally disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, should long continne oppressed.</p>
            <p>We may, therefore, rationally anticipate great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions to human happiness, from the future progress of the human mind. And it is here observable, that the state of the world is, at present, more peculiarly favorable, than it has been, at any former period, to the universal diffusion, and lasting preservation, of every species of science. Before the discoveries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventins of modern times had placed the improvements of mankind, upon their present stable and permanent basis, the arts and learning of ages might have been swept into oblivion, by a single inundation of hostile barbarians. But to such a degree have the means of information been multiplied and improved, in later
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033811_0032_0FF951628DC5FC58"/>
times, that, according to human probability, they can never be destroyed, but by some unexampled and incalculable mode of devastation. Unless, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, mankind shall become inattentive to their own welfare, in proportion, as they shall understand and enjoy the means of promoting it; there can be little doubt, that the great ends of society will be more effectually answered in future, that they have been in former, ages. Science and the arts have "struck an everlasting root," in both hemispheres: The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of absolute barbarism is already contracted to a comparatively narrow span. And since the entire revolution, which has taken place in the art of war, has given so decided a superiority to civilized, over savage, forces; learning and civilization have little to fear, from the hostile attacks of the latter. We may, therefore, with some degree of confidence, predict, that unless the apparent order of nature shall be changed, mankind will never experience a return of that intellectual darkness, which, during the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of the Roman empire, suspended, for ages, the operations of the human mind. The modern inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mariner's compass will facilitate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of knowledge, to the most distant regions of the habitable world; and the art of printing will ensure its preservation to the latest posterity.—The great and invaluable improvements, on which the useful institutions of social life are founded, being thus secured against all probable contingencies; we may perhaps on rational grounds, indulge the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hope, that, notwithstanding the disastrous phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, which are, at present, exhibited in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical world, the cause of bleeding Justice will even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prevail, and every succeeding age increase the knowledge, the virtue, and the happiness, of the human race.</p>
