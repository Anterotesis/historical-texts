            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE ſeveral Aſſemblies of NEW-JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA and VIRGINIA, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Congreſs a reſolution of the Houſe of Commons of GREAT-BRITAIN, which reſolution is in theſe words:</p>

               <hi>The Houſe in a Committee on the American papers. Motion made, and queſtion propoſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT it is the opinion of this Committee, that when the General Council and Aſſembly, or General Court of any of his Majeſty's provinces, or colonies in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, ſhall propoſe to make proviſion, according to the condition, circumſtance, or ſituation of ſuch province or colony, for contributing their proportion to the common defence, (ſuch proportion to be raiſed under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the General Court, or General Aſſembly of ſuch province or colony, and diſpoſable by Parliament) and ſhall engage to make proviſion also, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the civil government, and the adminiſtration of juſtice in ſuch province or colony, it will be proper if ſuch propoſal ſhall be approved by his Majeſty and the two Houſes of Parliament, and for ſo long as ſuch proviſion ſhall be made accordingly, to forbear in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:014583_0002_0F9384DBB7059240"/>
of ſuch province or colony to lay any duty, tax, or aſſeſſment, or to impoſe any farther duty, tax, or aſſeſſment, except only ſuch duties as it may be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to continue to levy or impoſe, for the regulation of commerce; the net produce of the duties laſt mentioned, to be carried to the account of ſuch province or colony reſpectively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Congreſs took the ſaid reſolution into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and are thereupon of opinion.</p>
            <p>THAT the colonies of America are entitled to the ſole and excluſive privilege of giving and granting their own money: that this involves a right of deliberating whether they will make any gift, for what purpoſes it ſhall be made, and what ſhall be it's amount: and that it is a high breach of this privilege for any body of men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous to their conſtitutions, to preſcribe the purpoſes for which money ſhall be levied on them, to take to themſelves the authority of judging of their conditions, circumſtances and ſituations, and of determining the amount of the contribution to be levied.</p>
            <p>THAT as the colonies poſſeſs a right of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating their gifts, ſo are they entitled at all times to enquire into their application, to ſee that they be not waſted among the venal and corrupt for the purpoſe of undermining the civil rights of the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor yet be diverted to the ſupport of ſtanding armies, inconſiſtent with their freedom and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of their quiet. To propoſe therefore, as this reſolution does, that the monies given by the colonies ſhall be ſubject to the diſpoſal of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:014583_0003_0F9384DBF1160658"/>
alone, is to propoſe that they ſhall relinquiſh this right of enquiry, and put it in the power of others to render their gifts ruinous, in proportion as they are liberal.</p>
            <p>That this privilege of giving or of witholding our monies is an important barrier againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due exertion of prerogative, which, if left altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without controul, may be exerciſed to our great oppreſſion; and all hiſtory ſhews how effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is it's interceſſion for redreſs of grievances and re-eſtabliſhment of rights, and how improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it would be to part with ſo powererful a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>
            <p>WE are of opinion that the propoſition contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this reſolution is unreaſonable and inſidious: unreaſonable, becauſe, if we declare we accede to it, we declare without reſervation, we will purchaſe the favor of parliament, not knowing at the ſame time at what price they will pleaſe to eſtimate their favor: it is inſidious, becauſe, individual colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, having bid and bidden again, till they find the avidity of the ſeller too great for all their powers to ſatisfy; are then to return into oppoſition, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from their ſiſter colonies whom the miniſter will have previouſly detached by a grant of eaſier terms, or by an artful procraſtination of a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive anſwer.</p>
            <p>THAT the ſuſpenſion of the exerciſe of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended power of taxation being expreſsly made commenſurate with the continuance of our gifts, theſe muſt be perpetual to make that ſo. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014583_0004_0F9384DD04258DD0"/>
no experience has ſhewn that a gift of perpetual revenue ſecures a perpetual return of duty or of kind diſpoſition. On the contrary, the parliament itſelf, wiſely attentive to this obſervation, are in the eſtabliſhed practice of granting their ſupplies from year to year only.</p>
            <p>DESIROUS and determined as we are to conſider in the moſt dipaſſionate view every ſeeming ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards a reconciliation made by the Britiſh parliament, let our brethren of Britain reflect what would have been the ſacrifice to men of free ſpirits had even fair terms been proffered, as theſe inſidious propoſals were with circumſtances of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and defiance. A propoſition to give our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, accompanied with large fleets and armies, ſeems addreſſed to our fears rather than to our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. With what patience would Britons have received articles of treaty from any power on earth when borne on the point of a bayonet by military plenipotentiaries?</p>
            <p>WE think the attempt unneceſſary to raiſe upon us by force or by threats our proportional contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions to the common defence, when all know, and themſelves acknowledge we have fully contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, whenever called upon to do ſo in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of freemen.</p>
            <p>WE are of opinion it is not juſt that the colonies ſhould be required to oblige themſelves to other contributions, while Great-Britain poſſeſſes a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of their trade. This of itſelf lays them under heavy contribution. To demand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014583_0005_0F9384DF010B5D50"/>
additional aids in the form of a tax, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the double of their equal proportion, if we are to contribute equally with the other parts of the empire, let us equally with them enjoy free commerce with the whole world. But while the reſtrictions on our trade ſhut to us the reſources of wealth, is it juſt we ſhould bear all other burthens equally with thoſe to whom every reſource is open?</p>
            <p>WE conceive that the Britiſh parliament has no right to intermeddle with our proviſions for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of civil government, or adminiſtration of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The proviſions we have made are ſuch as pleaſe ourſelves, and are agreeable to our own cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: they anſwer the ſubſtantial purpoſes of government and of juſtice, and other purpoſes than theſe ſhould not be anſwered. We do not mean that our people ſhall be burthened with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive taxes, to provide ſinecures for the idle or the wicked, under colour of providing for a civil liſt. While parliament purſue their plan of civil government within their own juriſdiction, we alſo hope to purſue ours without moleſtation.</p>
            <p>WE are of opinion the propoſition is altogether unſatisfactory, becauſe it imports only a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the mode, not a renunciation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended right to tax us: becauſe too it does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to repeal the ſeveral Acts of Parliament paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the purpoſes of reſtraining the trade and altering the form of government of one of our colonies; extending the boundaries and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the government of Quebec; enlarging the juriſdiction of the courts of Admiralty and vice Admiralty; taking from us the rights of trial
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014583_0006_0F9384DF86B2F740"/>
by a jury of the vicinage in caſes affecting both life and property; tranſporting us into other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to be tried for criminal offences; exempting by mock-trial the murderers of coloniſts from puniſhment; and quartering ſoldiers on us in times of profound peace. Nor do they renounce the power of ſuſpending our own legiſlatures, and of legiſlating for us themſelves in all caſes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. On the contrary, to ſhew they mean no diſcontinuance of injury, they paſs acts, at the very time of holding out this propoſition, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the commerce and fiſheries of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of New-England, and for interdicting the trade of other colonies with all foreign nations and with each other. This proves unequivocally they mean not to relinquiſh the exerciſe of indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate legiſlation over us.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, this propoſition ſeems to have been held up to the world, to deceive it into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that there was nothing in diſpute between us but the <hi>mode</hi> of levying taxes; and that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament having now been ſo good as to give up this, the colonies are unreaſonable if not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatiſfied: whereas in truth, our adverſaries ſtill claim a right of demanding <hi>ad libitum,</hi> and of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us themſelves to the full amount of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, if we do not comply with it. This leaves us without any thing we can call property. But, what is of more importance, and what in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal they keep out of ſight, as if no ſuch point was now in conteſt between us, they claim a right to alter our charters and eſtabliſhed laws, and leave us without any ſecurity for our lives or liberties.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014583_0007_0F9384E05FB2F5B0"/>
The propoſition ſeems alſo to have been calculated more particularly to lull into fa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> ſecurity our well-affected fellow ſubjects on the other ſide the water, till time ſhould be given for the operation of thoſe arms, which a Britiſh miniſter pronounced would inſtantaneouſly reduce the "cowardly" ſons of America to unreſerved ſubmiſſion. But when the world reflects, how inadequate to juſtice are theſe vaunted terms; when it attends to the rapid and bold ſucceſſion of injuries, which, during a courſe of eleven years, have been aimed at theſe colonies; when it reviews the pacific and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expoſtulations which, during that whole time, were the ſole arms we oppoſed to them; when it obſerves that our complaints were either not heard at all, or were anſwered with new and accumulated injury; when it recollects that the miniſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on an early occaſion declared, "that he would never treat with America, till he had brought her to his feet,' and that an avowed partiſan of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry has more lately denounced againſt us the dreadful ſentence '<hi>delendo eſt Carthago</hi>' that this was done in preſence of a Britiſh ſenate, and being unreproved by them, muſt be taken to be their own ſentiment, (eſpecially as the purpoſe has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in part been carried into execution, by their treatment of Boſton and burning of Charles-Town;) when it conſiders the great armaments with which they have invaded us, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of cruelty with which theſe have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced and proſecuted hoſtilities; when theſe things, we ſay, are laid together and attentively conſidered, can the world be deceived into an opinion that we are unreaſonable, or can it heſitate
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014583_0008_0F9384E2679919A8"/>
to believe with us, that nothing but our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions may defeat the miniſterial ſentence of death or abject ſubmiſſion.</p>
