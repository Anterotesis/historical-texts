            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>May it Pleaſe your Lordship;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE the Repreſentatives of this His Majeſties Province convened in General Aſſembly, do with all due Reſpect and Humility, approach your Lordſhip, to aſſure you, That the ſame Inviolable Loyalty which has hitherto affected and inflamed our hearts towards the Crown and Government of <hi>England,</hi> will ever preſerve us in a moſt Religious and ſteady Perſeverence therein, being throughly ſenſible how great a Bleſſing it is to be ſubject to the beſt and greateſt of Kings, and under ſo Noble a Conſtitution of Laws, as makes <hi>ENGLAND</hi> this day the Envy of all its Neighbour Nations. Yet we cannot but with great grief of heart repreſent to your Lordſhip, that we have not of late Years enjoy'd the Felicity of thoſe excellent Laws, which in their own Nature and Deſignment are to extend to all the Subjects of the Crown, how Remote ſoever, at leaſt virtually, and wherein the Lives, Liberties and Properties of the Subjects are concerned.</p>
            <p>We were very Uneaſie under an Arbitrary Commiſſion in the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, which gave the Governour of this Province, among other Arbitrary Powers, that of levying Money without calling an Aſſembly, whereby we reckoned that our Lives, as well as Eſtates, were ſubject to the Arbitrary Will of a Governour, contrary to the known Laws of <hi>England</hi>; and Money was actually levyed on us, purſuant to the Illegal Powers of the ſaid Commiſſion. The Exerciſe whereof, and the dreadful Violence we alſo apprehended would be done to our Conſciences, in reſpect of our Holy Proteſtant Religion, from a <hi>Popiſh Arbitrary King,</hi> made Us Unanimouſly and heartily throw off the Yoke of <hi>Popiſh Tyranny,</hi> and Declare for his then Highneſs the Prince of <hi>ORANGE,</hi> upon the firſt News we had of his Glorious and Unparralled Expedition into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We acted then, as we conceived, on a Right Principle, and we were the more confirmed in that Belief, becauſe we acted in Commerce and Conformity with the Glorious People of <hi>England.</hi> But to our great Amazement and Sorrow we have ſuffered ſeverely for our early Service to King <hi>William</hi> and the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> moſt of us in our Liberties and Eſtates, and two of our Friends (who had the Honeſty and Courage to ſtand in the Gap (when others ſhamefully drew back and deſerted the Proteſtant Cauſe, and were therefore by Univerſal Conſent of the People thought moſt Worthy to be Chief in Command, till Orders ſhould come from <hi>England</hi>) who fell a Sacrifice to the Rage and Malice of the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Party in this Province, who though few in Number, at that time, had nevertheleſs the Power and Influence to prevail on the weakeſt of Men, Coll. <hi>Henry Slaughter,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of this Province, to order a Tryal for thoſe brave Men, and appoint ſuch

a ſet of Judges, as by Principle and Prejudice, would not fail to gratifie the Malice of their Party, as they did, under a form of Law, which made it the more Cruel and Arbitrary, the ſaid Tryal being ordered by the Governour, and mannaged by the Bench, contrary to all the Rules of Juſtice and Humanity; for we are able to make appear, if thereunto required, that never a Revolution was carried on and mannaged with more Moderation in any part of the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>And further, to inſtance the Weakneſs, as well as Cruelty of the ſaid Governour, in appointing <hi>Nicholas Bayard, William Nicolls</hi> (lately ſuſpended by your Lordſhip from his Majeſties Council) and ſeveral others, to mannage, the Tryal againſt Capt. <hi>Leyſler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Millbourn,</hi> and the other ſix Priſoners, who were all their avowed Enemies, and bore a mortal grudge to the ſaid Capt. <hi>Leyſler,</hi> for their having been by him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the Fort, for oppoſing the late happy Revolution, and endeavouring to raiſe a Tumult among the People, and diſturb the Peace of the Government, and for telling Capt. <hi>Leyſler</hi> to his face, That the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> voting and enacting the Thrones being Vacant, was Non-ſence, that there was no ſuch thing poſſible in Nature, nor by the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> Governour <hi>Slaughter</hi> too by lodging in <hi>Nicholas Bayards</hi> Houſe, was the more preſſed, and ſooner prevailed on by <hi>Bayard</hi>'s Importunity, to ſign the Warrant of Execution. And as an infallible token of the ſhare he had in that Council, there was Flag hung out of a Window of his Houſe for two days together before the day of Execution, as a Trophy and Signal of the Point gained by him on the ſaid Governour, and of the Victory over the Lives, not only of innocent, but moſt deſerving Men. In thoſe days it was, when the Proteſtant Subjects were Diſ-armed, and Papiſts Armed; Nay, the publick Faith of Government was Violated; for a Reprieve had been ſealed to reſpit the Execution of theſe Gentlemen, until His Majeſties Pleaſure ſhould be known; yet before this could reach his Majeſty, they were Executed. And notwithſtanding the Governours Proclamation to invite ſuch as fled to ſhun the ſame hard Fate, ſeveral whereof were nevertheleſs Fined and Impriſoned; and certainly more had undergone the hard Fate of Capt. <hi>Leyſler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Millbourn,</hi> had it not been for Governour <hi>Slaughter</hi>'s ſuddain Death, and the Reflection he had, though too late of this Barbarous and Unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtrange Execution. This was the end of Capt. <hi>Leyſler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Millbourn,</hi> the former whereof has expended 2700 <hi>l.</hi> out of his own proper Eſtate, for the Service of his Majeſty. Theſe were the days of Wrath and utter Darkneſs, ſo that we muſt ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Wo unto them, for they have gone in the way of</hi> Cain.</p>
            <p>Then, contrary to his Majeſty's Letters Patents, <hi>Richard Ingoldsby,</hi> a hot headed inconſiderate Perſon, and only a ſimple Captain of Foot, is made Commander in Chief; and in all the time of his Adminiſtration, Oppreſſion is ſtill continued. Nor could change of Government remedy the ſame, by the coming of Coll. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> who, although no blood ſpilt, yet bruiſed the Bone of the Remnant left, and made his Government an entire maſs of Corruption, by encourageing Pyracy and Unlawful Trade, and giving away almoſt all the vacant Lands in the Province, to a few Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected and Undeſerving Men, neglecting the Fronteers of this Province, and pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Repreſentatives to ſerve in General Aſſembly, imbezeling and ſquandering away the Revenue, and other Publick Moneys, ſetting Atheiſtical Perſons in Places of greateſt Truſt in the Government. All which, and many more Inſtances of his Male-Adminiſtration, as we are informed, have been already tranſmitted to <hi>England</hi> by your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>The Repreſentatives convened in ſeveral, taking Notice of what was done herein for Relief, by that moſt auguſt Senate, the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in Reverſing of the Attainders of <hi>Jacob Leyſler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Millbourn,</hi> and others, Cannot but with the greateſt of Zeal, and fervency of Affection ſend up their Prayers to the great Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, for the Preſervation of his Majeſty's Royal Perſon, and of that

moſt excellent Conſtitution, and for the Miniſters of State, the influence of whoſe wiſe and honeſt Council, is felt, even at this vaſt Diſtance from <hi>England.</hi> And in humble Confidence of his Majeſties Goodneſs, We humbly pray your Excellency to lay before his Majeſty, this our moſt humble Petition, hoping that the ſame good Angel who led your Excellency to attend his Majeſty, when <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> in his glorious Expedition for <hi>England,</hi> and brought your Excellency ſafe amongſt Us, to put a ſtop to the Oppreſſions we groaned under, will now move your Lordſhip in our behalf, to interceed with his Majeſty for our Relief (although as Chriſtians we would forgive our Enemies and Oppreſſors) That he would be gratiouſly pleaſed to extend of his Royal Bounty and Favour on the Families of the ſaid <hi>Leyſler</hi> and <hi>Millbourn,</hi> and alſo order the ſaid Sum of two Thouſand ſeven Hundred Pounds to be paid unto her, (and that care be taken to pay ſuch Debts as are owing for what was expended in the late happy Revolution in this Province) in conſideration of their Sufferings and Services for his Majeſties Intereſt and this Province.</p>
            <p>That for the better Adminiſtration of Juſtice two able Judges may be ſent from <hi>England,</hi> and two or three able Council, who have acquired to that Noble Profeſſion by Study, and not by Uſurpation, for the Maintenance whereof we ſhall not be wanting.</p>
            <p>That Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s Coat of Arms may be pulled down from the Kings Chappel in the Fort, and Trinity Church in this City; that ſince he left no Monuments of Vi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
