Directs the grower to make his cyder in the manner foreign wines are made; to preserve its body and flavour; to lay on a colour, and to cure all its disorders, whether bad flavour'd, prick'd, oily, or ropy. Part II. Instructs the trader or housekeeper to make raisin-wines, at a small expence, little (if anything) inferior to foreign wines in strength or flavour; to cure their disorders; to lay on them new bodies, colour, &amp;c.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT may be thought necessary, in compliance with custom, that I should say something by way of PREFACE. If the reader would be informed what my reasons were for appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in print, I shall candidly acknowledge, that the great prospect of a considerable advantage to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was indeed the strongest persuasive; but I can with equal truth affirm, that it affords me no small pleasure to think I am doing my country at the same time a very great piece of service; and doubt not but that, as many will soon experience it, my labour will be thankfully received and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
            <p>Discoveries and Improvements ought not to be concealed; the public good calls loudly for them; but then, in return for the great advantage the public receives from them, the author of any such discovery may with the greatest justice claim an adequate reward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:009084_0003_103120B803E3D980"/>The following Receipts and Directions are not collected from Books, nor interspersed with old women's nostrums; but they are, in very truth, the result of my own LONG EXPERIENCE in trade, founded on chemical principles, which are principles of never-erring nature.</p>
            <p>Perhaps I had never thought of this Method of communicating my little knowledge, had it not been for many gentlemen in the counties of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, Hereford, Worcester,</hi> &amp;c. for whom I have done a great deal of business, in the cyder-way particularly; and who have often express'd their desire of seeing my directions for the management of cyders, &amp;c. made public.</p>
            <p>And no doubt such a thing was wanting; for it's hardly credible how much liquors of almost every kind is spoiled by mismanagement. Few people know the nature of fermentation, without which no vinous spirit can be produced; nor any liquor be render'd fine and po<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ble.</p>
            <p>Fermentation separates the particles of bodies, and from liquids throws off the gross parts from the finer, which, without it, could not be effected. There is what is called a <hi>fret,</hi> which is only a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fermentation, that nature is strong enough in some liquors to bring on, without the assistance of art; but this <hi>fret,</hi> or partial fermentation, is never strong enough to discharge the liquor of its foul parts; and if they should ever happen to subside, the least alteration in weather, as well as a hundred other accidents, will occasion their commixing, and
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:009084_0004_103120BB72850B60"/>
render the liquor almost, or altogether as foul as ever; to prevent which we call in the assistance of art, and which our method will effectually prevent.</p>
            <p>In brewing beer, yest is apply'd to it, in order to ferment it, without which it would never be beer. This opens the body of the liquor, and renders it spirity and fine.</p>
            <p>The reason that cyder is not often fine, is owing to its not being fermented. After it is got into the hogshead, the generality of people think they have acquitted themselves very well, and done all the necessary business, except racking it. But I can assure them, the more any liquor is rack'd, the more it is weaken'd. By often racking, it loseth its body, and so becomes acid for want of strength to support it.</p>
            <p>Another gross error many people are guilty of, in keeping the bungs out of the casks. Nothing is more pernicious to fermented liquors, than their being exposed to the open air, whereby they lose their strength and flavour. Take a bottle of wine, draw the cork, and let it stand exposed to the open air for twenty-four hours only, and you will then find it dead, flat, and insipid; for the spirit is volatile, and has been carried off by the air, and what remains is the gross, elementary part chiefly.</p>
            <p>A cyder-cask should never be kept open more than fourteen or fifteen days, that is, 'till the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is stopt; but so contrary is the practice, that I have known them very commonly kept open
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:009084_0005_103120BDED5C7128"/>
three or four months. It hath been objected to me by cyder and sweet-makers, that stopping up the cask so soon will endanger the head being blown out or bursted; but their fears are groundless, provided the ferment is stopt. The bottoms are quite confined, and it is impossible they should rise, unless a forcing be added to raise them.</p>
            <p>The best time for bottling your cyder, is in the winter, or cool weather, when it is <hi>down,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you will hazard breaking most of the bottles. The best method of keeping it, is to put it up in dry saw-dust, which will keep it in a due tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of heat, without the colour's subsiding, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you have laid a high colour on it, which, by long keeping, will subside in the same manner port-wine doth in bottles. For 'tis impossible to set a colour on cyder so strong, as to have it stand the bottle more than twelve or eighteen months, at farthest. The natural colour will change but little in a much longer time.</p>
            <p>What I have said of the sweet-making-business, (which I have been constantly concerned in for more than twenty years) is principally relating to fermentation; for it is in all kinds of made-wines the chief thing to be observed. I shall just take notice here of one or two things, by way of caution.</p>
            <p>If your fruit be candied, the best way to clean them is by bagging, and then you may easily take the stems from them.</p>
            <p>It is very seldom that the fruit is all of the same goodness, I would therefore recommend,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:009084_0006_103120BF75DAB288"/>
that the best fruit be made separate from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, it being easy, and much more prudent, to mix the liquors to your palate, than to run the hazard of making the good fruit with the bad, a small quantity of which will sometimes spoil the flavour of the liquor, and turn it acid.</p>
            <p>As to the method of brewing malt-liquors, I shall only here observe, that the practice of boiling the wort so long as is often done, is very injudicious. Five minutes is long enough: a longer time serves only to evaporate the spirit, without having any good effect.</p>
            <p>Under the head of malt-liquor, I have confined myself to giving proper instructions for curing their disorders, such as fining 'em, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which must be of great use to victuallers as well as private families, who, by reason of the badness of malt, mismanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bad weather, or other accidents, have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently quantities by them, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for want of knowing how to cure, lie useless, and are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thrown away.</p>
            <p>In the course of these receipts, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to lay down every thing as plain as possible, preferring, in these cases, plainness to elegance, even tho' I were capable of it, which indeed I have no pretensions to.</p>
            <p>Before I take leave of my reader, I must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish him, that if my directions are not observed punctually, I will not be answerable for his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; for he may be assured, in matters of this kind, a great deal depends upon what many people
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:009084_0007_103120C3F6E41020"/>
think trifling, and of no consequence whether done or not. But on the other hand, if he will take care to observe them exactly, I am sure they will fully answer his expectations. So shall he not repent laying out his money on this <hi>little,</hi> but not the least <hi>valuable,</hi> book; nor will my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation suffer in having penn'd it for his use; which is the earnest wish of</p>

            <p>LET your fruit be as near the same ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as possible, otherwise the juice will not agree in fermenting. When they are properly sweated, grind and press them; and as soon as you have filled a cask, if a hogshead, which is one hundred and ten gallons, ferment it as follows; and if less, proportion the ingredients to your quantity.</p>

               <p>TO one hogshead of cyder, take three pints of solid yest, the mildest you can get; if rough, wash it in warm water, and let it stand 'till it is cold. Pour the water from it, and put it in a pail or can; put to it as much jalap as will lay on a six-pence, beat them well together with a whisk,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009084_0009_103120C865B6A1F0"/>
then apply some of the cyder to it by degrees 'till your can is full. Put it all to the cyder, and stir it well together. When the ferment comes on, you must clean the bung-holes every morning with your finger, and keep filling the vessel up. The ferment for the first five or six days will be black and stiff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let it stand till it ferments white and kind, which it will do in fourteen or fifteen days; at that time stop the ferment, otherwise it will impair its strength.</p>

               <p>IN stopping this ferment, which is a very strong one, you must first rack it into a clean cask, and when pretty near full, put to it three pounds of course, red, scowering sand, and stir it well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a strong stick, and fill it within a gallon of being full; let it stand five or six hours, then pour on it as softly as you can a gallon of English spirit, and bung it up close; but leave out the vent-peg a day or two. At that time just put it in the hole and close it by degrees till you have got it close. Let it lay in that state at least a year, and if very strong cyder, such as stire, the longer you keep it the better it will be in the body; and when you pierce it, if not bright, force it in the following manner.</p>

Keep whisking it together, or else the glass will stick to the bottom, and have no effect on the liquor. When it comes to a stiff jelly, beat it well in your can with a whisk, and mix some of the cyder with it, 'till you have made the gallon four; then put two pounds of brick rubbings to it, and stir it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with two gallons of cyder more added to it, and apply to the hogshead; stir it well with your paddle, and shive it up close. The next day give it vent, and you will find it fine and bright. If you force perry, cut your isinglass with cyder or stale beer, for no liquor will force it's own body.</p>

               <p>THE reason that cyder is sometimes oily, is owing to the fruit not being sorted alike; for the juice of fruit that is not ripe will seldom

               <p>IN many places, particularly where the soil is light, and the orchard lays rising, the juice of the fruit is nearly white, and tho' the cyder may be strong, it doth not appear to be so, by reason of its colour, which always prejudices the buyer against it.</p>
               <p>Many people spoil a great deal of good cyder by boiling and mixing melasses with it, to give it a colour; which not only gives it a bad red colour, but makes it muddy, as well as bad tasted. Others, again, will boil a large quantity of brown sugar and mix with it, which gives it a colour indeed, tho' a light one; when two pounds of good sugar, properly used, is sufficient to colour ten hogsheads, as follows:</p>
               <p>Take two pounds of powder sugar, the whiter the sugar the farther it will go, and the better the colour will be. Put it in an iron pot or ladle; set it over the fire, and let it burn 'till it is black and bitter; then put two quarts of boiling hot water to it; keep stirring it about, and boil it a quarter of an hour after you have put the water to it.

               <p>Half a pint of this will colour a hogshead. Put to each half pint, when you use it, a quarter of an ounce of allum ground, to set the colour.</p>

               <head>Of RAISIN WINES.</head>
               <p>THESE wines are made of various kinds of fruit; of <hi>Malaga's, Belvederes, Smyrna's, Raisins of the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. But the fruit that produces the best wines is black <hi>Smyrna</hi>'s, their juice being the strongest, and the fruit clearest from stalks: for the stalks in <hi>Malaga's</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videres</hi> are apt to give the wine a bad flavour, and will always throw an acid on it; for the stalks of all fruits are acid; but the stalks of <hi>Smyrna's</hi> are so trifling, that after rubbing the fruit between your hands, they will easily sift out. Wine made from this fruit is the colour of Madeira, and has very much the flavour of it. Malaga is the colour and flavour of foreign malaga, but nothing near so strong. Wine made from belvideres is strong and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009084_0016_103120DF63381D00"/>
very sweet; and after keeping it four or five years is very little inferior to old mountain.</p>
               <p>In order to succeed in making these wines, you ought never to set your steeps in hot weather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the heat will put the fruit in a fret which will injure its fermenting kindly. The best time for making is in January or February. Set your steeps in the coldest part of the cellar, still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering to keep them from the frost.</p>
               <p>To every gallon of water put five pounds of fruit, if good, if but indifferent, put six pounds, into the steep. Keep stirring them three or four times a day, and let them continue in the steep till the fruit begins to burst, and the stones swim on the top; which will be in about fourteen or fifteen days. Then strain the liquor from the fruit, and press the fruit very dry, mixing the pressings with the rest of the liquor, and put all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a cask, and ferment it in the following manner.</p>
               <p>To every pipe of wine take two quarts of solid ale yest and one ounce of jalap, put them into a can, and into them pour a gallon of the new wine first made hot, whisk them well together, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the pipe, stirring all together very well. If your cask be less than a pipe, proportion your yest and jalap accordingly. When the ferment comes on, you must keep the bung-hole clean, and let the vessel be filled up three or four times a day. Let it ferment ten or twelve days, or till it works clean and white. Then take it off its
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009084_0017_103120E1883A52C0"/>
bottom, which will be very considerable, and put it into a clean cask. You may filter the bottom thro' a linen rag and put to the wine. Lay some heavy weight over the bung, and let it stand a day. Then lay on the top of the wine five gallons of melasses-spirit, and bung it up close. Leave out the vent peg a day or two; then drop it in the hole, and close it by degrees 'till you have made it quite close.</p>
               <p>Let it lay in this state for six months, at that time rack it from its bottom into a clean pipe, and you'll find it tolerably fine. Then put to it one quart of <hi>forcing,</hi> and bung it up. Let it lay 'till within a month of your wanting it; for the longer it lays the better it will be in body. Then rack it for the last time (always observing you touch no bottoms) and put three pints of <hi>forcing</hi> to it. Stir it well with your paddle, and bung it up. The bottoms you may run thro' a linen rag as before, and mix with that in the pipe. You may pierce the wine in six or seven days, and you will find it quite fine and bright.</p>

               <p>The sand will carry down with it all the small particles with the isinglass misses, and likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the bottom so as to prevent it from rising.

good effect, the acid part of the wine will rise to the top immediately, and issue out at the bung-hole. But if the cask be not full, the part that should fly off will still continue in the cask, and weaken the body of the wine. If your cask be full, it will be fit to have a body laid on it, in three or four days time.</p>

               <p>When it is off and quite down, bung it up for three days, then rack it, and you'll find part of its body gone off by the strong fermentation.

               <p>WINE made of raisins of the sun is always of the colour of rhenish, which is almost white. Very often that which is made of malaga's (especially if the fruit be but indifferent) will not hold its colour, but must have a colour laid on it.</p>

               <p>If you burn one pound of sugar, put a quart of boiling hot water to it; stir it about, and let it boil a quarter of an hour longer, then take it off and let it cool. A pint of this mixture is sufficient to colour a pipe of wine; but note, that with every pint you must mix a quarter of an ounce of common allum pounded to a fine powder; which will set the colour so that it will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, otherwise it will fall to the bottom, and have no good effect on the liquor.</p>
               <p>If you would have your wine of the colour of port, you must take eight ounces of logwood raspings, four ounces of alkanet root, one ounce of cochineal. Infuse them over a slow fire for three hours; strain the liquor from the wood, and keep it boiling. Then burn three pounds of brown sugar as before, and put the colour'd liquor to it; boil all together a quarter of an hour longer; then take it off, and when cold, bottle it for use.</p>

               <head>BEER or ALE ROPY, to cure.</head>
               <p>IF beer or ale should at any time get ropy, as in other disorders, you must proportion the strength of your remedy to the degree of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. But beer or ale is seldom known to be so ropy as cyder.</p>

                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:009084_0027_103120FD9E956C08"/>Take, for one hogshead, two pounds of common allum in one lump, if possible; put it into a clear fire, and burn it an hour, then pound it, and apply to the hogshead. Stir it well for half an hour. This will cut the rope in a day or two; then rack it and force it with the same <hi>stum forcing</hi> as is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for beer that is not sweet, as in page 26. If the rope be but thin, one pound of allum will be sufficient. Hyssop will cut a thin rope in ale, but this always gives it a bad taste.</p>

               <head>To make YEST, to ferment new BEER.</head>
               <p>MANY people that live at a distance from any town, are at a great loss, especially in the winter time, for yest to brew with; I shall therefore here give them directions to make an artificial yest that will answer the purpose alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as well as the natural.</p>
               <p>Take two quarts of small beer and one ounce of isinglass; boil them together five or six mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes; put it into a can or pail, and whisk it till it comes to the consistence of yest; let it stand an hour after, then put it to your wort in the same manner you were used to do the natural yest; this will be sufficient to ferment a hogshead.</p>
