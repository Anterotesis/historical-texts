            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Words</hi> are part of a raptrous and heavenly <hi>Song,</hi> utter'd by a devout, inſpir'd and tranſported <hi>Mother in Iſrael,</hi> upon a great and joyful Occaſion.

               <hi>Samuel,</hi> the rare and wonderful Son of inſpir'd <hi>Hannah,</hi> never outſpake his lovely Mother in any of his Prayers or Acts of Praiſe. <hi>Eli</hi> would have ſat at her Feet, and laid himſelf in the Duſt, at the hearing of this flowing Torrent of fervent Devotion from her beauteous Lips; And <hi>Saints</hi> thro' all Ages hang on the heavenly Muſic of her Tongue.</p>
            <p>Great things are here ſaid of GOD, and of His Government, in the Families and Kingdoms of Men; and ſuch wiſe and juſt Obſervations are made, as are worthy of deep Contemplation by the greateſt and beſt of Men. Had She like <hi>Deborah</hi> been the Princeſs of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> She could not have ſpoken with more Loftineſs and Majeſty, with more Authority and Command; nor better have addreſs'd the Nobles and Rulers, the Captains and the Mighty Men; to humble and lay 'em low before GOD.</p>

Thus my <hi>Text</hi> is introduced as a Reaſon for thoſe Diſpenſations of GOD towards a Perſon, a Family, or a People, which at any time are to us moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing and admirable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The things ſpoken of are great and mighty; <hi>The Pillars of the Earth.</hi> The Earth is a vaſt Fabrick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in Proportion to its mighty Bulk muſt its Pillars be.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Metaphor</hi> is plainly taken from <hi>Architecture;</hi> as in ſtately, ſpacious and magnificent Structures we often ſee Rows of Pillars, to ſuſtain the Roof and lofty Towers. But whether we apply this manner of Expreſſion to the <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral</hi> Earth, it is figurative and not literal.</p>
            <p>The <hi>natural Earth</hi> has no Pillar. The Will and Word of GOD is its only <hi>Baſis.</hi> It ſeems to us who dwell on it fix'd and immoveable in the Air. It keeps it's Place and Line there, as if it were ſet on ſome laſting ſolid Pillars, and never mov'd at all.</p>
            <p>We darkly <hi>Philoſophiſe</hi> upon the Point, and talk of the <hi>Poles</hi> of Heaven; which are more unintelligible to a common Audience than the Pillars of it. We ſpeak obſcurely of the Earth's being fixed on it's own <hi>Center.</hi> And we diſcourſe more intelligibly of the ſecret Power of <hi>Magnetiſm</hi> which is in Matter; whereby Bodies mutually <hi>attract</hi> or <hi>gravitate</hi> toward each other; By which the mighty Globes of the Univerſe preſerve their Diſtance, Motion and Order.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to be the only natural <hi>Pillar</hi> of the <hi>Earth:</hi> The amazing Work and Power of GOD. And the <hi>Planets</hi> which roll in the ſame <hi>Circle</hi> with us, have all of 'em the ſame Pillars. That is to ſay, "All Bodies thro' the whole <hi>Solar Syſtem</hi> attract or gravitate toward each other, with Forces according to their Quantities of Matter.</p>
            <p>But after all this fine Doctrine in our <hi>New Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> concerning the <hi>Centripetal Forces</hi> of the Sun
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003262_0006_0FEFDB0C232DD818"/>
and Planets; a plain Chriſtian is much more edified by the ſimple and vulgar Account which the <hi>ſacred Pages</hi> give us of this myſterious Thing<note n="*" place="bottom">Job xxvi. 7. Pſalm xxiv. 2.</note>: <hi>"He ſtretcheth out the North over the empty ſpace, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing! He hath founded it upon the Seas, and eſtabliſhed it upon the Floods.</hi> Which is to ſay, "No Man knows <hi>how</hi> or <hi>where,</hi> this vaſt material Frame finds it's Baſis and Station.</p>
            <p>Let us hear GOD again on the point, and ſay no more upon it; Job xxxviii. <hi>Who is this that darkneth Counſel by Words without Knowledge? Gird up now thy Loins like a Man; for I will demand of thee, and anſwer thou Me. Where waſt thou when I laid the Foundations of the Earth? Declare if thou haſt Underſtanding. Who hath laid the Meaſures thereof, if thou knoweſt? Or who hath ſtretched the Line upon it? Whereupon are the Foundations thereof faſtned? or who laid the Corner-ſtone thereof?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee then that the <hi>natural</hi> Earth has no Pillars, in any proper Senſe; Neither has the <hi>moral</hi> Earth, (<hi>i. e.</hi> The Inhabitants of it) any, but in a <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> Senſe: And ſo the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of it are called it's Pillars; becauſe the Affairs of the World ly upon their Shoulders, and turn upon their Conduct and Management, in a very great Degree.</p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Text</hi> explains it ſelf, and is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted from the ſcope of our <hi>Context;</hi> which ſpeaks of <hi>the Bows of the mighty Men,</hi> and of <hi>the Thrones of Princes,</hi> and then adds—<hi>the Pillars of the Earth.</hi> So that by PILLARS we are to underſtand <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> among Men; but not the <hi>Perſons</hi> that bear Rule, ſo much as the <hi>Order</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Government and Magiſtracy.</hi> For the Perſons may be weak and ſlender <hi>Reeds,</hi> little able of themſelves to bear up any thing; and here and there they may fall; but the Order ſtands and doth indeed uphold the World.</p>

                  <p>Now the Deſign and Uſe of Pillars in a Building is one of theſe two, or both together: 1. For <hi>Strength</hi> to uphold it, or 2. For <hi>Beauty</hi> to adorn it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Governments</hi> and Rulers of the Earth are its Pillars in reſpect of <hi>Strength</hi> to uphold and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Virtue, Order and Peace of it. Pillars ſhould be made ſtrong, and commonly are ſo; of Stone and Marble, Iron and Braſs. And it had need be a <hi>ſtrong Rod</hi> to be a <hi>Sceptre to Rule,</hi> Ezek. xix. 14. <hi>Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates</hi> need be ſtrong, for Government is a great Weight; and it is <hi>laid upon their Shoulders.  Moſes</hi> felt the Weight and ſaid, <hi>I am not able to bear this People alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Governments</hi> and Rulers of the Earth are it's Pillars for <hi>Ornament,</hi> to adorn it. Pillars in a fine Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are made as <hi>beautiful</hi> as may be; They are plan'd and poliſh'd, wrought and carv'd with much Art and Coſt, painted and gilded, for Sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as Uſe. As the <hi>Legs</hi> are to a Body, comely in it's goings: Such are Pillars in a ſtately Structure for Beauty to the Eye. It is the alluſion of the <hi>Spouſe,</hi> recounting the Beauties of her BELOVED, Cant. v. 15. <hi>His Legs are as Pillars of Marble, ſet upon Sockets of fine Gold.</hi> A bold and elegant Compariſon, becoming the Pen of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had built the <hi>Temple</hi> of GOD with all it's <hi>Pillars.</hi> They repreſented the Strength of CHRIST and his <hi>Stability,</hi> to bear the Weight of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laid upon Him; and alſo the Magnificence of <hi>the Goings of GOD our King in the Sanctuary:</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Steadineſs of the Divine Adminiſtration. So Thoſe in power and Magiſtracy are to be ſuppoſed, Men <hi>adorn'd</hi> with ſuperior Gifts, Powers and Beauties of Mind: Men that adorn the World wherein they Live, and the Offices which they ſuſtain. And then their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003262_0009_0FF02ED2F2A777E0"/>
Office adorns them alſo, and ſets them in conſpicuous Places, where what is great and good in them is ſeen of all.—To be ſure, Government and Magiſtracy adorn the World as well as preſerve it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> uphold and adorn the World, as <hi>Pillars</hi> do a Fabrick, by employing their ſuperior <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and Knowledge, Skill and Prudence, Diſcretion and Judgment for the publick Good. Theſe Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments are to be ſuppoſed in the Civil Order, and they render 'em the Pillars of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is both Strength and Beauty, a Defence and Ornament. So <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhines among Kings, for <hi>the Wiſdom of GOD was in Him. GOD gave him Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge exceeding much, and Largeneſs of Heart even as the Sand upon the Sea-ſhore.</hi> Angels excel in Strength, and Rulers ſhould be wiſe as the Angels of GOD. The Government is laid on CHRIST becauſe in Him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge. He is the Wiſdom of GOD and the Power of GOD. As GOD at firſt founded the Earth by his Wiſdom, and by his Underſtanding eſtabliſhed the Heavens; ſo by the Communication of Wiſdom and Underſtanding to ſome, He preſerves the Order and Happineſs of Others on it. What is ſaid of a Houſe is true of a State, <hi>"Thro' Wiſdom it is builded, and by Underſtanding it is eſtabliſhed, and by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall the Chambers be filled with all precious and pleaſant Riches: A wiſe Man is ſtrong, yea a Man of Knowledge increaſeth Strength</hi>

                  <p>But then, Is the Pillar for <hi>Ornament?</hi> What is more <hi>beautiful</hi> than Knowledge and Wiſdom? What more adorns a Man, a Place, a Country? The <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> came far to hear the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Huram</hi> was as much ſtruck as ſhe was: 2 Chron. ii. 12. <hi>Bleſſed be the LORD GOD of Iſrael, who hath given to David the King a wiſe Son, endued

with Prudence and Underſtanding, who may build a Houſe for the LORD, and an Houſe for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Integrity, Uprightneſs, Faithfulneſs</hi> added to Knowledge and Wiſdom, makes Men ſtrong and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Pillars,</hi> whether in Church or State. Every Man is ready to pretend to a Competency of Wiſdom, and as ready <hi>to proclaim his own Goodneſs; but a faithful Man who can find?</hi> Prov. xx. 6. He is a rare and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Spectacle, as <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Samuel, Jehojada, Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in their Times, and to the End of Time. All that rule over Men ſhould be like to <hi>Theſe, juſt Men Ruling in the Fear of the LORD;</hi> and then they are to the World as the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Rain,</hi> without which the Earth muſt periſh. As Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs vaniſhes before the Light, ſo <hi>a King that ſitteth upon the Throne of Judgment ſcattereth away all Evil with his Eyes.</hi> DAVID, that Pillar of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> came into the Government with that noble Purpoſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, Pſal. lxxv. 3. <hi>When I ſhall receive the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, I will judge uprightly.</hi> So he fed Them in the <hi>Integrity</hi> of his Heart, and led them by the Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his Hands. GOD's Righteouſneſs and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> are the Foundation of His everlaſting Government, <hi>the Habitation of His Throne.</hi> See the Pillars of the Divine Government, Pſal. xxxvi. 5, 6. <hi>Thy Faithfulneſs reacheth to the Clouds, thy Righteouſneſs is as the great Mountains.</hi> Nor can the Kingdoms and Provinces on the Earth ſtand, but on the like Baſis of a juſt and righteous Humane Government. Pſal. lxxii. 3. <hi>The Mountains ſhall bring Peace to the People, and the little Hills by Righteouſneſs.</hi> 
                     <q>Both the Superior and Inferior Magiſtrates ſhall miniſter abundantly to the Stability and Tranquility of the State.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A publick and enlarged Spirit</hi> for the common Weal and a ſingle Regard thereunto, without ſuffering our ſelves to be miſled by private and ſelfiſh Views: This renders Men <hi>Pillars</hi> to the World, in the Places wherein <hi>Providence</hi> ſets 'em.

4. A Spirit of <hi>Peace and Love,</hi> Meekneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Candour and Gentleneſs; whereby Perſons are ready to unite their Counſels, and act in Concert with one another; paying a juſt Deference one to another and preferring one another in Honour; glad to receive Light from any one, and well pleaſed to reflect it from them; all purſuing one End, as the many Pillars in a great Houſe ſtand quietly near to one another, and all help to bear it up: This <hi>Spirit of Power, and of Love, and of a ſound Mind,</hi> render men ſtrong and beautiful <hi>Pillars</hi> of the Earth. But if <hi>the Peace of</hi> GOD <hi>rule</hi> not in Mens Hearts; if their Paſſions ſhake 'em and they claſh with one another; the Houſe tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the high Arches above cleave aſunder, and the Roof falls in; as when <hi>Sampſon</hi> bow'd the Pillars of <hi>Dagons</hi> Houſe, and buried the lewd aſſembly in one vaſt Ruine.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A Pillar implies <hi>Fortitude and Patience;</hi> Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, Firmneſs and Strength of Mind, under Weight and Burden: Not to be ſoon ſhaken in Mind, nor moved away from what is right and juſt; but giving our Reaſon in the Meekneſs of Wiſdom, and hearing the Reaſons of others in the ſame Spirit of Meekneſs, to form an impartial Judgment, and abide by it; But yet with Submiſſion to the publick Judgment and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. The <hi>unſtable</hi> are as <hi>Water,</hi> and more fitly likened to the <hi>Waves of the Sea,</hi> then to a Pillar on Shore. And the irreſolute, diſcouraged and ſinking Mind is at beſt but a Pillar built upon the <hi>Sand;</hi> which falls when the Wind blows and the Storm beats upon it, becauſe of its weak Foundation.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Paſſive Courage,</hi> ever neceſſary in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Ruler, as much it may be as an <hi>Active.</hi> The Pillar ſtands regardleſs thro' the Weather beat on it, or tho' <hi>Dirt</hi> be caſt on it.

The wiſe, the meek &amp; ſtrong <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood as many Shocks, as ever Man did from an impatient, murmuring, ungrateful People.</p>

                  <head>II. Theſe Pillars of the Earth <hi>are the LORD</hi>'s.</head>
                  <p>The Earth is the <hi>LORD</hi>'s and the Fulneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the World and they that dwell therein. All are GOD's rightful Propriety &amp; Dominion. The <hi>Shields</hi> of the Earth belong to Him. <hi>Theſe</hi> are the ſame with the Pillars of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The LORD <hi>makes</hi> theſe Pillars, forms faſhions 'em, poliſhes and adorns 'em.

                  <p n="2">2. Both the Order &amp; the Perſons are of the LORD's <hi>ordering,</hi> conſtituting and appointing. Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of Divine Inſtitution, and GOD commiſſions and entruſts with the Adminiſtration whom He pleaſes. The great King of the World has order'd a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it, and He raiſes up Governours, ſupream and ſubordinate. <hi>There is no Power but of GOD; the Powers that be are ordained of Him.</hi> He puts the Scepter into the Hand, and the Spirit of Government into the Heart.</p>

3. The Pillars are the <hi>LORD</hi>'s, for He <hi>diſpoſes</hi> of them as he pleaſes; places and fixes them where He will; rears 'em when He ſees fit; and when He will removes, or takes 'em down: Or if He has no Pleaſure in them, breaks 'em to pieces and throws 'em away. <hi>He removeth Kings, and ſetteth up Kings: For Promotion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South: But GOD is the Judge; He putteth down one and ſetteth up another: He leadeth Counſellors away ſpoiled &amp; maketh the Judges fools: He looſeth the Bond of Kings, and girdeth their Loins with a Girdle: He leadeth Princes away ſpoiled, and overthroweth the Mighty</hi>

                  <p>Thus the <hi>Sovereign</hi> GOD forms the Pillars of the Earth, prepares 'em, ſets 'em up, ordains the Places and Times of their ſtanding; takes 'em down and puts others in their Room. He calls and uſes whom He will, inclines and ſpirits how He will, and improves to what Degree He will. They are <hi>His</hi> therefore, and His <hi>is the Greatneſs and the Glory and the Majeſty!</hi> And to Him it muſt be aſcribed both by the Perſons endowed and raiſed by Him, and by Others intereſted in Them: 1 Chron. xxix. 12, 13. <hi>Both Riches and Honour come of Thee, and in thy Hand is Power and Might, and in thy Hand it is to make Great; and to give Strength unto all: Now therefore, our GOD, we praiſe Thee, and bleſs thy Name for ever and ever.</hi>

                  <p>But to do the utmoſt Honour to the <hi>Civil Order</hi> among Men, and to give yet greater Glory to GOD, let us come to the third and laſt Part of our <hi>Text.</hi>

So the Peace, Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Flouriſhing of Places are made to depend on the Wiſdom and Fidelity of their Rulers, in the good Adminiſtration of the Government.

                  <p>
                     <hi>GOD hath ſet:</hi> As well in the Nature of Things, as in his Word. <hi>Government</hi> is not a Creature of Man's Luſt and Will, but of Divine Conſtitution, and from a Neceſſity in the Nature of things. The very Being and Weal of <hi>Society</hi> depends thereon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Government</hi> was not in the Original of it aſſumed or uſurped by any one Man. For Inſtance, Not by <hi>Lamech</hi> before the Flood, nor by <hi>Nimrod</hi> after it.

                  <p>In a word, <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> like the other Ordinances of Heaven, ſtands by the Power and Bleſſing of GOD; who effectually owns it and works by it, eſtabliſhes the Earth and it abideth. He has graven it deep in he Hearts of Men, even as the Deſire of Happineſs and

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. See the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs in Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Eſtabliſhing a Magiſtracy and Government in the World. It is one of the many great Inſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the SUPREAM GOVERNOUR of the World has taken Care for the univerſal and perpetual Weal of it. And they that would be lawleſs and ungoverned, deſpiſing Dominion and ſpeaking Evil of Dignity, Diſtinction, Authority and Rule among Men, act as madly and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſly as one would do, that ſhould go into a Houſe and ſap the Foundation of it, till it fall upon him and cruſh him to Death.</p>
               <p>It is one evident Mark of the <hi>Romiſh Impoſture,</hi> and of the Spirit of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that it has invaded, uſurp'd upon and ſubverted the Authority of Kings and Princes, Governments and States, over their Subjects. The <hi>Popes</hi> Claim of Supremacy transfers the Allegiance of Subjects to a foreign Power, and abſolves 'em from their Oaths. This alone is a ſufficient Mark of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and of the <hi>Man of Sin.</hi> What Confuſion and Vexation has the World ſuffered from this inſolent &amp; monſtrous Doctrine! And how ſtrange is it that ſo many Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould ſo long wander after it, to their infinite Miſrule &amp; Diſtraction! But the Word &amp; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judgment of GOD muſt be fulfilled on a wicked World.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> took early Care to <hi>proteſt</hi> againſt this Doctrine of Devils. They declared for a "conſcientious Subjection and Obedience to the Laws and Magiſtrates under which they liv'd, and by whom they were protected &amp; defended in their juſt Rights and Liberties.</p>

                  <q>Every Kind of Magiſtracy (ſay the <hi>Helvetian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>) is inſtituted by GOD, for the Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Man, and all Subjects ſhould own the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD in the Inſtitution of a Magiſtrate, by honouring Him as <hi>the Miniſter of GOD.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the juſt and true Principles of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> according to the <hi>Oracles</hi> of GOD in this Matter: Rom. xiii. 1,—5. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Powers: For there is no Power but of GOD; the Powers that be are ordained of GOD: Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Ordinance of GOD.—Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for Wrath</hi> (or fear of Puniſhment) <hi>but alſo for Conſcience ſake. Render therefore unto all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom, Fear to whom Fear, and Honour to whom Honour.</hi> Tit. iii. 1. <hi>Put them in mind to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magiſtrates.</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14, 15, 16, 16, 17. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Man for the</hi> LORD's <hi>ſake; whether it be to the King as ſupream, or unto Governours as unto them that are ſent by Him: For ſo is the Will of GOD.</hi> Let us very gratefully obſerve theſe Precepts, for they are very graciouſly given us for the Good of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are Magiſtrates the Pillars of the Earth? Are they the LORD's? and has He ſet the World upon them? Let us then devoutly obſerve the Governing Providence of GOD in diſpoſing of Perſons and Offices, both with reſpect unto our Selves and Others.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>our Selves,</hi> let GOD lead, and Providence open our Way, and let us follow humbly &amp; obediently. Let us think ſoberly of our ſelves, and not vainly pine after Honour and Power, or wickedly puſh for it like <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom.</hi> But neither need we hide our ſelves like <hi>Saul,</hi> when the Divine Call is plain, nor inſiſt on Excuſes like the meek and accompliſhed <hi>Moſes.</hi> Or if again Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence lays us by, why ſhould we not retire with <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el's</hi> Humility and Greatneſs of Soul.</p>
               <p>And then as to <hi>Others,</hi> Let us not think our ſelves neglected or overlook'd, be envious and diſcontent, if GOD prefer them. Suffer the MOST HIGH to rule in the Kingdoms of Men, and to give the Provinces that belong
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003262_0017_0FF02EED6F4597D0"/>
to 'em to whomſoever He will. Let us know and keep our own Place, and do our Duty to Thoſe whom GOD ſets over us.</p>
               <p>Let People reverence &amp; honour their worthy Rulers, and let the Higheſt among Men be very humble before GOD. They are <hi>Pillars,</hi> but of the <hi>Earth.</hi> The Earth and its Pillars are diſſolving together. <hi>Government</hi> abides, in a Succeſſion of Men, while the Earth endures, but the <hi>Perſons,</hi> however good &amp; great, muſt die like other Men. We muſt not look too much at the Lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any, nor lean too much on any earthly Pillar: <hi>Put not your Truſt in Princes, nor in the Son of Man in whom there is no Help: His Breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Duſt.</hi> Nor may the Higheſt among Mortals behold themſelves with Elation &amp; Security, as the vain King of <hi>Babylon</hi> once; but let them fear and tremble before the GOD <hi>of Heaven,</hi> who inherits all Nations, and ſtands in the Congregation of the Mighty, and judgeth among the <hi>Gods.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Are Rulers the Pillars of the Earth; are They the LORD's? and has He ſet the World upon 'em? Let all that are in Public Offices conſider their Obligation<hi>s</hi> to be PILLARS, in the Places wherein Providence hath ſet 'em.</p>
               <p>Let <hi>Rulers</hi> conſider what they owe to GOD, who has rear'd and ſet 'em up; and to the <hi>Publick</hi> which GOD has ſet upon them. Let 'em ſeek Wiſdom &amp; Strength, Grace and Conduct from GOD, that they may anſwer the <hi>Title</hi> given 'em in my <hi>Text.</hi> Let 'em <hi>ſtand,</hi> and <hi>bear,</hi> and <hi>act</hi> for GOD; whoſe they are, and who has ſet 'em where they are. Let the publick Good be their juſt Care; that it may be ſeen that GOD has ſet the World in their <hi>Heart,</hi> as well as laid it on their <hi>Shoulders.</hi> Let 'em act uprightly, that they may ſtand ſecure and ſtrong. Let 'em fear GOD, and rule by his Word, that they may be approved by GOD, and accepted always by Men with all Thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Government</hi> is the Pillar of the Earth, ſo <hi>Religion</hi> is the Pillar of Government. Take away the Fear of GOD's Government &amp; Judgment, and humane Rule utterly falls, or corrupts into Tyranny. But if Religion rule in the Hearts and Lives of Rulers, GOD will have Glory, and the People be made happy.</p>

                  <hi>FATHERS of our Country,</hi> let me freely ſay to You, That the <hi>Devotion and Virtue</hi> of our humble, but il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious ANCESTORS, (The firſt Planters of <hi>New-England,</hi>) laid the Foundation of our <hi>Greatneſs</hi> among the <hi>Provinces:</hi> And it is <hi>This</hi> that muſt continue and eſtabliſh it under the Divine Favour &amp; Bleſſing. Emulate their Piety and Godlineſs, and generous Regards to the Publick, and be acknowledged the <hi>Pillars,</hi> the Strength and Ornament of your Country!</p>
               <p>But let me move You by a greater <hi>Argument,</hi> even a <hi>far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory,</hi> which the HOLY GHOST has ſet before you in a moſt illuſtrious <hi>Promiſe;</hi> Rev. iii. 12. <hi>Him that over cometh will I make a</hi> PILLAR <hi>in the Temple of my GOD, and he ſhall go no more out: And I will write upon Him the Name of my GOD, and the Name of the</hi> CITY <hi>of my GOD, which is</hi> NEW-JERUSALEM; <hi>which cometh down out of Heaven from my GOD: And I will write upon Him my</hi> NEW-NAME.</p>
               <p>CHRIST will erect a <hi>Monumental Pillar,</hi> that ſhall ſtand for ever, in Honour of all <hi>Them</hi> who in their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, be they high or low, faithfully endeavour to uphold His Church and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>triumphant Promiſe</hi> taken from the <hi>Roman</hi> manner of Pillars rear'd to the Memory of Illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and PATRIOTS, on which were inſcrib'd their <hi>Names</hi> and worthy Deeds; together with that of the Empire, City or Province, which they were ſo happy as to ſerve and help to ſave.</p>
               <p>Infinitely more Glory and Honour ſhall be done to Him who ſerves the <hi>Lord CHRIST,</hi> his Kingdom, People and Intereſt, in his Life here on Earth: When he comes into his Temple above he ſhall have a <hi>Pillar of Celeſtial Glory</hi> rear'd to eternize his Name; And on it ſhall be written (O Divine Honour!) "THIS WAS A FAITHFUL SERVANT OF HIS GOD, AND SAVIOUR, AND OF THE CHURCH ON EARTH.</p>
               <p>There let Him ſtand for ever, <hi>"A Monument of free Grace, never to be defaced or removed."</hi> While the Names of famous <hi>Emperors, Kings</hi> and <hi>Generals,</hi> graven in Braſs or cut in Marble, on ſtately <hi>Pillars</hi> and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant <hi>Arches,</hi> ſhall moulder into Duſt.</p>

"So the Pillars in <hi>Solomon's Porch</hi> were broken down, and carried away by the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> But He that is made a Pillar in the Celeſtial Temple ſhall <hi>go no more out.</hi> Yea the Pillars of the literal Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens will ſhortly tremble, and be ſhaken out of their Place; but He that believes in CHRIST, and has His Glorious <hi>Name</hi> written on Him, ſhall remain unſhaken and immoveable; and remain, like his <hi>living</hi> SAVIOUR, ſtedfaſt for ever.</p>
               <p>This infinite and eternal GLORY we wiſh to all in this worſhipping <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> the greater and the leſs, high and low, rich and poor together: As in the Act of Worſhip, we are all on a <hi>Level</hi> before the THRONE of GOD. And the loweſt in outward Condition may be the Higheſt in Grace, and in the Honours that come from above.</p>
               <p>But in a more eſpecial manner we wiſh <hi>this</hi> Mercy and Bleſſing of our GOD and KING, out of <hi>His Houſe</hi> to YOUR EXCELLENCY our GOVERNOUR: Whoſe <hi>Return</hi> to your Country, and your Advancement to the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of it, we cannot but Congratulate in the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick manner, with Hearts full of Joy, and ſincere Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to GOD.</p>
               <p>The LORD GOD of our <hi>Fathers,</hi> who hath <hi>ſpread our Heavens,</hi> and <hi>laid the Foundations of our Earth,</hi> make You a PILLAR to Us both in the State &amp; Church.</p>
               <p>As it hath pleaſed HIM to chuſe, adorn &amp; ſet You up; ſo may He pleaſe to fix &amp; eſtabliſh You, and long continue You a FATHER, and illuſtrious Bleſſing to Your People.</p>
               <p>And may the <hi>Name of CHRIST,</hi> and of theſe <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> of our LORD <hi>JESUS,</hi> be <hi>graven</hi> deep upon Your Heart: And Your faithful Services to Them be an <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Name</hi> to You, <hi>which ſhall not be cut off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, not only erect Your Self a <hi>Pillar</hi> in every pious and grateful <hi>Heart,</hi> that loves our Civil and Religious Liberties; and let their Prayers and Bleſſings come upon You; but alſo lay a <hi>good Foundation</hi> againſt the World to come, for everlaſting Fame and Renown, and <hi>to be called</hi> GREAT <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

               <p>WIth Hearts full of Joy, and ſincere Thankfulneſs to GOD, we Congratulate Your Excellency's Return to Your Country, and Your Advancement to the Government of it. The KING could not have choſen any One of it's <hi>Sons,</hi> more worthy to repreſent His Royal Perſon, nor more accepted of the Multitude of Your Brethren.</p>
               <p>When we firſt heard of His <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Grace and Favour to Us, in Naming <hi>Your Excellency</hi> our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, we were like Men that dream: The <hi>Cloud</hi> that hung over us ſcattered in a moment, and as the <hi>Sun</hi> breaks out in a dark Day, ſo was the Face of GOD, and the Light of the KING's Countenance upon Us. We render back to the THRONE our dutiful and fervent Prayers, for His MAJESTY's long Life, and happy Reign over Us.</p>
               <p>According to the good Hand of our GOD upon <hi>Your Excellency,</hi> ſo has the KING granted to You both now and heretofore: GOD help'd You then to do us ſingular Benefits, and now He has rewarded You in an extraordinary manner. We adore the WISE PROVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCE that has led in every ſtep to ſo great an Event, and to GOD be all the Glory.</p>
               <p>We believe, SIR, That You are come full of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to Your Country, to our Churches and to the College; and will always have the moſt tender Sollicitude for their Welfare and Proſperity. And we bow our Knees with You to the GOD of all Wiſdom and Grace, for all thoſe Supplies of both, which You will continually need in the Adminiſtration of the Government.</p>
