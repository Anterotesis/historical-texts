            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>—Now when Solomon had made an end of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the fire came down from Heaven, and conſumed the burnt offering and the ſacrifice, and the glory of the Lord filled the Houſe.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>UNDER the Moſaic Diſpenſation, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were made uſe of as a principal part of the public worſhip of God by the Jewiſh Church: theſe were of two kinds, Gifts and Sacrifices, wherein the life of the creature offered was taken away. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to make an atonement for their ſins, to expreſs their gratitude to God for mercies received, and to procure new favors from his hand.</p>
            <p>IMMEDIATELY after the ſail the Lord inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Adam to offer ſacrifice, Gen. iii.21. When Abel was grown up, he offered the beſt of his flock in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, Gen. iv.4, 10. When Noah went forth from the ark, he offered an acceptable ſacrifice, Gen. viii.20. At different places and upon different occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, offered ſacrifices to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031840_0003_0FEECF471187FDC8"/>
the Lord by his command. From theſe injunctions to the Patriarchs, the cuſtom of offering ſacrifice ſpread through the world—theſe ſacrifices, when offered in faith in reference to the Meſſiah, as the Lamb which was to be ſlain to take away ſin, were conſumed upon the altar by fire from Heaven, as a mark of divine approbation.</p>
            <p>THEY were diſtinguiſhed by various appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſuch as Burnt-offerings, Peace offerings, Sin-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Treſpaſs offerings, Meat-offerings, and Drink-offerings, together with various other kinds.</p>
            <p>THE Offerings made uſe of by Solomon at the dedication of the Temple, were Burnt offerings and Peace-offerings: upon which occaſion he offered twenty-two thouſand Oxen, and an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Sheep. When the beaſts to be offered were prepared and laid upon the Altar, and when the Congregation and Elders of Iſrael were aſſembled, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Prieſts, the Levites, the Singers and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon inſtruments, the Lord gave them a token of his preſence, and that he meant to favor their deſign and bleſs the Congregation, by filling the houſe with a thick cloud. Solomon laid hold on the opportunity, and with the moſt profound reverence and ſolemnity, dedicated the houſe by prayer and ſupplication, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Almighty to make it the temple of his abode; the ſubſtance of which prayer we have in the 6th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031840_0004_0FEECF4896339FD0"/>
of this Book. The Hiſtorian informs us that when Solomon had made an end of praying (as a mark of divine approbation) fire came down from Heaven and conſumed the Burnt-offering and the Sacrifices, and that the glory of the Lord filled the Houſe.</p>
            <p>DID not this ſtrikingly repreſent the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who offered himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, who alone builds the Spiritual Temple, the Church; who takes poor ſinners out of the ruins of fallen nature, forms them by his word and ſpirit, and makes them lively ſtones in the Spiritual building, to offer ſpiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt; who conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates the Church by his matchleſs offering and all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent interceſſion; and who, by the fire of his love, fills the hearts of his people with his glory, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the power of their ſins and corruptions. It alſo reminds us of the obligations we are under to dedicate this Houſe, which has been erected under the care of a kind and indulgent Providence to the Lord, for his worſhip and ſervice. I ſhall therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">I. CONSIDER the qualifications neceſſary for dedicating a Houſe to the Lord, with any proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. SHEW in what manner we ſhould proceed in dedicating this Houſe to the Lord, or what kind of ſacrifices we ſhould offer which will be acceptable.</p>
            <p n="3">III. POINT out the tokens of our ſacrifices being
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031840_0005_0FEECF4A1BC9EFF8"/>
acceptable to God.
<q>The fire came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and conſumed the Burnt-offering and the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: and the glory of the Lord filled the Houſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE firſt things which now demand our attention are the qualifications neceſſary for dedicating a Houſe to the Lord with any proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>TO avoid the charge of hypocriſy brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſrael—
<q>This People draweth nigh to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me,</q>
we ſhould ſeriouſly enquire whether we have made a cheerful dedication of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Lord. In vain do we engage in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of this day unleſs our hearts have been cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed to love the Lord our God with all our hearts, Deut. xxx.6.</p>
            <p>UNLESS we have been humbled for our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſins, and been divinely conſtrained to ſeek refuge in the atoning blood of juſtifying righteouſneſs of the great Redeemer of Mankind, who offered himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin; unleſs we have received him as our Prophet, Prieſt and King, by faith, with thankſgiving, and given ourſelves up to him, to be ruled by his laws, led by his Spirit, and to yield obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; unleſs he has been made to us wiſdom, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption, how can we ſet this Houſe apart for his worſhip with any proſpect of ſucceſs unleſs we are made ſpiritual, and worſhip him
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031840_0006_0FEECF4B9F9DFA98"/>
in ſpirit and in truth; "<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r," ſays an inſpired writer,
<q>We are the circumciſion who worſhip God in the ſpirit, rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus and have no confidence in the fleſh.</q>
Phil. iii.3.</p>
            <p>THIS act of dedicating ourſelves muſt always precede every outward form of worſhip ſimilar to this, agreeable to the language of the Prophet, Iſaiah xliv. 5.
<q>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords: and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of Jacob: and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord, and ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name himſelf by the name of Iſrael.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> WE ſhould be well acquainted with the nature of that worſhip which the Lord requires to be performed in his Houſe, and only which can be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him—not the dry ſyſtematical form of words, however beautifully arranged, and pleaſing to the ear, can afford him entertainment, nor be conſidered a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſubſtitute for the ſincere devotion of the heart. In vain did the proud boaſting Phariſee enter the Temple with uplifted eyes and hands: in vain did he in a lofty tone addreſs the Almighty, ſaying,
<q>God, I thank thee I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this Publican. I faſt twice in the week, I give tythes of all that I poſſeſs. While the Publican ſtanding afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his eyes unto Heaven, but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying, God be merciful to me, a ſinner. This man went down to his houſe juſtified;</q>
that is,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031840_0007_0FEECF548BDE3540"/>
he poſſeſſed peace of conſcience, which was to him an evidence that his ſins were pardoned, and his prayer was accepted.—As no goodneſs or moral virtues of ours will merit the favor of the Almighty, ſo neither will any ſin or multitude of offences exclude a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinner the benefit of his mercy. The great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Mankind and object of religious worſhip, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the engagements of our hearts when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him—"My Son, ſays he, give me thy heart."— When David was inſtructed to ſeek the Lord, he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "My heart ſaid, Lord, thy face will I ſeek." Pſalm xxvii.8.
<q>It is with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, then with the mouth confeſſion will be made unto ſalvation.</q>
Rom. x.10. Every branch of our worſhip muſt correſpond with the inſtructions of God's word, both as to doctrine and experience. If theſe will not bear examination by this infallible rule,
<q>We do err, not knowing the ſcriptures, nor the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God.</q>
Mat. xxii.29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> A PROPER attention ſhould be paid to the object we have in view, and the motives by which we are influenced in the act of dedicating this Houſe to the Lord. What is the object? Is it popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe? Is it a mere conformity to the cuſtom of the day in which we live? Is it to gratify a ſpirit of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to become reſpectable as partiſans of a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſtinct Society? In ſhort, whatever it is, if it is not the glory of the divine Three, Father, Son and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031840_0008_0FEECF56109F37F0"/>
Holy Ghoſt, in the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſinners, and the conſolation and edification of the People of God, yea, all that is comprehended in the word ſalvation, we cannot expect it will proſper, but come to nought, and in that caſe, the ſooner the better.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond thing to be conſidered is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which we ſhould proceed in dedicating a Houſe to the Lord, or what kind of ſacrifices we ſhould offer, which will be acceptable. Since it is not by the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer, not by offering thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſands of rivers of oil, nor by our prayers, our tears, or mere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts of devotion, that ſin can be removed from the heart, or the guilt of it from the conſcience, but by the blood of Chriſt our Paſſover, who was ſacrificed for us.
<q>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</q>
Let us follow him in his victories and triumphs, and gather up the ſpoils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> WE ſhould attend to his worſhip with rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence—reverence becomes the ſanctuary, becomes ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery worſhiper and is due to the object of worſhip: for,
<q>the Lord is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of his ſaints, and to be had in reverence by thoſe who draw nigh unto him. We are to ſerve him with fear, and rejoice with trembling: for he is glorious in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:031840_0009_0FEECF5794896E58"/>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> WE ſhould come bowing at the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool of his mercy, as poor, having nothing but ſin, and guilty, deſerving nothing but miſery: conſcious that we have no might to free our ſouls from the bondage of the law, or break the chains of unbelief; dependant wholly on the riches of mercy and grace, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, we ſhould cry, "Lord, ſave, or we periſh." This is an acceptable ſacrifice, for the ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe. Pſ. li.17.
<q>To this man he will look, and with ſuch he will dwell, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the hearts of the contrite ones.</q>
Iſa. lvii.15. Theſe are the bleſſed deſcribed in Matt. v.3, 4, 6, and to them the promiſes belong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> As a humble frame of mind is the mark of a true penitent, ſo by prayer and ſupplication, we ſhould make known our requeſts to God, reſting upon the promiſe of ſalvation, and wreſtling, as Jacob did with the Angel, when he ſaid, I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me; ſuch will aſſuredly prevail and get that new name, the name of Iſrael. Gen. xxxii.28. We ſhould pray for the light of his countenance, and teachings of his ſpirit, that his grand purpoſes and deſigns in the covenant of grace may be more unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the myſtery of redeeming love explained, and that the unſearchable riches of Chriſt may be brought to view, that thouſands may be effectually called to the

knowledge and enjoyment of the truth within theſe walls—we ſhould pray that he might abundantly bleſs the proviſion of his Houſe, and ſatisfy Zions poor with bread: that he might clothe his Prieſts with ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and cauſe his ſaints to ſhout aloud for joy: that he might teach his Miniſters hands to war and their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to fight againſt ſin and error; that he might pour out his holy ſpirit upon all his people, and dwell in this ſanctuary, and in the heart of every worſhipper: that he might cauſe his goodneſs to paſs before us, and fill the Houſe with his glory. We ſhould pray for our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies, perſecutors and ſlanderers, that their hearts may be changed, and they ſaved in the Lord, with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation.</p>
            <p>THIS is another acceptable ſacrifice to him who hath ſaid, "In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will bleſs thee." Exodus xx.24.</p>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Gratitude of heart, and a public ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his goodneſs and mercy, is another ſacrifice acceptable to the Lord. As a warning to us, and to mark the ingratitude of Hezekiah, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo many and ſuch great favors at the Lord's hand, it is recorded, 2 Chron. xxxii.25.
<q>But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him;</q>
When the ten Lepers were cleanſed by our Lord, and only one turned back to glorify God, he noticed their ingratitude by ſaying.

Luke xvii.17. In addition to the innumerable benefits we have received from the Lord, both temporal and ſpiritual, we ſhould not be unmindful of theſe: that our eyes have ſeen his ſalvation; that our ears have heard and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to hear the joyful ſound of the Goſpel; that our feet have been directed into the paths of righteouſneſs, ſo that we can feed upon the word of truth, and that now, under the direction of his kind Providence, this Houſe has been raiſed, without any material injury to any concerned therein, and under the ſanction of good and wholeſome laws we are formed into a ſociety, and regularly incorporated, ſo that we can ſit under our own vine and fig-tree, and worſhip God agreeable to the dictates of our conſciences. Our ſacrifices ſhould continually be offered upon that altar which ſanctifieth the gift and the giver, even Jeſus, who is our ſacrifice, our Prieſt, and through whom only we can approach the Father. His invitation and promiſe are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for our confidence, that whatſoever we aſk we ſhall receive—his honor is engaged to make good the promiſes, and his praiſe is promoted by our reliance thereon; ſo that his glory is inſeparably connected with the ſalvation of thoſe who believe.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY I ſhall point out the tokens of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices being acceptable to the Lord.
<q>The fire came down from Heaven and conſumed the burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the ſacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the Houſe.</q>

               <hi>Firſt.</hi> IN the days of old the Lord manifeſted his approbation in conſuming the ſacrifice by fire from Heaven. When, by divine appointment Moſes had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed Aaron and his ſons to the office of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and Aaron had brought his ſin-offering, burnt-offering and peace-offering to the altar, fire came down from Heaven and conſumed the ſacrifices, Lev· ix.24. as a token of his divine approbation. When the Iſraelites were defeated in battle by the Midianites, Gideon prayed, and offered a Kid and unleavened bread: in anſwer to his prayer and to honor the gift he has offered, fire roſe up out of the rock, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the fleſh, and the unleavened bread, and Iſrael prevailed againſt Midian. Judges vi.21. When Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid had diſpleaſed the Lord by numbering the people, ſeventy thouſand Iſraelites were ſlain by peſtilence; he then built an altar and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the Lord, and he anſwered him from Heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offerings. 1 Chron. 21, 26. To reprove the Idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhippers of Baal, and to expoſe the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who had deluded them, Elijah built an altar, and offered a burnt-ſacrifice, while the falſe prophets cried in vain to their Idol, the fire came down and conſumed Elijahs ſacrifice, and the wood, and the ſtones, and the duſt, and licked up the water that was in the trench. 1 Kings xviii.38. No ſooner had Solomon made an end of praying before the whole congregation of Iſrael, at
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031840_0013_0FEECF64E51C1770"/>
the dedication of the Temple, but fire came down from Heaven and conſumed the burnt-offering and the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as a token of divine approbation.</p>
            <p>THE conſuming theſe offerings, was typical of the attention the Lord pays to the prayers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the honor he confers upon thoſe who put their truſt in him; he hearkens to the voice of their ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, he hears their cry, and ſaves them out of all their troubles:—There is alſo a book of remembrance before him, which contains every requeſt, however imperfectly made, if they are the requeſts of the ſoul, and which, in his own time, and in his own way, will fully be anſwered. Mal. iii.16. The greateſt deſires of a ſoul under the teachings of the ſpirit, are to have the mind preſerved from guilt, and the heart from the power and pollution of ſin, that they may continually be enabled to ſay,
<q>Whom have we in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that we deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the myſteries of Redeeming Love, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the covenant of grace, in the unſpeakable gift of Jeſus Chriſt, and in our effectual calling by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whoſe favors are without repentance, when theſe, I ſay, are explained and accompanied with an almighty and irreſiſtible power to the ſoul, fear and ſorrow vaniſh, joy and peace ſucceed, and the holy fire of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love warms the heart with inexpreſſible delight, and conſumes the power of our beaſtly luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031840_0014_0FEECF6669C5D518"/>
When Jeſus opened the underſtandings of the two diſciples, in their journey from Jeruſalem to Emmaus, they were conſtrained to acknowledge that their hearts burned within them. Luke xxiv.32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> When Moſes was upon the Mount talking with God, he ſaid, "ſhew me thy glory!" The Lord anſwered him,
<q>Thou canſt not ſee my face, for no man can ſee my face and live, but I will make all my goodneſs paſs before thee, and he proclaimed the name of the Lord, the Lord merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth.</q>
Exod. xxxiii.18, 20. xxxiv.6. The glory of God which filled the Temple when Solomon had made an end of praying was the cloud and a viſible brightneſs, like that of the Sun when covered with a thick cloud, though it cannot be ſeen in its ſplendor and glory, yet its brightneſs will be viſible in a certain degree, and the beholder will be ſatisfied that it is not removed, but veiled by the cloud, and that only for a ſhort period, when its power and influence will return. Incomparably more eaſy would it be to behold the Sun, with the naked eye, in his brightneſs and glory, without an interpoſing veil, than in our mortal and imperfect ſtate, to ſee the Almighty face to face. He is to be ſeen and known only through the veil of Chriſt's human nature,
<q>For God is in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf. In Chriſt dwells all the fulneſs of the godhead bodily,</q>
and he is the
<q>brightneſs of the Father's glory, and the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031840_0015_0FEECF6E8A27F5D8"/>
expreſs image of his perſon.</q>
The glory which filled the Temple, produced a reverential awe of God's holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wiſdom, power, love and faithfulneſs, and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to worſhip him with ſuitable affections.</p>
            <p>THEY were ſenſible he was preſent, though they could not ſee him with their bodily eyes. So now in the act of religious worſhip, the token we ſhould look for, and are encouraged to expect, of the preſence and approbation of the Lord, is that glory which will fill the Houſe and the heart of every ſpiritual worſhiper; if we have ſuch views of his holineſs as to ſay with Job. chap. xlii.5, 6.
<q>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye ſeeth thee, wherefore, I abhor myſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</q>
Such views of his wiſdom in the whole oeconomy of redemption, as to admire and fall in with his method of ſalvation; ſuch views of his power as to fear offending him, and put our whole truſt and confidence in him; ſuch views of his love; as to feel our ſouls animated in his ſervice, and ſuch views of his faithfulneſs, as to rejoice, with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory. Then how precious will the goſpel be to us, we ſhall bind it as chains of gold about our necks. We ſhall then behold the beauty of their feet who bring glad tidings of ſalvation; then how delightful to be engaged in preaching, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in hearing of the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, that in ſuch circumſtances we may ſay with the ſinger in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031840_0016_0FEECF3C8DA79EE8"/>
"Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O city of God." As the fountain of light, his rays penetrate the mind which was ſhut up in darkneſs—Though faint when it riſes, it ſhines brighter and brighter to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day; ſo does the divine glory upon the ſoul bleſſed with its quickening, illuminating, cheering and fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying influences; ſo powerful that its glory is reflected in their profeſſion and conduct; and when the veil of mortality and human imperfection is removed, they will ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and as the ſtars forever and ever;—then they will ſee eye to eye and face to face, loſt in wonder, love and praiſe.</p>
            <p>I SHALL conclude this diſcourſe with an inquiry, and a few obſervations.</p>
            <p>HAS this great change paſſed upon us? Have we been conſtrained to dedicate ourſelves to God? If not, we have cauſe to tremble, conſidering what we are this morning engaged in. As the Lord cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſo neither will he be mocked. May he who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, ſhine forth, through the preaching the goſpel of his Son, in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power, that thoſe who are dead in treſspaſſes and ſins, may hear his voice and live; that thoſe who ſit in darkneſs may ſee a great light; that the glory of our Immanual, as God Man Mediator, may influence them to a cheerful dedication of body, ſoul and ſpirit to the Lord; conſidering they are not their own, but are bought with the price of the Redeemer's blood. May
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031840_0017_0FEECF71937260D8"/>
every Believer this morning renew the act of dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to the Lord. Whenever we enter this ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, may the fire of divine love come down and warm our hearts, and conſume the power of all our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and may the glory of the Lord fill this houſe in the power of the goſpel, and the ſweet enjoyment of his preſence.</p>
            <p>SOONER than this pulpit ſhould be polluted with error, or the worſhip carried on in this place, have for its motto, <hi>Ichabod,</hi> "the glory is departed"—yea, ſooner than theſe walls ſhould afford protection to a licentious Miniſter, or a congregation debauched in their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and corrupt in their worſhip, may the whole fabric be levelled with the ground, or become the habitation of Owls, and the haunt of wild Beaſts.</p>
