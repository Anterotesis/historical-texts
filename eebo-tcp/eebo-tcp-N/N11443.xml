            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE following diſcourſe is with humility dedicated to you, by its author, who ſolicits your patronage.—The ſhort notice given me by the good people to whom it was preached,—my avocations—the great agitation of mind that muſt attend every well-wiſher to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, at this extremely critical juncture, make it defective in coherence and pertinency—When I compoſed it.

               <q>
                  <hi>Behold, how they reward us, to come to caſt us out of thy poſſeſſion, which thou haſt given us to inherit. O our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might againſt this great company that cometh againſt us: neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi>

            <p>TO ſpeak with propriety upon a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo important as is the alarming and affecting ſtate of political affairs in America, at the preſent day, is too arduous for me to attempt. To do it juſtice, requires the force of the moſt ſublime genius, and of art.—Conſcious therefore of my being in a great meaſure deſtitute of theſe accompliſhments; I have nothing to rely on but the divine aſſiſtance, and the known can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of this reſpectable aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Not can I urge your attention by any other motive, than my hearty affection to this my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, and the warmeſt wiſhes for her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014474_0007_0F92B2FCA11BF7A8"/>
It is, my friends, our unhappy lot to live in the day of the American Iſrael's trouble—our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are thoſe of our own houſe.</p>
            <p>We were derived from the great family of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and therefore had ſome rational foundation to expect of her friendly treatment, her kind care and affection. But to our great diſappointment, and even conſternation, ſhe has like an unnatural mother (entirely void of natural affection) turned againſt us, and is now ſheathing her ſword in our bowels; and thereby has plunged us in dire cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, in the laſt diſtreſs of nations, the horrors of A CIVIL WAR! ſo that we have reaſon to cry out in the language of the prophet Jeremiah, <hi>My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart: My heart maketh a noiſe in me, I cannot hold my peace, becauſe thou has heard. O my ſoul, the ſound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</hi>—We find by dire experience, that <hi>"every battle of the warrior is with confuſed noiſe, and garments rolled in blood."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe calamities, as before obſerved, were brought upon us by thoſe who are allied to us by kindred blood; who, not content with their own poſſeſſions and territories in their own proper coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (together with ſome of our own children) have ſent an army, to caſt us out of our poſſeſſion which God gave to our forefathers and to us to inherit! and though we have, of ourſelves, no ſufficient might againſt this great company, yet we hope that God will judge them</p>
            <p>Our text, my friends, is part of the prayer of Jehoſhaphat, when he was in the like diſtreſs, and proclaimed a faſt.—A part of the army, which
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014474_0008_0F92B2FD568F5078"/>
came againſt <hi>him,</hi> were the kindred of his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—they were the Edomites, the poſterity of Eſau, who was the brother of Jacob, the progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the people of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>This appears from the verſe next preceeding our text. Now behold the children of Ammon, and Moab, and <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> whom thou would'ſt not let Iſrael invade, &amp;c.—This Mount Seir was the country which the Edomites inhabited.—The children of Iſrael had it in their power, when they paſſed thro' the territories of the ſeveral people above mentioned, when coming out of the land of Egypt, to have deſtroyed them, and have laid waſte their country—but they did not—they acted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them the part of a kind, generous, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane people, and dealt with them as they might reaſonably expect to be treated.—Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, the Edomites and others no ſooner found themſelves in the poſſeſſion of power, than they raiſed an army, and came to root out and extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the rightful proprietors of the land of Canaan.—Jehoſhaphat in this caſe, did not lean to his own underſtanding, did not put entire confidence in his own ſtrength; but proclaimed a faſt, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated aſſiſtance from the God of armies: <hi>O our God wilt thou not judge them;</hi> wilt thou not give ſucceſs to our arms? Wilt thou not defeat them, and puniſh them for their iniquitous and ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attempts to deprive us of our lives and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
            <p>As our caſe, at the preſent time, is in a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree analogous to his, I ſhall apply the words of the text to ourſelves, and take occaſions from them to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:014474_0009_0F92B2FE13F99620"/>
I. That this our land is God's poſſeſſion, which He has given us to inherit.</p>
            <p>II. That no other man, or body of men, have a right to this poſſeſſion, or any part of it, unleſs we ſee cauſe to give it to him, or them, for ſome good or valuable conſideration; and therefore,</p>
            <p>III. Great-Britain in ſending an army to turn us out of our poſſeſſion, merely becauſe we will not reſign up ourſelves and property, to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of at her will and diſcretion, is unjuſt and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous; and therefore,</p>
            <p>IV. As this army is come againſt us, and as we cannot truſt in an arm of fleſh or upon our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels alone, we ought to have our eyes upon God, for him to eſpouſe our cauſe, and put an end to the quarrel.—</p>
            <p>Firſt then, I am to ſhew that this our land is God's poſſeſſion, which he has given us to inherit.</p>
            <p>In province this, I muſt firſt give you a ſhort hiſtory of the way and manner in which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſeized of God's poſſeſſion, which is ſaid to be given to us.—Thoſe advent'rous worthies, our forefathers, the firſt ſettlers of this country, were eye witneſſes of the infringements that were made upon the civil and religious rights and immunities of their brethren the people of England, during the unpringely adminiſtration of James, and the tyrannic reign of Charles the firſt; which laſt, it is not impoſſible might be an honeſt man, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was a moſt miſguided and impolitic king.</p>
            <p>They (our anceſtors) ſaw the ſeeds of civil war were ſprouting, which were likely to produce a dire harveſt of guns, bayonets, ſwords and ſpears: and ſo, rather than be employ'd in ſhedding and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014474_0010_0F92B2FEF0754218"/>
trampling in their brethren's gore, they choſe to forſake their native ſhores, the land of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's ſepulchres, to procure a peaceful ſeat in ſome foreign region, where they ſhould not hear the voice of the oppreſſor—where they might be free from the ſhackles, forged by popiſh prieſts for their bodies and conſciences too!—where they might, without moleſtation, worſhip the God of their fathers in ſpirit and in truth.</p>
            <p>They embarked—truſting in Jehovah, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to the mercileſs inclemency of the Atlantic—the everlaſting God was their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge—they diſembarked and for the firſt, ſet their feet upon this weſtern main.—The rocks and rough ſhore were their bed—the hideous foreſts and canopy of Heaven their covering—their gra<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s, wild bears and wolves, and other beaſts of prey, with that tawny race, whoſe tender mercies are cruelty.</p>
            <p>That part of theſe lands by them firſt ſettled, they purchaſed by fair bargain of the natives.</p>
            <p>The reſt was obtained by conqueſt, in a war entered into by them for their own juſt defence—and they defended their acquiſitions by themſelves alone for a long time with inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable expence of blood and treaſure! So that if purchaſe and conqueſt give any people a right to any land, territories or hereditaments whatſoever, then we have an excluſive right to this land, and all the profits of it.—</p>
            <p>It is God's poſſeſſion, as being a part of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the whole world is his, and the fulneſs; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he had an indefeaſible title to America.—It is his poſſeſſion, for that his churches are here
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014474_0011_0F92B2FFA1520B68"/>
erected, and his worſhip is not carried on in greater purity and beauty, in any other part of the world.—</p>
            <p>Here the doctrines of the chriſtian faith are known and underſtood in their greateſt purity—here are the tabernacles of God—his ſanctuaries where he delights to dwell, and where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the bleſſing, even life for evermore—This, I think, makes our land God's poſſeſſion, by way of eminence.—</p>
            <p>And it appears that he gave it to us to inherit, in that Americans from our anceſtors downward, 'till very lately, have had the peculiar ſmiles of Heaven. Where?—in what country, was it ever known that a people aroſe from paucity to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs ſo faſt? When in any other part of the world, did three millions of people exiſt in one col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective body, in a country diſcovered for them but little more than a century and an half?</p>
            <p>This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes!—</p>
            <p>And moſt of us (if not all) have had theſe lands confirmed to us by charters, which have had the ſanction of <hi>royal faith!</hi> Not that I ſuppoſe that the royal grantors had any legal right to grant theſe lands, for they were not ſeized of them, and conſequently had no property in them—for tho' we ſhould admit (as we may with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) that the diſcovery of an uninhabited country, may give the diſcoverers a right to ſuch lands, yet this rule could not operate in this caſe, becauſe this country was actually inhabited by the aboriginal Indians, of whom our forefathers purchaſed.—</p>
            <p>So that, as I conceive of it, the operation of the charters, relative to this country, was not a grant
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014474_0012_0F92B3038425B0F8"/>
of theſe lands to thoſe who before had no right to them; but was only a royal promiſe and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that we ſhould occupy and enjoy, and not be diſturbed in the enjoyment of all thoſe lands, tenements, and hereditaments, of which the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſettlers of America, before the date of ſaid charters, were ſeized and in actual poſſeſſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">The purchaſing of theſe lands of the Indians, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended royal grant notwithſtanding, is <hi>prima facie</hi> evidence, that the nominal grantees were under a full conviction that the ſaid grant conveyed a title, in foro juris Naturalis, invalid—that it was but a meer Fictio juris, the ſhadow, without the ſubſtance.</note> And as theſe lands are thus clearly ours, I am naturally led to ſay accordingly—that no other man, or body of men, have a right to this poſſeſſion, or any part of it, unleſs we ſee cauſe to give it to him or them, for ſome good or valuable conſideration.</p>
            <p>This is a doctrine, which has been ſo often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and proved over and over again, and is ſo well underſtood by people in general, that it ſeems almoſt unneceſſary to inſiſt upon it—But to ſtir up your minds by way of remembrance, I will now ſuggeſt ſome of the arguments which ſupport the aſſertion.—What any man acquires by his own labour and toil, he had an excluſive right to. To whatever is <hi>given</hi> to a man he has the ſame right—Whatever a man obtains by legal purchaſe, no man has a right to take from him.—Theſe are the principal ways in which men acquire property,<note n="†" place="bottom">The ſyſtematical law, writers, mention other ways of acquiring property, ſuch as, Occupancy, Deſcent &amp;c. but as they are comprehended in thoſe I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it is unneceſſary to give them a diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</note>—
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014474_0013_0F92B305AC0EFDE0"/>
Now as the natural rights of mankind are immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably the ſame, and as one man has naturally no pre-eminence above another, hence it undeniably follows (and it reſpects communities and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent parts as well as individuals) that no reaſon can be given why one man ſhould take away, have and enjoy that which is another's, without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.—The word <hi>property</hi> ſignifies that eſtate of ſubſtance which a man has and poſſeſſes, excluſive of the right and power of all the world beſides.</p>
            <p>Now, unleſs a man can diſpoſe of what he has, as he pleaſes, and keep it as long as he pleaſes, he cannot be ſaid to have any property at all.</p>
            <p>This does not extend ſo far, as to put a man at liberty to withold the payment of his juſt debts, or his proportional part of the neceſſary charges of good and wholeſome government.</p>
            <p>For when a man contracts a debt, he is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the judgment of the law, and of reaſon, at that time to promiſe to pay that debt. By this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the property in that matter, or ſubſtance which is to pay the ſame debt (whether money or any thing elſe)paſſes <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>promiſſor,</hi> into the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſee,</hi> or him to whom the promiſe is made.—So in regard to paying the charges of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; every man in the community is ſuppoſed either explicitly or implicitly, to conſent and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to be a member of that community; unleſs he expreſsly declares the contrary; and in this caſe, he is <hi>out lowed,</hi> and has no title or claim to any protection or ſupport.</p>
            <p>When men thus enter into ſociety they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſent and promiſe, each and every one of them, that they will bear their proportional part
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014474_0014_0F92B3072E978938"/>
of the charges reſulting from the ſupport of good regulation and government.</p>
            <p>And this is but the reaſonable and legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of every man's conduct, who enters into ſociety. So that, even in the caſes of debt, and the charges of government, the conſent of every man is had, previous to the diſpoſal of his property.</p>
            <p>Here I would juſt obſerve, that the members of the community, in a free ſtate, are to be conſulted, and are to determine from time to time, the <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of their property, which is to go to the ſupport of civil government, and to defray other contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent charges. And in caſe any ſociety, or (rather) community; neglect thus to do, their government falls to the ground, and they of courſe revert to the ſtate of nature.</p>
            <p>But let us ſuppoſe juſt for the preſent, that there are a clan of diſtinguiſhed, high-privileged mortals in the world, perhaps in Great-Britain, who have a legal right to levy taxes, and diſpoſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of their fellow-mortals at their own pleaſure and diſcretion!—Let us ſee where it will carry us.</p>
            <p>If they have a right in this way to take ſix pence, by the ſame rule they may take a ſhilling. And when their purſes, after a frolick, are grown a little lank, and their inclination prompts them, they may take a pound—and ſo on, till they have got the whole. Whence it follows, that there are ſome of our fellow-mortals, who, however honeſt and well deſerving they may be, and let them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor ever ſo hard, and procure ever ſo much gain, yet LEGALLY they have no property at all. This doctrine of the diſpoſal of property, without the conſent of the proprietor, is ſo ridiculous and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014474_0015_0F92B307EDBC7348"/>
abſurd, that it ſeems to me it is not irrational to ſuppoſe that it had its origination in Bedlam, or—a worſe place!</p>
            <p>I will conclude this head with producing only one authority from a writer who underſtood the nature of civil government, as well (at leaſt) as any writer, ancient or modern—the famous ALGER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NON SYDNEY—Says he, "NO MAN CAN GIVE THAT WHICH IS ANOTHER's." Which leads me to the conſideration of the third thing aſſerted, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>That Great-Britain in ſending an army to turn us out of our poſſeſſions, meerly becauſe we will not tamely reſign ourſelves and property to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of at her will and diſcretion, is unjuſt and barbarous.</p>
            <p>What is ſaid under the laſt head, is full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that it is in oppoſition to that plain dictate of reaſon &amp; common ſenſe, that no man is to have his property taken from him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own conſent, or that of his repreſentative.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid that her deſign is not to eject us from our poſſeſſions, but only to make us ſwear allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſubmit to the authority of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—I anſwer, this does not alter the merits of the cauſe, nor invalidate my aſſertion. Let me examine it.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh troops were ſent here expreſly and profeſſedly, to FORCE the Americans to own and acknowledge that the Britiſh parliament have a right to make laws binding upon them in ALL CASES WHATSOEVER. And now ſhould we Americans acknowledge this as their right, what would be the conſequence? The following!—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:014474_0016_0F92B308B98C2D80"/>
Firſt, If they by <hi>law</hi> bind us in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, then it is as evident as that two and two make four, that <hi>no poſſible caſe is excepted</hi> If ſo, then ſecondly, we are compleatly <hi>tenants at will,</hi> and have no permanent property.</p>
            <p>Now you all, no doubt, know that in <hi>law,</hi> a tenant at will, is he who holds an eſtate of another, determinable at the will and pleaſure of either of the parties.—Now if this exhorbitant claim of Parliament is acknowledged, <abbr>viz</abbr> a right, &amp;c. then they may, conſiſtently with themſelves, <hi>enact and ordain</hi> that all the lands and tenements in New-England (and more if they pleaſe) ſhall be deemed and be the King's property alone in Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Simple; and that we the preſent proprietors and poſſeſſors ſhall hold them only during his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>Now the King may determine his will, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſes, as well as <hi>any other man:</hi> And when his will is determined, we muſt, let come on us what will, <hi>leave the ground!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is but one inſtance, in which we can have an opportunity to determine our will, and that is to be beforehand with the King, and evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate our habitations, and relinquiſh our eſtates, in the ſame manner, as our ſuffering fellow-country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Roxbury and Charleſton have done.<note n="*" place="bottom">When this ſermon was preached, not many of the Boſtonians had emigrated.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is a never failing maxim of law, that <hi>that is certain, which may be rendered certain</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014474_0017_0F92B30963B10A08"/>
moral certainty, that if they have this right, now they are ſo loaded and diſtreſſed with debt, they, if they are not born fools, will exerciſe it.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid that the <hi>humanity of Britons</hi> will not admit of it, I anſwer—we have had a ſtriking ſpecimen of the humanity of Britons, on the 19th of April—in the ever memorable battle of Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington!!—On the other hand—If we do not ſubmit, nor acknowledge the ſaid claims, then we are to be DRAGOONED into a ſubmiſſion!</p>
            <p>Then conqueſt will be their mode of acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—If they gain the victory, then we are to be treated as <hi>Traitors,</hi> which (by the laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) is as follows; we are to be drawn on hurdles, i. e. carriages made of bundles of bruſh, and drawn by horſes on the ground, to the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—then hanged a while by the neck—then taken down, and our bowels taken out and burnt before our eyes—then beheaded and quartered, and our heads and quarters diſpoſed of at the King's pleaſure! [God Almighty be merciful to our ſouls!]—then enſue a confiſcation of eſtates and corruption of blood, ſo that our poſterity never can inherit, to the lateſt generation;<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Hawk, P. C. 443.</note> (then ſhe is ſure of them)—and all this becauſe we are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of keeping what little ſubſtance we have earned by the ſweat of our brow—by hard labor and toil, for the ſupport of ourſelves and families—and of that government under which <hi>we may lead lives in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O our God, wilt thou not judge them?</hi>

If it be ſaid, that we ought to pay ſomething in return for the protection we have received from Great-Britain, in our trade and commerce—I would aſk (admitting it for argument's ſake) What in the name of goodneſs, is the reaſon why it may not be paid by our VOLUNTARY GRANT, and in the ſame manner as the commons of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land raiſe their ſubſidies, to defray the charges of their fleets and armies?—But, by the way, I don't conceive that we owe her very much, on this ſcore—for ſhe has all along had the monopoly of our trade, that is the excluſive enjoyment of it, by which means MILLIONS of money have yearly accrued to her, which otherwiſe ſhe never would have had, the loſs of which by our non-importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is likely ſhe will ſoon terribly feel!</p>
            <p>Had we enjoyed a free trade with other nations, we ſhould have been much richer than we now are, and perhaps, have been able to make a better defence in a time of war.</p>
            <p>However, upon the whole, let the friends of government (ſo called) ſay what they will, it is <hi>certain,</hi> that the intent and deſign of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in ſending her fleets and troops here, is by <hi>one</hi> mean or another to take from us what we call our PROPERTY, and to change the nature of our freehold.<note n="*" place="bottom">I would not here be underſtood as meaning that there is an abſolute certainty that ſhe will, immediately, by an act of Parliament alter the mode of our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion or fealty: or ſoon, by ſtatute make us hold our lands of the Lord <hi>paramount,</hi> or to be tenants <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravail;</hi> and the only reaſon is, that ſhe muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be under a conviction of the iniquity of ſuch procedure: otherwiſe, ſhe would immediately exerciſe the pretended right in controverſy, and of this there is that moral, though not legal, certainty, above mentioned—But however this may be, as the ſtate of things now is, whether we acknowledge the right aforeſaid, or not, what I have ſuggeſted muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, in the courſe of thing, come into event. If we do acknowledge the right claimed by Parliament, we muſt hold as ſhe pleaſes—If we ſubmit to her impoſitions, we ſhall in a ſhort time be ouſted of our lands.—Our medium of currency will become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient—Mortgages muſt enſue—The mortgagors, deſtitute of a power of redemption, muſt ſurrender to the <hi>Great</hi> mortgagees.—and thus will the greater fiſh ſwallow up <hi>the leſſer fry.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I come now to ſpeak of the laſt thing propoſed—which is—That ſince this army is come againſt us; and as we cannot truſt in an arm of fleſh or on our own counſels alone, we ought to have our eyes upon God, for him to eſpouſe our cauſe, and put an end to the quarrel—as in the text—<hi>we have no might againſt this great company that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt us; neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon Thee.</hi>—Before I proceed, I muſt obſerve ſome things, to aſcertain the meaning of this latter part of the text—When Jehoſhaphat ſays, <hi>we have no might,</hi> he does not mean that he was deſtitute of troops—for in the 17th chap. v. 14th and onward, we find that he muſters 1,160,000 men ready prepared for the war.</p>
            <p>Nor does he mean, that they were ſmall, weak, and cowardly fellows: for it is there ſaid, that they were all men of valour—But his meaning was, and is evidently this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that without the ſmiles of heaven, the greateſt army can effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; that <hi>the race is not to the ſwift, not the battle to the ſtrong.—</hi> He had, no doubt, the ſame ſentiments as Aſa his father had, when he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade

the huge hoſt of the Ethiopians and Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, who cried in the face of his army, and ſaid, Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many or with them that have no power: Help us, O Lord our God, for we reſt on thee; and in thy name we go againſt this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God, let not man prevail againſt thee. And when he (Jehoſh.) ſays, <hi>we know not what to do,</hi> he intends no more than this, that without the guidance and direction of him who rules in the armies of heaven above, and of this earth, they muſt of neceſſity go forth to war as it were blindfold; for that God is "peculiarly concerned in deciding the fate of battles," and victory goes to the ſide, which, in all human pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, had the leaſt foundation to expect ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.—To go on then with the propoſition—we ought to have our eyes upon God, for him to eſpouſe our cauſe,—It is the duty of a people, in times of diſtreſs, to acknowledge God in all their ways, that ſo he may be pleaſed to direct their paths. We are not to put our confidence in an arm of fleſh, but in the Lord of Hoſts and God of armies.</p>
            <p>It is very dangerous, to truſt ſolely in the ſtrength of men.

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014474_0024_0F92B3136336A600"/>
if we now relinquiſh our rights and privileges—if we deſert our cauſe, and, like the Iſſachar, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zily couch down under the burden, "we ſhall be guilty of ſacriledge to God, and treachery to future generations."—"Therefore we are not to neglect the natural means of ſafety." Let our troops conſiſt of a reſpectable number of able-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died men—let them be well equiped with the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments of war, and to their arms let them ſtand, and play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God; and the Lord do what ſeemeth him good.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now, by way of concluſion, make ſome reflections on what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>And from hence we learn, that human nature is ſo depraved, that many among mankind are ſo void of generoſity, equity, and humanity, as, not content with what of right belongs to them, they audaciouſly venture to ſtrip and pillage their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, honeſt, and induſtrious friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours—and all under the ſpecious name of RIGHT. Behold how they reward us, to come to caſt us out of thy poſſeſſion which thou has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us to inherit.</p>
            <p>It is melancholy to reflect upon that ſordid ambition and avarice which poſſeſs the minds of men, which prompt them with rapacious hands to rob others of their property, their dear brought ſubſtance, earned by hard labor and toil, on which alone they can ſubſiſt. How humiliating, to think that any ſhould attempt to enſlave the free-born mind—to compel us meanly to cringe to uſurpation and arbitary power—ſhould ravage our country—firſt pillage, then burn our dwellings over our heads, and butcher our friends before our eyes!</p>
            <p>

2dly. It has been ſuggeſted in the foregoing diſcourſe, that a great company is come and coming to make an invaſion upon us, againſt whom we have no might—with whom we cannot cope with any hopes of ſucceſs, without the guidance, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and aſſiſtance of the God of the armies of Iſrael. Then ſurely it becomes us to humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God, for thoſe ſins, which have cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to bring ſo heavy a judgment upon us,—and to bring ourſelves into ſuch a ſubmiſſive frame, as that we may be in a capacity to receive ſo great a favor as the removal of this great company from us,—or elſe their defeat, ſo that they may have no advantage againſt us, and that we may ſtill lead quiet and peaceable lives, and have none to make us afraid.</p>
            <p>But can there be any diſadvantage accruing to us from our inferiority to this company of men, which, it is ſurmiſed, is coming againſt us? Surely it ſeems there cannot:—For this great company ſpoken of, conſiſts of Britiſh troops, who are bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh—Surely THEY cannot do us any hurt! In ſettling this great matter, let us have recourſe to facts.</p>
            <p>According to the beſt of my remembrance, ſome time in the fall of the year 1768, the ſcheme of poſting an armed force in Boſton, for certain pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. was carried into execution. Then, for the firſt time, did the inhabitants of this Province be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Britons, in military hue and equipage, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in their Capital,—to aſſiſt, as was ſaid, the civil magiſtrate, in carrying his edicts into executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Though, as dire experience has made appear, to overawe and fright the inhabitants into a mean, abject ſubmiſſion to arbitrary power. Old-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014474_0026_0F92B31736391E68"/>
military-band deſpiſed and contemned New-England's virtuous ſons—they treated them with inſult and abuſe. The armed ſoldier, with cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly ſoul, attacks the honeſt countryman naked of defence—accoſts him with ſuch language as muſt ſhock the moſt indelicate ear—with reproachful names he's ſtigmatized, and loaded with obloquy, too much for innocence to bear. Our ſabbaths and other holidays profaned. The worſhip of the GREAT SUPREME interrupted by harſh ſounds of drums and fifes &amp; military parade—The ſoldiery patrolling the ſtreets before the doors of temples rear'd to God, while prayers were offered to the Almighty Lord!—The ears of the virtuous fair, before uſed only to delicacy and politeneſs, now grated with ribaldry; reſulting from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt efforts of minds vicious and obſcene.—Thus ſtriving with Midianitiſh policy and guiles, to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy our morals, and debauch the BEAUTEOUS THRONG of daughters in our land.—</p>
            <p>Thus did two years roll heavy and gloomy on—Till on THE FATAL FIFTH OF MARCH, 1770; when Beelzebub broke looſe, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal train, joined with the ſcarlet throng, with George's livery, by name the XXIXth.—</p>
            <p>Then were there ſeen citizens of our now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs'd metropolis fallen by one leaden ſhower, and weltering in their gore!—</p>
            <p>Thus were the ſoul's of undeſigning and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically innocent Americans ſtript of their bodies, and ſent to Heaven's dread tribunal, there to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle their accounts, before they'd time to ſay, Lord have mercy on us!</p>
            <p>Now view bereaved relatives—their boſoms heaving—wringing their hands with grief,—bro't
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014474_0027_0F92B31942CBCA30"/>
into the liſt of mourners, they make a melancholly train—we pitied them, and ſympathized.—</p>
            <p>Thus, in our view, did Britons turn ruffians and horribly diſgrac'd their native country by the change!—May their conſciences harrow up their ſouls,—and like Angel's trumpet-tongued proclaim "THE DEEP DAMNATION OF THE DEED!"</p>
            <p>Five years more have now revolved—In this interval, the ſame unhallowed courſes, as at firſt, have been purſued.—</p>
            <p>'Till on THE EVER MEMORABLE NINETEENTH OF APRIL, 1775; new bloody ſcenes were opened to our view!</p>
            <p>As for that day, let its gloomineſs and the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death forever terrify thoſe murd'rous ſouls who wantonly then ſpilt OUR BRETHREN's BLOOD!—Who could have conceived, that men of CHRISTIAN NAME were capable of thus putting to the bluſh wild ſavages of the deſart?</p>
            <p>But, however ſtartling to our mind, and troops of Britain's king, ſet out upon a plundering expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in dead of night, being ſkill'd in works of darkneſs.—At morning light, they arriv'd at LEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, THE PORCH OF CIVIL WAR—There accoſted our innocent countrymen with the infernal, ſhocking name, <hi>damn'd rebels</hi>—there wantonly let looſe the dogs of war, and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant tongues cry'd HAVOC!!!—and by ONE fire diſmantled eight dear ſouls, and ſent them murmuring to the ſkies!—<hi>are theſe Britons?</hi>—O our God! wilt thou not JUDGE them!</p>
            <p>I muſt forbear—to go thro' the hiſtory of their conduct at CONCORD, their ravages and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in retreat, is too painful to the human mind.

—And what is now our duty? Muſt we now ſit ſtill and maintain peace with the butchers of our friends? Shall we maintain it "at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of property, liberty and life, and all that dear"? God forbid! If ever there was a call in providence to take the ſword, there now is—Therefore <hi>to arms!—to arms!</hi>—leſt that curſe fall upon us, which fell upon the daſtardly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Meroz</hi> (Jud. 5. 23.) "Curſe ye Meroz, ſaid the angel of the Lord; curſe ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof: becauſe they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty."</p>
            <p>We truſt that all, whoſe circumſtances will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of it, will go—that none ſuch will refuſe to inliſt in defence of his country. When God, in his providence, calls to take the ſword; if any refuſe to obey, Heaven's dread artillery is levelled againſt him, as you may ſee, Jer. 48. 10. CURSED BE HE THAT KEEPETH BACK HIS SWORD FROM BLOOD; curſed is that ſneaking coward who neglects the ſinking ſtate when called to its defence—O then, flee this dire curſe—let Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica's valorous ſons put on the harneſs, nor take it off till peace ſhall be to Iſrael.</p>
            <p>When they have engaged by enliſtment, let them act with fidelity, nor e'er deſert or leave the ground, till the campaign is ended, till fair, tho' baniſhed PEACE is full reſtor'd to MASSACHU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SETTS-BAY, and the whole weſtern world.—If any do deſert, the thunder bolt divine is direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their hearts, in the prophet Jeremiah, <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that by enliſtment plights his faith, then leaves the ground a coward, merits this dire curſe.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014474_0029_0F92B31A9627AD38"/>
—But there is another ſort of coward, who (to uſe the words of a late rouſing preacher) are ſly hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical cowards, who undertake the work of the Lord, that is, take up arms; but they do it deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully—they do not faithfully uſe their arms for the purpoſes for which they were taken—they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence ſoldiers, not that they may ſerve their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and do their duty to God—but that they may live in eaſe, idleneſs and pleaſure, and enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the public expence.—Curſed be he that doth the work of the lord deceitfully, and ſerves himſelf under pretence of ſerving his country.—Thus he.—</p>
            <p>Let none merit this flagitious character—but let them act their parts with fidelity, that ſo, at laſt, they may receive the rewards of good&amp;faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants—that they may be found ſuch good ſoldiers in the temporal militia, as that, at laſt, they may be raiſed to, and mingled with the CHURCH TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>UMPHANT in heaven.—</p>
            <p>To conclude—Let us all realize, that we are candidates for eternity—"We muſt ſave our ſouls, as well as our country." We have no might againſt the great company of principalities and powers of darkneſs, which are come againſt our ſouls to deſtroy them with an everlaſting deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—O our God, wilt thou not judge and prevent <hi>them</hi>—theſe are more terrible than all the troops of Britain, France. or Spain, with guns and ſwords, and all the dreadful artillery of death.—May we now put on the whole armour of God, and quit ourſelves like men and be ſtrong, and having done all, make a vigorous ſtand—May we all enliſt in this ſpiritual welfare,—</p>

May we now commence eternal hoſtilities with SIN, and be enabled by our God to carry on a ſucceſsful war againſt it, may be we fight the good fight of faith and overcome all our ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the world, the fleſh and the devil thro' him that loved us—that ſo fighting as good ſoldiers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, we may be thought worthy to enter into the kingdom of the prince of peace: Even into that kingdom which cannot be ſhaken; where are no wars, nor rumours of wars, but an everlaſting reſt for the people of God.</p>
