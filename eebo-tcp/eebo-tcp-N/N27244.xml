            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I WAS ≈øtrongly urged to publi≈øh the following work, immediately after my return from captiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which was nearly forty years ago‚Äîbut, as at that time the Americans were ≈øo little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Indian affairs, I apprehended a great part of it would be viewed as fable or romance.</p>
            <p>As the Indians never attempted to prevent me either from reading or writing, I kept a Journal, which I revi≈øed ≈øhortly after my return from captivity, and which I have kept ever ≈øince: and as I have had but a moderate Engli≈øh education, have been advi≈øed to employ ≈øome per≈øon of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral education to tran≈øcribe and embelli≈øh it‚Äîbut believing that nature always out≈øhines art, have thought, that occurrences truly and plainly ≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as they happened, would make the be≈øt hi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, be better under≈øtood, and mo≈øt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>In the different Indian ≈øpeeches copied into this work, I have not only imitated their own ≈øtyle, or mode of ≈øpeaking, but have al≈øo pre≈øerved the ideas meant to be communicated in tho≈øe ≈øpeeches ‚ÄîIn common conver≈øation, I have u≈øed my own ≈øtyle, but pre≈øerved their ideas. The principal advantage that I expect will re≈øult to the public, from the publication of the following ≈øheets, is the <hi>observations on the Indian mode of warfare.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has taught the Americans the nece≈ø≈øity of adopting their mode, and the more perfect we are in that mode, the better we ≈øhall be able to defend our≈øelves again≈øt them, when defence is nece≈ø≈øary,</p>

            <head>REMARKABLE OCCURRENCES, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN May 1755, the province of Penn≈øylvania, agreed to ≈øend out three hundred men, in order to cut a waggon road from Fort Loudon, to join Braddock's road, near the Turkey Foot, or three forks of Yohogania; My brother-in-law, William Smith e≈øq. of Conococheague, was appointed commi≈ø≈øioner, to have the over≈øight of the≈øe road-cutters.</p>
            <p>Though I was at that time only eighteen years of age, I had fallen violently in love with a young lady, whom I apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of a large ≈øhare of both beauty and virtue;‚Äî but being born between Venus and Mars, I concluded I mu≈øt al≈øo leave my dear fair one, and go out with this company of road-cutters, to ≈øee the event of this campaign; but ≈øtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that ≈øome time in the cour≈øe of this ≈øummer, I ≈øhould again return to the arms of my beloved.</p>
            <p>We went on with the road, without interruption, until near the Allegheny Mountain; when I was ≈øent back, in order to hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry up ≈øome provi≈øion waggons that were on the way after us; I proceeded down the road as far as the cro≈ø≈øings of Juniata, where, finding the waggons were coming on as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible, I returned up the road, again towards the Allegheny Mountain, in company with one Arnold Vigoras. About four or five miles above Bedford, three Indians had made a blind of bu≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ≈øtuck in the ground, as though they grew naturally, where they concealed them≈øelves, about fifteen yards from the road. When we came oppo≈øite to them, they fired upon us, at this ≈øhort di≈øtance, and killed my fellow traveller, yet their bullets did not touch me; but my hor≈øe making a violent ≈øtart, threw me, and the Indians immediately ran up, and took me pri≈øoner. The one that laid hold on me was a Cana≈øatauga, the other two were Delawares. One of them could ≈øpeak En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh, and a≈øked me if there were any more white men coming
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036317_0005_1008DBA3E32DB4F0"/>
after? I told them not any near, that I knew of. Two of the≈øe Indians ≈øtood by me, whil≈øt the other ≈øcalped my comrade: they then ≈øet off and ran at a ≈ømart rate, through the woods, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen miles, and that night we ≈ølept on the Alegheny Mountain, without fire.</p>
            <p>The next morning they divided the la≈øt of their provi≈øion which they had brought from Fort DuQue≈øne, and gave me an equal ≈øhare, which was about two or three ounces of mouldy bi≈øcuit‚Äîthis and a young Ground-Hog, about as large as a Rabbit, roa≈øted, and al≈øo equally divided, was all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion we had until we came to the Loyal-Hannan, which was about fifty miles; and a great part of the way we came through exceeding rocky Laurel-thickets, without any path. When we came to the We≈øt ≈øide of Laurel-Hill, they gave the ≈øcalp hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loo, as u≈øual, which is a long yell or halloo, for every ≈øcalp or pri≈øoner they have in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; the la≈øt of the≈øe ≈øcalp hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loos were followed with quick and ≈øudden, ≈øhrill ≈øhouts of joy and triumph. On their performing this, we were an≈øwered by the firing of a number of guns on the Loyal-Hannan, one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, quicker than one could count, by another party of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who were encamped near where Ligoneer now ≈øtands. As we advanced near this party, they increa≈øed with repeated ≈øhouts of joy and triumph; but I did not ≈øhare with them in their exce≈ø≈øive mirth. When we came to this camp, we found they had plenty of Turkeys and other meat, there; and though I never before eat veni≈øon without bread or ≈øalt; yet as I was hungry, it reli≈øhed very well. There we lay that night, and the next morning the whole of us marched on our way for Fort DuQue≈øne. The night after we joined another camp of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, with nearly the ≈øame ceremony, attended with great noi≈øe, and apparent joy, among all, except one. The next morning we continued our march, and in the afternoon we came in full view of the fort, which ≈øtood on the point, near where Fort Pitt now ≈øtands. We then made a halt on the bank of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legheny, and repeated the ≈øcalp halloo, which was an≈øwered by the firing of all the firelocks in the hands of both Indians and French who were in and about the fort, in the afore≈øaid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and al≈øo the great guns, which were followed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ≈øhouts and yells of the different ≈øavage tribes who were then collected there.</p>
            <p>As I was at this time unacquainted with this mode of firing and yelling of the ≈øavages, I concluded that there were thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands of Indians there, ready to receive General Braddock; but what added to my ≈øurprize, I ≈øaw numbers running tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards me, ≈øtripped naked, excepting breech-clouts, and painted in the mo≈øt hideous manner, of various colors, though the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036317_0006_1008DBA56A9F0E78"/>
color was vermillion, or a bright red; yet there was annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this, black, brown, blue, &amp;c. As they approached, they formed them≈øelves into two long ranks, about two or three rods apart. I was told by an Indian that could ≈øpeak Engli≈øh, that I mu≈øt run betwixt the≈øe ranks, and that they would flog me all the way, as I ran, and if I ran quick, it would be ≈øo much the better, as they would quit when I got to the end of the ranks. There appeared to be a general rejoicing around me, yet, I could find nothing like joy in my brea≈øt; but I ≈øtarted to the race with all the re≈øolution and vigor I was capable of exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and found that it was as I had been told, for I was flogged the whole way. When I had got near the end of the lines, I was ≈øtruck with ≈øomething that appeared to me to be a ≈øtick, or the handle of a tommahawk, which cau≈øed me to fall to the ground. On my recovering my ≈øen≈øes, I endeavored to renew my race; but as I aro≈øe, ≈øome one ca≈øt ≈øand in my eyes, which blinded me ≈øo, that I could not ≈øee where to run. They conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued beating me mo≈øt intolerably, until I was at length in≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but before I lo≈øt my ≈øen≈øes, I remember my wi≈øhing them to ≈øtrike the fatal blow, for I thought they intended killing me, but apprehended they were too long about it.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt thing I remember was my being in the fort, amid≈øt the French and Indians, and a French doctor ≈øtanding by me, who had opened a vein in my left arm: after which the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter a≈øked me how I did, I told him I felt much pain; the doctor then wa≈øhed my wounds, and the brui≈øed places of my body, with French brandy. As I felt faint, and the brandy ≈ømelt well, I a≈øked for ≈øome inwardly, but the doctor told me, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, that it did not ≈øuit my ca≈øe.</p>
            <p>When they found I could ≈øpeak, a number of Indians came around me, and examined me with threats of cruel death, if I did not tell the truth. The fir≈øt que≈øtion they a≈øked me, was, how many men were there in the party that were coming from Penn≈øylvania, to join Braddock? I told them the truth, that there were three hundred. The next que≈øtion was, were they well armed? I told them them they were all well armed, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the arm of fle≈øh) for they had only about thirty guns among the whole of them; which, if the Indians had known, they would certainly have gone and cut them all off<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> therefore I could not in con≈øcience let them know the defencele≈øs ≈øituation of the≈øe road-cutters. I was then ≈øent to the ho≈øpital, and carefully attended by the doctors, and recovered quicker than what I expected.</p>
            <p>Some time after I was there, I was vi≈øited by the Delaware Indian already mentioned, who was at the taking of me, and could ≈øpeak ≈øome Engli≈øh. Though he ≈øpoke but bad Engli≈øh,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036317_0007_1008DBA85C4048D8"/>
yet I found him to be a man of con≈øiderable under≈øtanding. I a≈øked him if I had done any thing that had offended the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which cau≈øed them to treat me ≈øo unmercifully? He ≈øaid no, it was only an old cu≈øtom the Indians had, and it was like how do you do; after that he ≈øaid I would be well u≈øed. I a≈øked him if I ≈øhould be admitted to remain with the French? He ≈øaid no ‚Äîand told me that as ≈øoon as I recovered, I mu≈øt not only go with the Indians, but mu≈øt be made an Indian my≈øelf. I a≈øked him what news from Braddock's army? He ≈øaid the Indians ≈øpied them every day, and he ≈øhewed me by making marks on the ground with a ≈øtick, that Braddock's army was advancing in very clo≈øe order, and that the Indians would ≈øurround them, take trees, and (as he expre≈ø≈øed it) <hi>shoot um down all one pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after this, on the 9th day of July 1755, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I heard a great ≈øtir in the fort. As I could then walk with a ≈øtaff in my hand, I went out of the door which was ju≈øt by the wall of the fort, and ≈øtood upon the wall and viewed the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in a huddle before the gate, where were barrels of powder, bullets, flints &amp;c. and every one taking what ≈øuited; I ≈øaw the Indians al≈øo march off in rank, intire‚Äîlikewi≈øe the French Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadians, and ≈øome regulars, after viewing the Indians and French in different po≈øitions, I computed them to be about four hundred, and wondered that they attempted to go out again≈øt Braddock with ≈øo ≈ømall a party. I was then in high hopes that I would ≈øoon ≈øee them flying before the Briti≈øh troops, and that general Braddock would take the fort and re≈øcue me.</p>
            <p>I remained anxious to know the event of this day; and in the afternoon I again ob≈øerved a great noi≈øe and commotion in the fort, and though at that time I could not under≈øtand French, yet I found that it was the voice of Joy and triumph, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they had received what I called bad news.</p>
            <p>I had ob≈øerved ≈øome of the old country ≈øoldiers ≈øpeak Dutch, as I ≈øpoke Dutch I went to one of them, and a≈øked him what was the news? he told me that a runner had ju≈øt arrived, who ≈øaid that Braddock would certainly be defeated; that the Indians and French had ≈øurrounded him, and were concealed behind trees and in gullies, and kept a con≈øtant fire upon the Engli≈øh, and that they ≈øaw the Engli≈øh falling in heaps, and if they did not take the river which was the only gap, and make their e≈øcape, there would not be one man left alive before ≈øun down. Some time after this I heard a number of ≈øcalp halloo's and ≈øaw a company of Indians and French coming in. I ob≈øerved they had a great many bloody ≈øcalps, grenadiers' caps, Briti≈øh canteens, bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets &amp;c. with them. They brought the news that Braddock was defeated. After that another company came in which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036317_0008_1008DBAA104C7088"/>
to be about one hundred, and chiefly Indians, and it ≈øeemed to me that almo≈øt every one of this company was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ≈øcalps; after this came another company with a number of waggon-hor≈øes, and al≈øo a great many ≈øcalps. Tho≈øe that were coming in, and tho≈øe that had arrived, kept a con≈øtant fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ≈ømall arms, and al≈øo the great guns in the fort, which were accompanied with the mo≈øt hedious ≈øhouts and yells from all quarters; ≈øo that it appeared to me as if the infernal regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had broke loo≈øe.</p>
            <p>About ≈øun down I beheld a ≈ømall party coming in with about a dozen pri≈øoners, ≈øtripped naked, with their hands tied behind their backs, and their faces, and part of their bodies blacked‚Äî the≈øe pri≈øoners they burned to death on the bank of Alegheny River oppo≈øite to the fort. I ≈øtood on the fort wall until I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them begin to burn one of the≈øe men, they had him tied to a ≈øtake and kept touching him with fire-brands, red-hod irons &amp;c. and he ≈øcreeming in a mo≈øt doleful manner,‚Äîthe Indians
in the mean time yelling like infernal ≈øpirits. As this ≈øcene appeared too ≈øhocking for me to behold, I retired to my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both ≈øore and ≈øorry.</p>
            <p>When I came into my longings I ≈øaw Ru≈ø≈øel's Seven Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which they had brought from the field of battle, which a Frenchman made a pre≈øent of to me. From the be≈øt infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I could receive there were only ≈øeven Indians and four French killed in this battle, and five hundred Briti≈øh lay dead in the field; be≈øides what were killed in the river on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
            <p>The morning after the battle I ≈øaw Braddock's artilery brought into the fort, the ≈øame day I al≈øo ≈øaw ≈øeveral Indians in Briti≈øh-officers' dre≈øs with ≈øa≈øh, half-moon, laced hats &amp;c. which the Briti≈øh then wore.</p>
            <p>A few days after this the Indians demanded me and I was obliged to go with them. I was not yet well able to march, but they took me in a canoe, up the Alegheny River to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian town that was on the north ≈øide of the river, about forty miles above Fort DuQue≈øne. Here I remained about three weeks, and was then taken to an Indian town on the we≈øt branch of Mu≈økingum, about twenty miles above the forks, which was called Tullihas, inhabited by Delawares, Caughne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wagos and Mohicans.‚ÄîOn our rout betwixt the afore≈øaid towns, the country was chiefly black-oak and white-oak land, which appeared generally to be good wheat land, chiefly ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third rate, intermixed with ≈øome rich bottoms.</p>
            <p>The day after my arrival at the afore≈øaid town, a number of Indians collected about me, and one of them began to pull the hair out of my head. He had ≈øome a≈øhes on a piece of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036317_0009_1008DBAB9887B190"/>
bark, in which he frequently dipped his fingers in order to take the firmer hold, and ≈øo he went on, as if he had been plucking a turkey, until he had all the hair clean out of my head, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a ≈ømall ≈øpot about three or four inches ≈øquare on my crown; this they cut off with a pair of ≈øci≈ø≈øors, excepting three locks, which they dre≈ø≈øed up in their own mode. Two of the≈øe they wraped round with a narrow beaded garter made by them≈øelves for that purpo≈øe, and the other they platted at full length, and then ≈øtuck it full of ≈øilver broches. After this they bored my no≈øe and ears, and fixed me off with ear rings and no≈øe jewels, then they ordered me to ≈øtrip off my clothes and put on a breech-clout, which I did; they then painted my head, face and body in various colours. They put a large belt of wampom on my neck, and ≈øilver bands on my hands and right arm; and ≈øo an old chief led me out in the ≈øtreet and gave the alarm halloo, <hi>coo-wigh,</hi> ≈øeveral times repeated quick, and on this all that were in the town came running and ≈øtood round the old chief, who held me by the hand in the mid≈øt.‚Äî As I at that time knew nothing of their mode of adoption, and had ≈øeen them put to death all they had taken, and as I never could find that they ≈øaved a man alive at Braddock's defeat, I made no doubt but they were about putting me to death in ≈øome cruel manner. The old chief holding me by the hand made a long ≈øpeech very loud, and when he had done he handed me to three young ≈øquaws, who led me by the hand down the bank in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the river until the water was up to our middle. The ≈øquaws then made ≈øigns to me to plunge my≈øelf into the water, but I did not under≈øtand them; I thought that the re≈øult of the council was that I ≈øhould be drowned, and that the≈øe young ladies were to be the executioners. They all three laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hold of me, and I for ≈øome time oppo≈øed them with all my might, which occa≈øioned loud laughter by the multitude that were on the bank of the river. At length one of the ≈øquaws made out to ≈øpeak a little Engli≈øh (for I believe they began to be afraid of me) and ≈øaid, <hi>no hurt you</hi>; on this I gave my≈øelf up to their lady≈øhips, who were as good as their word; for though they plunged me under water, and wa≈øhed and rubbed me ≈øeverely, yet I could not ≈øay they hurt me much.</p>
            <p>The≈øe young women then led me up to the council hou≈øe, where ≈øome of the tribe were ready with new cloths for me. They gave me a new ruffled ≈øhirt, which I put on, al≈øo a pair of leggins done off with ribbons and beads, likewi≈øe a pair of mocka≈øons, and garters dre≈ø≈øed with beads, Porcupine-quills, and redhair‚Äîal≈øo a tin≈øel laced cappo. They again painted my head and face with various colors, and tied a bunch of red feathers to one of the≈øe locks they had left on the crown of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036317_0010_1008DBB21E890440"/>
my head, which ≈øtood up five or ≈øix inches. They ≈øeated me on a bear ≈økin, and gave me a pipe, tomakawk, and polecat ≈økin pouch, which had been ≈økined pocket fa≈øhion, and contained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, killegenico, or dry ≈øumach leaves, which they mix with their tobacco,‚Äîal≈øo ≈øpunk, flint and ≈øteel. When I was thus ≈øeated, the Indians came in dre≈ø≈øed and painted in their grande≈øt manner. As they came in they took their ≈øeats and for a con≈øiderable time there was a profound ≈øilence, every one was ≈ømoking,‚Äîbut not a word was ≈øpoken among them.‚ÄîAt length one of the chiefs made a ≈øpeech which was delivered to me by an interpretor,‚Äîand was as followeth:‚Äî"My ≈øon, you are now fle≈øh of our fle≈øh, and bone of our bone. By the ceremony which was performed this day, every drop of white blood was wa≈øhed out of your veins; you are taken into the Caughnewago nation, and initiated into a warlike tribe; you are adopted into a great family, and now received with great ≈øeriousne≈øs and ≈øolemnity in the room and place of a great man; after what has pa≈ø≈øed this day, you are now one of us by an old ≈øtrong law and cu≈øtom‚ÄîMy ≈øon, you have now nothing to fear, we are now under the ≈øame obligations to love, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and defend you, that we are to love and defend one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, therefore you are to con≈øider your≈øelf as one of our people."‚ÄîAt this time I did not believe this fine ≈øpeech, e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that of the white blood being wa≈øhed out of me; but ≈øince that time I have found that there was much ≈øincerity in ≈øaid ≈øpeech,‚Äîfor from that day I never knew them to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny di≈øtinction between me and them≈øelves in any re≈øpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever until I left them.‚ÄîIf they had plenty of cloathing I had plenty, if we were ≈øcarce we all ≈øhared one fate.</p>
            <p>After this ceremony was over, I was introduced to my new kin, and told that I was to attend a fea≈øt that evening, which I did. And as the cu≈øtom was, they gave me al≈øo a bowl and wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ≈øpoon, which I carried with me to the place, where there was a number of large bra≈øs kettles full of boiled veni≈øon and green corn; every one advanced with his bowl and ≈øpoon and had his ≈øhare given him.‚ÄîAfter this one of the chiefs made a ≈øhort ≈øpeech, and then we began to eat.</p>
            <p>The name of one of the chiefs in this town was Tecanyater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ighto, alias Pluggy, and the other A≈øallecoa, alias Mohawk Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.‚ÄîAs Pluggy and his party were to ≈øtart the next day to war, to the frontiers of Virginia, the next thing to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med was the war dance, and their war ≈øongs. At their war dance they had both vocal and in≈øtrumental mu≈øic. They had a ≈øhort hollow gum clo≈øe in one end, with water in it, and parchment ≈øtretched over the open end thereof, which they beat with one ≈øtick, and made a ≈øound nearly like a muffled
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036317_0011_1008DBB3DB9F1738"/>
drum.‚Äîall tho≈øe who were going on this expedition collected together and formed. An old Indian then began to ≈øing, and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the mu≈øic by beating on this drum, as the ancients formerly timed their mu≈øic by beating the tabor. On this the warriors began to advance, or move, forward in concert, like well di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined troops would march to the fife and drum. Each warrior had a tomahawk, ≈øpear or war-mallet in his hand, and they all moved regularly towards the ea≈øt, or the way they intended to go to war. At length they all ≈øtretched their tomahawks tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the Potomack, and giving a hideous ≈øhout or yell, they wheeled quick about, and danced in the ≈øame manner back. The next was the war ≈øong. In performing this, only one ≈øung at a time, in a moving po≈øture, with a tomahawk in his hand, while all the other wariors were engaged in calling aloud <hi>he-uh, he-uh,</hi> which they con≈øtantly repeated, while the war ≈øong was going on. When the warior that was ≈øinging had ended his ≈øong, he ≈øtruck a war po≈øt with his tomahawk, and with a loud voice told what warlike exploits he had done, and what he now inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do: which were an≈øwered by the other wariors, with loud ≈øhouts of applau≈øe. Some who had not before intended to go to war, at this time were ≈øo animated by this performance, that they took up the tomahawk and ≈øung the war ≈øong, which was an≈øwered with ≈øhouts of joy, as they were then initiated into the pre≈øent marching company. The next morning this company all collected at one place, with their heads and faces painted with various colors, and packs upon their backs: they marched off, all ≈øilent, except the commander, who, in the front ≈øung the travelling ≈øong, which began in this manner: <hi>hoo caughtainte beegana.</hi> Ju≈øt as the rear pa≈ø≈øed the end of the town, they began to fire in their ≈ølow manner, from the front to the rear, which was accompanied with ≈øhouts and yells from all quarters.</p>
            <p>This evening I was invited to another ≈øort of dance, which was a kind of promi≈øcuos dance. The young men ≈øtood in one rank, and the young women in another, about one rod apart, facing each other. The one that rai≈øed the tune, or ≈øtarted the ≈øong, held a ≈ømall gourd or dry ≈øhell of a ≈øqua≈øh, in his hand, which contained beads or ≈ømall ≈øtones, which rattled. When he began to ≈øing, he timed the tune with his rattle; both men and women danced and ≈øung together, advancing towards each other, ≈øtooping until their heads would be touching together, and then cea≈øed from dancing, with loud ≈øhouts, and retreated and formed again, and ≈øo repeated the ≈øame thing over and over, for three or four hours, without intermi≈ø≈øion. This exerci≈øe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to one at fir≈øt, irrational and in≈øipid; but I found that in ≈øinging their tunes, they u≈øed <hi>ya ne no hoo wa ne, &amp;c.</hi> like our <hi>fa
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036317_0012_1008DBB5CFDEAEE0"/>
sol la,</hi> and though they have no ≈øuch thing as jingling ver≈øe, yet they can intermix ≈øentences with their notes, and ≈øay what they plea≈øe to each other, and carry on the tune in concert. I found that this was a kind of wooing or courting dance, and as they advanced ≈øtooping with their heads together, they could ≈øay what they plea≈øed in each others ear, without di≈øconcerting their rough mu≈øic, and the others, or tho≈øe near, not hear what they ≈øay.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this I went out to hunt, in company with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk Solomon, ≈øome of the Caughnewagas and a Delaware In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian that was married to a Caughnewaga ≈øquaw. We travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about ≈øouth, from this town, and the fir≈øt night we killed nothing, but we had with us green corn, which we roa≈øted and ate that night. The next day we encamped about twelve o'clock, and the hunters turned out to hunt, and I went down the run that we encamped on, in company with ≈øome ≈øquaws and boys, to hunt plumbs, which we found in great plenty. On my return to camp I ob≈øerved a large piece of fat meat: the Delaware Indian that could talk ≈øome Engli≈øh, ob≈øerved me looking earne≈øtly at this meat, and a≈øked me <hi>what meat you think that is?</hi> I ≈øaid I ≈øuppo≈øed it was bear meat; he laughed and ≈øaid, <hi>ho, all one fool you, beal now elly pool,</hi> and pointing to the other ≈øide of the camp, he ≈øaid <hi>look at that skin, you think that beal skin?</hi> I went and lifted the ≈økin, which appeared like an ox hide: he then ≈øaid, <hi>what skin you think that?</hi> I replied that I thought it was a buffaloe hide; he laughed and ≈øaid <hi>you fool again, you know nothing, you think buffaloe that colo?</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged I did not know much about the≈øe things, and told him I never ≈øaw a buffaloe, and that I had not heard what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor they were. He replyed <hi>by and by you shall see glent many buffaloe: He now go to gleat lick. That skin no buffaloe skin, that skin buck-elk skin.</hi> They went out with hor≈øes, and brought in the remainder of this buck-elk, which was the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt creature I ever ≈øaw of the tallow kind.</p>
            <p>We remained at this camp about eight or ten days, and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a number of deer. Though we had neither bread or ≈øalt at this time, yet we had both roa≈øt and boiled meat in great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they were frequently inviting me to eat, when I had no appetite.</p>
            <p>We then moved to the buffaloe lick, where we killed ≈øeveral buffaloe, and in their ≈ømall bra≈øs kettles they made about half a bu≈øhel of ≈øalt. I ≈øuppo≈øe this lick was about thirty or forty miles from the afore≈øaid town, and ≈øomewhere between the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, Ohio and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. About the lick was clear, open <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, and thin white-oak land, and at that time there were
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036317_0013_1008DBB7D3E65088"/>
large roads leading to the lick, like waggon roads. We moved from this lick about ≈øix or ≈øeven miles, and encamped on a creek.</p>
            <p>Though the Indians had given me a gun, I had not yet been admitted to go out from the camp to hunt. At this place Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk Solomon a≈øked me to go out with him to hunt, which I readily agreed to. After ≈øome time we came upon ≈øome fre≈øh buffaloe tracks. I had ob≈øerved before this that the Indians were upon their guard, and afraid of an enemy; for, until now they and the ≈øouthern nations had been at war. As we were following the buffaloe tracks, Solomon ≈øeemed to be upon his guard, went very ≈ølow, and would frequently ≈øtand and li≈øten, and appeared to be in ≈øu≈øpen≈øe. We came to where the tracks were very plain in the ≈øand, and I ≈øaid it is ≈øurely buffaloe tracks; he ≈øaid <hi>hush, you know nothing, may be buffaloe tracks, may be Catawba.</hi> He went very cautious until we found ≈øome fre≈øh buffaloe dung: he then ≈ømiled and ≈øaid <hi>Catawba can not make so.</hi> He then ≈øtopped and told me an odd ≈øtory about the Catawbas. He ≈øaid that formerly the Catawbas came near one of their hunting camps, and at ≈øome di≈øtance from the camp lay in ambu≈øh, and in order to decoy them out, ≈øent two or three Catawbas in the night, pa≈øt their camp, with buffaloe hoofs fixed on their feet, ≈øo as to make artificial tracks. In the morning tho≈øe in the camp followed after the≈øe tracks, thinking they were Buffaloe, until they were fired on by the Catawbas, and ≈øeveral of them killed; the others fled, collected a party and pur≈øed the Catawbas; but they, in their ≈øubtilty brought with them rattle-≈ønake poi≈øon, which they had collected from the bladder that lieth at the root of the ≈ønakes' teeth; this they had corked up in a ≈øhort piece of a cane-≈øtalk; they had al≈øo brought with them ≈ømall cane or reed, about the ≈øize of a rye ≈øtraw, which they made ≈øharp at the end like a pen, and dipped them in this poi≈øon, and ≈øtuck them in the ground among the gra≈øs, along their own tracks, in ≈øuch a po≈øition that they might ≈øtick into the legs of the pur≈øuers, which an≈øwered the de≈øign; and as the Catawbas had runners behind to watch the motion of the pur≈øuers, when they found that a number of them were lame, being artificially ≈ønake bit, and that they were all turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, the Catawbas turned upon the pur≈øuers, and defeated them, and killed and ≈øcalped all tho≈øe that were lame.‚ÄîWhen Solomon had fini≈øhed this ≈øtory, and found that I under≈øtood him, concluded by ≈øaying, <hi>you don't know, Catawba velly bad Indian, Catawba all one Devil Catawba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some time after this, I was told to take the dogs with me and go down the creek, perhaps I might kill a turkey; it being in the afternoon, I was al≈øo told not to go far from the creek,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036317_0014_1008DBBECE9E2448"/>
and to come up the creek again to the camp, and to take care not to get lo≈øt. When I had gone ≈øome di≈øtance down the creek, I came upon fre≈øh buffaloe tracks, and as I had a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of dogs with me to ≈øtop the buffaloe, I concluded I would follow after and kill one; and as the gra≈øs and weeds were rank<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> I could readily follow the track. A little before ≈øundown, I de≈øpaired of coming up with them: I was then thinking how I might get to camp before night: I concluded as the buffaloe had made ≈øeveral turns, if I took the track back to the creek, it would be dark before I could get to camp; therefore I thought I would take a near way through the hills, and ≈øtrike the creek a little below the camp; but as it was cloudy weather, and I a very young wood≈øman, I could find neither creek or camp. When night came on I fired my gun ≈øeveral times, and hallooed, but could have no an≈øwer. The next morning early, the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were out after me, and as I had with me ten or a dozen dogs, and the gra≈øs and weeds rank, they could readily follow my track. When they came up with me, they appeared to be in a very good humor. I a≈øked Solomon if he thought I was running away, he ≈øaid <hi>no no, you go too much clooked.</hi> On my return to camp they took my gun from me, and for this ra≈øh ≈øtep I was reduced to a bow and arrows, for near two years. We were out on this tour about ≈øix weeks.</p>
            <p>This country is generally hilly, though intermixed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable quantities of rich upland, and ≈øome good bottoms.</p>
            <p>When we returned to the town, Pluggy and his party had arrived, and brought with them a con≈øiderable number of ≈øcalps and pri≈øoners from the South Branch of Potomack: they al≈øo brought with them an Engli≈øh Bible, which they gave to a Dutch woman who was a pri≈øoner; but as ≈øhe could not read Engli≈øh, ≈øhe made a pre≈øent of it to me, which was very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
            <p>I remained in this town until ≈øome time in October, when my adopted brother, called Tontileaugo, who had married a Wian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dot ≈øquaw, took me with him to Lake Erie. We proceeded up the we≈øt branch of Mu≈økingum, and for ≈øome di≈øtance up the river the land was hilly but intermixed with large bodies of tolerable rich upland, and excellent bottoms. We proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, to the head waters of the we≈øt branch of Mu≈økingum. On the head waters of this branch, and from thence to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Cane≈øadooharie, there is a large body of rich, well lying land‚Äîthe timber is a≈øh, walnut, ≈øugar-tree, buckeye, honey-locu≈øt and cherry, intermixed with ≈øome oak, hickory, &amp;c.‚Äî This tour was at the time that the black-haws were ripe, and we were ≈øeldom out of ≈øight of them: they were common here both in the bottoms and upland.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:036317_0015_1008DBC2A90E9EC0"/>On this route we had no hor≈øes with us, and when we ≈øtarted from the town, all the pack I carried was a pouch, containing my books, a little dried veni≈øon, and my blanket. I had then no gun, but Tontileaugo who was a fir≈øt rate hunter, carried a rifle gun, and every day killed deer, racoons or bears. We left the meat, excepting a little for pre≈øent u≈øe, and carried the ≈økins with us until we encamped, and then ≈øtretched them with elm bark, in a frame made with poles ≈øtuck in the ground and tied together with lynn or elm bark; and when the ≈økins were dried by the fire, we packed them up, and carried them with us the next day.</p>
            <p>As Tontileaugo could not ≈øpeak Engli≈øh, I had to make u≈øe of all the Caughnewaga I had learned even to talk very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly with him; but I found I learned to talk Indian fa≈øter this way, than when I had tho≈øe with me who could ≈øpeak Engli≈øh.</p>
            <p>As we proceeded down the Cane≈øadooharie waters, our packs encrea≈øed by the ≈økins that were daily killed, and became ≈øo very heavy that we could not march more than eight or ten miles per day. We came to Lake Erie about ≈øix miles we≈øt of the mouth of Cane≈øadooharie. As the wind was very high the evening we came to the Lake, I was ≈øurprized to hear the roaring of the water, and ≈øee the high waves that da≈øhed again≈øt the ≈øhore, like the Ocean. We encamped on a run near the lake; and as the wind fell that night, the next morning the lake was only in a moderate motion, and we marched on the ≈øand along the ≈øide of the water, frequently re≈øting our≈øelves, as we were heavy laden. I ≈øaw on the ≈øtrand, a number of large fi≈øh, that had been left in flat or hollow places; as the wind fell and the waves abated, they were left without water, or only a ≈ømall quantity; and numbers of Bald and Grey Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, &amp;c. were along the ≈øhore devouring them.</p>
            <p>Some time in the afternoon we came to a large camp of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andots, at the mouth of Cane≈øadooharie, where Tontileaugo's wife was. Here we were kindly received: they gave us a kind of rough, brown potatoes, which grew ≈øpontaneou≈øly and is called by the Caughnewagas <hi>obnenata.</hi> The≈øe potatoes peeled and dipped in racoons' fat, ta≈øte nearly like our ≈øweet-potatoes. They al≈øo gave us what they call <hi>canebeanta,</hi> which is a kind of homony, made of green corn, dried, and beans mixed together.</p>
            <p>From the head waters of Cane≈øadooharie to this place, the land is generally good; chiefly fir≈øt or ≈øecond rate, and, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, little or no third rate. The only refu≈øe is ≈øome ≈øwamps, that appear to be too wet for u≈øe, yet I apprehend that a number of them, if drained, would make excellent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. The timber is black-oak, walnut, hickory, cherry, black-a≈øh,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036317_0016_1008DBC472F5DA48"/>
white-a≈øh, water-a≈øh, buckeye, black-locu≈øt, honey-locu≈øt, ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-tree and elm: there is al≈øo ≈øome land, though, comparatively, but ≈ømall, where the timber is chiefly white-oak or beach‚Äîthis may be called third rate. In the bottoms, and al≈øo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the upland, there is a large quantity of wild apple, plumb, and red and black-haw trees. It appeared to be well watered, and a plenty of meadow ground, intermixed with upland, but no large prairies or glades, that I ≈øaw, or heard of. In this route, deer, bear, turkeys and racoons, appeared plenty, but no buffaloe, and very little ≈øign of elks.</p>
            <p>We continued our camp at the mouth of Cane≈øadooharie for ≈øome time, where we killed ≈øome deer, and a great many racoons; the racoons here were remarkably large and fat.‚Äî At length we all embarked in a large birch bark canoe. This ve≈ø≈øel was about four feet wide, and three feet deep, and about five and thirty feet long: and tho it could carry a heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, it was ≈øo artfully and curiou≈øly con≈øtructed that four men could cary it ≈øeveral miles, or from one landing place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or from the waters of the Lake to the waters of the Ohio. ‚ÄîWe proceeded up Cane≈øadooharie a few miles and went on ≈øhore to hunt; but to my great ≈øurpri≈øe they carried the ve≈ø≈øel that we all came in up the bank, and inverted it or turned the bottom up, and converted it to a dwelling hou≈øe, and kindled a fire before us to warm our≈øeves by and cook. With our bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and our≈øelves in this hou≈øe we were very much crouded, yet our little hou≈øe turned off the rain very well.</p>
            <p>We kept moving and hunting up this river until we came to the falls; here we remained ≈øome weeks, and killed a number of deer, ≈øeveral bears, and a great many racoons. From the mouth of this river to the falls is about five and twenty miles. On our pa≈ø≈øage up I was not much out from the river, but what I ≈øaw was good land, and not hilly.</p>
            <p>About the falls is thin che≈ønut land, which is almo≈øt the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly che≈ønut timber I ever ≈øaw in this country.</p>
            <p>While we remained here, I left my pouch with my books in camp, wrapt up in my blanket, and went out to hunt che≈ønuts. On my return to camp my books were mi≈ø≈øing. I enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, and a≈øked the Indians if they knew where they were, they told me that they ≈øuppo≈øed the puppies had carried them off. I did not believe them; but thought they were di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øed at my poring over my books, and concluded that they had de≈øtroyed them, or put them out of my way.</p>
            <p>After this I was again out after nuts, and on my return be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a new erection, which were two white oak ≈øaplings, that were forked about twelve feet high, and ≈øtood about fifteen feet apart. They had cut the≈øe ≈øaplings at the forks and laid a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036317_0017_1008DBC5FB0F4340"/>
≈øtrong pole acro≈øs which appeared in the form of a gallows, and the po≈øts they had ≈øhaved very ≈ømooth and painted in places with vermillion. I could not conceive the u≈øe of this piece of work, and at length concluded it was a gallows, I thought that I had di≈øplea≈øed them by reading my books, and that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout puting me to death.‚ÄîThe next morning I ob≈øerved them bringing their ≈økins all to this place and hanging them over this pole, ≈øo as to pre≈øerve them from being injured by the weather, this removed my fears. They al≈øo buried their large canoe in the ground, which is the way they took to pra≈øerve this ≈øort of a canoe in the winter ≈øea≈øon.</p>
            <p>As we had at this time no hor≈øes, every one got a pack on his back, and we ≈øteered an ea≈øt cour≈øe about twelve miles, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped. The next morning we proceeded on the ≈øame cour≈øe about ten miles to a large creek that empties into Lake Erie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Cane≈øadooharie, and Cayahaga. Here they made their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercabbin, in the following form. They cut logs about fifteen feet long, and laid the≈øe longs upon each other, and drove po≈øts in the ground at each end to keep them together; the po≈øts they tied together at the top with bark, and by this means rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed a wall fifteen feet long, and about four feet high, and in the ≈øame manner they rai≈øed another wall oppo≈øite to this, at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve feet di≈øtance; then they drove forks in the ground in the centre of each end, and laid a ≈øtrong pole from end to end on the≈øe forks; and from the≈øe walls to the poles, they ≈øet up poles in≈øtead of rafters, and on the≈øe they tied ≈ømall poles in place of laths; and a cover was made of lynn bark which will run even in the winter ≈øea≈øon.</p>
            <p>As every tree will not run, they examine the tree fir≈øt, by trying it near the ground, and when they find it will do, they fall the tree and rai≈øe the bark with the tomahawk, near the top of the tree about five or ≈øix inches broad, then put the tomahawk handle under this bark, and pull it along down to the butt of the tree; ≈øo that ≈øome times one piece of bark will he thirty feet long; this bark they cut at ≈øuitable lengths in order to cover the hut.</p>
            <p>At the end of the≈øe walls they ≈øet up ≈øplit timber, ≈øo that they had timber all round, excepting a door at each end. At the top, in place of a chimney, they left an open place, and for bedding they laid down the afore≈øaid kind of bark, on which they ≈øpread bear ≈økins. From end to end of this hut along the middle there were fires, which the ≈øquaws made of dry ≈øplit wood and the holes or open places that appeared, the ≈øquaws ≈øtopped with mo≈øs, which they collected from old logs; and at the door they hung a bear ≈økin; and notwith≈øtanding the winters an hard here, our lodging was much better than what I expected<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:036317_0018_1008DBCCB65587D8"/>It was ≈øome time in December when we fini≈øhed this winter cabin; but when we had got into this comparatively fine lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, another difficulty aro≈øe, we had nothing to eat. While I was travelling with Tontileaugo, as was before mentioned, and had plenty of fat veni≈øon, bears meat and racoons, I then thought it was hard living without bread or Salt; but now I began to conclude, that if I had any thing that would bani≈øh pinching hunger, and keep ≈øoul and body together I would be content.</p>
            <p>While the hunters were all out, exerting them≈øelves to the utmo≈øt of their ability, the ≈øquaws and boys (in which cla≈øs I was) were ≈øcattered out in the bottoms, hunting red-haws, black-haws and hickory-nuts. As it was too late in the year, we did not ≈øucceed in gathering haws; but we had tolerable ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs in ≈øcratching up hickory-nuts from under a light ≈ønow, which we carried with us le≈øt the hunters ≈øhould not ≈øucceed. After our return the hunters came in, who had killed only two ≈ømall turkeys, which were but little among eight hunters, and thirteen ≈øquaws, boys, and children;‚Äîbut they were divided with the greate≈øt equity and ju≈øtice‚Äîevery one got their equal ≈øhare.</p>
            <p>The next day the hunters turned out again, and killed one deer and three bears.</p>
            <p>One of the bears was very large and remarkably fat. The hunters carried in meat ≈øufficient to give us all a hearty ≈øupper and breakfa≈øt.</p>
            <p>The ≈øquaws and all that could carry turned out to bring in meat,‚Äîevery one had their ≈øhare a≈ø≈øigned them, and my load was among the lea≈øt; yet, not being accu≈øtomed to carrying in this way, I got exceeding weary, and told them my load was too heavy, I mu≈øt leave part of it and come for it again. They made a halt and only laughed at me, and took part of my load and added it to a young ≈øquaw's, who had as much before as I carried.</p>
            <p>This kind of repoof had a greater tendency to excite me to exert my≈øelf in carrying without complaining, than if they had whipped me for lazine≈øs. After this the hunters held a council, and concluded that they mu≈øt have hor≈øes to carry their loads; and that they would go to war even in this inclement ≈øea≈øon, in order to bring in hor≈øes.</p>
            <p>Tontileaugo wi≈øhed to be one of tho≈øe who ≈øhould go to war; but the votes went again≈øt him, as he was one of our be≈øt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; it was thought nece≈ø≈øary to leave him at this winter camp to provide for the ≈øquaws and children; it was agreed upon that Tontileaugo and three others ≈øhould ≈øtay, and hunt, and the other four go to war.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:036317_0019_100895C35F216410"/>They then began to go through their common ceremony. They ≈øung their war ≈øongs danced their war dances &amp;c. And when they were equipped they went off ≈øinging their marching ≈øong, and firing their guns. Our camp appeared to be rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but I was grieved to think that ≈øome innocent per≈øons would be murdered not thinking of danger.</p>
            <p>After the departure of the≈øe warriors we had hard times; and tho we were not altogether out of provi≈øions, we were brought to ≈øhort allowance. At length Tontileaugo had con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ≈øucce≈øs; and we had meat brought into camp ≈øufficient to la≈øt ten days. Tontileaugo then took me with him in order to encamp ≈øome di≈øtance from this winter cabbin, to try his luck there. We carried no provi≈øion with us, he ≈øaid we would leave what was there for the ≈øquaws and children, and that we could ≈øhift for our≈øelves. We ≈øteered about a fouth cour≈øe up the waters of this creek, and encamped about ten or twelve miles from the winter cabbin. As it was ≈øtill cold weather and a cru≈øt upon the ≈ønow, which made a noi≈øe as we walked and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed the deer, we could kill nothing, and con≈øequently went to ≈øleep without ≈øupper. The only chance we had under the≈øe circum≈øtances, was to hunt bear holes; as the bears about Chri≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas ≈øearch out a winter lodging place, where they lie about three or four months without eating or drinking.‚ÄîThis may appear to ≈øome incredible; but it is now well known to be the ca≈øe, by tho≈øe who live in the remote we≈øtern parts of North America.</p>
            <p>The next morning early we proceeded on, and when we found a tree ≈øcratched by the bears climbing up, and the hole in the tree ≈øufficiently large for the reception of the bear, we then fell a ≈øapling or ≈ømall tree, again≈øt or near the hole; and it was my bu≈øine≈øs to climb up and drive out the bear, while Tontileau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ≈øtood ready with his gun and bow. We went on in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner until evening, without ≈øucce≈øs; at length we found a large elm ≈øcratched, and a hole in it about forty feet up; but no tree nigh ≈øuitable to lodge again≈øt the hole. Tontileaugo got a long pole and ≈øome dry rotten wood which he tied in bunches, with bark, and as there was a tree that grew near the elm, and extended up near the hole; but leaned the wrong way; ≈øo that we could not lodge it to advantage; but to remedy this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, he climed up this tree and carried with him his rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wood, fire and pole. The rotten wood he tied to his belt, and to one end of the pole he tied a hook, and a piece of rotten wood which he ≈øet fire to, as it would retain fire almo≈øt like ≈øpunk; and reached this hook from limb to limb as he went up; when he got up, with this pole he put dry wood on fire into the hole<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> after he put in the fire he heard the bear ≈ønuff and he came ≈øpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036317_0020_1008DBD17B02B850"/>
down, took his gun in his hand and waited until the bear would come out; but it was ≈øome time before it appeared, and when it did appear, he attempted taking ≈øight with his rifle; but it being then too dark, to ≈øee the ≈øights, he ≈øet it down by a tree, and in≈øtantly bent his bow, took hold of an arrow, and ≈øhot the bear a little behind the ≈øhoulder; I was preparing al≈øo to ≈øhoot an arrow, but he called to me to ≈øtop, there was no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion; and with that the bear fell to the ground.</p>
            <p>Being very hungry we kindled a fire, opened the bear, took out the liver, and wrapped ≈øome of the caul fat round and put it on a wooden ≈øpit which we ≈øtuck in the ground by the fire to roa≈øt, we then ≈økinned the bear, got on our kettle, and had both roa≈øt and boiled, and al≈øo ≈øauce to our meat, which appeared to me to be delicate fare. After I was fully ≈øatisfied I went to ≈øleep, Tontileaugo awoke me, ≈øaying, come eat hearty, we have got meat plenty now.</p>
            <p>The next morning we cut down a lynn tree, peeled bark and made a ≈ønug little ≈øhelter, facing the ≈øouth ea≈øt, with a large log betwixt us and the north we≈øt; we made a good fire before us, and ≈øcaffolded up our meat at one ≈øide.‚ÄîWhen we had fini≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our camp we went out to hunt, ≈øearched two trees for bears, but to no purpo≈øe. As the ≈ønow thawed a little in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Tontileaugo killed a deer, which we carried with us to camp.</p>
            <p>The next day we turned out to hunt, and near the camp we found a tree well ≈øcratched; but the hole was above forty feet high, and no tree that we could lodge again≈øt the hole; but finding that it was very hollow, we concluded that we would cut down the tree with our tomahawks, which kept us working a con≈øiderable part of the day. When the tree fell we ran up, Tontileaugo with his gun and bow, and I with my bow ready bent. Tontileaugo ≈øhot the bear through with his rifle, a little behind the ≈øhoulders, I al≈øo ≈øhot, but too far back; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then much accum≈øtomed to the bu≈øine≈øs, my arrow penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only a few inches thro the ≈økin. Having killed an old ≈øhe bear and three cubs, we hawled her on the ≈ønow to the camp, and only had time afterwards, to get wood, make a fire, cook &amp;c. before dark.</p>
            <p>Early the next morning we went to bu≈øine≈øs, ≈øearched ≈øeveral trees, but found no bears. On our way home we took three ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons out of a hollow elm, not far from the ground.</p>
            <p>We remained here about two weeks, and in this time killed four bears, three deer, ≈øeveral turkeys, and a number of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons. We packed up as much meat as we could carry, and returned to our winter cabin. On our arrival, there was great
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036317_0021_1008DBD9B7239DA8"/>
joy, as they were all in a ≈øtarving condition,‚Äîthe three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that we had left having killed but very little.‚ÄîAll that could carry a pack repaired to our camp to bring in meat.</p>
            <p>Some time in February the four warriors returned, who had taken two ≈øcalps, and ≈øix hor≈øes from the frontiers, of Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania. The hunters could then ≈øcatter out a con≈øiderable di≈øtance from the winter cabin, and encamp, kill meat and pack it in upon hor≈øes; ≈øo that we commonly after this had plenty of provi≈øion.</p>
            <p>In this month we began to make ≈øugar. As ≈øome of the elm bark will ≈øtrip at this ≈øea≈øon, the ≈øquaws after finding a tree that would do, cut it down, and with a crooked ≈øtick broad and ≈øharp at the end, took the bark off the tree, and of this bark, made ve≈ø≈øels in a curious manner, that would hold about two gallons each: they made above one hundred of the≈øe kind of ve≈ø≈øels. In the ≈øugar-tree they cut a notch, ≈ølooping down, and at the end of the notch, ≈øtuck in a tomahawk; in the place where they ≈øtuck the tomahawk, they drove along chip, in order to carry the water out from the tree, and under this they ≈øet their ve≈ø≈øel, to receive it. As ≈øugar trees were plenty and large here, they ≈øeldom or never notched a tree that was not two or three feet over. They al≈øo made bark ve≈ø≈øels for carrying the water, that would hold about four gallons each. They had two bra≈øs kettles, that held about fifteen gallons each, and other ≈ømaller kettles in which they boiled the water. But as they could not at all times boil away the water as fa≈øt as it was collected, they made ve≈ø≈øels of bark, that would hold about one hundred gallons each, for retaining the water; and tho' the ≈øugar trees did not run every day, they had always a ≈øufficient quantity of water to keep them boiling during the whole ≈øugar ≈øea≈øon.</p>
            <p>The way that we commonly u≈øed our ≈øugar while encamped, was by putting it in bears fat until the fat was almo≈øt as ≈øweet as the ≈øugar it≈øelf, and in this we dipped <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> roa≈øted veni≈øon. About this time ≈øome of the Indian lads and my≈øelf, were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making and attending traps for catching racoons, foxes, wild cats, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As the racoon is a kind of water animal, that frequents the runs, or ≈ømall water-cour≈øes, almo≈øt the whole night, we made our traps on the runs, by laying one ≈ømall ≈øapling on another, and driving in po≈øts to keep them from rolling. The upper ≈øapling we rai≈øed about eighteen inches, and ≈øet ≈øo, that on the racoons touching a ≈øtring, or ≈ømall piece of bark, the ≈øapling would fall and kill it; and left the racoon ≈øhould pa≈øs by, we laid bru≈øh on both ≈øides of the run, only leaving the channel o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
            <p>The fox traps we made nearly in the ≈øame manner, at the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036317_0022_1008DBDB41E38158"/>
end of a hollow log, or oppo≈øite to a hole at the root of a hollow tree, and put veni≈øon on a ≈øtick for bait: we had it ≈øo ≈øet that when the fox took hold of the meat, the trap fell. While the ≈øquaws were employed in making ≈øugar, the boys and men were engaged in hunting and trapping.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of March we began to prepare for mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into town, in order to plant corn: the ≈øquaws were then fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the la≈øt of their bears fat, and making ve≈ø≈øels to hold it. the ve≈ø≈øels were made of deer ≈økins, which were ≈økinned by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ≈økin off the neck, without ripping. After they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the hair, they gathered it in ≈ømall plaits round the neck and with a ≈øtring drew it together like a pur≈øe: in the centre a pin was put, below which they tied a ≈øtring, and while it was wet they blew it up like a bladder, and let it remain in this manner, until it was dry, when it appeared nearly in the ≈øhape of a ≈øugar loaf, but more rounding at the lower end. One of the≈øe ve≈ø≈øels would hold about four or five gallons; in the≈øe ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels it was they carried their bears oil.</p>
            <p>When all things were ready we moved back to the falls of Cane≈øadooharie. In this route the land is chiefly fir≈øt and ≈øecond rate, but too much meadow ground, in proportion to the up land. The timber is white a≈øh, elm, black-oak, cherry, buckeye, ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-tree, lynn, mulberry, beech, white-oak, hickory, wild ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-tree, red-haw, black-haw, and ≈øpicewood bu≈øhes. There is in ≈øome places, ≈øpots of beech timber, which ≈øpots may be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed third rate land. Buckeye, ≈øugar-tree and ≈øpicewood, are common in the woods here. There is in ≈øome places, large ≈øwamps too wet for any u≈øe.</p>
            <p>On our arrival at the falls, (as we had brought with us on hor≈øe back, about two hundred weight of ≈øugar, a large quantity of bears oil, ≈økins &amp;c.) the canoe we had buried was not ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to carry all; therefore we were obliged to make another one of elm bark. While we lay here a young Wiandot found my books: on this they collected together; I was a little way from the camp, and ≈øaw the collection, but did not know what it meant. They called me by my Indian name, which was Scoouwa, repeatedly. I ran to ≈øee what was the matter, they ≈øhewed me my books, and ≈øaid they were glad they had been found, for they knew I was grieved at the lo≈øs of them, and that they now rejoiced with me becau≈øe they were found. As I could then ≈øpeak ≈øome Indian, e≈øpecially Caughnewaga (for both that and the Wiandot tongue were ≈øpoken in this camp) I told them that I thanked them for the kindne≈øs they had always ≈øhewn to me, and al≈øo for finding my books. They a≈øked if the books were damaged? I told them not much. They then ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how they lay, which was in the be≈øt manner to turn off the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036317_0023_1008DBDCCA3CC5F8"/>
water. In a deer ≈økin pouch they lay all winter. The print was not much injured, though the binding was.‚ÄîThis was the fir≈øt time that I felt my heart warm towards the Indians. Though they had been exceeding kind to me, I ≈øtill before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øted them, on account of the barbarity I beheld after Braddock's defeat. Neither had I ever before pretended kindne≈øs, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed my≈øelf in a friendly manner; but I began now to excu≈øe the Indians on account of their want of information.</p>
            <p>When we were ready to embark, Tontileaugo would not go to town, but go up the river and take a hunt. He a≈øked me if I choo≈øed to go with him? I told him I did. We then got ≈øome ≈øugar, bears oil bottled up in a bear's gut, and ≈øome dry veni≈øon, which we packed up, and went up Cane≈øadooharie, about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles, and encamped. At this time I did not know either the day of the week, or the month; but I ≈øuppo≈øed it to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the fir≈øt of April. We had con≈øiderable ≈øucce≈øs in our bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. We al≈øo found ≈øome ≈øtray hor≈øes, or a hor≈øe, mare, and a young colt; and though they had run in the woods all winter, they were in exceeding good order. There is plenty of gra≈øs here all winter, under the ≈ønow, and hor≈øes accu≈øtomed to the woods can work it out.‚ÄîThe≈øe hor≈øes had run in the woods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they were very wild.</p>
            <p>Tontileaugo one night concluded that we mu≈øt run them down. I told him I thought we could not accompli≈øh it. He ≈øaid he had run down bears, buffaloes and elks: and in the great plains, with only a ≈ømall ≈ønow on the ground, he had run down a deer; and he thought that in one whole day, he could tire, or run down any four footed animal except a wolf. I told him that though a deer was the ≈øwifte≈øt animal to run a ≈øhort di≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet it would tire ≈øooner than a hor≈øe. He ≈øaid he would at all events try the experiment. He had heard the Wiandots ≈øay, that I could run well, and now he would ≈øee whether I could or not. I told him that I never had run all day, and of cour≈øe was not accu≈øtomed to that way of running. I never had run with the Wiandots, more than ≈øeven or eight miles at one time. He ≈øaid that was nothing, we mu≈øt either catch the≈øe hor≈øes, or run all day.</p>
            <p>In the morning early we left camp, and about ≈øunri≈øe we ≈øtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after them, ≈øtriped naked excepting breech-clouts and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øons. About ten o'clock I lo≈øt ≈øight of both Tontileaugo and the hor≈øes, and did not ≈øee them again until about three o'clock in the afternoon. As the hor≈øes run all day, in about three or four miles ≈øquare, at length they pa≈ø≈øed where I was, and I fell in clo≈øe after them. As I then had a long re≈øt, I endeavored to keep a head of Tontileaugo, and after ≈øome time I could hear him after me calling <hi>chakoh, chakoanaugh,</hi> which ≈øignifies, pull
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036317_0024_1008DBDFCB027370"/>
away or do your be≈øt. We pur≈øued on, and after ≈øome time Tontileaugo pa≈ø≈øed me, and about an hour before ≈øundown, we de≈øpaired of catching the≈øe hor≈øes and returned to camp where we had left our clothes.</p>
            <p>I reminded Tontileaugo of what I had told him; he replied he did not know what hor≈øes could do. They are wonderful ≈øtrong to run; but withal we made them very tired. Tontileaugo then concluded, he would do as the Indians did with wild hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, when out at war: which is to ≈øhoot them through the neck under the mane, and above the bone, which will cau≈øe them to fall and lie until they can halter them, and then they recover again. This he attemped to do; but as the mare was very wild, he could not get ≈øufficiently nigh to ≈øhoot her in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place; however he ≈øhot, the ball pa≈ø≈øed too low, and killed her. As the hor≈øe and colt ≈øtayed at this place we caught the hor≈øe, and took him and the colt with us to camp.</p>
            <p>We ≈øtayed at this camp about two weeks, and killed a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of bears, racoons, and ≈øome beavers. We made a canoe of elm bark, and Tontileaugo embarked in it. He arrived at the falls that night; whil≈øt I, mounted on hor≈øe back, with a bear ≈økin ≈øaddle, and bark ≈øtirrups, proceeded by land to the falls: I came there the next morning, and we carried our canoe and loading pa≈øt the falls.</p>
            <p>The river is very rapid for ≈øome di≈øtance above the falls, which are about twelve or fifteen feet nearly perpendicular. This river, called Cane≈øadooharie, interlocks with the We≈øt branch of Mu≈økingum, runs nearly a north cour≈øe, and empties into the ≈øouth ≈øide of Lake Erie, about eighty miles ea≈øt from Sandu≈øky, or betwixt Sandu≈øky and Cayahaga.</p>
            <p>On this la≈øt route the land is nearly the ≈øame, as that la≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed, only there is not ≈øo much ≈øwampy or wet ground.</p>
            <p>We again proceeded towards the lake, I on hor≈øe back, and Tontileaugo by water. Here the land is generally good, but I found ≈øome difficulty in getting round ≈øwamps and ponds. When we came to the lake I proceeded along the ≈øtrand, and Tontileaugo near the ≈øhore, ≈øometimes paddling and ≈øometimes polling his canoe along</p>
            <p>After ≈øome time the wind aro≈øe, and he went into the mouth of a ≈ømall creek and encamped. Here we ≈øtaid ≈øeveral days on account of high wind, which rai≈øed the lake in great billows. While we were here Tontileaugo went out to hunt, and when he was gone a Wiandot came to our camp; I gave him a ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of veni≈øon which I had by the fire well roa≈øted, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it gladly, told me he was hungry, and thanked me for my kindne≈øs. When Tontileaugo came home, I told him that a Wiandot had been at camp, and that I gave him a ≈øhounder of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036317_0025_1008DBE1CB5EF708"/>
roa≈øted veni≈øon: he ≈øaid that was very well, and I ≈øuppo≈øe you gave him al≈øo ≈øugar and bears oil, to eat with his veni≈øon. I told him I did not; as the ≈øugar and bears oil was down in the canoe I did not go for it. He replied you have behaved ju≈øt like a Dutchman.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Dutch he called Skoharehaugo, which took its derivation from a Dutch ≈øettlement called Skoharey.</note> Do you not know that when ≈øtrangers come to our camp, we ought always to give them the be≈øt that we have. I acknowledged that I was wrong. He ≈øaid that he could excu≈øe this, as I was but young; but I mu≈øt learn to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have like a warrior, and do great things, and never be found in any ≈øuch little actions.</p>
            <p>The lake being again calm,<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">The lake when calm, appears to be of a ≈øky blue colour; though when lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ve≈ø≈øel, it is like other clear water.</note> we proceeded, and arrived ≈øafe at Sunyendeand, which was a Wiandot town, that lay upon a ≈ømall creek which empties into the Little Lake below the mouth of Sandu≈øky.</p>
            <p>The town was about eighty rood above the mouth of the creek, on the ≈øouth ≈øide of a large plain, on which timber grew, and nothing more but gra≈øs or nettles. In ≈øome places there were large flats, where nothing but gra≈øs grew, about three feet high when grown, and in other places nothing but nettles, very rank, where the ≈øoil is extremely rich and loo≈øe‚Äîhere they planted corn. In this town there were al≈øo French traders, who purcha≈øed our ≈økins and fur, and we all got new clothes, paint, tobacco, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After I had got my new clothes, and my head done off like a read-headed wood-pecker, I, in company with a number of young Indians, went down to the corn-field, to ≈øee the ≈øquaws at work. When we came there, they a≈øked me to take a hoe, which I did, and hoed for ≈øome time. The ≈øquaws applauded me as a good hand at the bu≈øine≈øs; but when I returned to the town, the old men hearing of what I had done, chid me, and ≈øaid that I was adopted in the place of a great man, and mu≈øt not hoe corn like a ≈øquaw. They never had occa≈øion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove me for any thing like this again; as I never was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fond of work, I readily complied with their orders.</p>
            <p>As the Indians on their return from their winter hunt, bring in with them large quantities of bears' oil, ≈øugar, dried veni≈øon, &amp;c. at this time they have plenty, and do not ≈øpare eating or giving‚Äîthus they make way with their provi≈øion as quick as po≈ø≈øible. They have no ≈øuch thing as regular meals, breakfa≈øt, dinner or ≈øupper; but if any one, even the town folks, would go to the ≈øame hou≈øe, ≈øeveral times in one day, he would be invited to eat of the be≈øt‚Äîand with them it is bad manners to refu≈øe to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036317_0026_1008DBE37B5F5358"/>
eat when it is offered. If they will not eat it is interpreted as a ≈øymptom of di≈øplea≈øure, or that the per≈øons refu≈øing to eat, were angry with tho≈øe who invited them.</p>
            <p>At this time homony plentifully mixed with bears' oil and ≈øugar; or dried veni≈øon, bears oil and ≈øugar, is what they offer to every one who comes in any time of the day; and ≈øo they go on until their ≈øugar, bears oil and veni≈øon, is all gone, and then they have to eat homony by it≈øelf, without bread, ≈øalt or any thing el≈øe; yet, ≈øtill they invite every one that comes in, to eat whil≈øt they have any thing to give. It is thought a ≈øhame, not to invite people to eat, while they have any thing; but, if they can in truth, only ≈øay we have got nothing to eat, this is accepted as an honorable apology. All the hunters and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors continued in town about ≈øix weeks after we came in: they ≈øpent this time in painting, going from hou≈øe to hou≈øe, eatings, ≈ømoking and playing at a game re≈øembling dice, or hu≈øtle-cap. They put a number of plumb-≈øtones in a ≈ømall bowl; one ≈øide of each ≈øtone is black, and the other white; they then ≈øhake or hu≈øtle the bowl, calling, <hi>hits, hits, hits, honesey, honesey, rago, rago;</hi> which ≈øignifies calling for white or black, or what they wi≈øh to turn up; they then turn the bowl, and count the whites and blacks. Some were beating their kind of drum, and ≈øing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; others were employed in playing on a ≈øort of flute, made of hollow cane; and others playing on the jews-harp. Some part of this time was al≈øo taken up in attending the council hou≈øe, where the chiefs, and as many others as cho≈øe, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and at night they were frequently employed in ≈øinging and dancing. Towards the la≈øt of this time, which was in June 1756, they were all engaged in preparing to go to war again≈øt the frontiers of Virginia: when they were equipped, they went through their ceremonies, ≈øung their war ≈øongs, &amp;c. They all marched off, from fifteen to ≈øixty years of age; and ≈øome boys only twelve years old, were equipped with their bows and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and went to war; ≈øo that none were left in town but ≈øquaws and children, except my≈øelf, one very old man, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other about fifty years of age, who was lame.</p>
            <p>The Indians were then in great hopes that they would drive all the Virginians over the lake, which is all the name they know for the ≈øea. They had ≈øome cau≈øe for this hope, becau≈øe, at this time, the Americans were altogether unacquainted with war of any kind, and con≈øequently very unfit to ≈øtand their hand with ≈øuch ≈øubtil enemies as the Indians were. The two old Indians a≈øked me if I did not think that the Indians and French would ≈øubdue all America, except New-England, which they ≈øaid they had tried in old times. I told them I thought not: they ≈øaid they had already drove them all out of the mountains,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036317_0027_1008DBE862890C98"/>
and had chiefly laid wa≈øte the great valley, betwixt the North and South mountain, from Potomack to James River, which is a con≈øiderable part of the be≈øt land in Virginia, Maryland and Penn≈øylvania, and that the white people appeared to them like fools; they could neither guard again≈øt ≈øurprize, run or fight. The≈øe they ≈øaid were their rea≈øons for ≈øaying that they would ≈øubdue the whites. They a≈øked me to offer my rea≈øons for my opinion, and told me to ≈øpeak my mind freely. I told them that the white people to the Ea≈øt were very numerous, like the trees, and though they appeared to them to be fools, as they were not acquainted with their way of war, yet they were not fools; therefore after ≈øome time they will learn your mode of war, and turn upon you, or at lea≈øt defend them≈øelves. I found that the old men them≈øelves did not believe they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer America, yet they were willing to propagate the idea, in order to encourage the young men to go to war.</p>
            <p>When the warriors left this town we had neither meat ≈øugar or bears oil, left. All that we had then to live on was corn pounded into coar≈øe meal or ≈ømall homony‚Äîthis they boiled in water, which appeared like well thickened ≈øoup, without ≈øalt or any thing el≈øe. For ≈øome time, we had plenty of this kind of homony; at length we were brought to very ≈øhort allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and as the warriors did not return as ≈øoon as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, we were in a ≈øtarving condition, and but one gun in the town, and very little amunition. The old lame Wiandot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that he would go a hunting in a canoe, and take me with him, and try to kill deer in the water, as it was then watering time. We went up Sandu≈øky a few miles, then turned up a creek, and encamped. We had lights prepared, as we were to hunt in the night, and al≈øo a piece of bark and ≈øome bu≈øhes ≈øet up in the canoe, in order to conceal our≈øelves from the deer. A little boy that was with us, held the light, I worked the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe, and the old man, who had his gun loaded with large ≈øhot, when we came near the deer, fired, and in this manner killed three deer, in part of one night. We went to our fire, ate heartily, and in the morning returned to town, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the hungry and di≈øtre≈ø≈øed.</p>
            <p>When we came to town, the children were crying bitterly on account of pinching hunger. We delivered what we had taken, and though it was but little among ≈øo many, it was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to the ≈øtricte≈øt rules of ju≈øtice. We immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øet out for another hunt, but before we returned a part of the warriors had come in, and brought with them on hor≈øe-back, a quantity of meat. The≈øe warriors had divided into different parties, and all ≈øtruck at different places in Augu≈øta county. They brought in with them a con≈øiderable number of ≈øcalps,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036317_0028_1008DBED92A04B98"/>
pri≈øoners, hor≈øes, and other plunder. One of the parties brought in with them, one Arthur Campbell, that is now Col. Campbell, who lives on Hol≈øton River, near the Royal-Oak. As the Wiandots at Sunyendeand, and tho≈øe at Detroit were connected, Mr. Campbell was taken to Detroit; but he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ≈øome time with me in this town: his company was very agreeable, and I was ≈øorry when he left me. During his ≈øtay at Sunyendeand he borrowed my Bible, and made ≈øome perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent remarks on what he had read. One pa≈ø≈øage was where it is ≈øaid, "It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth." He ≈øaid we ought to be re≈øigned to the will of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kence, as we were now bearing the yoke, in our youth. Mr. Campbell appeared to be then about ≈øixteen or ≈øeventeen years of age.</p>
            <p>There was a number of pri≈øoners brought in by the≈øe parties and when they were to run the gauntlet, I went and told them how they were to act. One John Savage, was brought in, a middle aged man, or about forty years old. He was to run the gauntlet. I told him what he had to do; and after this I fell into one of the ranks with the Indians, ≈øhouting and yelling like them; and as they were not very ≈øevere on him, as he pa≈ø≈øed me, I hit him with a piece of a pumpkin‚Äîwhich plea≈øed the Indians much, but hurt my feelings.</p>
            <p>About the time that the≈øe warriors came in, the green corn, was beginning to be of u≈øe; ≈øo that we had either green corn or veni≈øon, and ≈øometimes both‚Äîwhich was comparatively, high living. When we could have plenty of green corn, or roa≈øting-ears, the hunters became lazy, and ≈øpent their time as already mentioned, in ≈øinging and dancing &amp;c. They appeared to be fulfilling the ≈øcriptures beyond tho≈øe who profe≈øs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, in that of taking no thought of to-morrow: and al≈øo in living in love, peace and friend≈øhip together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out di≈øputes. In this re≈øpect, they ≈øhame tho≈øe who profe≈øs Chri≈øtianity.</p>
            <p>In this manner we lived, until October, then the gee≈øe, ≈øwans, ducks, cranes, &amp;c. came from the north, and alighted on this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Lake, without number or innumerable. Sunyendeand is a remarkable place for fi≈øh, in the ≈øpring, and fowl both in the fall and ≈øpring.</p>
            <p>As our hunters were now tired with indolence, and fond of their own kind of exerci≈øe, they all turned out to fowling, and in this could ≈øcarce mi≈øs of ≈øucce≈øs; ≈øo that we had now plenty of homony and the be≈øt of fowls; and ≈øometimes as a rarity we had a little bread, which was made of Indian corn meal, pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036317_0029_1008DBF1159ED5F8"/>
in a homony-block, mixed with boiled beans, and baked in cakes under the a≈øhes.</p>
            <p>This, with us was called good living, though not equal to our fat, roa≈øted and boiled veni≈øon, when we went to the woods in the fall; or bears meat and beaver in the winter; or ≈øugar, bears oil, and dry veni≈øon in the ≈øpring.</p>
            <p>Some time in October, another adopted brother, older than Tontileaugo, came to pay us a vi≈øit at Sunyendeand, and he a≈øked me to take a hunt with him on Cayahaga. As they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways u≈øed me as a free man, and gave me the liberty of choo≈øing, I told him that I was attached to Tontileaugo‚Äîhad never ≈øeen him before, and therefore, a≈øked ≈øometime to con≈øider of this. He told me that the party he was going with would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, or at the mouth of this little lake, in le≈øs than ≈øix days, and I could in this time be acquainted with him, and judge for my≈øelf. I con≈øulted with Tontileaugo on this occa≈øion, and he told me that our old brother Tecaughretanego, (which was his name) was a chief, and a better man than he was; and if I went with him I might expect to be well u≈øed, but he ≈øaid I might do as I plea≈øed; and if I ≈øtaid he would u≈øe me as he had done. I told him that he had acted in every re≈øpect, as a brother to me; yet I was much plea≈øed with my old brother's conduct and conver≈øation; and as he was going to a part of the country I had never been in, I wi≈øhed to go with him‚Äîhe ≈øaid that he was perfectly willing.</p>
            <p>I then went with Tecaughretanego, to the mouth of the little lake, where he met with the company he intended going with, which was compo≈øed of, Caughnewagas, and Ottawas.‚Äî Here I was introduced to a Caughnewaga ≈øi≈øter, and others I had never before ≈øeen. My ≈øi≈øter's name was Mary, which they pronounced <hi>Maully.</hi> I a≈øked Tecaughretanego how it came that ≈øhe had an Engli≈øh name; he ≈øaid that he did not know that it was an Engli≈øh name; but it was the name the prie≈øt gave her when ≈øhe was baptized, which he ≈øaid was the name of the mother of Je≈øus. He ≈øaid there were a great many of the Caughnewagas and Wiandots, that were a kind of half Roman-Catholics; but as for him≈øelf, he ≈øaid, that the prie≈øt and him could not agree; as they held notions that contradicted both ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon, and had the a≈ø≈øurance to tell him, that the book of God, taught them the≈øe fooli≈øh ab≈øurdities: but he could not believe the great and good ≈øpirit ever taugh them any ≈øuch non≈øen≈øe: and therefore he concluded that the Indians' old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was better than this new way of wor≈øhiping God.</p>
            <p>The Ottawas have a very u≈øeful kind of tents which they carry with them, made of flags, plaited and ≈øtitched together in a very artful manner, ≈øo as to turn rain, or wind well,‚Äîeach
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036317_0030_1008DBF4100D67D0"/>
mat is made fifteen feet long, and about five feet broad. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to erect this kind of tent, they cut a number of long ≈øtrait poles, which they drive in the ground, in form of a circle, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwards; then they ≈øpread the matts on the≈øe poles,‚Äîbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the bottom and extending up, leaving only a hole in the top uncovered‚Äîand this hole an≈øwers the place of a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. They make a fire of dry ≈øplit wood, in the middle, and ≈øpread down bark mats and ≈økins for bedding, on which they ≈øleep in a crooked po≈øture, all round the fire, as the length of their beds will not admit of ≈øtretching them≈øelves. In place of a door they lift up one end of a mat and creep in, and let the mat fall down behind them.</p>
            <p>The≈øe tents are warm and dry, and tolerable clear of ≈ømoke. Their lumber they keep under birch-bark canoes, which they carry out and turn up for a ≈øhelter, where they keep every thing from the rain. Nothing is in the tents but them≈øelves and their bedding.</p>
            <p>This company had four birch canoes and four tents. We were kindly received, and they gave us plenty of homony, and wild fowl, boiled and roa≈øted. As the gee≈øe, ducks, ≈øwans, &amp;c. here are well grain-fed, they were remarkably fat e≈øpecially the green necked ducks.</p>
            <p>The wild fowl here, feed upon a kind of wild rice, that grows ≈øpontaneou≈øly in the ≈øhallow water, or wet places along the ≈øides or in the corners of the lakes.</p>
            <p>As the wind was high and we could not proceed on our voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, we remained here ≈øeveral days, and killed abundance of wild fowl, and a number of racoons.</p>
            <p>When a company of Indians are moving together on the lake, as it is at this time of the year often dangerous ≈øailing, the old men hold a council; and when they agree to embark, every one is engaged immediately in making ready, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering one word again≈øt the mea≈øure, though the lake may be boi≈øterous and horrid. One morning tho' the wind appeared to me to be as high as in days pa≈øt, and the billows raging, yet the call was given <hi>yohoh-yohoh,</hi> which was quickly an≈øwered by all ‚Äîooh-ooh which ≈øignifies agreed. We were all in≈øtantly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in preparing to ≈øtart, and had con≈øiderable difficulties in embarking.</p>
            <p>As ≈øoon as we got into our canoes we fell to paddling with all our might, making out from the ≈øhore. Though the≈øe ≈øort of canoes ride waves beyond what could be expected, yet the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øeveral times da≈øhed into them. When we got out about half a mile from ≈øhore, we hoi≈øted ≈øail, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> it was nearly a we≈øt wind, we then ≈øeemed to ride the waves with ea≈øe, and went on at a rapid rate. We then all laid down our paddles,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036317_0031_1008DBF721ECD080"/>
excepting one that ≈øteered, and there was no water da≈øhed into our canoes, until we came near the ≈øhore again. We ≈øailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ≈øixty miles that day, and encamped ≈øome time before night.</p>
            <p>The next day we again embarked and went on very well for ≈øome time; but the lake being boi≈øterous, and the wind not fair, we were obliged to make to ≈øhore, which we accompli≈øhed with hard work and ≈øome difficulty in landing.‚ÄîThe next morning a council was held by the old men.</p>
            <p>As we had this day to pa≈øs by a long precipice of rocks, on the ≈øhore about nine miles, which rendered it impo≈ø≈øible for us to land, though the wind was high and the lake rough; yet, as it was fair, we were all ordered to embark. We wrought our≈øelves out from the ≈øhore and hoi≈øted ≈øail (what we u≈øed in place of ≈øail cloth, were our tent mats, which an≈øwered the place very well) and went on for ≈øome time with a fair wind, until we were oppo≈øite to the precipice, and then it turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ≈øhore, and we began to fear we ≈øhould be ca≈øt upon the rocks. Two of the canoes were con≈øiderably farther out from the rocks, than the canoe I was in. Tho≈øe who were farthe≈øt out in the lake did not let down their ≈øails until they had pa≈ø≈øed the precipice; but as we were nearer the rock, we were obliged to lower our ≈øails, and paddle with all our might. With much difficulty we cleared our≈øelves of the rock, and landed. As the other canoes had landed before us, there were immediately runners ≈øent off to ≈øee if we were all ≈øafely landed.</p>
            <p>This night the wind fell, and the next morning the lake was tolerably calm, and we embarked without difficulty, and paddled along near the ≈øhore, until we came to the mouth of Cayahaga, which empties into Lake Erie on the ≈øouth ≈øide, betwixt Cane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øadooharie, and Pre≈øq'I≈øle.</p>
            <p>We turned up Cayahaga and encamped‚Äîwhere we ≈øtaid and hunted for ≈øeveral days; and ≈øo we kept moving and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting until we came to the forks of Cayahaga.</p>
            <p>This is a very gentle river, and but few riffles, or ≈øwift run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning places, from the mouth to the forks. Deer here were tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably plenty, large and fat; but bear and other game ≈øcarce. The upland is hilly, a principally ≈øecond and third rate land. The timber chiefly black-oak, white-oak, hickory, dogwood &amp;c. The bottoms are rich and large, and the timber is walnut, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øt, mulberry, ≈øugar-tree, red-haw, black-haw, wild-appletrees &amp;c. The We≈øt Branch of this river interlocks with the Ea≈øt Branch of Mu≈økingum; and the Ea≈øt Branch with the Big Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver creek, that empties into the Ohio about thirty miles below Pitt≈øburgh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:036317_0032_1008DBFA232BB538"/>From the forks of Cayahaga to the Ea≈øt Branch of Mu≈økingum, there is a carrying place, where the Indians carry their canoes &amp;c. from the waters of Lake Erie, into the waters of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hio.</p>
            <p>From the forks I went over with ≈øome hunters, to the Ea≈øt Branch of Mu≈økingum, where they killed ≈øeveral deer, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of beavers, and returned heavy laden, with ≈økins and meat, which we carried on our backs, as we had no hor≈øes.</p>
            <p>The land here is chiefly ≈øecond and third rate, and the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber chiefly oak and hickory. A little above the forks, on the Ea≈øt Branch of Cayahaga, are con≈øiderable rapids, very rocky, for ≈øome di≈øtance; but no perpendicular falls.</p>
            <p>About the fir≈øt of December, 1756, we were preparing for leaving the river: we buried our canoes, and as u≈øual hung up our ≈økins, and every one had a pack to carry: the ≈øquaws al≈øo packed up their tents, which they carried in large rolls, that extended up above their heads; and though a great bulk, yet not heavy. We ≈øteered about a ≈øouth ea≈øt cour≈øe and could not march over ten miles per day. At night we lodged in our flag tents, which when erected, were nearly in the ≈øhape of a ≈øugar loaf, and about fifteen feet diameter at the ground.</p>
            <p>In this manner we proceeded about forty miles, and wintered in the≈øe tents, on the waters of Beaver creek, near a little lake or large pond, which is about two miles long, and one broad, and a remarkable plate for beaver.</p>
            <p>It is a received opinion among the Indians, that the gee≈øe turn to beavers, and the ≈ønakes to racoons; and though Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caughretanego, who was a wi≈øe man, was not fully per≈øuaded that this was true; yet he ≈øeemed in ≈øome mea≈øure to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with this whim≈øical notion. He ≈øaid that this pond had been always a plentiful place of beaver. Though he ≈øaid he knew them to be frequently all killed, (as he thought;) yet the next winter they would be as plenty as ever. And as the beaver was an animal that did not travel by land, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no water communication, to, or from this pond‚Äîhow could ≈øuch a number of beavers get there year after year? But as this pond was al≈øo a con≈øiderable place for gee≈øe, when they came in the fall from the north, and alighted in this pond, they turned beavers, all but the feet, which remained nearly the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>I ≈øaid, that though there was no water communication, in, or out of this pond; yet it appeared that it was fed by ≈øprings, as it was always clear and never ≈øtagnated: and as a very large ≈øpring ro≈øe about a mile below this pond, it was likely that this ≈øpring came from this pond. In the fall when this ≈øpring is cormparatively low there would be air under ground
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036317_0033_1008DBFE66F52CD0"/>
≈øufficient for the beavers to breathe in, with their heads above water, for they cannot live long under water, and ≈øo they might have a ≈øubterraneous pa≈ø≈øage by water into this pond.‚ÄîTe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caughretanego, granted that it might be ≈øo.</p>
            <p>About the ≈øides of this pond there grew great abundance of cranberries, which the Indians gathered up on the ice, when the pond was frozen over. The≈øe berries were about as large as rifle bullets‚Äîof a bright red color‚Äîan agreeable ≈øour, though rather too ≈øour of them≈øelves; but when mixed with ≈øugar, had a very agreeable ta≈øte.</p>
            <p>In conver≈øation with Tecaughretanego, I happened to be talking of the beavers' catching fi≈øh. He a≈øked me why I thought that the beaver caught fi≈øh? I told him that I had read or the beaver making dams for the conveniency of fi≈øhing. He laughed, and made game of me and my book. He ≈øaid the man that wrote that book knew nothing about the beaver. The beaver never did eat fle≈øh of any kind; but lived on the bark of trees, roots, and other vegetables.</p>
            <p>In order to know certainly how this was, when we killed a beaver I carefully examined the inte≈øtines but found no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of fi≈øh; I afterwards made an experiment on a pet beaver which we had, and found that it would neither eat fi≈øh or fle≈øh; therefore I acknowledged that the book I had read was wrong.</p>
            <p>I a≈øked him if the beaver was an amphibious animal, or if it could live under water? He ≈øaid that the beaver was a kind of ≈øubterraneous water animal, that lives in or near the water; but they were no more amphibious than the ducks and gee≈øe were‚Äîwhich was con≈øtantly proven to be the ca≈øe; as all the beavers that are caught in ≈øteel traps are drowned, provided the trap be heavy enough to keep them under water. As the beaver does not eat fi≈øh, I enquired of Tecaughretanego why the beaver made ≈øuch large dams? He ≈øaid they were of u≈øe to them in various re≈øpects‚Äîboth for their ≈øafety and food. For their ≈øafety, as by rai≈øing the water over the mouths of their holes, or ≈øubterraneous lodging places, they could not be ea≈øily found: and as the beaver feeds chiefly on the bark of trees, by rai≈øing the water over the banks, they can cut down ≈øapplings for bark to feed upon without going out much upon the land: and when they are obliged to go out on land for this food they frequently are caught by the wolves. As the beaver can run upon land, but little fa≈øter than a water tortoi≈øe, and is no fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animal, if they are any di≈øtance from the water they become an ea≈øy prey to their enemies.</p>
            <p>I a≈øked Tecaughretanego, what was the u≈øe of the beaver's ≈øtones, or glands, to them;‚Äîas the ≈øhe beaver has two pair<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:036317_0034_1008DC0162FC3CE0"/>
which is commonly called the oil ≈øtones, and the bark ≈øtones? He ≈øaid that as the beavers are the dumbe≈øt of all animals, and ≈øcarcely ever make any noi≈øe; and as they were working crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they made u≈øe of this ≈ømell in order to work in concert. If an old beaver was to come on the bank and rub his breech upon the ground, and rai≈øe a perfume, the others will collect from different places and go to work: this is al≈øo of u≈øe to them in travelling, that they may thereby ≈øearch out and find their company. Cunning hunters finding this out, have made u≈øe of it again≈øt the beaver, in order to catch them. What is the bait which you ≈øee them make u≈øe of, but a compound of the oil and bark ≈øtones? By this perfume, which is only a fal≈øe ≈øignal they decoy them to the trap.</p>
            <p>Near this pond, beaver was the principal game. Before the the waters froze up, we caught a great many with wooden and ≈øteel traps: but after that, we hunted the beaver on the ice. Some places here the beavers build large hou≈øes to live in; and in other places they have ≈øubterraneous lodgings in the banks. Where they lodge in the ground we have no chance of hunting them on the ice; but where they have hou≈øes we go with malls and hand≈øpikes, and break all the hollow ice, to prevent them from getting their heads above the water under it. Then we break a hole in the hou≈øe and they make their e≈øcape into the water; but as they cannot live long under water, they are obliged to go to ≈øome of tho≈øe broken places to breathe, and the Indians commonly put in their hands, catch them by the hind leg, hawl them on the ice, and tomahawk them. Sometimes they ≈øhoot them in the head, when they rai≈øe it above the water. I a≈øked the Indians if they were not afraid to catch the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with their hands? they ≈øaid no: they were not much of a biting creature; yet if they would catch them by the fore foot they would bite.</p>
            <p>I went out with Tecaughretanego, and ≈øome others a beaver hunting: but we did not ≈øucceed, and on our return we ≈øaw where ≈øeveral racoons had pa≈ø≈øed, while the ≈ønow was ≈øoft; tho' there was now a cru≈øt upon it, we all made a halt looking at the racoon tracks. As they ≈øaw a tree with a hole in it they told me to go and ≈øee if they had gone in thereat; and if they had to halloo, and they would come and take them out. When I went to that tree, I found they had gone pa≈øt; but I ≈øaw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the way they had went, and proceeded to examine that, and found they had gone up it. I then began to holloo, but could have no an≈øwer.</p>
            <p>As it began to ≈ønow and blow mo≈øt violently, I returned and proceeded after my company, and for ≈øome time could ≈øee their tracks; but the old ≈ønow being only about three inches deep,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036317_0035_1008DC02E938F2B0"/>
and a cru≈øt upon it, the pre≈øent driving ≈ønow ≈øoon filled up the tracks. As I had only a bow, arrows and tomahawk, with me, and no way to ≈øtrike fire, I appeared to be in a di≈ømal ≈øituation‚Äîand as the air was dark with ≈ønow, I had little more pro≈øpect of ≈øteering my cour≈øe, than I would in the night. At length I came to a hollow tree, with a hole at one ≈øide that I could go in at. I went in, and found that it was a dry place, and the hollow about three feet diameter, and high enough for me to ≈øtand in. I found that there was al≈øo a con≈øiderable quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ≈øoft, dry rotten wood, around this hollow: I therefore concluded that I would lodge here; and that I would go to work, and ≈øtop up the door of my hou≈øe. I ≈øtripped off my blanket, (which was all the clothes that I had, excepting a breech-clout, leggins and mocka≈øons,) and with my tomahawk, fell to chopping at the top of a fallen tree that lay near and carried wood and ≈øet it up on end again≈øt the door, until I had it three or four feet thick, all round, excepting a hole I had left to creep in at. I had a block prepared that I could hawl after me, to ≈øtop this hole: and before I went in I put in a number of ≈ømall ≈øticks, that I might more effectually ≈øtop it on the in≈øide. When I went in, I took my tomahawk and cut down all the dry rotten wood I could get, and beat it ≈ømall. With it I made a bed like a goo≈øe-ne≈øt or hog-bed, and with the ≈ømall ≈øticks ≈øtopped every hole, until my hou≈øe was almo≈øt dark. I ≈øtripped off my mocka≈øons, and danced in the centre of my bed for about half an hour, in order to warm my≈øelf. In this time my feet and whole body were agreeably warmed. The ≈ønow, in the mean while, had ≈øtopped all the holes, ≈øo that my hou≈øe was as dark as a dungeon; though I knew it could not yet be dark out of doors. I then coiled my≈øelf up in my blanket, lay down in my little round bed, and had a tolerable nights lodging. When I awoke, all was dark‚Äînot the lea≈øt glimmering of light was to be ≈øeen. Immediately I recollected that I was not to expect light in this new habitation, as there was neither door nor win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in it. As I could hear the ≈øtorm raging, and did not ≈øuffer much cold, as I was then ≈øituated, I concluded I would ≈øtay in my ne≈øt until I was certain it was day. When I had rea≈øon to conclude that it ≈øurely was day, I aro≈øe and put on my mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øons, which I had laid under my head to keep from Freezing. I then endeavored to find the door, and had to do all by the ≈øen≈øe of feeling, which took me ≈øome time. At length I found the block, but it being heavy, and a large quantity of ≈ønow, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fallen on it, at the fir≈øt attempt I did not move it. I then felt terrified‚Äîamong all the hard≈øhips I had ≈øu≈øtained, I never knew before, what it was to be thus deprived of light. This, with the other circum≈øtances attending it, appeared grievous.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036317_0036_1008DC0482B29510"/>
I went ≈øtraightway to bed again, wrapped my blanket round me, and lay and mu≈øed awhile, and then prayed to almighty God to direct and protect me, as he had done heretofore. I once again attempted to move away the block, which proved ≈øucce≈øsful: it moved about nine inches‚ÄîWith this a con≈øiderable quantity of ≈ønow fell in from above, and I immediately received light, ≈øo that I found a very great ≈ønow had fallen, above what I had ever ≈øeen in one night. I then knew why I could not ea≈øily move the block, and I was ≈øo rejoiced at obtaining the light, that all my other difficulties ≈øeemed to vani≈øh. I then turned into my cell, and returned God thanks for having once more received the light of Heaven. At length I belted my blanket about me, got my tomahawk, bow and arrows, and went out of my den.</p>
            <p>I was now in tolerable high ≈øpirits, tho' the ≈ønow had fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en above three feet deep, in addition to what was on the ground before; and the only imperfect guide I had, in order to ≈øteer my cour≈øe to camp, was the trees; as the mo≈øs generally grows on the north-we≈øt ≈øide of them, if they are ≈øtraight. I proceeded on, wading through the ≈ønow, and about twelve o'clock (as it appeared afterwards, from that time to night, for it was yet cloudy,) I came upon the creek that our camp was on, about half a mile below the camp; and when I came in ≈øight of the camp, I found that there was great joy, by the ≈øhouts and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the boys, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When I arrived, they all came round me, and received me gladly; but at this time no que≈øtions were a≈øked, and I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into a tent, where they gave me plenty of fat beaver meat, and then a≈øked me to ≈ømoke. When I had done, Tecaughreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego de≈øired me to walk out to a fire they had made. I went out, and they all collected round me, both men women and boys. Tecaughretanego a≈øked me to give them a particular account of what had happened from the time they left me ye≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, until now. I told them the whole of the ≈øtory, and they never interrupted me; but when I made a ≈øtop, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals were filled with loud acclamations of joy. As I could not, at this time, talk Ottawa or Jibewa well, (which is nearly the ≈øame) I delivered my ≈øtory in Caughnewaga. As my ≈øi≈øter Molly's hu≈øband was a Jibewa and could under≈øtand Caugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newaga, he acted as interpreter, and delivered my ≈øtory to the Jibewas and Ottawas, which they received with plea≈øure. When all this was done, Tecauretanego made a ≈øpeech to me in the following manner:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Brother,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"You ≈øee we have prepared ≈ønow-≈øhoes to go after you, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036317_0037_1008DC081F7E6C78"/>
were almo≈øt ready to go, when you appeared; yet, as you had not been accu≈øtomed to hard≈øhips in your country, to the ea≈øt, we never expected to ≈øee you alive. Now, we are glad to ≈øee you, in various re≈øpects: we are glad to ≈øee you on your own account; and we are glad to ≈øee the pro≈øpect of your filling the place of a great man, in who≈øe room you were adopted. We do not blame you for what has happened, we blame our≈øelves; becau≈øe, we did not think of this driving ≈ønow filling up the tracks, until after we came to camp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Brother,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Your conduct on this occa≈øion hath plea≈øed us much: You have given us an evidence of your fortitude, ≈økill and re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and we hope you will always go on to do great actions, as it is only great actions that can make a great man."</p>
            <p>I told my brother Tecaughretanego, that I thanked them for their care of me, and for the kindne≈øs I always received. I told him that I always wi≈øhed to do great actions, and hoped I never would do any thing to di≈øhonor any of tho≈øe with whom I was connected. I likewi≈øe told my Jibewa brother-in-law to tell his people that I al≈øo thanked them for their care and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
            <p>The next morning ≈øome of the hunters went out on ≈ønow-≈øhoes, killed ≈øeveral deer, and hauled ≈øome of them into camp upon the ≈ønow. They fixed their carrying ≈øtrings, (which are broad in the middle, and ≈ømall at each end,) in the fore feet and no≈øe of the deer, and laid the broad part of it on their heads or about their ≈øhoulders, and pulled it along; and when it is mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will not ≈øink in the ≈ønow much deeper than a ≈ønow-≈øhoe; and when taken with the grain of the hair, ≈ølips along very ea≈øy.</p>
            <p>The ≈ønow-≈øhoes are made like a hoop net, and wrought with buck-≈økin thongs. Each ≈øhoe is about two feet and an half long, and about eighteen inches broad, before, and ≈ømall behind, with cro≈øs bars, in order to fix or tie them to their feet. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ≈ønow had lay a few days, the Indians tomahawked the deer, by pur≈øuing them in this manner.</p>
            <p>About two weeks after this, there came a warm rain, and took away the chief part of the ≈ønow, and broke up the ice: then we engaged in making wooden traps to catch beavers, as we had but few ≈øteel traps. The≈øe traps are made nearly in the ≈øame manner as the racoon traps already de≈øcribed.</p>
            <p>One day as I was looking after my traps, I got benighted, by beaver ponds intercepting my way to camp; and as I had neglected to take fire-works with me, and the weather very cold, I could find no ≈øuitable lodging place, therefore the only expedient I could think of to keep my≈øelf from freezing, was exerci≈øe. I danced and halloo'd the whole night with all my
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036317_0038_1008DC0C67896238"/>
might, and the next day came to camp. Though I ≈øuffered much more this time than the other night I lay out, yet the Indians were not ≈øo much concerned, as they thought I had fire works with me; but when they knew how it was, they did not blame me. They ≈øaid that old hunters were frequently involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this place, as the beaver dams were one above another on every creek and run, ≈øo that it is hard to find a fording place. They applauded me for my fortitude, and ≈øaid as they had now plenty of beaver-≈økins, they would purcha≈øe me a new gun at Detroit, as we were to go there the next ≈øpring; and then if I ≈øhould chance to be lo≈øt in dark weather, I could make fire, kill provi≈øion, and return to camp when the ≈øun ≈øhined. By being bewildered on the waters of Mu≈økingum, I lo≈øt repute, and was reduced to the bow and arrow; and by lying out two nights here, I regained my credit.</p>
            <p>After ≈øome time the waters all froze again, and then, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, we hunted beavers on the ice. Though beaver meat, without ≈øalt or bread, was the chief of our food this winter, yet we had always plenty, and I was well contented with my diet, as it appeared delicious fare, after the way we had lived the winter before.</p>
            <p>Sometime in February, we ≈øcaffolded up our fur and ≈økins, and moved about ten miles in que≈øt of a ≈øugar camp, or a ≈øuitable place to make ≈øugar, and encamped in a large bottom, on the head waters of Big Beaver creek. We had ≈øome difficulty in moving, as we had a blind Caughnewaga boy about 15 years of age, to lead; and as this country is very bru≈øhy we frequently had him to carry;‚ÄîWe had al≈øo my Jibewa brother-in-law's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with us, who was thought by the Indians to be a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juror‚Äîhis name was Manetohcoa‚Äîthis old man was ≈øo decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, that we had to carry him this route upon a bier,‚Äîand all our baggage to pack on our backs.</p>
            <p>Shortly after we came to this place the ≈øquaws began to make ≈øugar. We had no large kettles with us this year, and they made the fro≈øt, in ≈øome mea≈øure, ≈øupply the place of fire, in making ≈øugar. Their large bark ve≈ø≈øels, for holding the ≈øtock-water, they made broad and ≈øhallow; and as the weather is very cold here, it frequently freezes at night in ≈øugar time; and the ice they break and ca≈øt out of the ve≈ø≈øels. I a≈øked them if they were not throwing away the ≈øugar? they ≈øaid no: it was water they were ca≈øting away, ≈øugar did not freeze, and there was ≈øcarcely any in that ice. They ≈øaid I might try the experiment, and boil ≈øome of it, and ≈øee what I would get. I never did try it; but I ob≈øerved that after ≈øeveral times freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the water that remained in the ve≈ø≈øel, changed its color and became brown and very ≈øweet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:036317_0039_1008DC11053D4348"/>About the time we were done making ≈øugar the ≈ønow went off the ground; and one night a ≈øquaw rai≈øed an alarm. She ≈øaid ≈øhe ≈øaw two men with guns in their hands, upon the bank on the other ≈øide of the creek, ≈øpying our tents‚Äîthey were ≈øuppo≈øed to be John≈øton's Mohawks. On this the ≈øquaws were ordered to ≈ølip quietly out, ≈øome di≈øtance into the bu≈øhes; and all who had either guns or bows were to ≈øquat in the bu≈øhes near the tents; and if the enemy ru≈øhed up, we were to give them the fir≈øt fire, and let the ≈øquaws have an opportunity of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcaping. I got down be≈øide Tecaughretanego, and he whi≈øpered to me not to be afraid, for he would ≈øpeak to the Mohawks, and as they ≈øpake the ≈øame tongue that we did, they would not hurt the Caughnewagas, or me: but they would kill all the Jibewas and Ottawas that they could, and take us along with them. This news plea≈øed me well, and I heartily wi≈øhed for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Mohawks.</p>
            <p>Before we withdrew from the tents they had carried Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tohcoa, to the fire and gave him his conjuring tools, which were dyed feathers, the bone of the ≈øhoulder blade of a wild cat, tobacco &amp;c. and while we were in the bu≈øhes, Manetohcoa was in a tent at the fire, conjuring away to the utmo≈øt of his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. At length he called aloud for us all to come in, which was quickly obeyed. When we came in, he told us that after he had gone through the whole of his ceremony, and expected to ≈øee a number of Mohawks on the flat bone when it was warmed at the fire, the pictures of two wolves only appeared. He ≈øaid tho there were no Mohawks about, we mu≈øt not be angry with the ≈øquaw for giving a fal≈øe alarm; as ≈øhe had occa≈øion to go out and happened to ≈øee the wolves, though it was moon light; yet ≈øhe got afraid, and ≈øhe conceited it was Indians, with guns in their hands, ≈øo he ≈øaid we might all go to ≈øleep for there was no danger‚Äîand accordingly we did.</p>
            <p>The next morning we went to the place, and found wolf tracks, and where they had ≈øcratched with their feet like dogs; but there was no ≈øign of mocka≈øon tracks. If there is any ≈øuch thing as a wizzard, I think Manetohcoa was as likely to be one, as any man, as he was a profe≈ø≈øed wor≈øhiper of the devil.‚ÄîBut let him be a conjuror or not, I am per≈øuaded that the Indians believed what he told them upon this occa≈øion, as well as if it had come from an infallible oracle; or they would not after ≈øuch an alarm as this, go all to ≈øleep in an unconcerned man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This appeared to me the mo≈øt like witchcraft, of any thing I beheld while I was with them. Though I ≈øcrutinized their proceedings in bu≈øine≈øs of this kind; yet I generally found that their pretended witchcraft, was either art or mi≈øtaken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereby they deceived them≈øelves.‚ÄîBefore a battle they
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036317_0040_1008DC129A2AF598"/>
≈øpy the enemy's motions carefully, and when they find that they can have con≈øiderable advantage, and the greate≈øt pro≈øpect of ≈øucce≈øs, then the old men pretend to conjure, or to tell what the event will be,‚Äîand this they do in a figurative manner, which will bear ≈øomething of a different interpretation, which generally comes to pa≈øs nearly as they foretold; therefore the young warriors generally believed the≈øe old conjurors, which had a tendency to animate, and excite them to pu≈øh on with vigor.</p>
            <p>Some time in March 1757 we began to move back to the forks of Cayahaga, which was about forty or fifty miles; and as we had no hor≈øes, we had all our baggage and ≈øeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight of beaver ≈økins, and ≈øome deer and bear ≈økins‚Äîall to pack on our backs. The method we took to accompli≈øh this was by making ≈øhort day's journies. In the morning we would move on with as much as we were able to carry, about five miles, and encamp; and then run back for more. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made three ≈øuch trips in the day. When we came to the great pond, we ≈øtaid there one day to re≈øt our≈øelves and to kill ducks and gee≈øe.</p>
            <p>While we remained here I went in company with a young Caughnewaga, who was about ≈øixteen or ≈øeventeen years of age, Chinnohete by name, in order to gather crannberries. As he was gathering berries at ≈øome di≈øtance from me, three Jibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa ≈øquaws crept up undi≈øcovered and made at him ≈øpeedily, but he nimbly e≈øcaped and came to me apparently terrified. I a≈øked him what he was afraid of? he replied did you not ≈øee tho≈øe ≈øquaws? I told him I did, and they appeared to be in a very good humour. I a≈øked him wherefore then he was afraid of them? He ≈øaid the Jibewa ≈øquaws were very bad women, and had a very ugly cu≈øtom among them. I a≈øked him what that cu≈øtom was? he ≈øaid that when two or three of them could catch a young lad, that was betwixt a man and a boy, out by him≈øelf, if they could overpower him, they would ≈øtrip him by force in order to ≈øee whether he was coming on to be a man or not. He ≈øaid that was what they intended when they crawled up, and ran ≈øo violently at him, but ≈øaid he, I am very glad that I ≈øo narrowly e≈øcaped. I then agreed with Chinnohete in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning this as a bad cu≈øtom, and an exceeding immode≈øt action for young women to be guilty of.</p>
            <p>From our ≈øugar camp on the head waters of Big Beaver creek, to this place is not hilly, and ≈øome places the woods are tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly clear: but in mo≈øt places exceeding bru≈øhy. The land here is chiefly ≈øecond and third rate. The timber on the upland is white-oak, black-oak, hickory and che≈ønut: there is al≈øo in ≈øome places walnut up land, and plenty of good water. The bottoms here are generally large and good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:036317_0041_1008DC1566DF7638"/>We again proceeded on from the pond to the forks of Caya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haga, at the rate of about five miles per day.</p>
            <p>The land on this route is not very hilly, it is well watered, and, in many places ill timbered, generally bru≈øhy, and chiefly ≈øecond and third rate land, intermixed with good bottoms.</p>
            <p>When we came to the forks, we found that the ≈økins we had ≈øcaffolded were all ≈øafe. Though this was a public place, and Indians frequently pa≈ø≈øing, and our ≈økins hanging up in view; yet there was none ≈øtolen; and it is ≈øeldom that Indians do ≈øteal any thing from one another; and they ≈øay they never did, until the white people came among them, and learned ≈øome of them, to lie, cheat and ≈øteal,‚Äîbut be that as it may, they never did cur≈øe or ≈øwear, until the whites learned them; ≈øome think their language will not admit of it, but I am not of that opinion, if I was ≈øo di≈øpo≈øed, I could find language to cur≈øe or ≈øwear, in the Indian tongue.</p>
            <p>I remember that Tecaughretanego, when ≈øomething di≈øplea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, ≈øaid, God damn it.‚ÄîI a≈øked him if he knew what he then ≈øaid? he ≈øaid he did; and mentioned one of their degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding expre≈ø≈øions, which he ≈øuppo≈øed to be the meaning or ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the meaning of what he had ≈øaid. I told him that it did not bear the lea≈øt re≈øemblance to it; that what he ≈øaid, was calling upon the great ≈øpirit to puni≈øh the object he was di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øed with. He ≈øtood for ≈øometime amazed, and then ≈øaid, if this be the meaning of the≈øe words what ≈øort of people are the whites? when the traders were among us the≈øe words ≈øeemed to be intermixed with all their di≈øcour≈øe. He told me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øider what I had ≈øaid, for he thought I mu≈øt be mi≈øtaken in my definition; if I was not mi≈øtaken, he ≈øaid, the traders applied the≈øe words not only wickedly, but often times very fooli≈øhly and contrary to ≈øen≈øe or rea≈øon. He ≈øaid he remembered once of a trader's accidentally breaking his gun lock, and on that occa≈øion calling out aloud God damn it‚Äî≈øurely ≈øaid he the gun lock was not an object worthy of puni≈øhment for Owaneeyo, or the Great Spirit: he al≈øo ob≈øerved the traders often u≈øed this expre≈ø≈øion, when they were in a good humour and not di≈øplea≈øed with any thing.‚ÄîI acknowledged that the traders u≈øed this expre≈ø≈øion very often, in a mo≈øt irrational, incon≈øi≈øtent, and impious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; yet I ≈øtill a≈ø≈øerted that I had given the true meaning of the≈øe words.‚ÄîHe replied, if ≈øo, the traders are as bad as Oona≈øahroona, or the under ground inhabitants, which is the name they give the devils; as they entertain a notion that their place of re≈øidence is under the earth.</p>
            <p>We took up our birch-bark canoes which we had buried, and found that they were not damaged by the winter; but they not being ≈øufficient to carry all that we now had, we made a large
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036317_0042_1008DC1801335F80"/>
che≈ønut bark canoe; as elm bark was not to be found at this place.</p>
            <p>We all embarked, and had a very agreeable pa≈ø≈øage down the Cayahaga, and along the ≈øouth ≈øide of Lake Erie, until we pa≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mouth of Sandu≈øky; then the wind aro≈øe, and we put in at the mouth of the Miami of the Lake, at Cedar Point, where we remained ≈øeveral days, and killed a number of Turkeys, gee≈øe, ducks and ≈øwans. The wind being fair, and the lake not extremely rough, we again embarked, hoi≈øted up ≈øails, and arrived ≈øafe at the Wiandot town, nearly oppo≈øite to Fort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit, on the north ≈øide of the river. Here we found a number of French traders, every one very willing to deal with us for our beaver.</p>
            <p>We bought our≈øelves fine clothes, amunition, paint, tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, &amp;c. and according to promi≈øe, they purcha≈øed me a new gun: yet we had parted with only about one third of our bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. At length a trader came to town with French Brandy: We purcha≈øed a keg of it, and held a council about who was to get drunk, and who was to keep ≈øober. I was invited to get drunk, but I refu≈øed the propo≈øal‚Äîthen they told me that I mu≈øt be one of tho≈øe who were to take care of the drunken peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I did not like this; but of two evils I cho≈øe that which I thought was the lea≈øt‚Äîand fell in with tho≈øe who were to conceal the arms, and keep every dangerous weapon we could, out of their way, and endeavor, if po≈ø≈øible to keep the drinking club from killing each other, which was a very hard ta≈øk. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times we hazarded our own lives, and got our≈øelves hurt, in preventing them from ≈ølaying each other. Before they had fini≈øhed this keg, near one third of the town was introduced to this drinking club; they could not pay their part, as they had already di≈øpo≈øed of all their ≈økins; but that made no odds, all were welcome to drink.</p>
            <p>When they were done with this keg, they applied to the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and procured a kettle full of brandy at a time, which they divided out with a large wooden ≈øpoon,‚Äîand ≈øo they went on and never quit while they had a ≈øingle beaver ≈økin.</p>
            <p>When the trader had got all our beaver, he moved off to the Ottawa town, about a mile above the Wiandot town.</p>
            <p>When the brandy was gone, and the drinking club ≈øober, they appeared much dejected. Some of them were crippled, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers badly wounded, a number of their fine new ≈øhirts tore, and ≈øeveral blankets were burned:‚Äîa number of ≈øquaws were al≈øo in this club, and neglected their corn planting.</p>
            <p>We could now hear the effects of the brandy in the Ottawa town. They were ≈øinging and yelling in the mo≈øt hideous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036317_0043_1008DC19895344A0"/>
both night and day; but their frolic ended wor≈øe than ours; five Ottawas were killed and a great many wounded.</p>
            <p>After this a number of young Indians were getting their ears cut, and they urged me to have mine cut likewi≈øe; but they did not attempt to compel me, though they endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuade me. The principal arguments they u≈øed were its being a very great ornament, and al≈øo the common fa≈øhion‚ÄîThe former I did not believe, and the latter I could not deny. The way they performed this operation was by cutting the fle≈øhy part of the circle of the ear clo≈øe to the gri≈øtle quite through. When this was done they wrapt rags round this fle≈øhy part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it was entirely healed; then they hung lead to it and ≈øtretched it to a wonderful length: when it was ≈øufficiently ≈øtretched, they wrapt the fle≈øhy part round with bra≈øs wire, which formed it into a ≈øemicircle about four inches diameter.</p>
            <p>Many of the young men were now exerci≈øing them≈øelves in a game re≈øembling foot ball; though they commonly ≈øtruck the ball with a crooked ≈øtick, made for that purpo≈øe; al≈øo a game ≈øomething like this, wherein they u≈øed a wooden ball, about three inches diameter, and the in≈øtrument they moved it with was a ≈øtrong ≈øtaff about five feet long, with a hoop net on the end of it, large enough to contain the ball. Before they begin the play, they lay off about half a mile di≈øtance in a clear plain, and the oppo≈øite parties all attend at the centre, where a di≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øted per≈øon ca≈øts up the ball then the opo≈øite parties all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for it. If any one gets it into his net, he runs with it the way he wi≈øhes it to go, and they all pur≈øue him. If one of the oppo≈øite party overtakes the per≈øon with the ball, he gives the ≈øtaff a ≈øtroke which cau≈øes the ball to fly out of the net; then they have another debate for it; and if the one that gets it can outrun all the opo≈øite party, and can carry it quite out, or over the line at the end, the game is won; but this ≈øeldom happens. When any one is running away with the ball, and is like to be overtaken, he commonly throws it, and with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument can ca≈øt it fifty or ≈øixty yards. Sometimes when the ball is almo≈øt at the one end, matters will take a ≈øudden turn, and the oppo≈øite party may quickly carry it out at the other end. Often times they will work a long while back and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward before they can get the ball over the line, or win the game.</p>
            <p>About the fir≈øt of June 1757 the warriors were preparing to go to war, in the Wiandot, Pottowatomy, and Ottawa towns; al≈øo a great many Jibewas came down from the upper lakes; and after ≈øinging their war ≈øongs and going through their common ceremonies, they marched off again≈øt the frontiers of Virginia, Maryland and Penn≈øylvania.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:036317_0044_1008DC1CABEAC470"/>land, and Penn≈øylvania, in their u≈øual manner, ≈øinging the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling ≈øong, ≈ølow firing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the north≈øide of the river St. Laurence, oppo≈øite to Fort Detroit, there is an i≈øland, which the Indians call the Long I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øland, and which they ≈øay is above one thou≈øand miles long, and in ≈øome places above one hundred miles broad. They further ≈øay that the great river that comes down by Cane≈øatauga and that empties into the main branch of St. Laurence, above Montreal, originates from one ≈øource, with the St. Lawrence, and forms this i≈øland.</p>
            <p>Oppo≈øite to Detroit, and below it, was originally a prairie, and laid off in lots about ≈øixty rods broad, and a great length: each lot is divided into two fields, which they cultivate year about. The principal grain that the French rai≈øed in the≈øe fields was ≈øpring wheat, and peas.</p>
            <p>They built all their hou≈øes on the front of the≈øe lots on the river ≈øide; and as the banks of the river are very low, ≈øome of the hou≈øes are not above three or four feet above the ≈øurface of the water; yet they are in no danger of being di≈øturbed by fre≈øhes, as the river ≈øeldom ri≈øes above eighteen inches; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it is the communication, of the river St. Laurence, from one lake to another.</p>
            <p>As dwelling-hou≈øes, barns, and ≈øtables are all built on the front of the≈øe lots; at a di≈øtance it appears like a continued row of hou≈øes in a town, on each ≈øide of the river for a long way. The≈øe villages, the town, the river and the plains, being all in view at once, affords a mo≈øt delightful pro≈øpect.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants here chiefly drink the river water; and as it comes from the northward it is very whole≈øome.</p>
            <p>The land here is principally ≈øecond rate, and comparatively ≈øpeaking, a ≈ømall part is fir≈øt or third rate; tho about four or five miles ≈øouth of Detroit, their is a ≈ømall portion that is wor≈øe than what I would call third rate, which produces abundance of hurtle berries.</p>
            <p>There is plenty of good meadow ground here, and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mar≈øhes that are over≈øpread with water.‚ÄîThe timber is elm, ≈øugar-tree, black-a≈øh, white-a≈øh, abundance of water-a≈øh, oak, hickory, and ≈øome walnut.</p>
            <p>About the middle of June the Indians were almo≈øt all gone to war, from ≈øixteen to ≈øixty; yet Tecaughretanego remained in town with me. Tho he had formerly, when they were at war with the ≈øouthern nations been a great warrior, and an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent coun≈øellor; and I think as clear and as able a rea≈øoner upon any ≈øubject that he had an opportunity of being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, as I ever knew; yet he had all along been again≈øt
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036317_0045_1008DC1ECE010D70"/>
this war, and had ≈øtreneou≈øly oppo≈øed it in council. He ≈øaid if the Engli≈øh and French had a quarrel let them fight their own battles them≈øelves; it is not our bu≈øine≈øs to intermeddle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
            <p>Before the warriors returned we were very ≈øcarce of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion: and tho we did not commonly ≈øteal from one another; yet we ≈øtole during this time any thing that we could eat from the French, under the notion that it was ju≈øt for us to do ≈øo; becau≈øe they ≈øupported their ≈øoldiers; and our ≈øquaws, old men and children were ≈øuffering on the account of the war, as our hunters were all gone.</p>
            <p>Some time in Augu≈øt the warriors returned, and brought in with them a great many ≈øcalps, pri≈øoners, hor≈øes and plunder; and the common report among the young warriors, was, that they would intirely ≈øubdue Tulha≈øaga, that is the Engli≈øh, or it might be literally rendered the Morning Light inhabitants.</p>
            <p>About the fir≈øt of November a number of families were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to go on their winter hunt, and all agreed to cro≈øs the lake together. We encamped at the mouth of the river the fir≈øt night, and a council was held, whether we would cro≈øs thro' by the three i≈ølands, or coa≈øt i round the lake. The≈øe i≈ølands lie in a line acro≈øs the lake, and are ju≈øt in ≈øight of each other. Some of the Wiandots or Ottawas frequently make their winter hunt on the≈øe i≈øland. Tho excepting wild fowl and fi≈øh, there is ≈øcarcely any game here but racoons which are amazingly plenty, and exceeding large and fat; as they feed upon the wild rice, which grows in abundance in wet places round the≈øe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølands. It is ≈øaid that each hunter in one winter will catch one thou≈øand racoons.</p>
            <p>It is a received opinion among the Indians that the ≈ønakes and racoons are tran≈ømutable; and that a great many of the ≈ønakes turn racoons every fall, and racoons ≈ønakes every ≈øpring. This notion is founded on ob≈øervations made on the ≈ønakes and racoons in this i≈øland.</p>
            <p>As the racoons here lodge in rocks, the trappers make their wooden traps at the mouth of the holes; and as they go daily to look at their traps, in the winter ≈øea≈øon, they commonly find them filled with racoons; but in the ≈øpring or when the fro≈øt is out of the ground, they ≈øay, they then find their traps filled with large rattle ≈ønakes. And therefore conclude that the racoons are transformed. They al≈øo ≈øay that the rea≈øon why they are ≈øo remarkably plenty in the winter, is, every fall the ≈ønakes turn racoons again.</p>
            <p>I told them that tho I had never landed on any of the≈øe i≈ølands, yet from the unanimous accounts I had received, I believed that both ≈ønakes and racoons were plenty there; but no doubt
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036317_0046_1008DC233713F9C0"/>
they all remained there both ≈øummer and winter, only the ≈ønakes were not to be ≈øeen in the latter; yet I did not believe that they were tran≈ømutable.</p>
            <p>The≈øe i≈ølands are but ≈øeldom vi≈øited; becau≈øe early in the ≈øpring and late in the fall it is dangerous ≈øailing in their bark canoes; and in the ≈øummer they are ≈øo infe≈øted with various kinds of ≈øerpents, (but chiefly rattle ≈ønakes,) that it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous landing.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall now quit this digre≈ø≈øion, and return to the re≈øult of the council at the mouth of the river. We concluded to coa≈øt it round the lake, and in two days we came to the mouth of the Miami of the Lake, and landed on cedar point, where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ≈øeveral days. Here we held a council, and concluded we would take a driving hunt in concert, and in partner≈øhip<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
            </p>
            <p>The river in this place is about a mile broad, and as it and the lake forms a kind of neck, which terminates in a point, all the hunters (which were fifty-three) went up the river, and we ≈øcattered our≈øelves from the river to the lake. When we fir≈øt began to move we were not in ≈øight of each other, but as we all rai≈øed the yell, we could move regularly together by the noi≈øe. At length we came in ≈øight of each other and appeared to be marching in good order; before we came to the point, both the ≈øquaws and boys in the canoes were ≈øcattered up the river, and along the lake, to prevent the deer from making their e≈øcape by water. As we advanced near the point the guns began to crack ≈ølowly; and after ≈øome time the firing was like a little engagement. The ≈øquaws and boys were bu≈øy toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawking the deer in the water, and we ≈øhooting them down on the land:‚ÄîWe killed in all about thirty deer: tho a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny made their e≈øcape by water.</p>
            <p>We had now great fea≈øting and rejoicing, as we had plenty of homony, veni≈øon, and wild fowl. The gee≈øe at this time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be preparing to move ≈øouthward‚ÄîIt might be a≈øked what is meant by the gee≈øe preparing to move? The Indians repre≈øent them as holding a great council at this time concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weather in order to conclude upon a day, that they may all at or near one time leave the Northern Lakes, and wing their way to the ≈øouthern bays. When matters are brought to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion and the time appointed that they are to take wing, then they ≈øay, a great number of expre≈ø≈øes are ≈øent off, in order to let the different tribes know the re≈øult of this council, that they may be all in readine≈øs to move at the time appointed. As there is a great commotion among the gee≈øe at this time, it would appear by their actions, that ≈øuch a council had been held. Certain it is, that they are led by in≈øtict to act in concert and to move off regularly after their leaders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:036317_0047_1008DC277AAFCDC0"/>Here our company ≈øeparated. The chief part of them went up the Miami river, that empties into Lake Erie, at cedar point, whil≈øt we proceeded on our journey in company with Tecaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retanego, Tontileaugo, and two families of the Wiandots.</p>
            <p>As cold weather was now approaching, we began to feel the doleful effects of extravagantly and fooli≈øhly ≈øpending the large quantity of beaver we had taken in our la≈øt winters hunt. We were all nearly in the ≈øame circum≈øtances‚Äî≈øcarcely one had a ≈øhirt to his back; but each of us had an old blanket which we belted round us in the day, and ≈ølept in at night, with a deer or bear ≈økin under us for our bed.</p>
            <p>When we came to to the falls of Sandu≈øky, we buried our birch bark canoes as u≈øual, at a large burying place for that purpo≈øe, a little below the falls. At this place the river falls about eight feet over a rock, but not perpendicular. With much difficulty we pu≈øhed up our wooden canoes, ≈øome of us went up the river, and the re≈øt by land with the hor≈øes, until we came to the great meadows or prairies that lie between Sandu≈øky and Sciota.</p>
            <p>When we came to this place we met with ≈øome Ottawa hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and agreed with them to take, what they call a ring hunt, in partner≈øhip. We waited until we expected rain was near falling to extingui≈øh the fire, and then we kindled a large circle in the prairie. At this time, or before the bucks began to run a great number of deer lay concealed in the gra≈øs, in the day, and moved about in the night; but as the fire burned in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the centre of the circle, the deer fled before the fire: the Indians were ≈øcattered al≈øo at ≈øome di≈øtance before the fire, and ≈øhot them down every opportunity, which was very frequent, e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as the circle became ≈ømall. When we came to divide the deer, there were above ten to each hunter, which were all killed in a few hours. The rain did not come on that night to put out the out-≈øide circle of the fire, and as the wind aro≈øe, it extended thro the whole prairie which was about fifty miles in length, and in ≈øome places near twenty in breadth. This put an end to our ring hunting this ≈øea≈øon, and was in other re≈øpects an injury to us in the hunting bu≈øine≈øs; ≈øo that upon the whole we received more harm that benefit by our rapid hunting frolic. We then moved from the north end of the glades, and excamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the carrying place.</p>
            <p>This place is in the plains betwixt a creek that empties into Sandu≈øky, and one that runs into Sciota: and at the time of high water, or in the ≈øpring ≈øea≈øon, there is but about one half mile of portage, and that very level, and clear of rocks, timber or ≈øtones; ≈øo that with a little digging there may be water car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage the whole way from Sciota to Lake Erie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:036317_0048_1008DC2A09D44BE0"/>From the mouth of Sandu≈øky to the falls is chiefly fir≈øt rate land, lying flat or level, intermixed with large bodies of clear meadows, where the gra≈øs is exceeding rank, and in many places three or four feet high. The timber is oak, hickory, walnut, cherry black-a≈øh, elm, ≈øugar-tree, buckeye, locu≈øt and beech. In ≈øome places there is wet timber land‚Äîthe timber in the≈øe places is chiefly water-a≈øh, ≈øycamore, or button-wood.</p>
            <p>From the falls to the prairies, the land lies well to the ≈øun, it is neither too flat nor too hilly‚Äîand chiefly fir≈øt rate. The timber nearly the ≈øame as below the falls, excepting the water-a≈øh.‚ÄîThere is al≈øo here, ≈øome plats of beech land, that appears to be ≈øecond rate, as it frequently produces ≈øpice-wood. The prairie appears to be a tolerable fertile ≈øoil, tho in many places too wet for cultivation; yet I apprehend it would produce tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, were it only kept from fire.</p>
            <p>The Indians are of the opinion that the ≈øquirrels plant all the timber; as they bury a number of nuts for food, and only one at a place. When a ≈øquirrel is killed the various kinds of nuts thus buried will grow.</p>
            <p>I have ob≈øerved that when the≈øe prairies have only e≈øcaped fire for one year, near where a ≈øingle tree ≈øtood, there was a young growth of timber ≈øuppo≈øed to be planted by the ≈øquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels; but when the prairies were again burned, all this young growth was immediately con≈øumed; as the fire rages in the gra≈øs, to ≈øuch a pitch, that numbers of racoons are thereby burned to death.</p>
            <p>On the we≈øt ≈øide of the prairie, or betwixt that and Sciota, there is a large body of fir≈øt rate land‚Äîthe timber, walnut, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øt, ≈øugar-tree, buckeye, cherry, a≈øh, elm, mulberry, plumb-trees, ≈øpicewood, black-haw red-haw, oak and hickory.</p>
            <p>About the time the bucks quit running, Tontileaugo his wife and children, Tecaughretanego, his ≈øon Nungany and my≈øelf left the Wiandot camps at the carrying place, and cro≈ø≈øed the Sciota river at the ≈øouth end of the glades, and proceeded on about a ≈øouth-we≈øt cour≈øe to a large creek called Ollen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangy, which I believe interlocks with the waters of the Miami, and empties into Sciota on the we≈øt ≈øide thereof, From the ≈øouth end of the prairie to Ollentangy, there is a large quantity of beech land, intermixed with fir≈øt rate land. Here we made our winter hut, and had con≈øiderable ≈øucce≈øs in hunting.</p>
            <p>After ≈øome time one of Tontileaugo's ≈øtep-≈øons, (a lad about eight years of age) offended him, and he gave the boy a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate whipping, which much di≈øplea≈øed his Wiandot wife. She acknowledged that the boy was guilty of a fault, but thought that he ought to have been ducked, which is their u≈øual mode of cha≈øti≈øement. She ≈øaid ≈øhe could not bear to have her ≈øon
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036317_0049_1008DC2CCBB3E150"/>
whipped like a ≈øervant or ≈ølave‚Äîand ≈øhe was ≈øo di≈øplea≈øed that when Tontileaugo went out to hunt, ≈øhe got her two hor≈øes, and all her effects, (as in this country the hu≈øband and wife have ≈øeparate intere≈øts) and moved back to the Wiandot camps that we had left.</p>
            <p>When Tontileaugo returned, he was much di≈øturbed on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wife's elopement, and ≈øaid that he would never go after her were it not that he was afraid that ≈øhe would get bewildered, and that his children that ≈øhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with her, might ≈øuffer. Tontileaugo went after his wife, and when they met they made up the quarrel, and he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; but left Tecaughretanego and his ≈øon, (a boy about ten years of age) and my≈øelf, who remained here in our hut all winter.</p>
            <p>Tecaughretanego who had been a fir≈øt-rate warior, ≈øtate≈øman and hunter; and though he was now near ≈øixty years of age, he was yet equal to the common run of hunters, but ≈øubject to the rheumati≈øm, which deprived him of the u≈øe of his legs.</p>
            <p>Shortly after Tontileaugo left us, Tecaughretanego became lame, and could ≈øcarcely walk out of our hut for two months. I had con≈øiderable ≈øucce≈øs in hunting and trapping. Though Tecaughretanego endured much pain and mi≈øery, yet he bore it all with wonderful patience, and would often endeavor to entertain me with chearful conver≈øation. Sometimes he would applaud me for my diligence, ≈økill and activity‚Äîand at other times he would take great care in giving me in≈øtructions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the hunting and trapping bu≈øine≈øs. He would al≈øo tell me that if I failed of ≈øucce≈øs, we would ≈øuffer very much, as we were about forty miles from any one living, that we knew of; yet he would not intimate that he apprehended we were in any danger, but ≈øtill ≈øuppo≈øed that I was fully adequate to the ta≈øk.</p>
            <p>"Tontileaugo left us a little before Chri≈øtmas, and from that until ≈øome time in February, we had always plenty of bear meat, veni≈øon, &amp;c. During this time I killed much more than we could u≈øe, but having no hor≈øes to carry in what I killed, I left part of it in the woods. In February there came a ≈ønow, with a cru≈øt, which made a great noi≈øe when walking on it, and frightened away the deer; and as bear and beaver were ≈øcarce here, we got entirely out of provi≈øion. After I had hunted two days without eating any thing, and had very ≈øhort allowance for ≈øome days before, I returned late in the evening faint and weary. When I came into our hut, Tecaughretanego a≈øked what ≈øucce≈øs? I told him not any. He a≈øked me if I was not very hungry? I replied that the keen appetite ≈øeemed to be in ≈øome mea≈øure removed, but I was both faint and weary. He commanded Nunganey his little ≈øon, to bring me ≈øomething to
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036317_0050_1008DC3104CE58C0"/>
eat, and he brought me a kettle with ≈øome bones and broth,‚Äî after eating a few mouthfuls my appetite violently returned, and I thought the victuals had a mo≈øt agreable reli≈øh, though it was only fox and wild-cat bones, which lay about the camp, which the ravens and turkey-buzzards had picked‚Äîthe≈øe Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganey had collected and boiled, until the ≈øinews that remained on the bones would ≈øtrip off. I ≈øpeedily fini≈øhed my allowance, ≈øuch as it was, and when I had ended my <hi>sweet</hi> repa≈øt, Tecaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retanego a≈øked me how I felt? I told him that I was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre≈øhed. He then handed me his pipe and pouch, and told me to take a ≈ømoke. I did ≈øo. He then ≈øaid he had ≈øomething of importance to tell me, if I was now compo≈øed and ready to hear it. I told him that I was ready to hear him. He ≈øaid the rea≈øon why he deferred his ≈øpeech till now, was becau≈øe few men are in a right humor to hear good talk, when they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hungry, as they are then generally fretful and di≈øcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed; but as you appear now to enjoy calmne≈øs and ≈øerenity of mind, I will now communicate to you the thoughts of my heart, and tho≈øe things that I know to be true.</p>

            <p>The next morning I went out, and ≈øteered about an ea≈øt cour≈øe. I proceeded on ≈ølowly for about five miles, and ≈øaw deer frequently, but as the cru≈øt on the ≈ønow made a great noi≈øe, they were always running before I ≈øpied them, ≈øo that I could not get a ≈øhoot. A violent appetite returned, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intolerably hungry;‚Äîit was now that I concluded I would run off to Penn≈øylvania, my native country. As the ≈ønow was on the ground, and Indian hunters almo≈øt the whole of the way before me, I had but a poor pro≈øpect of making my e≈øcape<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but my ca≈øe appeared de≈øperate. If I ≈øtaid here I thought I would peri≈øh with hunger, and if I met with Indians, they could but kill me.</p>
            <p>I then proceeded on as fa≈øt as I could walk, and when I got about ten or twelve miles from our hut, I came upon fre≈øh buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faloe tracks,‚ÄîI pur≈øued after, and in a ≈øhort time came in ≈øight of them, as they were pa≈ø≈øing through a ≈ømall glade‚ÄîI ran with all my might, and headed them, where I lay in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øh, and killed a very large cow. I immediately kindled a fire and began to roa≈øt meat, but could not wait till it was done‚ÄîI ate it almo≈øt raw. When hunger was abated I began to be tenderly concerned for my old Indian brother, and the little boy I had left in a peri≈øhing condition. I made ha≈øte and packed up what meat I could carry, ≈øecured what I left from the wolves, and returned homewards.</p>
            <p>I ≈øcarcely thought on the old man's ≈øpeech while I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt di≈øtracted with hunger, but on my return was much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, reflected on my≈øelf for my hard-heartedne≈øs and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, in attempting to run off and leave the venerable old man and little boy to peri≈øh with hunger. I al≈øo con≈øidered how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably the old man's ≈øpeech had been verified in our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially obtaining a ≈øupply. I thought al≈øo of that part of his ≈øpeech which treated of the fractious di≈øpo≈øitions of hungry people, which was the only excu≈øe I had for my ba≈øe inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in attempting to leave them in the mo≈øt deplorable ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As it was moon-light, I got home to our hut, and found the old man in his u≈øual good humor. He thanked me for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exertion, and bid me ≈øit down, as I mu≈øt certainly be fatigued, and he commanded Nunganey to make ha≈øte and cook. I told him I would cook for him, and let the boy lay ≈øome meat on the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:036317_0052_1008DC344A740E50"/>
coals, for him≈øelf‚Äîwhich he did, but ate it almo≈øt raw, as I had done. I immediately hung on the kettle with ≈øome water, and cut the beef in thin ≈ølices, and put them in:‚Äîwhen it had boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed awhile, I propo≈øed taking it off the fire, but the old man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "let it be done enough." This he ≈øaid in as patient and unconcerned a manner, as if he had not wanted one ≈øingle meal. He commanded Nunganey to eat no more beef at that time, lea≈øt he might hurt him≈øelf; but told him to ≈øit down, and after ≈øome time he might ≈øup ≈øome broth‚Äîthis command he reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly obeyed.</p>
            <p>When we were all refre≈øhed, Tecauretanego delivered a ≈øpeech upon the nece≈ø≈øity and plea≈øure of receiving the nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øupports of life with thankfulne≈øs, knowing that Owaneeyo is the great giver. Such ≈øpeeches from an Indian, may be tho't by tho≈øe who are unacquainted with them, altogether incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but when we reflect on the Indian war, we may readily conclude that they are not an ignorant or ≈øtupid ≈øort of people, or they would not have been ≈øuch fatal enemies. When they came into our country they outwitted us‚Äîand when we ≈øent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies into their country, they outgeneralled, and beat us with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior force. Let us al≈øo take into con≈øideration that Tecaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retanego was no common per≈øon, but was among the Indians, as Socrates in the ancient Heathen world; and it may be, equal to him‚Äîif not in wi≈ødom and learning, yet, perhaps in patience and fortitude. Notwith≈øtanding Tecauretanego's, uncommon natural abilitis, yet in the ≈øequel of this hi≈øtory you will ≈øee the deficiency of the light of nature, unaided by revelation, in this truly great man.</p>
            <p>The next morning Tecaughretanego de≈øired me to go back and bring another load of buffaloe beef: As I proceeded to do ≈øo, about five miles from our hut I found a bear tree. As a ≈øap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, grew near the tree, and reached near the hole that the bear went in at, I got dry dozed or rotton wood, that would catch and hold fire almo≈øt as well as ≈øpunk. This wood I tied up in bunches, fixed them on my back, and then climbed up the ≈øapling, and with a pole, I put them touched with fire, into the hole, and then came down and took my gun in my hand. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øome time the bear came out, and I killed and ≈økinned it. packed up a load of the meat, (after ≈øecuring the remainder from the wolves) and returned home before night. On my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn my old brother and his ≈øon were much rejoiced at my ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs. After this we had plenty of provi≈øion.</p>
            <p>We remained here until ≈øome time in April 1758. At this time Tecaughretanego had recovered ≈øo, that he could walk about. We made a bark canoe, embarked, and went down Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentangy
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036317_0053_1008DC3774B1BF00"/>
≈øome di≈øtance, but the water being low, we were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ≈øplitting our canoe upon the rocks: therefore Tecaughre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanego concluded we would encamp on ≈øhore, and pray for rain.</p>
            <p>When we encamped, Tecaughretanego made him≈øelf a ≈øweat-hou≈øe; which he did by ≈øticking a number of hoops in the ground, each hoop forming a ≈øemi-circle‚Äîthis he covered all round with blankets and ≈økins; he then prepared hot ≈øtones, which he rolled into this hut, and then went into it him≈øelf, with a little kettle of water in his hand, mixed with a variety of herbs, which he had formerly cured, and had now with him in his pack‚Äîthey afforded an odoriferous perfume. When he was in, he told me to pull down the blankets behind him, and cover all up clo≈øe, which I did, and then he began to pour water upon the hot ≈øtones, and to ≈øing aloud. He continued in this vehement hot place about fifteen minutes:‚Äîall this he did in order to purify him≈øelf before he would addre≈øs the Supreme Being. When he came out of his ≈øweat-hou≈øe, he began to burn tobacco and pray. He began each pretition with <hi>oh, ho, ho, ho,</hi> which is a kind of a≈øpiration, and ≈øignifies an ardent wi≈øh. I ob≈øerved that all his petitions were only for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, or pre≈øent temporal ble≈ø≈øings. He began his addre≈øs by thank≈øgiving, in the following manner:</p>
            <p>"O great being! I thank thee that I have obtained the u≈øe of my legs again‚Äîthat I am now able to walk about and kill tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys, &amp;c. without feeling exqui≈øite pain and mi≈øery: I know that thou art a hearer and a helper, and therefore I will call upon thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Oh, ho, ho, ho,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Grant that my knees and ankles may be right well, and that I may be able, not only to walk, but to run, and to jump logs, as I did la≈øt fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Oh, ho, ho, ho,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Grant that on this voyage we may frequently kill bears, as they may be cro≈ø≈øing the Sciota and Sandu≈øky.</p>

               <hi>"Oh, ho, ho, ho,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Grant that we may kill plenty of Turkeys along the banks, to ≈øtew with our fat bear meat.</p>

            <p>"Giant that rain may come to rai≈øe the Ollentangy about two or three feet, that we may cro≈øs in ≈øafety down to Sciota, without danger of our canoe being wrecked on the rocks:‚Äîand now, O great being! thou knowe≈øt how matters ≈øtand‚Äîthou knowe≈øt that I am a great lover of tobacco, and though I know not when I may get any more, I now make a pre≈øent of the la≈øt I have unto thee, as a free burnt offering; therefore I expect thou wilt hear and grant the≈øe reque≈øts, and I thy ≈øervant will return thee thanks, and love thee for thy gifts."</p>

               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:036317_0054_1008DC3A332615F0"/>During the whole of this ≈øcene I ≈øat by Tecaughretanego, and as he went through it with the greate≈øt ≈øolemnity, I was ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly affected with his prayers. I remained duly compo≈øed until he came to the burning of the tobacco, and as I knew that he was a great lover of it, and ≈øaw him ca≈øt the la≈øt of it into the fire, it excited in me a kind of meriment, and I in≈øen≈øibly ≈ømiled. Tecaughretanego ob≈øerved me laughing, which di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øed him, and occa≈øioned him to addre≈øs me in the following manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Brother,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"I have ≈øomewhat to ≈øay to you, and I hope you will not be offended when I tell you of your faults. You know that when you were reading your books in town, I would not let the boys or any one di≈øturb you; but now when I was praying, I ≈øaw you laughing. I do not think that you look upon praying as a fooli≈øh thing;‚ÄîI believe you pray your≈øelf. But perhaps you may think my mode, or manner of prayer fooli≈øh; if ≈øo, you ought in a friendly manner to in≈øtruct me, and not make ≈øport of ≈øacred things."</p>
            <p>I acknowledged my error, and on this he handed me his pipe to ≈ømoke, in token of friend≈øhip and reconciliation; though at that time he had nothing to ≈ømoke, but red-willow bark. I told him ≈øomething of the method of reconciliation with an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, as revealed in my Bible, which I had then in po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion. He ≈øaid that he liked my ≈øtory better than that of the French prie≈øts, but he thought that he was now too old to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to learn a new religion, therefore he ≈øhould continue to wor≈øhip God in the way that he had been taught, and that if ≈øalvation or future happine≈øs was to be had in his way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, he expected he would obtain it, and if it was incon≈øi≈øtent with the honor of the great ≈øpirit to accept of him in his own way of wor≈øhip, he hoped that Owaneeyo would accept of him in the way I had mentioned, or in ≈øome other way, though he might now be ignorant of the channel through which favor or mercy might be conveyed. He ≈øaid that he believed that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waneeyo would hear and help every one that ≈øincerely waited upon him.</p>
            <p>Here we may ≈øee how far the light of nature could go; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we ≈øee it here almo≈øt in its highe≈øt extent. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the ju≈øt views that this great man entertained of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, yet we now ≈øee him (though he acknowledged his guilt) expecting to appea≈øe the Deity, and procure his favor, by burning a little tobacco. We may ob≈øerve that all Heathen nations, as far as we can find out either by tradition or the light of Nature, agree with Revelation in this, that ≈øacrifice is nece≈ø≈øary, or that ≈øome kind of attonement is to be made,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036317_0055_1008DC3E938D0CF8"/>
in order to remove guilt, and reconcile them to God. This, accompanied with numberle≈øs other witne≈ø≈øes, is ≈øufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the rationality the truth of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>A few days after Tecaughretanego had gone through his ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and fini≈øhed his prayers, the rain came and rai≈øed the creek a ≈øufficient height, ≈øo that we pa≈ø≈øed in ≈øafety down to Sciota, and proceeded up to the carrying place. Let us now de≈øcribe the land on this route, from our winter hut, and down Ollentangy to the Sciota, and up it to the carrying place.</p>
            <p>About our winter cabbin is chiefly fir≈øt and ≈øecond rate land. A con≈øiderable way up Ollentangy on the ≈øouth-we≈øt ≈øide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or betwixt it and the Miami, there is a very large prairie, and from this prairie down Ollentangy to Sciota, is generally fir≈øt rate land. The timber is walnut, ≈øugar-tree, a≈øh, buckeye locu≈øt, wild-cherry and ≈øpice-wood, intermixed with ≈øome oak and beech. From the mouth of Ollentangy on the ea≈øt ≈øide of Sciota, up to the carrying place, there is a large body of fir≈øt and ≈øecond rate land, and tolerably well watered. The timber is a≈øh, ≈øugar-tree, walnut locu≈øt, oak and beech. Up near the carrying place, the land is a little hilly, but the ≈øoil good.</p>
            <p>We proceeded from this place down Sandu≈øky, and in our pa≈ø≈øage we killed four bears, and a number of turkeys. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caughretanego appeared now fully pur≈øuaded that all this came in an≈øwer to his prayers‚Äîand who can ≈øay with any degree of certainty that it was not ≈øo?</p>
            <p>When we came to the little lake at the mouth of Sandu≈øky we called at a Wiandot town that was then there, called Sunyendeand. Here we diverted our≈øelves ≈øeveral days, by catching rock-fi≈øh in a ≈ømall creek, the name of which is al≈øo Sunyendeand, which ≈øignifies Rock-Fi≈øh. They fi≈øhed in the night, with lights, and ≈øtruck the fi≈øh with giggs or ≈øpears. The rock-fi≈øh here, when they begin fir≈øt to run up the creek to ≈øpawn, are exceeding fat, and ≈øufficient to fry them≈øelves. The fir≈øt night we ≈øcarcely caught fi≈øh enough for pre≈øent u≈øe, for all that was in the town.</p>
            <p>The next morning I met with a pri≈øoner at this place, by the name of Thomp≈øon, who had been taken from Virginia: he told me if the Indians would only omit di≈øturbing the fi≈øh for one night, he could catch more fi≈øh than the whole town could make u≈øe of. I told Mr. Thomp≈øon that if he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he could do this, that I would u≈øe my influence with the Indians, to let the fi≈øh alone for one night. I applied to the chiefs, who agreed to my propo≈øal, and ≈øaid they were anxious to ≈øee what the Great Knife (as they called the Virginian) could do. Mr. Thomp≈øon, with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of ≈øome other

pri≈øoners, ≈øet to work, and made a hoop net of Elm bark: they then cut down a tree acro≈øs the creek, and ≈øtuck in ≈øtakes at the lower ≈øide of it, to prevent the fi≈øh from pa≈ø≈øing up, leaving only a gap at the one ≈øide of the creek:‚Äîhere he ≈øat with his net, and when he felt the fi≈øh touch the net he drew it up, and frequently would hawl out two or three rock-fi≈øh that would weigh about five or ≈øix pounds each. He continued at this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had hawled out about a waggon load, and then left the gap open, in order to let them pa≈øs up, for they could not go far, on account of the ≈øhallow water. Before day Mr. Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon ≈øhut it up, to prevent them from pa≈ø≈øing down, in order to let the Indians have ≈øome diver≈øion in killing them in daylight.</p>
            <p>When the news of the fi≈øh came to town, the Indians all collected, and with ≈øurprize beheld the large heap of fi≈øh, and applauded the ingenuity of the Virginian. When they ≈øaw the number of them that were confined in the water above the tree, the young Indians ran back to the town, and in a ≈øhort time returned with their ≈øpears, giggs, bows and arrows, &amp;c. and were the chief of that day engaged in killing rock-fi≈øh, in≈øomuch that we had more than we could u≈øe or pre≈øerve. As we had no ≈øalt, or any way to keep them, they lay upon the banks, and after ≈øome time great numbers of turkey-buzzards and eagles collected together and devoured them.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this we left Sunyendeand, and in three days ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Detroit, where we remained this ≈øummer.</p>
            <p>Some time in May we heard that General Forbes, with ≈øeven thou≈øand men was preparing to carry on a campaign again≈øt Fort DuQue≈øne, which then ≈øtood near where Fort Pitt was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards erected. Upon receiving this news a number of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were ≈øent off by the French commander at Detroit, to urge the different tribes of Indian warriors to repair to Fort DuQue≈øne.</p>
            <p>Some time in July 1758, the Ottowas, Jibewas, Potowatomies and Wiandots rendzvouzed at Detroit, and marched off to Fort DuQue≈øne, to prepare for the encounter of General Forbes. The common report was, that they would ≈øerve him as they did General Braddock, and obtain much plunder. From this time, until fall, we had frequent accounts of Forbes's army, by Indian runners that were ≈øent out to watch their motion. They ≈øpied them frequently from the mountains ever after they left Fort Loudon. Notwith≈øtanding their vigilence, colonel Grant with his Highlanders ≈øtole a march upon them, and in the night took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of a hill about eighty rod from Fort DuQue≈øne:‚Äîthis hill is on that account called Grant's hill to this day. The French and Indians knew not that Grant and his men were there until they beat the drum and played upon
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036317_0057_1008DC43DCF1D210"/>
the bagpipes, ju≈øt at day-light. They then flew to arms, and the Indians ran up under covert of the banks of Allegheny and Monoagahela, for ≈øome di≈øtance, and then ≈øallied out from the banks of the rivers, and took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the hill above Grant; and as he was on the point of it in ≈øight of the fort, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ≈øurrounded him, and as he had his Highlanders in ranks, and very clo≈øe order, and the Indians ≈øcattered, and concealed behind trees, they defeated him with the lo≈øs only of a few war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors:‚Äîmo≈øt of the Highlanders were killed or taken pri≈øoners.</p>
            <p>After this defeat the Indians held a council, but were divided in their opinions. Some ≈øaid that general Forbes would now turn back, and go home the way that he came, as Dunbar had done when General Braddock was defeated: others ≈øuppo≈øed he would come on. The French urged the Indians to ≈øtay and ≈øee the event:‚Äîbut as it was hard for the Indians to be ab≈øent from their ≈øquaws and children, at this ≈øea≈øon of the year, a great many of them returned home to their hunting. After this, the remainder of the Indians, ≈øome French regulars, and a number of Canadians, marched off in que≈øt of General Forbes. They met his army near Fort Ligoneer, and attacked them, but were fru≈øtrated in their de≈øign. They ≈øaid that Forbes's men were beginning to learn the art of war, and that there were a great number of American riflemen along with the read-coats, who ≈øcattered out, took trees, and were good marks-men; therefore they found they could not accompli≈øh their de≈øign, and were obliged to retreat. When they returned from the battle to Fort DuQue≈øne, the Indians conclued that they would go to their hunting. The French endeavored to per≈øuade them to ≈øtay and try another battle. The Indians ≈øaid if it was only the red-coats they had to do with, they could ≈øoon ≈øubdue them, but they could not with≈øtand <hi>Asbalecoa,</hi> or the Great Knife, which was the name they gave the Virginians. They then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to their hunting, and the French evacuated the fort, which General Forbes came and took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of without further oppo≈øition, late in the year 1758, and at this time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to build Fort Pitt.</p>
            <p>When Tecaughretanego had heard the particulars of Grant's defeat, he ≈øaid that he could not well account for his contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and incon≈øi≈øtent conduct. He ≈øaid as the art of war con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts in ambu≈øhing and ≈øurprizing our enemies, and in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from ambu≈øhing and ≈øurprizing us; Grant, in the fir≈øt place, acted like a wi≈øe and experienced officer, in art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully approaching in the night without being di≈øcovered; but when he came to the place, and the Indians were lying a≈øleep out≈øide of the fort, between him and the Allegheny river, in place of ≈ølipping up quietly, and falling upon them with their
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036317_0058_1008DC475BE5DC68"/>
broad ≈øwords, they beat the drums and played upon the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes. He ≈øaid he could account for this incon≈øi≈øtent conduct no other way than by ≈øuppo≈øing that he had made too free with ≈øpirituous liquors during the night, and became intoxicated about day-light. But to return:</p>
            <p>This year we hunted up Sandu≈øky, and down Sciota, and took nearly the ≈øame route that we had done the la≈øt hunting ≈øea≈øon. We had con≈øiderable ≈øucce≈øs, and returned to Detroit ≈øome time in April 1759.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this, Tecaughretanego, his ≈øon Nungany and my≈øelf, went from Detroit, (in an elm bark canoe) to Caughne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waga, a very ancient Indian town, about nine miles above Montreal, where I remained until about the fir≈øt of July. I then heard of a French ≈øhip at Montreal that had Engli≈øh pri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on board, in order to carry them over ≈øea, and exchange them. I went privately off from the Indians, and got al≈øo on board; but as general Wolfe had ≈øtopped the River St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, we were all ≈øent to pri≈øon in Montreal, where I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed four months. Some time in November we were all ≈øent off from this place to Crown Point, and exchanged.</p>
            <p>Early in the year 1760, I came home to Canacocheague, and found that my people could never a≈øcertain whether I was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or taken, until my return. They received me with great joy, but were ≈øurprized to ≈øee me ≈øo much like an Indian, both in my gait and ge≈øture.</p>
            <p>Upon enquiry, I found that my ≈øweet-heart was married a few days before I arrived. My feelings I mu≈øt leave on this occa≈øion, for tho≈øe of my readers to judge, who have felt the pangs of di≈øappointed love, as it is impo≈ø≈øible now for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe the emotion of ≈øoul I felt at that time.</p>
            <p>Now there was peace with the Indians which la≈øted until the year 1763. Sometime in May, this year, I married, and about that time the Indians again commenced ho≈øtilities, and were bu≈øily engaged in killing and ≈øcalping the frontier inhabitants in various parts of Penn≈øylvania. The whole Conococheague Valley, from the North to the South Mountain, had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt entirely evacuated during Braddock's war. This ≈øtate was then a Quaker government, and at the fir≈øt of this war the frontiers received no a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from the ≈øtate. As the people were now beginning to live at home again, they thought hard to be drove away a ≈øecond time, and were determined if po≈ø≈øible, to make a ≈øtand: therefore they rai≈øed as much money by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections and ≈øub≈øcriptions, as would pay a company of rifle-men for ≈øeveral months. The ≈øub≈øcribers met and elected a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee to manage the bu≈øine≈øs. The committee appointed me captain of this company of rangers, and gave me the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:036317_0059_1008DC4C176526A8"/>
of my ≈øubalterns. I cho≈øe two of the mo≈øt active young men that I could find, who had al≈øo been long in captivity with the Indians. As we enli≈øted our men, we dre≈ø≈øed them uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Indian manner, with breech-clouts, leggins, mocke≈øons and green ≈øhrouds, which we wore in the ≈øame manner that the Indians do, and nearly as the Highlanders wear their plaids. In place of hats we wore red hankerchiefs, and painted our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces red and black, like Indian warriors. I taught them the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian di≈øcipline, as I knew of no other at that time, which would an≈øwer the purpo≈øe much better than Briti≈øh. We ≈øucceeded beyond expectation in defending the frontiers, and were extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by our employers. Near the conclu≈øion of this expedition I accepted of an en≈øign's commi≈ø≈øion in the regular ≈øervice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King George, in what was then called the Penn≈øylvania line. Upon my re≈øignation, my lieutenant ≈øucceeded me in command, the re≈øt of the time they were to ≈øerve. In the fall (the ≈øame year) I went on the Su≈øquehannah campaign, again≈øt the Indians, under the command of General Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrong. In this route we burnt the Delaware and Mon≈øey towns, on the We≈øt Branch of the Su≈øquehannah, and de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their corn.</p>
            <p>In the year 1764, I received a lieutenant's commi≈ø≈øion, and went out on General Bouquet's campaign again≈øt the Indians on the Mu≈økingum. Here we brought them to terms, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed to be at peace with them, upon condition that they would give up all our people that they had then in captivity among them. They then delivered unto us three hundred of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners, and ≈øaid that they could not collect them all at this time, as it was now late in the year, and they were far ≈øcattered; but they promi≈øed that they would bring them all into Fort Pitt early next ≈øpring, and as ≈øecurity that they would do this, they delivered to us ≈øix of their chiefs, as ho≈øtages. Upon this we ≈øettled a ce≈ø≈øation of arms for ≈øix months, and promi≈øed upon their fulfilling the afore≈øaid condition, to make with them a permanent peace.</p>
            <p>A little below Fort Pitt the ho≈øtages all made their e≈øcape. Shortly after this the Indians ≈øtole hor≈øes, and killed ≈øome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the frontiers. The king's proclamation was then circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating and ≈øet up in various public places, prohibiting any per≈øon from trading with the Indians, until further orders.</p>
            <p>Notwith≈øtanding all this, about the fir≈øt of March 1765, a number of waggons loaded with Indian goods, and warlike ≈øtores, were ≈øent from Philadelphia to Henry Pollens's, Cono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheague, and from thence ≈øeventy pack-hor≈øes were loaded with the≈øe goods, in order to carry them to Fort Pitt. This alarmed the country, and Mr. William Duffield rai≈øed about
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:036317_0060_1008DC4DC65BDE60"/>
fifty armed men, and met the pack-hor≈øes at the place where Mercer≈øburg now ≈øtands. Mr. Duffield de≈øired the employers to ≈øtore up their goods, and not proceed until further orders. They made light of this, and went over the North Mountain, where they lodged in a ≈ømall valley called the Great Cove. Mr. Duffield and his party followed after, and came to their lodging, and again urged them to ≈øtore up their goods:‚ÄîHe rea≈øoned with them on the impropriety of their proceedings, and the great danger the frontier inhabitants would be expo≈øed to, if the Indians ≈øhould now get a ≈øupply:‚ÄîHe ≈øaid as it was well known that they had ≈øcarcely any amunition, and were almo≈øt naked, to ≈øupply them now, would be a kind of murder, and would be illegally trading at the expence of the blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of the frontiers. Notwith≈øtanding his powerful rea≈øoning, the≈øe traders made game of what he ≈øaid, and would only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer him by ludicrous burle≈øque.</p>
            <p>When I beheld this, and found that Mr. Duffield would not compel them to ≈øtore up their goods, I collected ten of my old warriors, that I had formerly di≈øciplined in the Indian way, went off privately, after night, and encamped in the woods. The next day, as u≈øual, we blacked and painted, and waylayed them near Sidelong Hill. I ≈øcattered my men about forty rod along the ≈øide of the road and ordered every two to take a tree, and about eight or ten rod between each couple, with orders to keep a re≈øerve fire, one not to fire until his comrade had load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his gun‚Äîby this means we kept up a con≈øtant, ≈ølow fire, upon them from front to rear:‚ÄîWe then heard nothing of the≈øe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's merriment or burle≈øque. When they ≈øaw their pack-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes falling clo≈øe by them, they called out <hi>pray gentlemen, what would you have us to do?</hi> The reply was, <hi>collect all your loads to the front, and unload them in one place; take your private property, and immediately retire.</hi> When they were gone, we burnt what they left, which con≈øi≈øted of blankets, ≈øhirts, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million, lead, beads, wampum, tomahawks, ≈øcalping knives, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The traders went bach to Fort Loudon, and applied to the commanding officer there, and got a party of Highland ≈øoldiers, and went with them in que≈øt of the robbers, as they called us, and without applying to a magi≈øtrate, or obtaining any civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but barely upon ≈øu≈øpicion, they took a number of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable per≈øons pri≈øoners, (who were chiefly not any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this action) and confined them in the guard-hou≈øe in Fort Loudon. I then rai≈øed three hundred riflemen, marched to Fort Loudon, and encamped on a hill in ≈øight of the fort. We were not long there, until we had more than double as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Briti≈øh troops pri≈øoners in our camp, as they had of
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:036317_0061_1008DC512FAF1F70"/>
our people in the guard-hou≈øe. Captain Grant, a Highland officer, who command Fort Loudon, then ≈øent a flag of truce to our camp, where we ≈øettled a cartel, and gave them above two for one, which enabled us to redeem all our men from the guard-hou≈øe, without further difficulty.</p>
            <p>After this Captain Grant kept a number of rifle guns, which the Highlanders had taken from the country people, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to give them up. As he was riding out one day, we took him pri≈øoner, and detained him until he delivered up the arms; we al≈øo de≈øtroyed a large quantity of gun-powder that the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had ≈øtored up, le≈øt it might be conveyed privately to the Indians. The king's troops, and our party, had now got en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of the channel of the civil law, and many unju≈øtifiable things were done by both parties. This convinced me more than ever I had been before, of the ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil law, in order to govern mankind.</p>

            <p>When we came to the mouth of Tenne≈ø≈øee, my fellow travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers concluded that they would proceeded on to the Illinois, and ≈øee ≈øome more of the land to the we≈øt:‚Äîthis I would not agree to. As I had already been longer from home than what I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectd, I thought my wife would be di≈øtre≈ø≈øed, and think I was killed by the Indians; therefore I concluded that I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home. I ≈øent my hor≈øe with my fellow travellers to the Illinois, as it was difficult to take a hor≈øe through the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. My comrades gave me the greate≈øt part of the amuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they then had, which amounted only to half a pound of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and lead equivalent. Mr. Horton al≈øo lent me his mulatto boy, and I then ≈øet off through the wilderne≈øs, for Carolina.</p>
            <p>About eight days after I left my company at the mouth of Tenne≈ø≈øee, on my journey ea≈øtward, I got a cane ≈øtab in my foot, which occa≈øioned my leg to ≈øwell, and I ≈øuffered much pain. I was now in a doleful ≈øituation‚Äîfar from any of the human ≈øpecies, excepting black Jamie, or the ≈øavages, and I knew not when I might meet with them‚Äîmy ca≈øe appeared de≈øperate, and I thought ≈øomething mu≈øt be done. All the ≈øurgical in≈øtruments I had, was a knife, a mocka≈øon awl, and a pair of bullit moulds‚Äîwith the≈øe I determined to draw the ≈ønag from my foot, if po≈ø≈øible. I ≈øtuck the awl in the ≈økin, and with the knife I cut the fle≈øh away from around the cane, and then I commanded the mulatto fellow to catch it with the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit moulds, and pull it out, which he did. When I ≈øaw it, it ≈øeemed a ≈øhocking thing to be in any per≈øon's foot; it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ≈øuppo≈øed that I was very glad to have it out. The black fellow attended upon me, and obeyed my directions faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. I ordered him to ≈øearch for Indian medicine, and told him to get me a quantity of bark from the root of a lynn tree,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036317_0064_1008DC5BF70E8F08"/>
which I made him beat on a ≈øtone, with a tomahawk, and boil it in a kettle, and with the ooze I bathed my foot and leg:‚Äî what remained when I had fini≈øhed bathing, I boiled to a jelly, and made poultices thereof. As I had no rags, I made u≈øe of the green mo≈øs that grows upon logs, and wrapped it round with elm bark: by this means (≈øimple as it may ≈øeem) the ≈øwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and inflamation in a great mea≈øure abated. As ≈øtormy weather appeared, I ordered Jamie to make us a ≈øhelter, which he did by erecting forks and poles, and covering them over with cane tops, like a fodder-hou≈øe. It was but about one hundred yards from a large buffaloe road. As we were almo≈øt out of provi≈øion, I commanded Jamie to take my gun, and I went along as well as I could, concealed my≈øelf near the road, and killed a buffaloe. When this was done, we jirked<note n="*" place="bottom">Jirk is a name well known by the hunters, and frontier inhabitants, for meat cut in ≈ømall pieces and laid on a ≈øcaffold, over a ≈ølow fire, whereby it is roa≈øted till it is thoroughly dry.</note> the lean, and fryed the tallow out of the fat meat, which we kept to ≈øtew with our jirk as we needed it.</p>
            <p>While I lay at this place, all the books I had to read, was a P≈øalm Book, and Watts upon Prayer. Whil≈øt in this ≈øitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation I compo≈øed the following ver≈øes, which I then frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øung.</p>
            <lg n="1">

               <l>Six weeks I've in this de≈øart been,</l>
               <l>With one mulatto lad,</l>
               <l>Excepting this poor ≈øtupid ≈ølave,</l>

               <l>In ≈øolitude I here remain,</l>

               </l>
               <l>My ca≈øe for to deplore.</l>

            <lg n="3">
               <head>3.</head>
               <l>I'm far from home, far from the wife,</l>

            <lg n="4">

               <l>This doleful circum≈øtance cannot</l>

               <l>Great comfort and content.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I continued in this place until I could walk ≈ølowly, without crutches. As I now lay near a great buffaloe road, I was afraid that the Indians might be pa≈ø≈øing that way, and di≈øcover
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:036317_0065_1008DC5D893BDC70"/>
any fire-place, therefore I moved off ≈øome di≈øtance, where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained until I killed an elk. As my foot was yet ≈øore, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that I would ≈øtay here until it was healed, le≈øt by travelling too ≈øoon it might again be inflamed.</p>
            <p>In a few weeks after, I proceeded on, and in October I arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Carolina. I had now been eleven months in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and during this time I neither ≈øaw bread, money, women, or ≈øpirituous liquors; and three months of which I ≈øaw none of the human ≈øpecies, except Jamie.</p>
            <p>When I came into the ≈øettlement, my clothes were almo≈øt worn out, and the boy had nothing on him that ever was ≈øpun. He had buck-≈økin leggins, mocka≈øons and breech-clout‚Äîa bear-≈økin dre≈ø≈øed with the hair on, which he belted about him, and a racoon-≈økin cap. I had not travelled far after I came in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was ≈øtrictly examined by the inhabitants. I told them the truth, and where I came from, &amp;c. but my ≈øtory appeared ≈øo ≈øtrange to them, that they did not believe me. They ≈øaid they had never heard of any one coming through the mountains from the mouth of Tenne≈ø≈øee; and if any one would undertake ≈øuch a journey, ≈øurely no man would lend him his ≈ølave. They ≈øaid that they thought that all I had told them were lies, and on ≈øu≈øpicion they took me into cu≈øtody, and ≈øet a guard over me.</p>
            <p>While I was confined here, I met with a reputable old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who voluntarily became my voucher; and al≈øo told me of a number of my acquaintances that now lived near this place, who had moved from Penn≈øylvania‚ÄîOn this being made public, I was liberated. I went to a magi≈øtrate, and obtained a pa≈øs, and one of my old acquaintances made me a pre≈øent of a ≈øhirt. I then ca≈øt away my old rags, and all the clothes I now had was an old beaver hat, buck-≈økin leggins, mocka≈øons, and a new ≈øhirt; al≈øo an old blanket, which I commonly carried on my back in good weather. Being thus equipped, I marched on, with my white ≈øhirt loo≈øe, and Jamie with his bear-≈økin about him:‚Äîmy≈øelf appearing white, and Jamie very black, alarmed the dogs where-ever we came, ≈øo that they barked violently. The people frequently came out and a≈øked me where we came from, &amp;c. I told them the truth, but they, for the mo≈øt part ≈øu≈øpected my ≈øtory, and I generally had to ≈øhew them my pa≈øs. In this way I came on to Fort Chi≈ø≈øel, where I left Jamie at Mr. Horton's negro-quarter, according to promi≈øe. I went from thence to Mr. George Adams's, on Reed Creek, where I had lodged, and where I had left my clothes as I was going out from home. When I dre≈ø≈øed my≈øelf in good clothes, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on hor≈øeback, no man ever a≈øked me for a pa≈øs; therefore I concluded that a hor≈øe-thief, or even a robber, might pa≈øs
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:036317_0066_1008DC637B3DCD50"/>
without interruption, provided he was only well dre≈ø≈øed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ≈øhabby villain would be immediately detected.</p>
            <p>I returned home to Conococheague, in the fall 1767. When I arrived, I found that my wife and friends had de≈øpaired of ever ≈øeeing me again, as they had heard that I was killed by the Indians, and my hor≈øe brought into one of the Cherokee towns.</p>
            <p>In the year 1769, the Indians again made incur≈øions on the frontiers; yet, the traders continued carrying goods and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ≈øtores to them. The frontiers took the alarm, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of per≈øons collected, de≈øtroyed and plundered a quantity of their powder, lead, &amp;c. in Bedford county. Shortly after this, ≈øome of the≈øe per≈øons, with others, were apprehended and laid in irons in the guard-hou≈øe in Fort Bedford, on ≈øu≈øpicion of being the perpetrators of this crime.</p>
            <p>Though I did not altogether approve of the conduct of this new club of black-boys, yet I concluded that they ≈øhould not lie in irons in the guard-hou≈øe, or remain in confinement, by arbitrary or military power. I re≈øolved therefore, if po≈ø≈øible, to relea≈øe them, if they even ≈øhould be tried by the civil law afterwards. I collected eighteen of my old black-boys, that I had ≈øeen tried in the Indian war, &amp;c. I did not de≈øire a large party, le≈øt they ≈øhould be too much alarmed at Bedford, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly prepare for us. We marched along the public road in day-light, and made no ≈øecret of our de≈øign:‚ÄîWe told tho≈øe whom we met, that we were going to take Fort Bedford, which appeared to them a very unlikely ≈øtory. Before this I made it known to one William Thomp≈øon, a man whom I could tru≈øt, and who lived there: him I employed as a ≈øpy, and ≈øent him along on hor≈øe-back, before, with orders to meet me at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place near Bedford, one hour before day. The next day a little before ≈øun-≈øet we encamped near the cro≈ø≈øings of Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata, about fourteen miles from Bedford, and erected tents, as though we intended ≈øtaying all night, and not a man in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany knew to the contrary, ≈øave my≈øelf. Knowing that they would hear this in Bedford, and wi≈øhing it to be the ca≈øe, I thought to ≈øurprize them, by ≈øtealing a march.</p>
            <p>As the moon ro≈øe about eleven o'clock, I ordered my boys to march, and we went on at the rate of five miles an hour, until we met Thomp≈øon at the place appointed. He told us that the commanding officer had frequently heard of us by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and had ordered thirty men upon guard. He ≈øaid they knew our number, and only made game of the notion of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen men coming to re≈øcue the pri≈øoners, but they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect us until towards the middle of the day. I a≈øked him if the gate was open? He ≈øaid it was then ≈øhut, but he expected they would open it as u≈øual, at day-light, as they apprehended no
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:036317_0067_1008DC65065206D8"/>
danger. I then moved my men privately up under the banks of Juniata, where we lay concealed about one hundred yards from the fort gate. I had ordered the men to keep a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ≈øilence, until we got into it. I then ≈øent off Thomp≈øon again, to ≈øpy. At day-light he returned, and told us that the gate was open, and three centinels were ≈øtanding on the wall‚Äî that the guards were taking a morning dram, and the arms ≈øtanding together in one place. I then concluded to ru≈øh into the fort, and told Thomp≈øon to run before me to the arms. We ran with all our might, and as it was a mi≈øty mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the centinels ≈øcarcely ≈øaw us until we were within the gate, and took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the arms. Ju≈øt as we were entering, two of them di≈øcharged their guns, though I do not believe they aimed at us. We then rai≈øed a ≈øhout, which ≈øurprized the town, though ≈øome of them were well plea≈øed with the news. We compelled a black-≈ømith to take the irons off the pri≈øoners, and then we left the place. This, I believe, was the fir≈øt Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh fort in America, that was taken by what they called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican rebels.</p>
            <p>Some time after this I took a journey we≈øtward, in order to ≈øurvey ≈øome located land I had on and near the Youhogany. As I pa≈ø≈øed near Bedford, while I was walking and leading my hor≈øe, I was overtaken by ≈øome men on hor≈øe-back, like travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. One of them a≈øked my name, and on telling it, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately pulled out their pi≈øtols, and pre≈øented them at me, calling upon me to deliver my≈øelf, or I was a dead man. I ≈øtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped back, pre≈øented my rifle, and told them to ≈øtand off. One of them ≈ønapped a pi≈øtol at me, and another was preparing to ≈øhoot, when I fired my piece:‚Äîone of them al≈øo fired near the ≈øame time, and one of my fellow travellers fell. The a≈ø≈øailants then ru≈øhed up, and as my gun was empty, they took and tied me. I charged them with killing my fellow traveller, and told them he was a man that I had accidentally met with on the road, that had nothing to do with the public quarrel. They a≈ø≈øerted that I had killed him. I told them that my gun blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or made a ≈ølow fire‚Äîthat I had her from my face before ≈øhe went off, or I would not have mi≈ø≈øed my mark; and from the po≈øition my piece was in when it went off, it was not likely that my gun killed this man, yet I acknowledged I was not certain that it was not ≈øo. They then carried me to Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, laid me in irons in the guard-hou≈øe, ≈øummoned a jury of the opp≈øite party, and held an inque≈øt. The jury brought me in guilty of wilful murder. As they were afraid to keep me long in Bedford, for fear of a re≈øcue, they ≈øent me privately through the wilderne≈øs to Carli≈øle, where I was laid in heavy irons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:036317_0068_1008DC6A20687A70"/>Shortly after I came here, we heard that a number of my old black boys were coming to tear down the jail. I told the ≈øhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff that I would not be re≈øcued, as I knew that the indictment was wrong; therefore I wi≈øhed to ≈øtand my trial. As I had found the black boys to be always under good command, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected I could prevail on them to return, and therefore wi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to write to them‚Äîto this the ≈øheriff readily agreed. I wrote a letter to them, with irons on my hands, which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ≈øent; but as they had heard that I was in irons, they would come on. When we heard they were near the town, I told the ≈øheriff I would ≈øpeak to them out of the window, and if the irons were off, I made no doubt but I could prevail on them to de≈øi≈øt. The ≈øheriff ordered them to be taken off, and ju≈øt as they were taken off my hands, the black boys came running up to the jail. I went to the window and called to them, and they gave attention. I told them as my indictment was for wilful murder, to admit of being re≈øcued, would appear di≈øhonorable. I thanked them for their kind intentions, and told them the greate≈øt favor they could confer upon me, would be to grant me this one reque≈øt, <hi>to withdraw from the jail, and return in peace</hi>: to this they complied, and withdrew. While I was ≈øpeaking, the irons were taken off my feet, and never again put on.</p>
            <p>Before this party arrived at Conococheague, they met about three hundred more, on the way, coming to their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, and were re≈øolved to take me out; they then turned, and all came together, to Carli≈øle. The rea≈øon they gave for coming again, was, becau≈øe they thought that government was ≈øo enraged at me that I would not get a fair trial; but my friends and my≈øelf together again prevailed on them to return in peace.</p>
            <p>At this time the public papers were partly filled with the≈øe occurrences. The following is an extract from the Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania Gazette, number 2132, November 2d, 1769.</p>

                        <p>Whereas, in this Gazette of September 28th, 1769, there appeared an extract of a letter from Bedford, September 12th, 1769, relative to James Smith, as being apprehended on ≈øu≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of being a black boy, then killing his companion, &amp;c. I look upon my≈øelf as bound by all the obligations of truth, ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:036317_0069_1008DC6D2E659040"/>
to character and to the world, to ≈øet that matter in a true light; by which, I hope the impartial world will be enabled to obtain a more ju≈øt opinion of the pre≈øent ≈øcheme of acting in this end of the country, as al≈øo to form a true idea of the truth, candor, and ingenuity of the author of the ≈øaid extract, in ≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that matter in ≈øo partial a light. The ≈øtate of the ca≈øe (which can be made appear by undeniable evidence,) was this: "James Smith, (who is ≈øtiled the principal ring leader of the black boys, by the ≈øaid author) together with his younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and brother-in-law, were going out in order to ≈øurvey and improve their land on the waters of Youghoghany, and as the time of their return was long, they took with them their arms, and hor≈øes loaded with the nece≈ø≈øaries of life: and as one of Smith's brothers-in-law was an arti≈øt in ≈øurveying, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo with him the in≈øtruments for that bu≈øine≈øs. Travelling on the way, within about nine miles of Bedford, they overtook, and joined company with one John≈øon and Moorhead, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe had hor≈øes loaded, part of which loading was liquor, and part ≈øeed wheat, their intentions being to make improvements on their lands. When they arrived at the parting of the road on this ≈øide Bedford, the company ≈øeparated, one part going through the town, in order to get a hor≈øe ≈øhod, were apprehended, and put under confinement, but for what crime they knew not, and treated in a manner utterly incon≈øi≈øtent with the laws of their country, and the liberties of Engli≈øhmen:‚ÄîWhil≈øt the other part, viz. James Smith, John≈øon and Moorhead, taking along the other road, were met by John Holmes e≈øq. to whom James Smith ≈øpoke in a friendly manner, but received no an≈øwer. Mr. Holmes ha≈øted, and gave an alarm in Bedford, from whence a party of men were ≈øent in pur≈øuit of them; but Smith and his companions not having the lea≈øt thought of any ≈øuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures being taken, (why ≈øhould they?) travelled ≈ølowly on. After they had gained the place where the roads joined, they delayed until the other part of their company ≈øhould come up. At this time a number of men came riding, like men travelling; they a≈øked Smith his name, which he told them‚Äîon which they immediately a≈ø≈øaulted him as highway-men, and with pre≈øented pi≈øtols, commanded him to ≈øurrender, or he was a dead man; upon which Smith ≈øtepped back, a≈øked them if they were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-men, charging them at the ≈øame time to ≈øtand off, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, Robert George (one of the a≈ø≈øailants) ≈ønapped a pi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol at Smith's head, and that before Smith offered to ≈øhoot, (which ≈øaid George him≈øelf acknowled upon oath;) whereupon Smith pre≈øented his gun at another of the a≈ø≈øailants, who was preparing to ≈øhoot him with his pi≈øtol. The ≈øaid a≈ø≈øailant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a hold of John≈øon by the arm, two ≈øhots were fired, one
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:036317_0070_1008DC7081AA0E50"/>
by Smith's gun, the other from a pi≈øtol, ≈øo quick as ju≈øt to be di≈øtingui≈øhable, and John≈øon fell. After which Smith was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and carried into Bedford, where John Holmes, e≈øq. the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, held an inque≈øt on the corp≈øe, one of the a≈ø≈øailants being as an evidence, (nor was there any other troubled about the matter) Smith was brought in guilty of wilful murder, and ≈øo committed to pri≈øon. But a jealou≈øy ari≈øing in the brea≈øts of many that the inque≈øt, either through inadvertency, ignorance or ≈øome other default, was not ≈øo fair as it ought to be; Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Deny, corroner of the county, upon requi≈øion made, thought proper to re-examine the matter, and ≈øummoning a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of unexceptionable men, out of three town≈øhips‚Äîmen who≈øe candor, probity and hone≈øty, is unque≈øtionable with all who are acquainted with them, and having rai≈øed the corp≈øe, held an inque≈øt in a ≈øolemn manner, during three days. In the cour≈øe of their ≈øcrutiny they found John≈øon's ≈øhirt blacked about the bullit-hole, by the powder of the charge by which he was killed, whereupon they examined into the di≈øtance Smith ≈øtood from John≈øon when he ≈øhot, and one of the a≈ø≈øailants being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to oath, ≈øwore to the re≈øpective ≈øpots of ground they both ≈øtood on at that time, which the jury mea≈øured, and found to be twenty-three feet, nearly; then trying the experiment of ≈øhooting at the ≈øame ≈øhirt, both with and again≈øt the wind, and at the ≈øame di≈øtance, found no effects, not the lea≈øt ≈øtain from the powder, on the ≈øhirt:‚ÄîAnd let any per≈øon that plea≈øes, make the experiment, and I will venture to affirm he ≈øhall find that powder will not ≈øtain at half the di≈øtance above mentioned, if ≈øhot out of a rifle gun, which Smith's was. Upon the whole, the jury, after the mo≈øt accurate examination, and mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, brought in their verdict that ≈øome one of the a≈ø≈øail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants them≈øelves mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily have been the perpetrators of the murder.</p>
                        <p>I have now repre≈øented the matter in its true and genuine colors, and which I will abide by. I only beg liberty to make a few remarks and reflections on the above mentioned extract. The author ≈øays "James Smith, with two others in company, pa≈ø≈øed round the town, without touching," by which it is plain he would in≈øinuate, and make the public believe that Smith, and that part of the company, had taken ≈øome bye road, which is utterly fal≈øe, for it was the king's high-way, and the ≈øtraighte≈øt, that through Bedford, being ≈øomething to the one ≈øide, nor would the other part of the company have gone through the town, but for the rea≈øon already given. Again, the author ≈øays that "four men were ≈øent in pur≈øuit of Smith and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who overtook them about five miles from Bedford, and commanded them to ≈øurrender, on which Smith pre≈øented his
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:036317_0071_1008DC7208484CE0"/>
gun at one of the men, who was ≈øtruggling with his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fired it at him, and ≈øhot his companion through the back." Here I would ju≈øt remark again, the unfair and partial account given of this matter, by the author; not a word mentioned of George's ≈ønapping his pi≈øtol before Smith offered to ≈øhoot, or of another of the a≈ø≈øailants actually firing his pi≈øtol, though he confe≈ø≈øed him≈øelf afterwards, he had done ≈øo; not the lea≈øt mention of the company's baggage, which, to men in the lea≈øt open to a fair enquiry, would have been ≈øufficient proof of the innocence of their intentions. Mu≈øt not an effu≈øive blu≈øh over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpread the face of the partial repre≈øenter of facts, when he finds the veil he had thrown over truth thus pulled a≈øide, and ≈øhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to naked view. Suppo≈øe it ≈øhould be granted that Smith ≈øhot the man, (which is not, and I pre≈øume never can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be the ca≈øe) I would only a≈øk, was he not on his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? Was he not publicly a≈ø≈øaulted? Was he not charged at the peril of his life, to ≈øurrender, without knowing for what? No warrant being ≈øhown him, or any declaration made of their authority. And ≈øeeing the≈øe things are ≈øo, would any judicious man, any per≈øon in the lea≈øt acquainted with the laws of the land, or morality, judge him guilty of wilful murder? But I humbly pre≈øume every one who has an opportunity of ≈øeeing this, will by this time be convinced that the proceedings again≈øt Smith were truly unlawful and tyranical, perhaps unparalleled by any in≈øtance in a civilized nation; for to endeavor to kill a man in the apprehending him, in order to bring him to trial for a fact, and that too on a ≈øuppo≈øed one, is undoubtedly beyond all bounds of law or government.</p>
                        <p>If the author of the extract thinks I have treated him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, or that I have advanced any thing he can controvert, let him come forward as a fair antagoni≈øt, and make his defence, and I will, if called upon, vindicate all that I have advanced again≈øt him or his abettors.</p>

to ≈øtrong pre≈øumptive evidence that it could not po≈ø≈øibly be my gun that killed John≈øon, the jury, without he≈øitation, brought in their verdict, NOT GUILTY. One of the judges then declared that not one of this jury ≈øhould ever hold any office above a con≈øtable. Notwith≈øtanding this proud, ill-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red declaration, ≈øome of the≈øe jurymen afterwards filled honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able places, and I my≈øelf was elected the next year, and ≈øat on the board<note n="*" place="bottom">A board of commi≈ø≈øioners was annually elected in Penn≈øylvania, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late taxes, and lay the county levy.</note> in Bedford county, and afterwards I ≈øerved in the board three years in We≈øtmoreland county.</p>
            <p>In the year 1774, another Indian war commenced, though at this time the white people were the aggre≈ø≈øors. The pro≈øpect of this terrified the frontier inhabitants, in≈øomuch that the greater part on the Ohio waters, either fled over the mountains, ea≈øtward, or collected into forts. As the ≈øtate of Penn≈øylvania apprehended great danger, they at this time appointed me cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over what was then called the Penn≈øylvania line. As they knew I could rai≈øe men that would an≈øwer their purpo≈øe, they ≈øeemed to lay a≈øide their former inveteracy.</p>
            <p>In the year 1776, I was appointed a major in the Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania a≈ø≈øociation. When American independence was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I was elected a member of the convention in We≈øtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land county, ≈øtate of Penn≈øylvania, and of the a≈ø≈øembly as long as I propo≈øed to ≈øerve.</p>
            <p>While I attended the a≈ø≈øembly in Philadelphia, in the year 1777, I ≈øaw in the ≈øtreet, ≈øome of my old boys, on their way to the Jer≈øeys, again≈øt the Briti≈øh, and they de≈øired me to go with them‚ÄîI petitioned the hou≈øe for leave of ab≈øence, in order to head a ≈øcouting party, which was granted me. We marched into the Jer≈øeys, and went before General Wa≈øhington's army, way-laid the road at Rocky Hill, attacked about two hundred of the Briti≈øh, and with thirty-≈øix men drove them out of the woods into a large open field. After this we attacked a party that were guarding the officers baggage, and took the waggon and twenty two He≈ø≈øians; and al≈øo re-took ≈øome of our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental ≈øoldiers which they had with them. In a few days we killed and took more of the Briti≈øh, than was of our party. At this time I took the camp fever, and was carried in a ≈øtage waggon to Burlington, where I lay until I recovered. When I took ≈øick, my companion, Major James M'Common, took the command of the party, and had greater ≈øucce≈øs than I had. If every officer and his party that lifted arms again≈øt the Engli≈øh, had fought with the ≈øame ≈øucce≈øs that Major M'Common did, we would have made ≈øhort work of the Briti≈øh war.</p>

            <p>With the≈øe, and ≈øome other letters of recommendation, which I have not now in my po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, I went to his excellency, who lay at Morri≈øtown. Though General Wa≈øhington did not fall in with the ≈øcheme of white-men turning Indians, yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed giving me a major's place in a battallion of rifle men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready rai≈øed. I thanked the general for his propo≈øal; but as I entertained no high opinion of the colonel that I was to ≈øerve under, and with him I had no pro≈øpect of getting my old boys again, I thought I would be of more u≈øe in the cau≈øe we were then ≈øtruggling to ≈øupport, to remain with them as a militia of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, therefore I did not accept this offer.</p>
            <p>In the year 1778, I received a colonel's commi≈ø≈øion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my return to We≈øtmoreland, the indians made an attack upon our frontiers. I then rai≈øed men and pur≈øued them, and the ≈øecond day we overtook and defeated them. We likewi≈øe took four ≈øcalps, and recovered the hor≈øes and plunder which they were carrying off. At the time of this attack, Captain John Hink≈øton pur≈øued an Indian, both their guns being empty, and after the fray was over he was mi≈ø≈øing:‚ÄîWhile we were enquiring about him, he came walking up, ≈øeemingly unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a bloody ≈øcalp in his hand‚Äîhe had pur≈øued the Indian about a quarter of a mile, and tomahawked him.</p>
            <p>Not long after this I was called upon to command four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred riflemen, on an expedition again≈øt the Indian town on French Creek. It was ≈øome time in November, before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders from General M'Into≈øh, to march, and then <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> were poorly equipped, and ≈øcarce of provi≈øions. We marched in three columns, forty rod from each other. There were all flankers on the out≈øide of each column, that marched a-brea≈øt in the rear, in ≈øcattered order‚Äîand even in the columns, the men were one rod apart‚Äîand in the front<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> the volunteers marched a-brea≈øt, in the ≈øame manner of the flankers, ≈øcouring the woods. In ca≈øe of an attack, the officers were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to order the men to face out and take trees‚Äîin this po≈øition the Indians could not avail them≈øelves by ≈øurrounding us, or
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:036317_0075_1008DC7E516CB180"/>
have an opportunity of ≈øhooting a man from either ≈øide of the tree. If attacked, the centre column was to reinforce what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever part appeared to require it mo≈øt. When we encamped, our encampment formed a hollow ≈øquare, including about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or forty acres‚Äîon the out≈øide of the ≈øquare there were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels placed, who≈øe bu≈øine≈øs it was to watch for the enemy, and ≈øee that neither hor≈øes or bullocks went out:‚ÄîAnd when encamped, if any attacks were made by an enemy, each officer was immediately to order the men to face out and take trees, as before mentioned; and in this form they could not take the advantage by ≈øurrounding us, as they commonly had done when they fought the whites.</p>

our way back, we met with con≈øiderable difficulties on account of high waters and ≈øcarcity of provi≈øion; yet we never lo≈øt one hor≈øe, excepting ≈øome that gave out.</p>
            <p>After peace was made with the Indians, I met with ≈øome of them in Pitt≈øburg, and enquired of them in their own tongue, concerning this expedition,‚Äînot letting them know I was there. They told me that they watched the movements of this army ever after they had left Fort-Pitt, and as they pa≈ø≈øed thro the glades or barrens they had a full view of them from the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent hills and computed their number to be be about one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand. They ≈øaid they al≈øo examined their camps, both before and after they were gone, and found, they could not make an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous attack, and therefore moved off from their town and hunting ground before we arrived.</p>
            <p>In the year 1788 I ≈øettled in Bourbon county, Kentucky, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven miles above Paris; and in the ≈øame year was elected a member of the convention, that ≈øat at Danville, to confer about a ≈øeparation from the ≈øtate of Virginia.‚Äîand from that year un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the year 1799, I repre≈øented Bourbon county, either in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or as a member of the general a≈ø≈øembly, except two years that I was left a few votes behind.</p>

               <head>ON THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE INDIANS.</head>
               <p>The Indians are a ≈ølovenly people in their dre≈øs.‚ÄîThey ≈øeldom ever wa≈øh their ≈øhirts, and in regard to cookery they are exceeding filthy. When they kill a buffaloe they will ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times la≈øh the paunch of it round a ≈øapling, and ca≈øt it into the kettle, boil it and ≈øup the broth; tho they commonly ≈øhake it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in cold water, then boil and eat it.‚ÄîNotwith≈øtanding all this, they are very polite in their own way, and they retain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, the e≈ø≈øentials of good manners; tho they have few compliments, yet they are complai≈øant to one another, and when accompanied with good humour and di≈øcretion, they entertain ≈øtrangers in the be≈øt manner their circum≈øtances will admit. They u≈øe but few titles of honor. In the military line, the titles of great men are only captains or leaders of parties‚ÄîIn the civil line, the titles are only councilors, chiefs or the old wi≈øemen. The≈øe titles are never made u≈øe of in addre≈ø≈øing any of their great men. The language commonly made u≈øe of in addre≈ø≈øing them, is, Grandfather, Father, or Uncle. They have no ≈øuch thing in u≈øe among them, as Sir, Mr. Madam or Mi≈øtre≈øs‚ÄîThe common mode of addre≈øs, is, my Friend, Brother, Cou≈øin, or Mother Si≈øter, &amp;c. They pay great re≈øpect to age; or to the
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:036317_0077_1008DC8613475D20"/>
aged Fathers and Mothers among them of every rank. No one can arrive at any place of honor, among them, but by merit. Either ≈øome exploit in war, mu≈øt be performed, before any one can be advanced in the military line, or become eminent for wi≈ødom before they can obtain a ≈øeat in council. It would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the Indians a mo≈øt ridiculous thing to ≈øee a man lead off a company of warriors, as an officer, who had him≈øelf never been in a battle in his life: even in ca≈øe of merit, they are ≈ølow in advancing any one, until they arrive at or near middle-age.</p>
               <p>They invite every one that comes to their hou≈øe, or camp to eat, while they have any thing to give; and it is accounted bad manners to refu≈øe eating, when invited. They are very tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their old mode of dre≈ø≈øing and painting, and do not change their fa≈øhions as we do. They are very fond of tobacco, and the men almo≈øt all ≈ømoke it mixed with ≈øumach leaves or red willow bark, pulverized; tho they ≈øeldom u≈øe it any other way. They make u≈øe of the pipe al≈øo as a token of love and friend≈øhip.</p>
               <p>In court≈øhip they al≈øo differ from us. It is a common thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them for a young woman, if in love, to make ≈øuit to a young man: tho the fir≈øt addre≈øs may be by the man; yet the other is the mo≈øt common. The ≈øquaws are generally very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode≈øt in their words and actions, and will often put the young men to the blu≈øh. The men commonly appear to be po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of much more mode≈øty than the women; yet I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ≈øome young ≈øquaws that appeared really mode≈øt: genuine it mu≈øt be, as they were under very little re≈øtraint in the channel of education or cu≈øtom.</p>
               <p>When the Indians meet one-another, in≈øtead of ≈øaying, how do you do, they commonly ≈øalute in the following manner‚Äîyou are my friend‚Äîthe reply is, truly friend, I am your friend,‚Äîor, cou≈øin, you yet exi≈øt‚Äîthe reply is certainly I do.‚ÄîThey have their children under tolerable command: ≈øeldom ever whip them, and their common mode of cha≈øti≈øing, is by ducking them in cold water; therefore their children are more obedient in the winter ≈øea≈øon, than they are in the ≈øummer; tho they are then not ≈øo often ducked. They are a peaceable people, and ≈øcarcely ever wrangle or ≈øcold, when ≈øober; but they are very much addicted to drinking, and men and women will become ba≈øely intoxicated, if they can, by any means, procure or obtain ≈øpirituous liquor; and then they are commonly either extremely merry and kind, or very turbulent, ill-humoured and di≈øorderly.</p>

               <head>ON THEIR TRADITIONS AND RELIGIOUS SEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIMENTS.</head>
               <p>As the family that I was adopted into was intermarried with the Wiandots and Ottawas, three tongues were commonly ≈øpoke

viz. Caughnewaga, or what the French call Iroque, al≈øo the Wiandot and Ottawa; by this means I had an opportunity of learning the≈øe three tongues; and I found that the≈øe nations varied in their traditions and opinions concerning religion;‚Äî and even numbers of the ≈øame nations differed widely in their religious ≈øentiments. Their traditions are vague, whim≈øical, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic and many of them ≈øcarce worth relating; and not any of them reach back to the creation of the world. The Wian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dots comes the neare≈øt to this. They tell of a ≈øquaw that was found when an infant, in the water in a canoe made of bull-ru≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: this ≈øquaw became a great prophetre≈øs and did many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things; ≈øhe turned water into dry land, and at length made this continent, which was, at that time, only a very ≈ømall i≈øland, and but a few Indians in it. Tho they were then but few they had not ≈øufficient room to hunt; therefore this ≈øquaw went to the water ≈øide, and prayed that this little i≈øland might be enlarged. The great being then heard her prayer, and ≈øent great numbers of Water Tortoi≈øes, and Mu≈økrats, which brought with them mud and other materials, for enlarging this i≈øland, and by this means, they ≈øay, it was encrea≈øed to the ≈øize that it now remains; therefore they ≈øay, that the white people ought not to encroach upon them, or take their land from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe their great grand mother made it.‚ÄîThey ≈øay, that about this time the angels or heavenly inhabitants, as they call them, frequently vi≈øited them and talked with their forefathers; and gave directions how to pray, and how to appea≈øe the great being when he was offended. They told them they were to offer ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, burn tobacco, buffaloe and deer bones; but that they were not to burn bears or racoons bones in ≈øacrifice.</p>
               <p>The Ottawas ≈øay, that there are two great beings that rule and govern the univer≈øe, who are at war with each other; the one they call <hi>Maneto,</hi> and the other <hi>Matchemaneto.</hi> They ≈øay that Maneto is all kindne≈øs and love, and that Matchema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neto is an evil ≈øpirit, that delights in doing mi≈øchief; and ≈øome of them think, that they are equal in power, and therefore wor≈øhip the evil ≈øpirit out of a principle of fear. Others doubt which of the two may be the mo≈øt powerful, and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep in favour with both, by giving each of them ≈øome kind of wor≈øhip. Others ≈øay that Maneto is the fir≈øt great cau≈øe and therefore mu≈øt be all powerful and ≈øupreme, and ought to be adored and wor≈øhipped; whereas Matchemaneto ought to be rejected and di≈øpi≈øed.</p>
               <p>Tho≈øe of the Ottawas that wor≈øhip the evil ≈øpirit, pretend to be great conjurors. I think if there is any ≈øuch thing now in the world as witchcraft, it is among the≈øe people, I have been told wonderful ≈øtories concerning their proceedings; but never

Some hold that following nature or their own propen≈øities is the way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and cannot be di≈øplea≈øing to the deity, becau≈øe he delights in the happine≈øs of his creatures, and does nothing in vain; but gave tho≈øe di≈øpo≈øitions with a de≈øign to lead to happine≈øs, and therefore they ought to be followed. Others reject this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion altogether, and ≈øay that following their own propen≈øities in this manner, is neither the means of happine≈øs nor the way to plea≈øe the deity.</p>
               <p>Tecaughretanego was of opinion that following nature in a limited ≈øen≈øe was rea≈øonable and right. He ≈øaid that mo≈øt of the irrational animals by following their natural propen≈øities, were led to the greate≈øt pitch of happine≈øs that their natures and the world they lived in would admit of. He ≈øaid that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and the rattle ≈ønakes had evil di≈øpo≈øitions, that led them to injure them≈øelves and others. He gave in≈øtances of this. He ≈øaid he had a puppy that he did not intend to rai≈øe, and in order to try an experiment, he tyed this puppy on a pole and held it to a rattle ≈ønake, which bit it ≈øeveral times; that he ob≈øerved the ≈ønake ≈øhortly after, rolling about apparently in great mi≈øery, ≈øo that it appeared to have poi≈øoned it≈øelf as well as the puppy. The other in≈øtance he gave was concerning him≈øelf. He ≈øaid that when he was a young man, he was very fond of the women, and at length got the venereal di≈øea≈øe, ≈øo that by following this propen≈øity, he was led to injure him≈øelf and others. He ≈øaid our happine≈øs depends on our u≈øing our rea≈øon, in order to ≈øuppre≈øs the≈øe evil di≈øpo≈øitions; but when our propen≈øities nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lead us to injure our≈øelves nor others, we might with ≈øafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty indulge them, or even pur≈øu≈øe them as the means of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
               <p>The Indians generally, are of opinion that there are great numbers of inferior Deities, which they call <hi>Carreyagaroona,</hi> which ≈øignifies the Heavenly Inhabitants. The≈øe beings they ≈øuppo≈øe are employed as a≈ø≈øi≈øtants, in managing the affairs of the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:036317_0080_1008DC8DC44892A8"/>
univer≈øe, and in in≈øpecting the actions of men: and that even the irrational animals are engaged in viewing their actions, and bearing intelligence to the Gods. The eagle, for this purpo≈øe, with her keen eye, is ≈øoaring about in the day, and the owl, with her nightly eye, perched on the trees around their camp in the night; therefore, when they ob≈øerve the eagle or the owl near, they immediately offer ≈øacrifice, or burn tobacco, that they may have a good report to carry to the Gods. They ≈øay that there are al≈øo great numbers of evil ≈øpirits, which they call <hi>Onasabroona,</hi> which ≈øignifies the Inhabiants of the Lower Region. The≈øe they ≈øay are employed in di≈øturbing the world, and the good ≈øpirits are always going after them, and ≈øetting things right, ≈øo that they are con≈øtantly working in oppo≈øition to each other. Some talk of a future ≈øtate, but not with any certainty: at be≈øt their notions are vague and un≈øettled. Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers deny a future ≈øtate altogether, and ≈øay that after death they neither think or live.</p>
               <p>As the Caugnewagas and the ≈øix nations ≈øpeak nearly the ≈øame language, their theology is al≈øo nearly alike. When I met with the Shawanees or Delawares, as I could not ≈øpeak their tongue, I ≈øpoke Ottawa to them, and as it bore ≈øome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemblance to their language, we under≈øtood each other in ≈øome common affairs, but as I could only conver≈øe with them very imperfectly, I cannot from my own knowledge, with certainty, give any account of their theological opinions.</p>

               <p>I have often heard of Indian Kings, but never ≈øaw any.‚Äî How any term u≈øed by the Indians in their own tongue, for the chief man of a nation, could be rendered King, I know not. The chief of a nation is neither a ≈øupreme ruler, monarch or potentate‚ÄîHe can neither make war or peace, leagues or treaties‚ÄîHe cannot impre≈øs ≈øoldiers, or di≈øpo≈øe of maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines‚ÄîHe cannot adjourn, prorogue or di≈ø≈øolve a general a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, nor can he refu≈øe his a≈ø≈øent to their conclu≈øions, or in any manner controul them‚ÄîWith them there is no ≈øuch thing as hereditary ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, title of nobility or royal blood, even talked of‚ÄîThe chief of a nation, even with the con≈øent of his a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or council, cannot rai≈øe one ≈øhilling of tax off the citizens, but only receive what they plea≈øe to give as free and voluntary donations‚ÄîThe chief of a nation has to hunt for his living, as any other citizen‚ÄîHow then can they with any propriety, be called kings? I apprehend that the white people were formerly ≈øo fond of the name of kings, and ≈øo ignorant of their power, that they concluded the chief man of a nation mu≈øt be a king.</p>
               <p>As they are illiterate, they con≈øequently have no written
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:036317_0081_1008DC90A7D05A30"/>
code of laws. What they execute as laws, are either old cu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, or the immediate re≈øult of new councils. Some of their ancient laws or cu≈øtoms are very pernicious, and di≈øturb the public weal. Their vague law of marriage is a glaring in≈øtance of this, as the man and his wife are under no legal obligation to live together, if they are both willing to part. They have little form, or ceremony among them, in matrimony, but do like the I≈øraelites of old‚Äîthe man goes in unto the woman, and ≈øhe becomes his wife. The years of puberty and the age of con≈øent, is about fourteen for the women, and eighteen for the men. Before I was taken by the Indians, I had often heard that in the ceremony of marriage, the man gave the woman a deer's leg, and ≈øhe gave him a red ear of corn, ≈øignifying that ≈øhe was to keep him in bread, and he was to keep her in meat. I enquired of them concerning the truth of this, and they ≈øaid they knew nothing of it, further than that they had heard it was the ancient cu≈øtom among ≈øome nations. Their frequent changing of partners prevents propagation, creates di≈øturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and often occa≈øions murder and blood≈øhed; though this is commonly committed under the pretence of being drunk. Their impunity to crimes committed when intoxicated with ≈øpirituous liquors, or their admitting one crime as an excu≈øe for another, is a very unju≈øt law or cu≈øtom.</p>
               <p>The extremes they run into in dividing the necece≈ø≈øaries of life, are hurtful to the public weal; though their dividing meat when hunting, may an≈øwer a valuable purpo≈øe, as one family may have ≈øucce≈øs one day, and the other the next; but their carrying this cu≈øtom to the town, or to agriculture, is ≈øtriking at the root of indu≈øtry, as indu≈øtrious per≈øons ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and the lazy ≈øuffer for their indolence.</p>
               <p>They have ≈øcarcely any penal laws: the principal puni≈øhment is degrading: even murder is not puni≈øhed by any formal law, only the friends of the murdered are at liberty to ≈ølay the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, if ≈øome attonement is not made. Their not annexing penalties to their laws, is perhaps not as great a crime, or as unju≈øt and cruel, as the bloody penal laws of England, which we have ≈øo long ≈øhamefully practi≈øed, and which are in force in this ≈øtate, until our penitentiary hou≈øe is fini≈øhed, which is now building, and then they are to be repealed.</p>
               <p>Let us al≈øo take a view of the advantages attending Indian police:‚ÄîThey are not oppre≈ø≈øed or perplexed with expen≈øive litigation‚ÄîThey are not injured by legal robbery‚ÄîThey have no ≈øplendid villains that make them≈øelves grand and great upon other peoples labor‚ÄîThey have neither church or ≈øtate erected as money-making machines.</p>

               <head>ON THEIR DISCIPLINE, AND METHOD OF WAR.</head>
               <p>I have often heard the Briti≈øh officers call the Indians the undi≈øciplined ≈øavages, which is a capital mi≈øtake‚Äîas they have all the e≈ø≈øentials of di≈øcipline. They are under good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and punctual in obeying orders: they can act in concert, and when their officers lay a plan and give orders, they will chearfully unite in putting all their directions into immediate execution; and by each man ob≈øerving the motion or move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his right hand companion, they can communicate the motion from right to left, and march a-brea≈øt in concert, and in ≈øcattered order, though the line may be more than a mile long, and continue, if occa≈øion requires, for a con≈øiderable di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without di≈øorder or confu≈øion. They can perform va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nece≈ø≈øary manoeuvres, either ≈ølowly, or as fa≈øt as they can run: they can form a circle, or ≈øemi-circle: the circle they make u≈øe of, in order to ≈øurround their enemy, and the ≈øemi-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle if the enemy has a river on one ≈øide of them. They can al≈øo form a large hollow ≈øquare, face out and take trees: this they do, if their enemies are about ≈øurrounding them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being ≈øhot from either ≈øide of the tree. When they go into battle they are not loaded or encumbered with many clothes, as they commonly fight naked, ≈øave only breech-clout, leggins and mocke≈øons. There is no ≈øuch thing as corporeal puni≈øhment u≈øed, in order to bring them under ≈øuch good di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: degrading is the only cha≈øti≈øement, and they are ≈øo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in this, that it effectually an≈øwers the purpo≈øe. Their officers plan, order and conduct matters until they are brought into action, and then each man is to fight as though he was to gain the battle him≈øelf. General orders are commonly given in time of battle, either to advance or retreat, and is done by a ≈øhout or yell, which is well under≈øtood, and then they retreat or advance in concert. They are generally well equipped, and exceeding expert and active in the u≈øe of arms. Could it be ≈øuppo≈øed that undi≈øciplined troops could defeat Generals Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, Grant, &amp;c? It may be ≈øaid by ≈øome that the French were al≈øo engaged in this war: true, they were; yet I know it was the Indians that laid the plan, and with ≈ømall a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, put it into execution. The Indians had no aid from the French, or any other power, when they be≈øieged Fort Pitt in the year 1763, and cut off the communication for a con≈øiderable time, between that po≈øt and Fort Loudon, and would have defeated General Bouquet's army, (who were on the way to rai≈øe the ≈øiege) had it not been for the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Virginia volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers. They had no Briti≈øh troops with them when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated Colonel Crawford, near the Sandu≈øky, in the time of the American War with Great Britain; or when they defeated
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:036317_0083_1008DC9744836928"/>
Colonel Loughrie, on the Ohio, near the Miami, on his way to meet General Clarke: this was al≈øo in the time of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh war. It was the Indians alone that defeated Colonel Todd, in Kentucky, near the Blue licks<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> in the year 1782; and Colonel Harmer, betwixt the Ohio and Lake Erie, in the year 1790, and General St. Clair, in the year 1791; and it is ≈øaid that there were more of our men killed at this defeat, than there were in any one battle during our conte≈øt with Great Britain. They had no aid when they fought even the Virginia rifle-men almo≈øt a whole day, at the Great Kanhawa, in the year 1774; and when they found they could not prevail again≈øt the Virginians, they made a mo≈øt artful retreat. Notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had the Ohio to cro≈øs, ≈øome continued firing, whil≈øt others were cro≈ø≈øing the river; in this manner they proceeded until they all got over, before the Virginians knew that they had retreated; and in this retreat they carried off all their wounded. In the mo≈øt of the foregoing defeats, they fought with an inferior number, though in this, I believe it was not the ca≈øe.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more unju≈øtly repre≈øented than the different accounts we have had of their number from time to time, both by their own computations, and that of the Briti≈øh. While I was among them, I ≈øaw the account of the number, that they in tho≈øe parts gave to the French, and kept it by me. When they in their own council-hou≈øe, were taking an account of their number, with a piece of bark newly ≈øtripped, and a ≈ømall ≈øtick, which an≈øwered the end of a ≈ølate and pencil, I took an account of the different nations and tribes, which I added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and found there were not half the number which they had given the French: and though they were then their allies, and lived among them, it was not ea≈øy finding out the decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they were a wandering ≈øet, and ≈øome of them almo≈øt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the woods hunting. I a≈øked one of the chiefs what was their rea≈øon for making ≈øuch different returns? He ≈øaid it was for political rea≈øons, in order to obtain greater pre≈øents from the French, by telling them they could not divide ≈øuch and ≈øuch quantities of goods among ≈øo many.</p>
               <p>In year of General Bouquet's la≈øt campaign, 1764, I ≈øaw the official return made by the Briti≈øh officers, of the number of Indians that were in arms again≈øt us that year, which amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thirty thou≈øand. As I was then a lieutenant in the Briti≈øh ≈øervice, I told them I was of opinion that there was not above one thou≈øand in arms again≈øt us, as they were divided by Broad-≈øtreet's army being then at Lake Erie. The Briti≈øh officers hooted at me, and ≈øaid they could not make England ≈øen≈øible of the difficulties they labored under in fighting them, as England expect that their troops could fight the undi≈øciplined ≈øavages
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:036317_0084_1008DC98DE889AC8"/>
in America, five to one, as they did the Ea≈øt-Indians, and therefore my report would not an≈øwer their purpo≈øe, as they could not give an honorable account of the war, but by aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting their number. I am of opinion that from Braddock's war, until the pre≈øent time, there never were more than three thou≈øand Indians at any time, in arms again≈øt us, we≈øt of Fort Pitt, and frequently not half that number. According to the Indians' own accounts, during the whole of Braddock's war, or from 1755, till 1758, they killed or took, fifty of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for one that they lo≈øt. In the war that commenced in the year 1763, they killed, comparatively, few of our people, and lo≈øt more of theirs, as the frontiers (e≈øpecially the Virginians) had learned ≈øomething of their method of war: yet, they, in this war, according to their own accounts, (which I believe to be true) killed or took ten of our people, for one they lo≈øt.</p>
               <p>Let us now take a view of the blood and trea≈øure that was ≈øpent in oppo≈øing comparatively, a few Indian warriors, with only ≈øome a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from the French, the fir≈øt four years of the war. Additional to the amazing de≈øtruction and ≈ølaughter that the frontiers ≈øu≈øtained, from James River to Su≈øquehanna, and about thirty miles broad; the following campaigns were al≈øo carried on again≈øt the Indians:‚ÄîGeneral Braddock's, in the year 1755: Colonel Arm≈øtrong's again≈øt the Cattanyan town, on the Allegheny, 1757: General Forbes's, in 1758: General Stanwick's, in 1759: General Monkton's, in 1760: Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Bouquet's, in 1761‚Äîand 1763, when he fought the battle of Bru≈øhy Run, and lo≈øt above one hundred men; but by the a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance of the Virginia volunteers, drove the Indians: Colonel Arm≈øtrong's, up the We≈øt Branch of Su≈øquehanna, in 1763: General Broad≈øtreet's, up Lake Erie, in 1764: General Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet's, again≈øt the Indians at Mu≈økingum, in 1764: Lord Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's, in 1774: General M'Into≈øh's, in 1778: Colonel Crawford's, ≈øhortly after his, General Clarke's, in 1778‚Äî1780: Colonel Bowman's, in 1779: General Clarke's, in 1782‚Äîagain≈øt the Waba≈øh, in 1786: General Logan's again≈øt the Shawanees, in 1786: General Wilkin≈øon's, in‚Äî: Colonel Harmer's, in 1790: and General St. Clair's in 1791; which, in all, are twenty-two campaigns, be≈øide ≈ømaller expeditions, ≈øuch as the French Creek expedition, Colonels Edwards's, Loughric's, &amp;c. All the≈øe were exclu≈øive of the number of men that were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally employed as ≈øcouting parties, and in erecting forts, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øtations, &amp;c. When we take the foregoing occurrences into con≈øideration, may we not rea≈øonably conclude, that they are the be≈øt di≈øciplined troops in the known world? Is it not the be≈øt di≈øcipline that has the greate≈øt tendency to annoy the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and ≈øave their own men? I apprehend that the Indian di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:036317_0085_1008DC9C50466D78"/>
is as well calculated to an≈øwer the purpo≈øe in the woods of America, as the Briti≈øh di≈øcipline in Flanders: and Briti≈øh di≈øcipline, in the woods, is the way to have men ≈ølaughtered, with ≈øcarcely any chance of defending them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>Let us take a view of the benefits we have received, by what little we have learned of their art of war, which co≈øt us dear, and the lo≈øs we have ≈øu≈øtained for want of it, and then ≈øee if it will not be well worth our while to retain what we have, and al≈øo to endeavor to improve in this nece≈ø≈øary branch of bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. Though we have made con≈øiderable proficiency in this line, and in ≈øome re≈øpects out-do them, <hi>viz.</hi> as mark≈ømen, and in cutting our rifles, and keeping them in good order; yet, I apprehend we are far behind in their manoeuvres, or in being able to ≈øurprize, or prevent a ≈øurprize. May we not conclude that the progre≈øs we had made in their art of war, contributed con≈øiderably towards our ≈øucce≈øs, in various re≈øpects, when contending with great Britain for liberty? Had the Briti≈øh king attempted to en≈ølave us before Braddock's war, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability he might readily have done it, becau≈øe, except the New-Englanders, who had formerly been engaged in war, with the Indians, we were unacquainted with any kind of war: but after fighting ≈øuch a ≈øubtil and barbarous enemy as the Indians, we were not terrified at the approach of Briti≈øh red-coats.‚Äî Was not Burgoyne's defeat accompli≈øhed in ≈øome mea≈øure, by the Indian mode of fighting? and did not Gen. Morgan's rifle-men, and many others, fight with greater ≈øucce≈øs, in con≈øequence of what they had learned of their art of war? Kentucky would not have been ≈øettled at the time it was, had the Virginians been altogether ignorant of this method of war.</p>
               <p>In Braddock's war, the frontiers were laid wa≈øte, for above three hundred miles long, and generally about thirty broad, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ≈øome that were living in forts, and many hundreds, or perhaps thou≈øands, killed or made captives, and hor≈øes, and all kinds of property carried off: but, in the next Indian war, though we had the ≈øame Indians to cope with, the frontiers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt all ≈øtood their ground, becau≈øe they were by this time, in ≈øome mea≈øure acquainted with their manoeuvres; and the want of this, in the fir≈øt war, was the cau≈øe of the lo≈øs of many hundred of our citizens, and much trea≈øure.</p>
               <p>Though large volumes have been wrote on morality, yet it may be all ≈øummed up in ≈øaying, do as you would wi≈øh to be done by: ≈øo the Indians ≈øum up the art of war in the following manner:</p>
               <p>The bu≈øine≈øs of the private warriors is to be under command, or punctually to obey orders‚Äîto learn to march a-brea≈øt in ≈øcattered order, ≈øo as to be in readine≈øs to ≈øurround the enemy,

                  <hi>Concerning Officers.</hi> They ≈øay that it would be ab≈øurd to appoint a man an officer who≈øe ≈økill and courage had never been tried‚Äîthat all officers ≈øhould be advanced only according to merit‚Äîthat no one man ≈øhould have the ab≈øolute command of an army‚Äîthat a council of officers are to determine when, and how an attack is to be made‚Äîthat it is the bu≈øine≈øs of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to lay plans to take every advantage of the enemy‚Äîto am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øh and ≈øurprize them, and to prevent being ambu≈øhed and ≈øurprized them≈øelves‚Äîit is the duty of officers to prepare and deliver ≈øpeeches to the men, in order to annimate and encourage them; and on the march, to prevent the men, at any time, from getting into a huddle, becau≈øe if the enemy ≈øhould ≈øurround them in this po≈øition, they would be expo≈øed to the enemy's fire. It is likewi≈øe their bu≈øine≈øs at all times to endeavor to annoy their enemy, and ≈øave their own men, and therefore ought never to bring on an attack without con≈øiderable advantage, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out what appeared to them the ≈øure pro≈øpect of victory, and that with the lo≈øs of few men: and if at any time they ≈øhould be mi≈øtaken in this, and are like to lo≈øe many men by gaining the victory, it is their duty to retreat, and wait for a better opportunity of defeating their enemy, without the danger of lo≈øing ≈øo many men. Their conduct proves that they act upon the≈øe principles, therefore it is, that from Braddock's war to the pre≈øent time, they have ≈øeldom ever made an un≈øucce≈øsful attack. The battle at the mouth of the Great Kanhawa, is the greate≈øt in≈øtance of this; and even then, though the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans killed about three, for one they lo≈øt, yet they retreated. The lo≈øs of the Virginians in this action, was ≈øeventy killed, and the ≈øame number wounded:‚ÄîThe Indians lo≈øt twenty kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the field, and eight, who died afterwards, of their wounds. This was the greate≈øt lo≈øs of men that I ever knew the Indians to ≈øu≈øtain in any one battle. They will commonly retreat if their men are falling fa≈øt‚Äîthey will not ≈øtand cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, like the Highlanders, or other Briti≈øh troops: but this proceeds from a compliance with their rules of war, rather than cowardice. If they are ≈øurrounded, they will fight while there is a man of them alive, rather than ≈øurrender. When Colonel John Arm≈øtrong ≈øurrounded the Cattanyan town, on the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheny river, Captain Jacobs, a Delaware chief, with ≈øome war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of a hou≈øe, defended them≈øelves for ≈øome time, and killed a number of our men. As Jacobs could ≈øpeak
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:036317_0087_1008DCA3749A4F00"/>
Engli≈øh<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> our people called on him to ≈øurrender: he ≈øaid that he and his men were warriors, and they would all fight while life remained. He was again told that they ≈øhould be well u≈øed, if they would only ≈øurrender; and if not, the hou≈øe ≈øhould be burned down over their heads:‚ÄîJacobs replied he could eat fire: and when the hou≈øe was in a flame, he, and they that were with him, came out in a fighting po≈øition, and were all killed. As they are a ≈øharp, active kind of people, and war is their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ≈øtudy, in this they have arrived at con≈øiderable perfection. We may learn of the Indians what is u≈øeful and laudable, and at the ≈øame time lay a≈øide their barbarous proceedings. It is much to be lamented that ≈øome of our frontier rifle-men are prone to imitate them in their inhumanity. During the Briti≈øh war, a con≈øiderable number of men from below Fort Pitt, cro≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ohio, and marched into a town of Friendly Indians, chiefly Delawares, who profe≈ø≈øed the Moravian religion. As the Indians apprehended no danger, they neither lifted arms or fled. After the≈øe rifle-men were ≈øometime in the town, and the Indians altogether in their power, in cool blood, they ma≈ø≈øacred the whole town, without di≈øtinction of age or ≈øex. This was an act of barbarity beyond any thing I ever knew to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ≈øavages them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>Why have we not made greater proficiency in the Indian art of war? Is it becau≈øe we are too proud to imitate them, even though it ≈øhould be a means of pre≈øerving the lives of many of our citizens? No! We are not above borrowing lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage from them, ≈øuch as homony, pone, tomahawk, &amp;c. which is of little or no u≈øe to us. I apprehend that the rea≈øons why we have not improved more in this re≈øpect, are as follows: no important acqui≈øition is to be obtained but by attention and diligence; and as it is ea≈øier to learn to move and act in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, in clo≈øe order, in the open plain, than to act in concert in ≈øcattered order, in the woods; ≈øo it is ea≈øier to learn our di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, than the Indian manoeuvres. They train up their boys to the art of war from the time they are twelve or fourteen years of age; whereas the principal chance our people had of learning, was by ob≈øerving their movements when in action again≈øt us. I have been long a≈øtoni≈øhed that no one has wrote upon this important ≈øubject, as their art of war would not only be of u≈øe to us in ca≈øe of another rupture with them; but were only part of our men taught this art, accompanied with our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental di≈øcipline, I think no European power, after trial, would venture to ≈øhew its head in the American woods.</p>
               <p>If what I have wrote ≈øhould meet the approbation of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, perhaps I may publi≈øh more upon this ≈øubject, in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture edition.</p>
