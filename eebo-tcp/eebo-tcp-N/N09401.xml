            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE ſlavery of the Negroes having, of late, drawn the attention of many ſerious minded people; ſeveral tracts have been publiſhed ſetting forth its inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy with every chriſtian and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral virtue, which its hoped will have weight with the judicious; eſpecially at a time when the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mankind are become ſo much the ſubject of general atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the ſatisfaction of the ſerious enquirer who may not have the opportunity of ſeeing thoſe tracts, and ſuch others who are ſincerely deſirous that the iniquity of this practice may become effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually apparent, to thoſe in whoſe
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:011985_0006_0F87EDFFDA862170"/>
power it may be, to put a ſtop to any farther progreſs therein; it is propoſed, hereby, to republiſh the moſt material parts of ſaid tracts; and in order to enable the reader to form a true judgment of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which, tho' ſo very important, is generally diſregarded; or ſo art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miſrepreſented by thoſe whoſe intereſt leads them to vindicate it, as to bias the opinions of people otherwiſe upright; ſome account will be here given of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts of Africa, from which the Negroes are brought to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; with an impartial relation from what motives the Europeans were firſt induced to undertake, and have ſince continued this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous traffic. And here it will not be improper to premiſe, that
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:011985_0007_0F87EE009A85FA60"/>
tho' wars ariſing from the common depravity of human nature, have happened, as well among the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes as other nations and the weak ſometimes been made captives to the ſtrong; yet nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in the various relations of the intercourſe and trade, for a long time, carried on by the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, on that coaſt, which would induce us to believe, that there is any real foundation for that argument, ſo commonly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, in vindication of that trade viz. <q>
                  <hi>That the ſlavery of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes took its riſe from a deſire, in the purchaſers, to ſave the lives of ſuch of them as were taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in war, who would otherwiſe have been ſacrificed to the impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable revenge of their conquerors.</hi>

               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:011985_0008_0F87EE015A8513E8"/>
A plea which when compared with the hiſtory of thoſe times, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be deſtitute of Truth; and to have been advanced, and urged, principally by ſuch as were concerned in reaping the gain of this infamous traffic, as a paliation of that, againſt which their own reaſon and conſcience, muſt have raiſed fearful objections.</p>

and too eaſy credit is given to the accounts we frequently hear or read of their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſavage way of living in their own country; we ſhall be naturally induced to look upon them as incapable of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſtitute, miſerable, and inſenſible of the benefits of life; and that our permitting them to live amongſt us, even on the moſt oppreſſive terms, is to them a favour; but on impartial enquiry, the caſe will appear to be far otherwiſe; we ſhall find that there is ſcarce a country in the whole world, that is better calculated for affording the neceſſary comforts of life to its inhabitants, with leſs ſolicitude and toil, than Guinea. And that notwithſtanding the long converſe of many of its inhabitants with (often) the worſt of the Europeans, they ſtill retain a great deal of innocent ſimplicity; and when not ſtirred up to revenge from the frequent abuſes they have received from the Europeans in general; manifeſt themſelves to be a humane, ſociable people, whoſe faculties are as capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement as thoſe of other people; and that their oeconomy and government is, in many reſpects, commendable. Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears they might have lived happy, if not diſturbed by the Europeans; more eſpecially, if theſe laſt had uſed ſuch endeavours as their chriſtian profeſſion requires, to communicate to the ignorant Africans that ſuperior

                              <q>To form a juſt idea of the unhealthineſs of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, it will be neceſſary to conceive a country extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three hundred leagues eaſt, and more to the north and ſouth. Thro' this country ſeveral large rivers empty themſelves into the ſea; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sanaga, Gambia and Sherbro; theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the rainy months, which begin in July, and continue till October, overflow their banks and lay the whole flat country under water; and indeed, the very ſudden riſe of theſe rivers is incredible, to perſons who have never been within the tropicks and are unacquainted with the violent rains that fall there. At Galem, nine hundred miles from the mouth of the Sanaga, I am informed that the waters riſe one hundred and fifty feet perpendicular from the bed of the river. This information I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from a gentleman, who was ſurgeon's mate to a party ſent there, and the only ſurvivor of three captains command, each conſiſting of one captain, two lieutenants, one enſign, a ſurgeon's mate, three ſerjeants, three corporals and fifty privates.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>When the rains are at an end which uſually happens in October, the intenſe heat of the Sun ſoon dries up the waters, which lie on the higher parts of the earth, and the remainder forms lakes of ſtagnated waters, in which are found all ſorts of dead animals: Theſe waters every day decreaſe till at laſt they are quite exhaled and then the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia that ariſes is almoſt inſupportable. At this ſeaſon, the winds blow ſo very hot from off the land, that I can compare them to nothing but the heat proceeding from the mouth of an oven. This occaſions the Europeans to be ſorely vexed with bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and putrid lovers. From this account you will not be ſurprized, that the total loſs of Britiſh ſubjects in this iſland only, amounted to above two thouſand fivehundred in the ſpace of three years that I was there, in ſuch a putrid moiſt air as I have deſcribed.</q>

order: on inquiry why there is ſuch a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in the character given of theſe people, it appears, that tho' they are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined to be <hi>kind to ſtrangers,</hi> with whom they are <hi>fond</hi> of <hi>trading,</hi> yet the <hi>frequent injuries</hi> done them by Europeans, has occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned their being <hi>ſuſpicious and ſhy:</hi> the ſame cauſe has been the occaſion of the ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have ſometimes given to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſtrangers, who have attempted to trade with them. As the Europeans have no ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement on this part of <hi>Guinea,</hi> the trade is carried on by ſignals from the ſhips; on the appearance of which the natives uſually come on board, in their canoes, bringing their gold-duſt, ivory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which has given opportunity to ſome villainous Europeans, to carry them off with their effects, or retain them on board till a ranſom is paid. It is noted by ſome that ſince the European voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers have carried away ſeveral of theſe people, their miſtruſt is ſo great, that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult to prevail on them to come on board. <hi>William Smith</hi> remarks<note n="*" place="bottom">W.

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011985_0028_0F87EE105A6E0D60"/>
that the natives came ſeldom on board an Engliſh ſhip, for fear of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or carried off; yet at laſt ſome ventured on board; but if theſe chanced to ſpy any arms, they would all immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately take to their canoes and make the beſt of their way home.

                        <q>That theſe coaſts, which are divided into ſeveral little kingdoms, and have ſeldom any wars, is the reaſon the ſlave trade is not ſo good here as on <hi>the Gold and Slave Coaſt,</hi> where the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans

And as the policy, produce and oeconomy of theſe two diviſions of <hi>Guinea</hi> are much the ſame, I ſhall deſcribe them together.</p>
                     <p>Here the Europeans have the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of forts and factories, from whence, by means of the Negro factors, a trade is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on above ſeven hundred miles back in the Inland country; whereby great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſlaves are procured, as well by means of the wars which ariſe amongſt the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, or are fomented by the Europeans, as thoſe brought from the back country. Here we find the natives <hi>more reconciled to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean manners and trade;</hi> but, at the ſame time, <hi>much more inured to war,</hi> and ready to aſſiſt the European traders, in procuring loadings for the great number of veſſels which come yearly on thoſe coaſts for ſlaves. This part of Guinea is agreed by hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be, in general, <hi>extraordinary fruitful and agreeable;</hi> producing (according to the

difference of the ſoil) vaſt quantities of rice and other grain; plenty of fruit and roots; palm wine and oyl, and fiſh in great abundance; with much tame and wild cattle. Boſman, principal factor for the Dutch at D'Elmina, ſpeaking of the country of Axim, which is ſituate towards the beginning of the Gold Coaſt,<note n="†" place="bottom">Boſman's deſcription of the coaſt of Guinea, p. 5.</note> ſays, <q>The Negro inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are generally very rich, driving a great trade with the Europeans for gold: That they are induſtriouſly employed either in trade, fiſhing, or agriculture; but chiefly in the culture of rice, which grows here, in an incredible abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and is tranſported hence all over the Gold Coaſt.

                     <p>William Smith gives much the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the before mentioned parts of the Gold Coaſt, and adds, <q>The country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout D'Elmina and Cape Coaſt, is much the ſame for beauty and goodneſs, but more populous; and the nearer we come

In the Collection its ſaid,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Aſtley's Collection, 2. vol. p. 535.</note> That the Inland people, on that part of the coaſt, employ themſelves in tillage and trade, and ſupply the market with corn, fruit and palm wine; the country producing ſuch vaſt plenty of indian corn, that abundance is daily exported, as well by Europeans as Blacks reſorting thither from other parts. Theſe Inland peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſaid to live in great union and friendſhip, being generally well temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, civil and tractable; not apt to ſhed human blood, except when much provoked; and ready to aſſiſt one another.</q>

                     <p>NEXT adjoining to the Slave Coaſt, is the kingdom of Benin, which though it extends but about 170 miles on the Sea, yet ſpreads ſo far inland as to be eſteemed the moſt potent kingdom in Guinea.

How ſtrange muſt it then appear to the ſerious minded amongſt theſe people, (nay how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent is it with every divine and moral law, amongſt ourſelves,) that thoſe chriſtian laws which prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit fornication and adultery, are in none of the Engliſh governments extended to them: but that they are allowed to cohabit and ſeparate at pleaſure?

It is amazing, that whilſt the clergy of the eſtabliſhed church, are publickly expreſſing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that theſe oppreſſed people ſhould be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the chriſtian religion; they ſhould be thus ſuffered, and even forced ſo flagrantly to infringe one of the principle injunctions of our holy religion!</note> amongſt

                     <p>The laſt diviſion of Guinea from which ſlaves are imported; are the kingdoms of Kongo and Angola, theſe lye to the ſouth of Benin, extending with the intermediate land about twelve hundered miles on the Coaſt. Great numbers of the natives of both theſe kingdoms profeſs the chriſtian religion, which was long ſince introduced by the Portugueſe, who made early ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that country.</p>
                     <p>In the Collection it is ſaid, that both in Kongo and Angola the ſoil is in general fruitful, producing great plenty of grain, indian corn and ſuch quantities of rice that it hardly bears any price, with fruits, roots and palm oyl in plenty.</p>

The natives are generally a quiet people, who diſcover a good underſtanding, and behave in a friendly manner to ſtrangers, being of a mild converſation, affable and eaſily overcome with reaſon.</p>
                     <p>In the government of Kongo, the king appoints a judge in every particular diviſion, to hear and determine diſputes and civil cauſes; the judges impriſon and releaſe, or impoſe fines according to the rule of cuſtom; but in weighty matters every one may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the king, before whom all criminal cauſes are brought, in which he giveth ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; but ſeldom condemneth to death.</p>
                     <p>The town of Leango ſtands in the midſt of four lordſhips, which abound in corn, fruit <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here they make great quantities of cloth of divers kinds very fine and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the inhabitants are ſeldom idle: they even make needle work caps as they walk in the ſtreets.</p>
                     <p>The ſlave trade is here principally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by the Portugueſe; who carry the trade far up into the inland countries. They are ſaid to ſend off from theſe parts fifteen thouſand ſlaves each year.</p>

His works printed in that language at Rome, were afterwards tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Latin and printed at Paris, under the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of the famous Thuanus, chancellor of France, with the title of <hi>Geographica Nubienſis,</hi> containing an account of all the nations lying on the Senegal and Gambia. The other wrote by John Leo,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> a Moor born at Granada, in Spain, before the Moors were totally expelled from that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He reſided in Africa; but being on a voyage from Tripoli to Tunis, was taken by ſome Italian Corſairs, who finding him poſſeſſed of ſeveral Arabian books, beſides his own manuſcripts, apprehended him to be a man of learning, and as ſuch preſented him to Pope Leo the 10th. This Pope en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging him, he embraced the Romiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and his deſcription of Africa was publiſhed in Italian. From theſe writings we gather, that after the mahometan religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had extended to the kingdom of Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, ſome of the promoters of it, croſſing the ſandy deſarts of Numedia, which ſeparates that country from Guinea, found it inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men, who tho' under no regular government and deſtitute of that knowledge
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011985_0051_0F87EE219A535D58"/>
the Arabians were favoured with, lived in content and peace. The firſt author parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly remarks, <q>That they never made war or travelled abroad; but employed themſelves in tending their herds, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in the ground. J: Leo ſays p. 65. That they lived in common, having no property in land, no tyrant nor ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior lord, but ſupported themſelves in an equal ſtate, upon the natural produce of the country, which afforded plenty of roots, game and honey. That ambition or avarice never drove them into foreign countries to ſubdue or cheat their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Thus they lived without toil or ſuperfluities. The ancient inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Morrocco who wore coats of mail, and uſed ſwords and ſpears headed with iron, coming amongſt theſe harmleſs and naked people, ſoon brought them under ſubjection, and divided that part of Guinea which lies on the rivers Senegal and Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia into fifteen parts; thoſe were the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen kingdoms of the Negroes, over which the Moors preſided and the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were Negroes. Theſe Moors taught the Negroes the mahometan religion and arts of life; particularly the uſe of iron, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unknown to them: About the 14th, century, a native Negro called Heli Iſchia, expelled the Mooriſh conquerors; but tho'
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011985_0052_0F87EE225A638228"/>
the Negroes threw off the yoke of a foreign nation, they only changed a Libyan for a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe maſter. Heli Iſchia himſelf becoming king, led the Negroes on to foreign wars and eſtabliſhed himſelf in power over a very large extent of country.</q> Since Leo's time, the Europeans have had very little knowledge of thoſe parts of Africa; nor do they know what became of his great empire. It is highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it broke into pieces, and that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives again reſumed many of their ancient cuſtoms; for in the account publiſhed by William Moor, in his travels on the river Gambia, we find a mixture of the Mooriſh and mahometan cuſtoms, joined with the original ſimplicity of the Negroes. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by accounts of ancient voyages, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Hackluit, Purchaſe and others, that it was about fifty years before the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of America, that the Portugueſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſail round cape Bojador which lays between their country and Guinea; this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter divers repulſes, occaſioned by the violent currents, they effected; when landing on the weſtern coaſts of Africa they ſoon began to make incurſions into the country and to ſeize and carry off the native inhabitants. As early as the year 1434, Alonzo Gonzales, the firſt who is recorded to have met with the natives, being on that coaſt, purſued
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011985_0053_0F87EE231A5FD4C0"/>
and attacked a number of them, when ſome were wounded, as was alſo one of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe, which the author records, as the firſt blood ſpilt by chriſtians in thoſe parts. Six years after, the ſame Gonzales again at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the natives, and took twelve priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; with whom he returned to his veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; he afterwards put a woman on ſhore, in order to induce the natives to redeem the priſoners; but the next day 150 of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants appeared on horſes and camels, provoking the Portugueſe to land, which they not daring to venture, the natives diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a volley of ſtones at them, and went off. After this the Portugueſe ſtill continued to ſend veſſels on the coaſt of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, particularly we read of their falling on a village, whence the inhabitants fled and being purſued, 25 were taken. <q>
                           <hi>He that ran beſt, ſays the author, taking the moſt:</hi> in their way home they killed ſome of the natives, and took fifty-five more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.<note n="†" place="bottom">Collection, vol. 1, page 13.</note> Afterwards Diniſanes Dagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, with two other veſſels landed on the iſland Arguin, where they took 54 Moors; then running along the coaſt 80 leagues farther they at ſeveral times took 50 ſlaves; but here ſeven of the Portugueſe were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then being joined by ſeveral other veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Diniſanes propoſed to deſtroy the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011985_0054_0F87EE23DA5C8518"/>
iſland, to revenge the loſs of the ſeven Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe, of which the Moor's being appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fled; ſo that no more than 12 were found whereof only four could be taken; the reſt being killed, as alſo one of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe.</q> Many more captures of this kind, on the coaſt of Barbary and Guinea, are recorded to have been made in thoſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly times by the Portugueſe; who in the year 1481, erected their firſt fortat D'Elmina on that coaſt, from whence they ſoon open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a trade for ſlaves with the Inland parts of Guinea.</p>
                     <p>From the foregoing accounts it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted that the practice of making ſlaves of the Negroes, owes it origin to the early incurſions of the Portugueſe on the coaſt of Africa, ſolely from an inordinate deſire of gain; this is clearly evidenced from their own hiſtorians, particularly <hi>Cada Moſto</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1455, who writes, <q>
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">Collection, vol. 1. page, 576.</note> That before the trade was ſettled for purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaves from the Moors at Arguin, ſometimes four, and ſometimes more Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe veſſels, were uſed to come to that gulf, well armed, and landing by night would ſurpriſe ſome fiſhermen's villages; that they even entered into the country and carried off Arabs of both ſexes, whom they ſold in Portugal. And alſo That

the Portugueſe and Spaniards ſettled on four of the Canary iſlands, would go to the other iſland, by night, and ſeize ſome of the natives of both ſexes, whom they ſent to be ſold in Spain.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the ſettlement of America thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations and the captivating the miſerable Africans greatly increaſed.</p>
                     <p>Anderſon in his hiſtory of trade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, at page 336, ſpeaking of what paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the year 1508, writes <q>That the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards had by this time found that the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Indian natives, whom they had made to work in their mines and fields, were not ſo robuſt and proper for thoſe purpoſes, as Negroes, brought from Africa; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they, about that time, began to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Negroes for that end into Hiſpaniola, from the Portugueſe ſettlements, on the Guinea coaſts; and alſo afterwards for their ſugar works;</q> This oppreſſion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, had, even before this time, rouzed the zeal, as well as it did the compaſſion of ſome of the truly pious of that day; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of Bartholomew Delas Caſas, biſhop of Chapia; whom a deſire of being inſtrumental towards the converſion of the Indians, had invited into America. It is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally agreed, by the writers of that age, that he was a man of perfect diſintereſtedneſs, and ardent charity; being affected with this
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011985_0056_0F87EE255A5BE108"/>
ſad ſpectacle, he returned to the court of Spain, and there made a true report of the matter; but not without being ſtrongly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by thoſe mercenary wretches, who had enſlaved the Indians; yet being ſtrong and indefatigable, he went to and fro, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Europe and America, firmly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to give over his purſuit, but with his life. After long ſolicitation and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable repulſes, he obtained leave to lay the matter before the Emperor Charles the fifth, then King of Spain. As the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the ſpeech he made before the King in council, are very applicable to the caſe of the enſlaved Africans, and a lively evidence that the ſpirit of true piety ſpeaks the ſame language in the hearts of faithful men, in all ages, for the relief of their fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from oppreſſion of every kind, I think it may not be improper, here to tranſcribe the moſt intereſting parts of it. <q>I was, ſays this pious biſhop, one of the firſt who went to America; neither curioſity, nor intereſt prompted me to undertake ſo long and dangerous a voyage, the ſaving the ſouls of the heathen was my ſole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Why was I not permitted, even at the expence of my blood, to ranſom ſo many thouſand ſouls, who fell unhappy victims to avarice or luſt? I have been an eye witneſs to ſuch cruel treatment of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011985_0057_0F87EE261A5184B0"/>
the Indians, as is too horrid to be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned at this time.—It is ſaid that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous executions were neceſſary to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh or check the rebellion of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans;—but to whom was this owing? did not thoſe people receive the Spaniards who firſt came amongſt them with gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humanity? Did they not ſhew more joy, in proportion, in laviſhing treaſure upon them, than the Spaniards did greedineſs in receiving it?—but our avarice was not yet ſatisfied;—tho' they gave up to us their land and their riches, we would tear from them their wives, their children and their liberties.—To black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en theſe unhappy people, their enemies aſſert, that they are ſcarce human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;—but it is we that ought to bluſh, for having been leſs men, and more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous than they.—What right have we to enſlave a people who are born free and whom we diſturbed, tho' they never offended us?—They are repreſented as a ſtupid people, addicted to vice;—but have they not contracted moſt of their vices from the example of the chriſtians? And as to thoſe vices peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have not the chriſtians quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them therein? Nevertheleſs it muſt be granted, that the Indians ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main untainted with many vices uſual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

the Europeans; ſuch as ambition, blaſphemy, treachery, and many like monſters, which have not yet took place with them; they have ſcarce an idea of them; ſo that in effect, all the advantage we can claim, is to have more elevated notions of things, and our natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties more unfolded and more cultivated than theirs.—Don't let us flatter our corruptions, nor voluntarily blind our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; all nations are equally free; one nation has no right to infringe upon the freedom of any other; let us do towards theſe people as we would have them to have done towards us, if they had land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our ſhore, with the ſame ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of ſtrength. And indeed, why ſhould not things be equal on both ſides? How long has the right of the ſtrongeſt been allowed to be the balance of juſtice? What part of the goſpel gives a ſanction to ſuch a doctrine? In what part of the whole earth did the apoſtles and the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgators of the goſpel ever claim a right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the lives, the freedom, or the ſubſtance of the Gentiles? What a ſtrange method this of propagating the goſpel, that holy law of grace, which from being ſlaves to Satan, initiates us into the freedom of the children of God!—Will it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to inſpire them with a love to
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:011985_0059_0F87EE279A53E228"/>
its dictates, while they are ſo exaſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at being diſpoſſeſſed of that invaluable bleſſing, <hi>Liberty?</hi> The apoſtles ſubmitted to chains themſelves, but loaded no man with them. Chriſt came to free not to enſlave us.—Submiſſion to the faith he left us, ought to be a voluntary act, and ſhould be propagated by perſuaſion, gentleneſs and reaſon.</q>

The king applauded the biſhop's zeal; promiſed to ſecond it; but ſo many of the great ones had an intereſt in continuing the oppreſſion, that nothing was done; ſo that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in Hiſpaniola, except a few who

The ſentiments of the natives concerning the ſlave-trade, from William Smith: Confirmed by Andrew Brue and James Barbot.</p>
                     <p>IT was about the year 1551, towards the latter end of the reign of king Edward the ſixth, when ſome London merchants ſent out the firſt Engliſh ſhip, on a trading voyage to the coaſt of Guinea; this was ſoon ollowed by ſeveral others to the ſame parts;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011985_0061_0F87EE291A4E3508"/>
but the Engliſh not having then any planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Weſt Indies, and conſequently no occaſion for Negroes, ſuch ſhips traded only for gold, Elephants teeth and Guinea pepper. This trade was carried on at the hazard of loſing their ſhips and cargoes, if they had fallen into the hands of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, who claimed an excluſive right of trade, on account of the ſeveral ſettlements they had made there.<note n="*" place="bottom">Aſtley's Collection, vol. 1 page, 139.</note> In the year 1553, we find captain Thomas Windham trading along the coaſt with 140 men, in three ſhips, and ſailing as far as Benin, which lies about 3000 miles down the coaſt, to take in a load of pepper.<note n="†" place="bottom">Collection vol. 1. p. 148.</note> Next year John Lock traded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the coaſt of Guinea, as far as D'Elmina, when he brought away conſiderable quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of gold and ivory. He ſpeaks well of the natives, and ſays,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. 157.</note> 
                        <q>
                           <hi>That whoever will deal with them muſt behave civilly, for they will not traffic if ill uſed.</hi>
                        </q>. In 1555, William Towerſon traded in a peaceable manner with the natives, who made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to him of the Portugueſe, who were then ſettled in their caſtle at D'Elmina, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>
                           <hi>They were bad men, who made them ſlaves if they could take them, putting irons on their legs.</hi>

This bad example of the Portugueſe, was ſoon followed by ſome evil diſpoſed Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for the ſame captain Towerſon relates, <q>
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">Collection, vol. 1. p. 148.</note>That in the courſe of his voyage, he perceived the natives, near D'Elmina, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to come to him, and that he was at laſt attacked by them; which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood was done in revenge for the wrong done them, the year before, by one captain Gainſh, who had taken away the Negro captain's ſon, and three others, with their gold &amp;c. this cauſed them to join the Portugueſe, notwithſtanding their hatred of them, againſt the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</q> The next year captain Towerſon brought theſe men back again; whereupon the Negroes ſhew'd him much kindneſs.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. 157.</note> Quickly after this another inſtance of the ſame kind occurred, in the caſe of captain George Fenner, who, being on the coaſt with three veſſels, was alſo attacked by the Negroes, who wounded ſeveral of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and violently carried three of his men to their town. The captain ſent a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, offering any thing they deſired for the ranſom of his men; but they refuſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them, letting him know, <q>
                           <hi>That three weeks before, an Engliſh ſhip which
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011985_0063_0F87EE2A9A48BE98"/>
came in the road, had carried off three of their people, and that till they were brought again they would not reſtore his men, even tho' they ſhould give their three ſhips to releaſe them.</hi>
                        </q> It was probably the evil conduct of theſe and ſome other Engliſhmen, which was the occaſion of what is mentioned in Hill's naval hiſtory, viz. <q>That when cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hawkins returned from his firſt voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to Africa, Queen Elizabeth ſent for him, when ſhe expreſſed her concern, leaſt any of the African Negroes ſhould be carried off without their free conſent; which ſhe declared would be deteſtable, and would call down the vengeance of heaven upon the undertakers.</q> Hawkins made great promiſes, which nevertheleſs he did not perform, for his next voyage to the coaſt appears to have been principally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to procure Negro ſlaves; in order to ſell them to the Spaniards in the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; which occaſioned the ſame author to uſe theſe remarkable words. <q>
                           <hi>Here began the horrid practice of forcing the Africans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſlavery, an injuſtice and barbarity, which, ſo ſure as there is vengeance in heaven for the worſt of crimes will ſometime be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all who act or who encourage it.</hi>
                        </q> This captain Hawkins, afterwards ſir John Hawkins, ſeems to have been the firſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman who gave public countenance to this
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011985_0064_0F87EE2B5BDA18B0"/>
wicked traffic: For Anderſon before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, at page 401, ſays, <q>That in the year 1562, captain Hawkins, aſſiſted by ſubſcription of ſundry gentlemen, now fitted out three ſhips, and having learnt that Negroes were a very good commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Hiſpaniola, he ſailed to the coaſt of Guinea, took in Negroes, and ſailed with them for Hiſpaniola, where he ſold them, and his Engliſh commodities, and loaded his three veſſels with hides, ſugar and ginger, &amp;c. with which he returned home, anno. 1563, making a proſperous voyage.</q> As it proved a lucrative buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the trade was continued both by Hawkins and others, as appears from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val chronicle, page 55, where it is ſaid, <q>That on the 18th of October, 1564, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain John Hawkins with, two ſhips of 700 and 140 tuns ſailed for Africa, that on the 8th December they anchored to the ſouth of Cape Verd, where the captain manned the boat, and ſent eighty men in armour, in the country; to ſee if they could take ſome Negroes, but the natives flying from them, they returned to their ſhips, and proceeded farther down the coaſt; here they ſtaid certain days, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their men aſhore, in order, as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſays, to burn and ſpoil their towns and take the inhabitants. The land they
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011985_0065_0F87EE2C1A44B758"/>
obſerved to be well cultivated, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plenty of grain and fruit of ſeveral ſorts, and the towns prettily laid out. On the 25th, being informed by the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, of a town of Negroes called Bym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, where there was not only a quantity of gold, but 140 inhabitants, they reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attack it, having the Portugueſe for their guide; but by miſmanagement they took but ten Negroes, having ſeven of their own men killed and 27 wounded. They then went farther down the coaſt, when having procured a number of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, they proceeded to the Weſt Indies, where they ſold them to the Spaniards.</q> And in the ſame naval chronicle, at page 76, it is ſaid, <q>That in the year 1567, Francis Drake, before performing his voyage round the world, went with ſir John Hawkins, in his expedition to the coaſt of Guinea, where taking in a cargoe of ſlaves, they determined to ſteer for the Carribee Iſlands.</q> How queen Elizabeth ſuffered ſo grievous an infringement of the rights of mankind to be perpetrated by her ſubjects; and how ſhe was perſuaded about the 30th year of her reign, to grant patents for carrying on a trade from the north part of the river Senegal, to an hundred leagues beyond Siera Leona, which gave riſe to the preſent African company, is hard to account
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011985_0066_0F87EE2CDA410220"/>
for, any otherwiſe than to have ariſen from the miſrepreſentation made to her of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the Negroes, and of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, it was pretended, they would reap from being made acquainted with the chriſtian religion. This was the caſe of Lewis the 13th, king of France, who Labat, in his account of the iſles of America, tells us, <q>Was extreamly uneaſy at a law by which the Negroes of his colonies were to be made ſlaves; but it being ſtrongly urged to him, as the readieſt means for their converſion to chriſtianity, he acquieſed therewith.</q> Nevertheleſs, ſome of the chriſtian powers did not ſo eaſily give way in this matter, for we find, <q>
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">Collection, vol. 3. page 164.</note> That cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cibo, one of the Pope's principal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of ſtate, wrote a letter on behalf of the college of cardinals or great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at Rome, to the miſſionaries in Congo, complaining that the pernicious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable abuſe of ſelling ſlaves was yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; requiring them to remedy the ſame if poſſible, but this the miſſionaries ſaw little hopes of accompliſhing, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the trade of the country lay wholly in ſlaves and ivory.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the foregoing accounts, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authentick publications of this kind, it appears that, it was the luſt of unwarrantable
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011985_0067_0F87EE2D9A415BF8"/>
gain, which firſt ſtimulated the Portugueſe, and afterwards other Europeans, to engage in this horrid traffick. By the moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick relations of thoſe early times the natives were an inoffenſive people, who when civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, traded amicably with the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

                           <hi>They found more ſincere proofs of love and good will from the natives, than they could find from the Spaniards and Portugueſe, even tho' they had relieved them from the greateſt miſery.</hi>
                        </q> And from the ſame relations there is no reaſon to think otherwiſe but that they generally lived in peace amongſt themſelves; for I don't find, in the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous publications I have peruſed on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, relating to theſe early times, of there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wars on that coaſt, nor of any ſale of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives taken in battle, who would have been otherwiſe ſacrificed by the victors<note n="*" place="bottom">Note, this plea falls of itſelf, for if the Negroes apprehended they ſhould be cruelly put to death, if they were not ſent away, why do they manifeſt ſuch reluctance and dread, as they generally do at being brought from their native country?

                              <hi>The Gambians abhor ſlavery; and will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing, tho' never ſo deſperate, to avoid it,</hi>

ſome modern authors, in their publications, relating to the Weſt Indies, deſirous of throwing a vail over the iniquity of the ſlave trade, have been hardy enough, upon meer ſuppoſition or report, to aſſert the contrary.</p>
                     <p>It was long after the Portugueſe had made a practice of violently forcing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Africa into ſlavery, that we read of the different Negroe nations making war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each other, and ſelling their captives. And probably this was not the caſe, till thoſe bordering on the coaſt, who had been uſed to ſupply the veſſels with neceſſaries, had become corrupted, by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Europeans, and were exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by drunkenneſs and avarice to join them in carrying on thoſe wicked ſchemes; by which thoſe unnatural wars were perpetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the inhabitants kept in continual alarms; the country laid waſte; and as William Moor expreſſes it, <hi>Infinite numbers ſold into ſlavery;</hi> but that the Europeans are the principal cauſe of theſe devaſtations, is particularly eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by one, whoſe connection with the trade

would rather induce him to repreſent it in the faireſt colours, to wit, William Smith, the perſon ſent in the year 1726, by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican company to ſurvey their ſettlements; who, from the information he received of one of the factors, who had reſided ten years in that country, ſays, <q>

                           <p>There is a principle which is pure placed in the human mind, which in different places and ages hath had different names; it is however, pure, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from God.—It is deep and inward, confined to no forms of religion, nor excluded from any, where the heart ſtands in perfect ſincerity. In whomſoever, this takes root and grows, of what nation ſoever they become brethren in the beſt ſenſe of the expreſſion. Uſing ourſelves to take ways which appear moſt eaſy to us, when inconſiſtent with that purity which is without beginning, we thereby ſet up a government of our own, and deny obedience to him whoſe ſervice is true liberty. He that has a ſervant, made ſo wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and knows it to be ſo, when he treats him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than a free man, when he reaps the benefit of his labour, without paying him ſuch wages as are reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably due to free men for the like ſervice; theſe things, though done in calmneſs, without any ſhew of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, do yet deprave the mind, in like manner and with as great certainty, as prevailing cold congeals water. Theſe ſteps taken by maſters, and their conduct ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the minds of their children, whilſt young, leave leſs room for that which is good to work upon them. The cuſtoms of their parents, their neighbours and the people with whom they converſe, working upon their minds; and they from thence conceiving wrong ideas of things, and modes of conduct, the enterance into their hearts become in a great meaſure ſhut up againſt the gentle movings of uncreated purity.</p>

Negroes are our fellow creatures, and their preſent condition among us requires our ſerious conſideration. We know not the time when thoſe ſcales, in which mountains are weighed may turn.

He turns the channel of power, humbles the moſt haughty people, and gives deliverance to the oppreſſed, at ſuch periods as are conſiſtent with his infinite juſtice and goodneſs. And wherever gain is preferred to equity, and wrong things publickly encouraged, to that degree that wickedneſs takes root, and ſpreads, wide amongſt the inhabitants of a country, there is a real cauſe for ſorrow to all ſuch, whoſe love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſtands on a true principle, and wiſely conſider the end and event of things."

That their conduct towards their ſlaves was ſuch as gave him reaſon to believe, that either they had ſuffered a ſpirit of infidelity, a ſpirit quite contrary to the nature of the goſpel, to prevail in them, or that it muſt be their eſtabliſhed opinion, that the Negroes had no more ſouls than beaſts; that hence they concluded them to be neither ſuſceptible of religious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011985_0085_0F87EE3B1A2DB8A0"/>
nor fit objects for the redeeming grace of God to operate upon. That under this perſuaſion and from a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cruelty, they treated them with far leſs humanity than they did their cattle: for ſays he, they do not ſtarve their horſes, which they expect ſhould both carry and credit them on the road; nor pinch the cow, by whoſe milk they are ſuſtained, which yet to their eternal ſhame, is too frequently the lot and condition of thoſe poor people, from whoſe labour their wealth and livelihood doth wholly ariſe; not only in their diet, but in their cloathing and overworking ſome of them even to death; which is particularly the calamity of the moſt innocent and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; but alſo in tormenting and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them almoſt and ſometimes quite to death, upon even ſmall miſcarriages.

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:011985_0088_0F87EE3D5A2947E8"/>
overſeers often are. This is confirmed in a <hi>Hiſtory of Jamaica</hi> wrote in thirteen let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, about the year 1740, by a perſon then reſiding in that iſland who writes, as follows," <q>I ſhall not now enter upon the queſtion whether the ſlavery of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes be agreeable to the laws of nature or not, though it ſeems extreamly hard they ſhould be reduced to ſerve and toil for the benefit of others, without the leaſt advantage to themſelves. Happy Britannia where ſlavery is never known; where liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and freedom chears every misfortune. here (<hi>ſays the author,</hi>) we can boaſt of no ſuch bleſſing; we have at leaſt ten ſlaves to one freeman. I incline to touch the hardſhips which theſe poor creatures ſuffer, in the tendereſt manner, from a particular regard which I have to many of their maſters; but I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their ſad circumſtances intirely: the moſt trivial error is puniſhed with terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whipping. I have ſeen ſome of them treated in that cruel manner, for no other reaſon but to ſatisfy the brutiſh pleaſure of an overſeer, who has their puniſhment moſtly at his diſcretion. I have ſeen their bodies all in a gore of blood, the ſkin torn off their backs with the cruel whip; beaten pepper and ſalt rubbed in the wounds, and a large ſtick of ſealing wax
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:011985_0089_0F87EE3E1A2C8020"/>
dropped leiſurely upon them. It is no wonder, if the horrid pain of ſuch inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tortures incline them to rebel. Moſt of theſe ſlaves are brought from the coaſt of Guinea: When they firſt arrive, it's obſerved they are ſimple and very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent creatures; but ſoon turn to be roguiſh enough: And when they come to be whipt, urge the example of the whites for an excuſe of their faults.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe accounts of the deep depravity of mind attendant on the practice of ſlavery, verify the truth of Monteſquieu's remarks of its pernicious effects. And altho' the ſame degree of oppoſition to inſtructing the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes may not now appear in the iſlands as formerly; eſpecially ſince the ſociety ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for propagating the Goſpel have poſſeſſed a number of Negroes in one of them; nevertheleſs the ſituation of theſe oppreſſed people is yet dreadful, as well to themſelves, as in its conſequences to their hard taſk-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and their offspring, as muſt be evident to every impartial perſon who is acquainted with the treatment they generally receive, or with the laws which from time to time have been made in the colonies, with reſpect to the Negroes; ſome of them being abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtant with reaſon, and ſhocking to humanity. By the 329th act of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Barbadoes, page 125, it is enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>Griffith Hughes's account of the number of Negroes in Barbadoes. Cannot keep up their uſual number with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a yearly recruit. Exceſſive hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips wears the Negroes down in a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing manner. A ſervitude without a condition, inconſiſtant with reaſon and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural juſtice. The general uſage the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes meet with in the Weſt Indies. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human calculations of the ſtrength and lives of the Negroes. Dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which may be expected from the cruelty exerciſed upon this oppreſſed part of mankind.</p>
                     <p>WE are told by Griffith Hughes, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of St. Lucy in Barbadoes, in his natural hiſtory of that iſland, printed in the year 1750, <q>That there was between ſixty five and ſeventy thouſand Negroes, at that time, in the iſland, tho' formerly they had a greater number: That in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to keep up a neceſſary number, they were obliged to have a yearly ſupply from Africa: That the hard labour, and often
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:011985_0094_0F87EE41DA1D0F00"/>
want of neceſſaries, which theſe unhappy creatures are obliged to undergo, deſtroy a greater number than are bred there.</q> He adds, <q>That the capacities of their minds in common affairs of life are but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, if at all, to thoſe of the Europeans. If they fail in ſome arts, he ſays, it may be owing more to their want of education and the depreſſion of their ſpirits by ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, than to any want of natural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</q> This deſtruction of the human ſpecies, thro' unnatural hardſhips, and want of neceſſary ſupplies, in the caſe of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes is farther confirmed in <hi>an account of the European ſettlements in America,</hi> printed London, 1757, where it is ſaid, par. 6. chap. 11th. <q>The Negroes in our colonies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a ſlavery more compleat, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with far worſe circumſtances, than what any people in their condition ſuffer in any other part of the world or have ſuffered in any other period of time: Proofs of this are not wanting. The prodigious waſte which we experience in this unhappy part of our ſpecies, is a full and melancholy evidence of this truth. The iſland of Barbadoes (the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes upon which do not amount to eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand) notwithſtanding all the means which they uſe to encreaſe them, by propagation, and that the climate is
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:011985_0095_0F87EE429A22C3F0"/>
in every reſpect (expect that of being more wholeſome) exactly reſembling the climate from whence they come; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, Barbadoes lies under a neceſſity of an annual recruit of five thouſand ſlaves, to keep up the ſtock at the number I have mentioned. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious failure, which is at leaſt in the ſame proportion in all our iſlands, ſhews demonſtratively that ſome uncommon and unſupportable hardſhip lies upon the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, which wears them down in ſuch a ſurpriſing manner.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In an account of part of North America, publiſhed by Thomas Jeffery 1761, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſpeaking of the uſage the Negroes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the Weſt India iſlands, ſays, <q>It is impoſſible for a human heart to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſervitude of theſe dregs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, without in ſome meaſure feeling for their miſery, which ends but with their lives.—Nothing can be more wretched than the condition of this people. One would imagine, they were framed to be the diſgrace of the human ſpecies, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their country, and deprived of that bleſſing liberty, on which all other nations ſet the greateſt value; they are in a meaſure reduced to the condition of beaſts of burden. In general a few roots, potatoes eſpecially, are their food, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:011985_0096_0F87EE435A20A110"/>
two rags, which neither ſcreen them from the heat of the day, nor the extraordinary coolneſs of the night, all their covering; their ſleep very ſhort; their labour almoſt continual: they receive no wages, but have twenty laſhes for the ſmalleſt fault.</q> 
                        <hi>A thoughtful</hi> perſon, who had an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obſerving the miſerable condition of the Negroes, in one of our Weſt India iſlands, writes thus, <q>I met with daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to ſee the treatment which thoſe miſerable wretches met with, from their maſters; with but few exceptions. They whip them moſt unmercifully on ſmall occaſions: you will ſee their bodies all whaled and ſcarred; in ſhort, they ſeem to ſet no other value on their lives, than as they coſt them ſo much money, and are reſtrained from killing them, when angry, by no worthier conſideration, than that they loſe ſo much. They act as though they did not look upon them as a race of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man creatures, who have reaſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of misfortunes; but as beaſts, like oxen, who are ſtubborn, hardy and ſenſeleſs; fit for burdens and deſigned to bear them: they wont allow them to have any claim to human privileges, or ſcarce indeed, to be regarded as the work of God. Though it was conſiſtent with the juſtice of our maker to pronounce
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:011985_0097_0F87EE441A1FE1A8"/>
the ſentence on our common parent, and through him on all ſucceeding genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>That he and they ſhould eat their bread by the ſweat of their brows:</hi> yet does it not ſtand recorded by the ſame eternal truth, <hi>That the labourer is worthy of his hire?</hi> It cannot be allowed, in natural juſtice, that there ſhould be a ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude without condition, a cruel, endleſs, ſervitude. It cannot be reconcileable to natural juſtice, that whole nations, nay whole continents of men, ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to do the drudgery of life for others, be dragged away from their attachments of relations and ſocieties, and be made to ſerve the appetite and pleaſure of a race of men, whoſe ſuperiority has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by illegal force.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sir Hans Sloan in the introduction to his natural hiſtory of Jamaica in the account he gives of the treatment the Negroes met with there, ſpeaking of the puniſhments inflicted on them, ſays, page 56 <q>For rebellion the puniſhment is burning them by nailing them down on the ground, with crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſticks on every limb, and then apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fire by degrees from the feet and hands, burning them gradually up to the head, whereby <hi>their pains are extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.</hi> For crimes of a leſs nature, gelding or chopping off half the foot with an axe.

—For negligence, they are uſually whipped by the overſeers with lance-wood ſwitches.—After they are whipped till they are raw, ſome put on their ſkins pepper and ſalt to make them ſmart; at other times their maſters will drop melted wax on their ſkins, and uſe ſeveral <hi>very exquiſite torments.</hi>
                        </q> In that iſland the owners of the Negroe ſlaves, ſet aſide to each a parcel of ground, and allow them half a day at the latter end of the week, which with the day appointed, by the divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, to be a day of reſt and ſervice to God, and which ought to be kept as ſuch, is the only time allowed them to manure their ground. This with a few herrings, or other ſalt fiſh, is what is given for their ſupport. Their allowance for cloathing in the iſland is ſeldom more than ſix yards of oznabrigs each year. And in the more northern colonies, where the piercing weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly winds are long and ſenſibly felt, theſe poor Africans ſuffer much for want of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cloathing, indeed ſome have none till they are able to pay for it by their labour. The time that the Negroes work in the Weſt Indies, is from day break till noon; then again from two o'clock till dark, (dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time they are attended by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers who ſeverely ſcourge thoſe who appear to them dilatory,) and before they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:011985_0099_0F87EE6D5A395160"/>
to go to their quarters, they have ſtill ſomething to do, as collecting herbage for the horſes, gathering fewel for the boilers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that it is often paſt twelve before they can get home; when they have ſcarce time to grind and boil their Indian corn: whereby if their food was not prepared the evening before, it ſometimes happens, that they are called again to labour before they can ſatisfy their hunger. And here no delay or excuſe will avail, for if they are not in the field immediately upon the uſual notice, they muſt expect to feel the overſeers laſh. In crop time (which laſts many months,) they are obliged (by turns,) to work moſt of the night, in the boiling houſe. Thus their owners from a deſire of making the greateſt gain by the labour of their ſlaves, lay heavy burdens on them, and yet feed and cloath them very ſparingly, and ſome ſcarce feed or cloath them at all; ſo that the poor creatures are obliged to ſhift for their living in the beſt manner they can; which occaſions their being often killed in the neighbouring lands, ſtealing potatoes or other food, to ſatisfy their hunger. And if they take any thing from the plantation they belong to, though under ſuch preſſing want, their owners will correct them ſeverely, for taking a little of what they have ſo hardly laboured for; whilſt many of themſelves riot in the greateſt
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:011985_0100_0F87EE6E19E17D00"/>
luxury and exceſs. It is a matter of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment how a people who, as a nation, are looked upon as generous and humane, and ſo much value themſelves for their uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of the benefit of liberty, can live in the practice of ſuch extreme oppreſſion and inhumanity, without ſeeing the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of ſuch conduct, and feeling great remorſe. Nor is it leſs amazing to hear theſe men calmly making caculations about the ſtrength and lives of their fellow men; in Jamaica if ſix in ten, of the new imported Negroes ſurvive the ſeaſoning, it is looked upon as a gaining purchaſe. And in moſt of the other plantations, if the negroes live eight or nine years, their labour is reckoned a ſufficient compenſation for their coſt. If calculations of this ſort were made upon the ſtrength and labour of beaſts of burden it would not appear ſo ſtrange, but even then a merciful man would certainly uſe his beaſt with more mercy than is uſually ſhewn to the poor Negroes. Will not the groans, the dying groans, of this deeply afflicted and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed people reach heaven, and when the cup of iniquity is full, muſt not the inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſequence, be the pouring forth of the judgments of God upon their oppreſſors? But alas! is it not too manifeſt that this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion has already long been the object of the divine diſpleaſure? For what heavier
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:011985_0101_0F87EE6ED9DD1030"/>
judgment, what greater calamity can befal any people, than to become ſubject to that hardneſs of heart, that forgetfulneſs of God, and inſenſibility to every religious impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; as well as that general depravation of manners, which ſo much prevails in theſe colonies, in proportion as they have more or leſs enriched themſelves at the expence of the blood and bondage of the Negroes.</p>
                     <p>It is a dreadful conſideration, as a late author remarks, that out of the ſtock of eighty thouſand Negroes in Barbadoes, there die every year five thouſand more than are born in that iſland; which failure is probably in the ſame proportion in the other iſlands. <hi>In effect this people is under a neceſſity of being entirely renewed every ſixteen years.</hi> And what muſt we think of the management of a people, who far from increaſing greatly, as thoſe who have no loſs by war ought to do, muſt in ſo ſhort a time as ſixteen years, without foreign recruits, be entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to a man. Is it not a chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, <hi>that the labourer is worthy of his hire?</hi> and hath not the Lord by the mouth of his prophet pronounced <q>
                           <hi>wo unto that man who buildeth his houſe by unrighteouſneſs, and his chambers by wrong, who uſes his neighbours ſervice without wages, and giveth him nought for his work?</hi>
                        </q> And yet the poor Negroe ſlaves are conſtrained, like the beaſts, by
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011985_0102_0F87EE6F99DF9C88"/>
beating to work hard without hire or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and receive nothing from the hand or their unmerciful maſters, but ſuch a wretched proviſion as will ſcarce ſupport them under their fatigues. The intolerable hardſhips many of the ſlaves undergo is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved by the ſhortneſs of their lives.—And who are theſe miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that receive ſuch barbarous treatment from the planters? Can we reſtrain our juſt indignation when we conſider that they are undoubtedly <hi>his brethren! his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours! the children of the ſame father; and ſome of thoſe for whom Chriſt died, as truly as for the planter himſelf.</hi> Let the opulent planter or merchant prove that his Negroe ſlave is not his brother; or that he is not his neighbour, in the ſcripture ſenſe of theſe appellations; and if he is not able to do ſo, how will he juſtify the buying and ſelling of his brethren, as if they were of no more conſideration than his cattle? The wearing them out with continual labour, before they have lived out half their days? The ſevere whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and torturing them even to death, if they reſiſt his inſupportable tyranny. Let the hardieſt ſlave-holder look forward to that tremendous day, when he muſt give an account to God of his ſtewardſhip, and let him ſeriouſly conſider, whether at ſuch a time, he thinks, he ſhall be able to ſatisfy
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:011985_0103_0F87EE7059D85540"/>
himſelf, that any act of buying and ſelling, or the fate of war, or the birth of children, in his houſe, plantation, or territories, or any other circumſtance whatever, can give him ſuch an abſolute property in the perſons of men, as will juſtify his retaining them as ſlaves, and treating them as beaſts. Let him diligently conſider whether there will not always remain to the ſlave a <hi>ſuperior</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or right to the fruit of his own labour; and more eſpecially to his own perſon, that being which was given him by God, and which none but the giver can juſtly claim.</p>

to, as to ſatify the greedy deſire of gain in their profligate employers; who to this intent have furniſhed them with prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious quantities of arms and amunition. Thus they have been hurried into confuſion, diſtreſs and all the extremities of temporal miſery; every thing, even the power of their kings, has been made ſubſervient to this wicked purpoſe, for inſtead of being protectors of their ſubjects, ſome of thoſe rulers corrupted by the exceſſive love of ſpirituous liquors, and the tempting baits laid before them by the factors, have invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the liberties of their unhappy ſubjects, and are become their oppreſſors.</p>
                     <p>Here it may be neceſſary to obſerve, that the accounts we have of the inhabitants of Guinea, are chiefly given by perſons engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the trade, who, from ſelf intereſted views, have deſcribed them in ſuch colours as were leaſt likely to excite compaſſion and reſpect, and endeavoured to reconcile ſo manifeſt a violation of the rights of mankind to the minds of the purchaſers; yet they cannot but allow the Negroes to be poſeſſed of ſome good qualities, though they contrive as much as poſſible to caſt a ſhade over them. A particular inſtance of this appears in Aſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's collection 2 vol. p. 73, where the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſpeaking of the Mandingo's ſettled at Galem, which is ſituated 900 miles up the

Senegal, after ſaying that they carry on a commerce to all the neighbouring king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and amaſs riches, adds, <q>That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>the vices peculiar to the blacks,</hi> they are a good ſort of people, honeſt, hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, juſt to their word, laborious, induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious and very ready to learn arts and ſciences.</q> Here it is difficult to imagine what vices can be peculiarly attendant on a people ſo well diſpoſed as the author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes theſe to be. With reſpect to the charge ſome authors have brought againſt them as being void of all natural affection, it is frequently contradicted by others: in the 2 vol. of the collec. p. 275, and 629, the Negroes of North Guinea, and the Gold Coaſt, are ſaid, <hi>to be fond of their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, whom they love with tenderneſs.</hi> And Boſman ſays p. 340, <q>Not a few in his country (<hi>viz.</hi> Holland) fondly imagine, that parents here fell their children; men their wives, and one brother the other; but thoſe who think ſo deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for this never happens on any other account but that of neceſſity, or ſome great crime.</q> The ſame is repeated by J. Barbot, page 326, and alſo confirmed by Sir Hans Sloan, in the introduction to his natural hiſtory of Jamaica; where ſpeaking of the Negroes, he ſays, <q>They are uſually thought to be haters of their own

children, and therefore 'tis believed that they ſell and diſpoſe of them to ſtrangers for money: but this is not true, for the Negroes of Guinea being divided into ſeveral captainſhips, as well as the Indians of America, have wars, and beſides thoſe ſlain in battle, many priſoners are taken, who are ſold as ſlaves and brought thither; but the parents here although their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren are ſlaves for ever, yet have ſo great love for them, that no maſter dares ſell, or give away one of their little ones, unleſs they care not whether their parents hang themſelves or no.</q> J. Barbot ſpeaking of the occaſion of the natives of Guinea being repreſented as a treacherous people, aſcribes it to the Hollanders (and doubtleſs other Europeans,) uſurping autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and fomenting diviſions between the Negroes. At page 110 he ſays, <q>It is well known that many of the European nations trading amongſt theſe people, have very unjuſtly and inhumanly, without any provocation, ſtolen away, from time to time, abundance of the people, not only on this coaſt, but almoſt every where in Guinea who have come on board their ſhips in a harmleſs and confiding manner, theſe they have in great numbers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, and ſold in the plantations with other ſlaves, which they had purchaſed.</q>

And although ſome of the Negroes may be juſtly charged with indolence and ſuppineſs, yet many others are frequently mentioned by authors <hi>as a careful, induſtrious and even laborious</hi> people. But nothing ſhews more clearly how unſafe it is to form a judgment of diſtant people from the accounts given of them by travellers, who have taken but a tranſient view of things, than the caſe of the Hottentots, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe ſeveral nations of Negroes who inhabit the moſt ſouthern part of Africa; <hi>theſe people</hi> are repreſented, by ſeveral authors, who appear to have very much copied their relations one from the other, as ſo ſavage and barbarous as to have little of human, but the ſhape; but theſe accounts are ſtrongly contradicted by others, particularly Peter Kolben has given a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial relation of the diſpoſition and manners of thoſe people.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Kolben's account of the Cape of Good Hope.</note> He was a man of learning, ſent from the court of Pruſſia, ſolely to make aſtronomical and natural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations there; and having no intereſt in the ſlavery of the Negroes, had not the ſame inducement as moſt other relators had, to miſrepreſent the natives of Africa.

                     <p>Man-ſtealing eſteemed highly cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal and puniſhable by the laws of <hi>Guinea: No</hi> Negroes allowed to be ſold for Slaves there but thoſe deemed priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of war, or in puniſhment for crimes. <hi>Some</hi> of the Negroe rulers, corrupted by the Europeans, violently infringe the laws of <hi>Guinea.</hi> The king of Barſailay noted in that reſpect.</p>
                     <p>BY an enquiry into the laws and cuſtoms formerly in uſe and ſtill in force amongſt the Negroes, particularly on the Gold Coaſt, it will be found, that proviſion was made for the general peace, and for the ſafety of individuals; even in W. Boſman's time, long after the Europeans had eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſlave trade, the natives were not publicly enſlaved, any otherwiſe than in puniſhment for crimes; when priſoners of war; or by a violent exertion of the power of their corrupted kings. Where any of the natives were ſtolen, in order to be ſold to the Europeans, it was done ſecretly, or at leaſt only connived at by thoſe in power;
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:011985_0114_0F87EE7899CADFF0"/>
this appears from Barbot and Boſman's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter, both agreeing that Man-ſtealing was not allowed on the Gold Coaſt. The firſt,<note n="†" place="bottom">Barbot, page 303.</note> ſays, <q>
                           <hi>Kidnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or ſtealing of human creatures is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed there, and even ſometimes with death.</hi>
                        </q> And W. Boſman, whoſe long reſidence on the coaſt, enabled him to ſpeak with certainty, ſays<note n="‡" place="bottom">Boſman, page 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </q> Hence it may be concluded, that the ſale of the greateſt part of the Negroes to the Europeans is ſupported by violence, in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the laws, through the knavery of their principal men<note n="*" place="bottom">Note.

Theſe merchants bring down elephants teeth, and in ſome years two thouſand ſlaves, moſt of which they ſay, are priſoners taken in war. They buy them from the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:011985_0120_0F87EE7D19C50008"/>
different princes, who take them; many of them are Bumbrongs and Petcharies; nations, who each of them have different languages, and are brought from a vaſt way inland. Their way of bringing them is tying them by the neck, with leathern thongs, at about a yard diſtance from each other, thirty or forty in a ſtring, having generally a bundle of corn or elephants teeth upon each of their heads. In their way from the mountains, they travel thro' very great woods, where they cannot for ſome days get water; ſo they carry in ſkin bags enough to ſupport them for a time. I cannot, (adds Moor) be certain of the number of merchants who follow this trade, but there may, perhaps, be about an hundred, who go up into the inland country, with the goods which they buy from the white men, and with them pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, in various countries, gold, ſlaves, and elephants teeth. Beſides the ſlaves which the merchants bring down, there are many bought along the river: Theſe are either taken in war, as the former are, or men condemned for crimes; <hi>or elſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtolen, which is very frequent.</hi>—Since the ſlave trade has been uſed all puniſhments are changed into ſlavery; there being an advantage on ſuch condemnation, <hi>they

The 30th. <q>No trade yet, but our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders came on board to day, and informed us the people had burnt four towns of their enemies, ſo that to-morrow we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſlaves off: another large ſhip is come in. Yeſterday came in a large Londoner.</q>

                     <p>The 2d of January. <q>Laſt night we ſaw a prodigious fire break out about eleven o'clock; and this morning ſee the town of Seſtro burnt down to the ground; (it contained ſome hundreds of houſes) ſo that we find their enemies are too hard for them at preſent, and conſequently our trade ſpoiled here; therefore, about ſeven o'clock we weighed anchor, as did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the three other veſſels, to proceed lower down.</q>

him with his arrival, and letting him know, they wanted a cargo of ſlaves. The King promiſed to furniſh them with ſlaves; and, in order to do it, ſet out to go to war againſt his enemies; deſigning to ſurpriſe ſome town, and take all the people priſoners: Some time after, the king ſent them word, he had not yet met with the deſired ſucceſs; having been twice repulſed, in attempting to break up two towns; but that he ſtill hoped to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a number of ſlaves for them; and in this deſign he perſiſted till he met his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the field; where a battle was ſought, which laſted three days, during which time the engagement was ſo bloody, that four thouſand five hundred men were ſlain on the ſpot.</q> The perſon who wrote the account beheld the bodies as they lay on the field of battle. <q>Think (ſays he in his Journal) what a pitiable ſight it was to ſee the widows weeping over their loſt huſbands, orphans deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the loſs of their fathers, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>

                              <hi>The following relation is inſerted at the requeſt of the Author,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>THAT I may contribute all in my power towards the Good of Mankind, by inſpiring any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals with a ſuitable abhorrence of that deteſtable practice of trading in our fellow-creatures, and in ſome meaſure atone for my neglect of duty as a Chriſtian, in engaging in that wicked traffic, I offer to their ſerious conſideration ſome few occurrences of which I was an eye-witneſs. That being ſtruck with the wretched and affecting ſcene they may foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that humane principle, which is the noble and diſtinguiſhed characteriſtic of man, and improve it to the benefit of their children's children.</p>
                           <p>About the year 1749, I ſailed from <hi>Liverpool</hi> to the coaſt of <hi>Guinea:</hi> Some time after our arrival I was ordered to go up the country a conſiderable diſtance; upon having notice from one of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe Kings, that he had a parcel of ſlaves to diſpoſe of; I received my inſtructions, and went, carrying with me an account of ſuch goods we had on board to exchange for the ſlaves we intended to purchaſe. Upon being introduced, I preſented him with a ſmall caſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpirits, a gun, and ſome trifles, which having accepted, and underſtood by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter what goods we had, the next day was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for viewing the ſlaves; we found about two hundred confined in one place. But here how ſhall I relate the affecting ſight I there beheld! How can I ſufficiently deſcribe the ſilent ſorrow which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the countenance of the afflicted father, and the painful anguiſh of the tender mother, expecting to be forever ſeparated from their tender offspring; the diſtreſſed maid wringing her hands in preſage of her future wretchedneſs, and the general cry of the innocent from a fearful apprehenſion of the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſlavery to which they were doomed! Under a ſenſe of my offence to GOD, in the perſon of his creatures; I acknowledge I purchaſed eleven, who I conducted tyed, two and two to the ſhip. Being but a ſmall veſſel, (ninety ton) we ſoon purchaſed our cargo, conſiſting of one hundred and ſeventy ſlaves, whom thou may'ſt Reader range in thy view, as they were ſhackled two and two together, pent up within the narrow confines of the main deck, with the complicated diſtreſs of ſickneſs, chains and contempts; deprived of every fond and ſocial tie, and in a great meaſure reduced to a ſtate of deſperation. We had not been a fortnight at ſea, before the fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this deſpair appeared; they formed a deſign of recovering their natural right, LIBERTY, by riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and murdering every man on board, but the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Almighty rendered their ſcheme abortive, and his mercy ſpared us to have time to repent. The plot was diſcovered; the Ringleader ty'd by the two thumbs over the barricade door, at ſun-riſe received a number of laſhes, in this ſituation he remained till ſun-ſet, expoſed to the inſults and barbarity of the brutal crew of ſailors, with full leave to exerciſe their cruelty at pleaſure. The conſequence of this was, that next morning the miſerable ſufferer was found dead, flead from the ſhoulders to the waiſt. The next victim was a youth, who, from too ſtrong a ſenſe of his miſery refuſed nouriſhment, and died; diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unnoticed, till the hogs had fed on part of his fleſh. Will not Chriſtianity bluſh at this impious ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege? May the relation of it ſerve to call back the ſtruggling remains of humanity, in the hearts of thoſe who from a love of wealth, partake in any degree of this oppreſſive gain, and have ſuch an effect on the minds of the ſincere, as may be productive of peace, the happy effect of true repentance for paſt tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a reſolution to renounce all connexion with it for the time to come.</p>

ſome infants, or aged parents, whom his labour was to feed, and vigilance protect; themſelves under the moſt dreadful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of an unknown perpetual ſlavery; confined within the narrow limits of a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, where often ſeveral hundred lie as cloſe as poſſible: Under theſe aggravated diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they are often reduced to a ſtate of deſpair, in which many have been frequently killed and ſome deliberately put to death under the greateſt torture, when they have attempted to riſe in order to free themſelves from preſent miſery and the ſlavery deſigned them. Many accounts of this nature might be mentioned, indeed from the vaſt number of veſſels employed in the trade, and the repeated relations in the public prints of Negroes riſing on board the veſſels from Guinea, its more than probable that many ſuch inſtances occur every year. I ſhall only mention one example of this kind, by which the reader may judge of the reſt; its in Aſtley's Collection 2 vol. P. 449, related by John Atkins, ſurgeon on board Admiral Ogle's ſquadron, of one <q>
                           <hi>Harding,</hi> maſter of a veſſel in which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the men ſlaves and a woman ſlave had attempted to riſe, in order to recover their liberty; ſome of whom the maſter, of his own authority, ſentenced to cruel death, making them firſt eat the heart

and liver of one of thoſe he had killed. The woman he hoiſted by the thumbs, whipped and ſlaſhed with knives before the other ſlaves till ſhe died.</q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">A memorable inſtance of ſome of the dreadful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the ſlave-trade, happened about five years paſt, on a ſhip from this port, then at anchor about three miles from ſhore, near Acra Fort, on the coaſt of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea. They had purchaſed between four and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Negroes, and were ready to ſail for the Weſt-Indies. Its cuſtomary on board thoſe veſſels to keep the men ſhackled two by two, each by one leg to a ſmall iron bar; theſe are every day brought on the deck, for the benefit of air, and leaſt they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to recover their freedom, they are made faſt to two common chains, which are extended on each ſide the main deck: The women and children are looſe. This was the ſituation of the ſlaves on board this veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, when it took fire, by means of a perſon who was drawing ſpirits by the light of a lamp; the caſk burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the fire ſpread with ſo much violence, that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten minutes, the ſailors apprehending it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to extinguiſh it, before it could reach a large quantity of powder they had on board, concluded it neceſſary to caſt themſelves into the ſea, as the only chance of ſaving their lives; and firſt, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to looſe the chains by which the Negroe men were faſtened to the deck, but in the confuſion the key being miſſing, they had but juſt time to looſe one of the chains by wrenching the ſtaple; when the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of the fire ſo encreaſed, that they all, but one man, jumped over board, when immediately the fire having gained the powder, the veſſel blew up with all the ſlaves who remained faſtened to the one chain, and ſuch others as had not followed the ſailors examples. There happened to be three Portugueſe veſſels in ſight, who, with others from the ſhore, putting out their boats, took up about two hundred and fifty of thoſe poor ſouls who remained alive; of which number about fifty died on ſhore, being moſtly of thoſe who were were fettered together by iron ſhackles, which as they jumped into the ſea, had broke their legs, and theſe fractures being inflamed, by ſo long a ſtruggle in the ſea probably mortified, which occaſioned the death of every one that was ſo wounded. The two hundred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining alive, were ſoon diſpoſed of, for account of the owners to other purchaſers.</note> As de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable

and ſhocking as this may appear, to ſuch whoſe hearts are not yet hardened by the practice of that cruelty, which the love of wealth by degrees introduceth into the human mind; it will not be ſtrange to thoſe who have been concerned or employed in the trade.</p>
                     <p>Now here ariſes a neceſſary query to thoſe who hold the balance of juſtice, and who muſt be accountable to God for the uſe they have made of it; that as the principles on which the Britiſh conſtitution is founded, are ſo favourable to the common rights of mankind, how it has happened that the laws which countenance this iniquitous traffic, have obtained the ſanction of the legiſlature; and that the executive part of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould ſo long ſhut their ears to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual

reports of the barbarities perpetrated againſt this unhappy people, and leave the trading ſubjects at liberty to trample on the moſt precious rights of others, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a rebuke. Why are the maſters of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels thus ſuffered to be the ſovereign arbiters of the lives of the miſerable Negroes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with impunity, thus to deſtroy (may I not properly ſay <hi>to murder</hi>) their fellow creatures, and that by means ſo cruel, as cannot be even related but with ſhame and horror.</p>

                     <p>WHEN the veſſels arrive at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined port in the colonies, the poor Negroes are to be diſpoſed off to the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and here they are again expoſed naked, without any diſtinction of ſexes, to the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal examination of their purchaſers; and this, it may well be judged, is to many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other occaſion of deep diſtreſs. Add to this, that near connections muſt now again be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated to go with their ſeveral purchaſers; this muſt be deeply affecting to all, but ſuch whoſe hearts are feared by the love of gain. Mothers are ſeen hanging over their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, bedewing their naked breaſts with tears, and daughters clinging to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,

not knowing what new ſtage of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs muſt follow their ſeparation, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall ever meet again. And here what ſympathy! What commiſeration do they meet with! Why, indeed, if they will not ſeparate as readily as their owners think proper, the Whipper is called for, and the laſh is exerciſed upon their naked bodies, till obliged to part. Can any human heart, which is not become callous by the practiſe of ſuch cruelties, be unconcerned, even at the relation of ſuch grievous affliction, to which this oppreſſed part of our ſpecies are ſubjected.</p>
                     <p>In a book printed in Liverpool, called, <hi>The Liverpool Memorandum,</hi> which contains amongſt other things, an account of the trade of that port, there is an exact liſt of the veſſels employed in the Guinea trade, and of the number of ſlaves imported in each veſſel; by which it appears, that in the year 1753, the number imported to America by one hundred and one veſſels belonging to that port, amounted to upwards of thirty thouſand, and from the number of veſſels employed by the African company, in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Briſtol, we may, with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of certainty, conclude, there are one hundred thouſand Negroes purchaſed and brought on board our ſhips yearly from the coaſt of Africa.

                        <q>that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſupplies her American colonies with Negroe ſlaves, amounting in number to above one hundred thouſand every year.</q> When the veſſels are full freighted with ſlaves, they ſail for our plantations in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and may be two or three months in the voyage, during which time, from the filth and ſtench that is among them, diſtempers frequently break out, which carry off com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a fifth, a fourth, yea ſometimes a third or more of them: ſo that taking all the ſlaves together, that are brought on board our ſhips yearly, one may reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that at leaſt ten thouſand of them die on the voyage. And in a printed account of the ſtate of the Negroes, in our plantations, it is ſuppoſed that a fourth part more or leſs die at the different iſlands, in what is called the ſeaſoning. Hence it may be preſumed, that at a moderate computation of the ſlaves who are purchaſed by our African mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in a year, near thirty thouſand die upon the voyage and in the ſeaſoning. Add to this, the prodigious number who are killed in the incurſions and inteſtine wars, by which the Negroes procure the number of ſlaves wanted to load the veſſels. How
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:011985_0139_0F87EE8B59A2DDC0"/>
dreadful then is this ſlave-trade, whereby ſo many thouſands of our fellow creatures, free by nature, endued with the ſame rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal faculties, and called to be heirs of the ſame ſalvation with us, loſe their lives, and are truly and properly ſpeaking murdered every year; for it is not neceſſary in order to convict a man of murder, to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that he had an intention to commit murder. Whoever does, by unjuſt force or violence, deprive another of his liberty, and while he hath him in his power, continues ſo to oppreſs him, by cruel treatment as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventually to occaſion his death, is actually guilty of murder. It is enough to make a thoughtful perſon tremble, to think what a load of guilt lies upon our nation on this account, and that the blood of thouſands of poor innocent creatures murdered every year in the proſecution of this wicked trade, cries aloud to Heaven for vengeance. Were we to hear or read of a nation that deſtroyed every year, in ſome other way, as many human creatures as periſh in this trade, we ſhould certainly conſider them as a very bloody barbarous people. If it be alledged, that the legiſlature hath encouraged and ſtill does encourage this trade. It is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no legiſlature on earth, can alter the nature of things, ſo as to make that to be right which is contrary to the law of God,

                     <p>Obſervations on the diſpoſition and capacity of the Negroes: Why thought inferior to that of the Whites. Affecting inſtances of the ſlavery of the Negroes. Reflections thereon.</p>
                     <p>DOUBTS may ariſe in the minds of of ſome, whether the foregoing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts relating to the natural capacity and good diſpoſition of the inhabitants of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, and of the violent manner in which they are ſaid to be torn from their native land, is to be depended upon on; as thoſe
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:011985_0141_0F87EE8CD99ABBB8"/>
Negroes, who are brought to us, are not heard to complain, nor do but ſeldom ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſuch a docility and quickneſs of parts, as is agreeable thereto. But thoſe who make theſe objections, are deſired to note the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcouragements the poor Africans labour under when brought from their native land. Let them conſider, that thoſe afflicted ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, though in an <hi>enlightened Chriſtian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> have yet but little opportunity or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to exert and improve their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural talents: They are conſtantly employed in ſervile labour, and the abject condition in which we ſee them, naturally raiſes an idea of a ſuperiority in ourſelves; whence we are apt to look upon them as an ignorant and contemptible part of mankind. Add to this, that they meet with very little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of freely converſing with ſuch of the Whites, as might impart inſtruction to them. It is a fondneſs for wealth, for authority or honour which prompts moſt men, in their endeavours to excel; but theſe motives can have little influence upon the minds of the Negroes; few of them having any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proſpect of any other than a ſtate of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; ſo that, though their natural capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ever ſo good, they have neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement or opportunity to exert them to advantage: This naturally tends to depreſs their minds, and ſink their ſpirits into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:011985_0142_0F87EE8D99A260C0"/>
of idleneſs and ſloth, which they would, in all likelihood, have been free from, had they ſtood upon an equal footing with the white people. They are ſuffered, with impunity, to cohabit together, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married, and to part, when ſolemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to one another as man and wife; notwithſtanding the moral and religious laws of the land, ſtrictly prohibiting ſuch practices. This naturally tends to beget ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion in the moſt thoughtful of thoſe people, that we look upon them as a lower race, not worthy of the ſame care, nor liable to the ſame rewards and puniſhments as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Nevertheleſs it may with truth be ſaid, that both amongſt thoſe who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their freedom, and thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in ſervitude, ſome have manifeſted a ſtrong ſagacity and an exemplary upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart. If this hath not been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the caſe with them, is it a matter of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize? Have we not reaſon to make the ſame complaint of many white ſervants, when diſcharged from our ſervice, though many of them have had much greater op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of knowledge and improvement than the blacks; who even, when free, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under the ſame difficulties as before, having but little acceſs to, and intercourſe with the moſt reputable white people; they remain confined within their former limits
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:011985_0143_0F87EE8E599C0F90"/>
of converſation. And if they ſeldom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the unjuſt and cruel uſage they have received in being forced from their native country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is not to be wondered at; it being a conſiderable time after their arrival amongſt us, before they can ſpeak our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and, by the time they are able to expreſs themſelves, they have great reaſon to believe, that little or no notice would be taken of their complaints, yet let any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enquire of thoſe who were capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection before they were brought from their native land, and he will hear ſuch affecting relations, which, if not loſt to the common feelings of humanity, will ſenſibly affect his heart. The caſe of a poor Negroe, not long ſince brought from Guinea, is a recent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this kind. From his firſt arrival, he appeared thoughtful and dejected, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently dropping tears when taking notice of his maſter's children, the cauſe of which was not known till he was able to ſpeak En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, when the account he gave of himſelf was, <q>That he had a wife and children in his own country; that ſome of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick and thirſty, he went, in the night time, to fetch water at a ſpring, where he was violently ſeized and carried away by perſons, who lay in wait to catch men, from whence he was tranſported to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. The remembrance of his family,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:011985_0144_0F87EE8F199D6B38"/>
friends and other connections, left behind, which he never expected to ſee any more, were the principal cauſe of his dejection and grief.</q> Many caſes equally affecting might be here mentioned, but one more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which fell under the notice of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of credit will ſuffice. One of theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creatures, then about 50 years of age, informed him, <q>That being violently torn from a wife and ſeveral children in Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, he was ſold in Jamaica, where never expecting to ſee his native land or family any more, he joined himſelf to a Negroe woman, by whom he had two children; after ſome years, it ſuiting the intereſt of his owner to remove him, he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from this ſecond wife and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and brought to South-Carolina, where, expecting to ſpend the remainder of his days, he engaged with a third wife, by whom he had another child; but here the ſame conſequence of one man being ſubject to the will and pleaſure of another man occurring, he was ſeparated from this laſt wife and child, and brought in this country, where he remained a ſlave.</q> Can any, whoſe mind is not rendered quite obdurate by the love of wealth, hear theſe relations, without being deeply touched with ſympathy and ſorrow; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the caſe of many, very many of theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:011985_0145_0F87EE8FD99C7908"/>
people, upon enquiry would be found to be attended with circumſtances equally tragical and aggravating. And, if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thoſe Negroes who were brought away from their native country when child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, we ſhall find moſt of them to have been ſtolen away when abroad from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, on the roads, in the woods, or watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their corn-fields. Now, you that have ſtudied the book of conſcience, and you that are learned in the law, what will you ſay to ſuch deplorable caſes. When, and how have theſe oppreſſed people forfeited their liberty? Does not juſtice loudly call for its being reſtored to them? Have they not the ſame right to demand it as any of us ſhould have, if we had been violently ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Pyrates from our native land? Is it not the duty of every diſpenſer of juſtice, who is not forgetful of his own humanity, to remember, that theſe are men, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them free? Where inſtances of ſuch cruelty frequently occur, and are neither enquired into, nor redreſſed by thoſe whoſe duty it is, <hi>to ſeek judgment, and relieve the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,</hi> Iſaiah i. 17. What can be expected but that the groans and cries of theſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will reach Heaven, and what ſhall we do <hi>when God riſeth up and when he viſiteth,</hi> What will ye anſwer him? <hi>Did not he that made them, make us; and did not one faſhion us in the womb.</hi> Job xxxi. 14.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>IT is ſcarce to be doubted, but that the foregoing accounts will beget in the heart of the conſiderate readers, an earneſt deſire to ſee a ſtop put to this complicated evil, but the objection with many is, What ſhall be done with thoſe Negroes already imported and born in our families? Muſt they be ſent to Africa? That would be to expoſe them in a ſtrange land to greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties than many of them labour under at preſent. To ſet them ſuddenly free here, would be, perhaps, attended with no leſs difficulty; for undiſciplined as they are in religion and virtue, they might give a looſe to thoſe evil habits, which the fear of a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would have reſtrained. Theſe are objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which weigh with many well diſpoſed people, and it muſt be granted theſe are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in the way; nor can any general
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:011985_0147_0F87EE91599CC728"/>
change be made or reformation affected without ſome; but the difficulties are not ſo great but that they may be ſurmounted. If the government was ſo conſiderate of the iniquity and danger attending on this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice as to be willing to ſeek a remedy, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the Almighty would bleſs this good intention, and ſuch methods would be thought of, as would not only put an end to the unjuſt oppreſſion of the Negroes, but might bring them under regulations that would enable them to become profitable members of ſociety. For the furtherance of which, the following propoſals are offered to conſideration: That all farther importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſlaves be abſolutely prohibited; and as to thoſe born amongſt us, after ſerving ſo long as may appear to be equitable, let them by law be declared free. Let every one thus ſet free, be enrolled in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty courts, and be obliged to be a reſident during a certain number of years within the ſaid county, under the care of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of the poor. Thus being, in ſome ſort, ſtill under the direction of governors and the notice of thoſe who were formerly acquainted with them, they would be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act the more circumſpectly, and make proper uſe of their liberty, and their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:011985_0148_0F87EE9219959750"/>
would have an opportunity of obtaining ſuch inſtruction as is neceſſary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon occaſions of life, and thus both parents and children might gradually become uſeful members of the community. And further, where the nature of the country would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as certainly the uncultivated condition of our ſouthern and moſt weſtern colonies eaſily would: ſuppoſe a ſmall tract of land were aſſigned to every Negroe family, and they obliged to live upon and improve it, (when not hired out to work for the white people) this would encourage them to exert their abilities and become induſtrious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Hence both planters and tradeſmen would be plentifully ſupplied with chearful and willing minded labourers, much vacant land would be cultivated; the produce of the country be juſtly encreaſed; the taxes for the ſupport of government leſſened to individuals by the encreaſe of taxables. And the Negroes, inſtead of being and object of Terror<note n="*" place="bottom">The hard uſage the Negroes meet with in the plantations, and the great diſproportion between them and the white people, will always be a juſt cauſe of terror. In Jamaica and ſome parts of South-Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, it is ſuppoſed that there are fifteen blacks to one white.</note>, as they certainly muſt be to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments

                     <p>Anſwer to a miſtaken opinion, that the warmth of the climate in the Weſt-Indies will not permit white people to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour there.

                     <p>IT is frequently offered as an argument in vindication of the uſe of Negroe ſlaves. That the warmth of the climate in the Weſt Indies, will not permit white people to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the culture of the land; but upon an acquaintance with the nature of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and its effects upon ſuch labouring
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:011985_0150_0F87EE94598E3C80"/>
white people as are prudent and moderate in labour and the uſe of ſpirituous liquors, this will be found to be a miſtaken opinion. Thoſe iſlands were, at firſt, wholly cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by white men; the encouragement they then met with for a long courſe of years was ſuch as occaſioned a great encreaſe of people. Richard Ligon, in his hiſtory of Barbadoes, where he reſided from the year 1647 to 1650, about 24 years after its firſt ſettlement, writes, <q>that there was then fifty thouſand ſouls on that iſland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Negroes; and that though the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was very hot, yet not ſo ſcalding, but that ſervants, both Chriſtians and ſlaves laboured ten hours a day.</q> By other accounts we gather, that the white people have ſince decreaſed to leſs than one half the number which was there at that time; and by relations of the firſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the other iſlands, we do not meet with any complaints of unfitneſs in the white people for labour there, before ſlaves were introduced. The iſland of Hiſpaniola, which is one of the largeſt of thoſe iſlands, was at firſt planted by the Bucaneers, a ſet of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy laborious men, who continued ſo for a long courſe of years, till following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their neighbours in the purchaſe and uſe of Negroe Slaves, idleneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs prevailing, debility and diſeaſe natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:011985_0151_0F87EE95199600C8"/>
ſucceeded, and have ever ſince conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. If, under proper regulations, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was proclaimed through the colonies, the Negroes, from a dangerous grudging half fed ſlaves, might become able willing mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Labourers. And if there was not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient number of theſe to do the neceſſary work, a competent number of labouring people might be procured from Europe, which affords numbers of poor diſtreſſed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who, if not overlooked, with proper uſage, might, in ſeveral reſpects, better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer every good purpoſe in performing the neceſſary labour in the iſlands than the ſlaves now do.</p>
                     <p>A farther conſiderable advantage might accrue to the Britiſh nation in general, if the ſlave trade was laid aſide, by the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a fair, friendly and humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Africans, without which it is not poſſible the inland trade of that country ſhould ever be extended to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree it is capable of; for while the ſpirit of butchery and making ſlaves of each other is promoted by the Europeans amongſt the Negroes, no mutual confidence can take place; nor will the Europeans be able to travel with ſafety into the heart of their country to form and cement ſuch commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial friendſhips and alliances as might be neceſſary to introduce the arts and ſciences
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:011985_0152_0F87EE95D991BEF0"/>
amongſt them, and engage their attention to inſtruction in the principles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, which is the only ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of every ſocial virtue. Africa has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten thouſand miles of ſea coaſt, and extends in depth near three thouſand miles from eaſt to weſt, and as much from north to ſouth; ſtored with vaſt treaſures of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials neceſſary for the trade and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Great-Britain, and from its climate and the fruitfulneſs of its ſoil, capable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proper management, of producing, in the greateſt plenty, moſt of the commodities which are imported into Europe from thoſe parts of America ſubject to the Engliſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,<note n="*" place="bottom">See note page, 109.</note> and as in return they would take our manufactures, the advantages of this trade would ſoon become ſo great, that it is evident this ſubject merits the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and attention of the government,</p>

An Engliſh ſubject cannot be made a ſlave without his own free conſent, but—a foreign ſlave is made a ſubject with or without his own conſent; there needs no contract for this purpoſe as in the other caſe; nor any other act or deed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, but that of his being landed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; for according to a ſtatute of 32d Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, VIII. c. 16. Sect. 9. <q>
                        <hi>Every alien or ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, born out of the King's obeiſance, not being denizen, which now or hereafter ſhall come into this realm, or elſewhere within the King's dominions, ſhall, after the ſaid firſt of September next coming, be bounden by and unto the laws and ſtatutes of this realm, and to all and ſingular the contents of the ſame.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it muſt be obſerved, that though this law makes no diſtinſtion of <hi>bond or free,</hi> neither of colours or complexions, whether of <hi>black, brown,</hi> or <hi>white,</hi> for <q>
                        <hi>every alien or ſtranger</hi> (without exception) <hi>are bounden by and unto the law,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This binding or obligation, is properly
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011985_0157_0F87EE9999944B48"/>
expreſſed by the Engliſh word Ligeance, (<hi>a Ligando</hi>) which may be either perpetual or temporary. Wood 6. 1. c. 3. p. 37. but one of theſe is indiſpenſably due to the Sovereign from all ranks and conditions of people, their being bounden unto the laws, (upon which the Sovereign's right is founded) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes and implies this ſubjection to the laws, and therefore to alledge, that an alien is not a ſubject, becauſe he is in bondage, is not only a plea without foundation, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in terms, for every perſon who in any reſpect is in ſubjection to the laws, muſt undoubtedly be a ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the main point—"<hi>that every man, woman, or child, that now is, or hereafter ſhall be an inhabitant or reſiant of this kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed,</hi>" is, in ſome reſpect or other, the <hi>King's ſubject,</hi> and as ſuch, is abſolutely ſecure in his, or her <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal liberty,</hi> by virtue of a ſtatute, 31ſt Car. II. ch. 11, and particularly by the 12th Sect. of the ſame (wherein ſubjects of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are plainly included.)</p>
                  <p>This act is expreſsly intended for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecuring the liberty of the ſubject, and for prevention of impriſonment beyond the ſeas. It contains no diſtinction of "<hi>natural born, naturalized, denizen, or alien ſubject, nor of white or black, freemen or even of bond men,</hi>"
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011985_0158_0F87EE9A59988168"/>
(except in the caſe already mentioned <hi>of a contract in writing,</hi> by which it ſhall appear, <hi>that the ſaid ſlave have voluntarily bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without compulſion or illegal dureſs</hi>) allowed by the 13th Sect. and the exception likewiſe in the 14th Sect. concerning felons, but they are all included under the general titles of "<hi>the ſubject, any of the ſaid ſubjects," every ſuch perſon, &amp;c.</hi> Now the definition of the word "<hi>perſon</hi>" in its relative or civil capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (according to Wood. b. 1. c. 11. p. 27) <hi>is either the King or a ſubject.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>only capital diſtinctions</hi> that can be made; though the latter conſiſts of a variety of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations and degrees.</p>
                  <p>But if I were even to allow, that a <hi>Negroe ſlave</hi> is not a ſubject, (though I think I have clearly proved that he is) yet it is plain, that ſuch an one ought not to be denied the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the King's court, unleſs the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder ſhall be able to prove likewiſe, that he is not a <hi>Man,</hi> becauſe <hi>every man</hi> may be <hi>free</hi> to ſue for and <hi>defend his right in our courts,</hi> ſays a ſtat. 20th Edw. III. Ch. 4. and elſewhere according to law. And <hi>no man of what eſtate or condition</hi> that he be, (here can be no exception whatſoever) <hi>ſhall be put out of land or tenement, nor taken nor impriſoned, nor diſinherited, nor put to death, without being brought in anſwer by due proceſs of the law.</hi> 28th Edw.

what eſtate or condition that he be,</hi> can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be detained in England <hi>as a ſlave,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have no law, whereby a man <hi>may be</hi> condemned to <hi>ſlavery,</hi> without his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, (for even convicted felons muſt, "<hi>in open court pray to be tranſported,</hi>") ſee Habeas Corpus act, Sect. 14. and therefore there cannot be any "<hi>due proceſs of the law,</hi>" tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſo baſe a purpoſe: It follows, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that every man who preſumes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>any perſon</hi> whatſoever as a ſlave, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by virtue of a written contract, acts manifeſtly without "<hi>due proceſs of the law.</hi>" and conſequently is liable to the ſlaves <q>
                        <hi>action of falſe impriſonment,</hi> becauſe <hi>every man may be free to ſue,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. ſo that the ſlave-holder cannot avail himſelf of his imaginary <hi>property,</hi> either by the aſſiſtance of the common law, or of a court of equity, (<hi>except it appears that the ſaid ſlave has voluntary bound himſelf without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, or illegal dureſs</hi>) for in both, his ſuit will certainly appear both unjuſt and indefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The former cannot aſſiſt him, becauſe the ſtatute law at preſent is ſo far from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing any man in a ſtate of ſlavery, that it cannot even permit ſuch a ſtate, except in the two caſes mentioned in the 13th and 14th Section of the Habeas Corpus act; and the courts of equity likewiſe muſt neceſſarily decide againſt him, becauſe his mere merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

plea, of <hi>private property,</hi> cannot, equit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in a caſe between (<hi>man and man,</hi>) ſtand in competition with that <hi>ſuperior property</hi> which every man muſt neceſſarily be allowed to have in his own <hi>proper perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How then is the ſlave-holder to ſecure what he eſteems his <hi>property?</hi> Perhaps he will endeavour clandeſtinely to ſeize the ſuppoſed ſlave in order to tranſport him, (with or without <hi>his conſent</hi>) to the colonies, where ſuch property it allowed: But let him take care what he does, the very attempt is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable, and even the making over his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to another for that purpoſe, renders him equally liable to the ſevere penalties of the law, for a bill of ſale may certainly be included under the terms expreſſed in the Habeas Corpus act, 12th Sect. <hi>viz.</hi> "<hi>Anywar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or writing for ſuch commitment, detainer, impriſonment or tranſportation, &amp;c.</hi>" It is alſo dangerous for a counſellor or any other perſon <hi>to adviſe</hi>" (ſee the act "ſhall be adviſing") ſuch proceedings by ſaying, "<hi>that a maſter may legally compel him,</hi> (the ſlave) <hi>to return again to the plantations.</hi>" Likewiſe an Attorney, Notary-public, or any other perſon, who ſhall preſume to draw up, negotiate, or even to witneſs a bill of ſale, or other inſtrument, for ſuch committment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> offends equally againſt the law, becauſe, "<hi>All, or any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons that ſhall frame, contrive, write,

"<hi>And the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, in every ſuch action, ſhall have judgment to recover his treble coſts, beſides damages; which damages ſo to be given, ſhall not be leſs than five hundred pounds;</hi>" ſo that the injured may have ample ſatisfaction for their ſufferings; and even a judge may not direct or inſtruct a jury contrary to this ſtatute whatever his private opinion may be concerning property in ſlaves; becauſe, <hi>no order or command, nor no injunction,</hi> is allowed to interfere with this <hi>golden act of liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—I have before obſerved, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral term, "<hi>every Alien,</hi>" includes <hi>all ſtrangers whatſoever,</hi> and renders them <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to the King and the laws during their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in this kingdom; and this is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, whether the aliens be Turks, Moors, Arabians, Tartars, or even ſavages from any part of the world.—Men are rendered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the laws by their offences, and not by the particular denomination of their rank, order, parentage, colour or country, and therefore, though we ſhould ſuppoſe, that any particular body of people whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were not known, or had in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the legiſlature at the different times
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011985_0162_0F87EE9D598635D0"/>
when the ſevere penal laws were made, yet no man can reaſonably conceive, that ſuch men are exempted on this account from the penalties of the ſaid laws, when legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of having offended againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Laws calculated for the moral purpoſe of preventing oppreſſion, are likewiſe uſually ſuppoſed to be everlaſting, and to make up a part of our happy conſtitution; for which reaſon, though the kind of oppreſſion to be guarded againſt, and the penalties for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders are minutely deſcribed therein, yet the perſons to be protected are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in terms as general as poſſible; that "<hi>no perſon who now is, or hereafter ſhall be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant or reſiant in this kingdom,</hi> (ſee Habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Corpus act, Sect. 12th) may ſeem to be excluded from protection. The general terms of the ſeveral ſtatutes before cited are ſo full and clear, that they admit of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception whatſoever, for all perſons, (Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes as well as others) muſt be included in the terms; "the ſubject;—<hi>no ſubject of this realm that now is, or hereafter ſhall be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>any ſubject; every ſuch perſon,</hi> ſee Habeas Cor. act.

Cap. 4, and <hi>no man, of what eſtate or condition than he be,</hi> ſhall be taken nor impriſoned. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> True juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice makes no reſpect of perſons, and can never deny to any one that bleſſing to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011985_0163_0F87EE9E197C5678"/>
which all mankind have an undoubted right, their <hi>natural liberty:</hi> Though the law makes no mention of Negroe ſlaves, yet this is no juſt argument for excluding them from the general protection of our happy conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>Neither can the objection, that Negroe ſlaves were not "had in conſideration or contemplation" when theſe laws were made, prove any thing againſt them; but, on the contrary, much in their favour; for both theſe circumſtances are ſtrong preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proofs, that the practice of importing ſlaves into this kingdom, and retaining them as ſuch, is an innovation entirely foreign to the ſpirit and intention of the laws now in force.</p>
                  <p>—Page 79. A toleration of ſlavery, is, in effect, a toleration of inhumanity; for there are wretches in the world, who make no ſcruple to gain, by wearing out their ſlaves with continual labour, and a ſcanty allowance, before they have lived out half their natural days. 'Tis notorious, that this is too often the caſe in the unhappy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where ſlavery is tolerated.</p>
                  <p>See the account of the European ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in America, Part VI. Chap. 11. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the "<hi>miſery of the Negroes, great waſte of them, &amp;c.</hi> which informs us, not only of a moſt ſcandalous profanation of the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011985_0164_0F87EE9ED9781C70"/>
Lord's day, but alſo, of another abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which muſt be infinitely more heinous in the ſight of God, <hi>viz.</hi> oppreſſion carried to ſuch exceſs, as to be even deſtructive of the human ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>At preſent the inhumanity of conſtrained labour in exceſs, extends no farther in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, than to our beaſts, as poſt and hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney horſes, ſand aſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thanks to our laws, and not to the general good diſpoſition of maſters, that it is ſo, for the wretch, who is bad enough to mal-treat a helpleſs beaſt, would not ſpare his fellow man, if he had him as much in his power.</p>
                  <p>The maintenance of civil liberty, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, abſolutely neceſſary to prevent an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our national guilt, by the addition of the horrid crime of tyranny.—Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the plea of neceſſity cannot here be urged, yet this is no reaſon why an increaſe of the practice is not to be feared.</p>
                  <p>Our North America colonies afford us a melancholy inſtance to the contrary;—for though the climate in general is ſo whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and temperate, that it will not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe this plea of neceſſity for the employment of ſlaves, any more than our own, yet the pernicious practice of ſlave-holding is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come almoſt general in thoſe parts. At New-York, for inſtance, the infringement on ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011985_0165_0F87EE9F99784768"/>
or domeſtic liberty is become notorious, notwithſtanding the political controverſies of the inhabitants in praiſe of liberty; but no panegyrick on this ſubject (howſoever elegant in itſelf) can be graceful, or edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the mouth, or pen of one of thoſe provincials; becauſe men, who do not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to detain others in ſlavery, have but a very partial and unjuſt claim to the protection of the laws of liberty; and indeed it too plainly appears, that they have no real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for liberty, farther than their own private intereſts are concerned; and (conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) that they have ſo little deteſtation for deſpotiſm and tyranny, that they do not ſcruple to exerciſe them whenever their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price excites them, or their private intereſt ſeems to require an exertion of their power over their miſerable ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>Every petty planter, who avails himſelf of the ſervice of ſlaves, is an arbitrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, or rather a lawleſs Baſhaw in his own territories, notwithſtanding that the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary freedom of the province wherein he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, may ſeem to forbid the obſervation.</p>
                  <p>The boaſted liberty of our American co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, therefore, has ſo little right to that ſacred name, that it ſeems to differ from the arbitrary power of deſpotic monarchs, only in one circumſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a <hi>many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed monſter of tyranny,</hi> which entirely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011985_0166_0F87EEA05977E9A8"/>
our moſt excellent conſtitution, becauſe liberty and ſlavery are ſo oppoſite to each other, that they cannot ſubſiſt in the ſame community. <q>
                        <hi>Political liberty (in mild or well regulated governments) makes civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty valuable; and whoſoever is deprived of the latter, is deprived alſo of the former.</hi>
                     </q> This obſervation of the learned Monteſquieu, I hope, ſufficiently juſtifies my cenſure of the Americans for their notorious violation of civil liberty.—The New-York Journal, or, The General Advertiſer, for Thurſday, 22d October 1767, Gives Notice by Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of no leſs than eight different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have eſcaped from ſlavery, or are put up to public ſale for that horrid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

Another Advertiſement in the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, contains a very particular deſcription of a Negroe man, called <hi>Jeremiah</hi>—, <q>and concludes as follows:—Whoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivers him to Capt.

And as ſuch a kind of people are ſuppoſed to undertake any thing for money, the Reward of thirty Guineas was tendered at the top of the Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in capital letters.

                  <p>This circumſtance of confining a man without a warrant, has ſo great a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the proceedings of a Popiſh inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that it is but too obvious what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practices ſuch ſcandalous innovations (if permitted to grow more into uſe) are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to introduce. No perſon can be ſafe, if wicked and deſigning men have it in their power, under the pretence of private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty as a ſlave, to throw a man clandeſtine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without a warrant into goal, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal him there, until they can conveniently diſpoſe of him.</p>
                  <p>A free man may be thus robbed of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and carried beyond the ſeas, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having the leaſt opportunity of making his caſe known; which ſhould teach us how jealous we ought to be of all impriſonments made without the authority, or previous examination of a civil magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>The diſtinction of colour will, in a ſhort
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011985_0171_0F87EEA419738890"/>
time, be no protection againſt ſuch outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, eſpecially, as not only Negroes, but Mullatoes, and even American Indians, (which appears by one of the Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before quoted) are retained in ſlavery in our American colonies; for there are many honeſt weather-beaten Engliſhmen, who have as little reaſon to boaſt of their complexion as the Indians. And indeed the more northern Indians, have no difference from us in complexion, but ſuch as is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the climate or different way of living. The plea of private property, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, cannot by any means juſtify a private commitment of any perſon whatſoever to to priſon, becauſe of the apparent danger and tendency of ſuch an innovation. This dangerous practice of concealing in priſon, was attempted in the caſe of Jonathan Strong; for the door-keeper of the P—lt—y C—pt—r (or ſome perſon who acted for him) abſolutely refuſed for two days to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this poor injured Negro to be ſeen or ſpoke with, though a perſon went on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe both thoſe days to demand the ſame.—All laws ought to be founded upon the principle of "<hi>doing as one would be done by,</hi>" and indeed this principle ſeems to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry baſis of the Engliſh conſtitution, for what precaution could poſſibly be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for that purpoſe, than the right we
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011985_0172_0F87EEA4D9676330"/>
enjoy of being judged by our Peers, credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perſons of the vicinage; eſpecially, as we may likewiſe claim the right of except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt any particular juryman, who might he ſuſpected of partiality.</p>
                  <p>This law breathes the pure ſpirit of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, equity and ſocial love; being calculated to maintain that conſideration and mutual regard, which one perſon ought to have for another howſoever unequal in rank or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But when any part of the community, under the pretence of private property, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this common privilege, 'tis a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of civil liberty, which is entirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the ſocial principles of a free ſtate.</p>
                  <p>True liberty protects the labourer, as well as his Lord; preſerves the dignity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and ſeldom fails to render a province rich and populous; whereas, on the other hand, a toleration of ſlavery is the higheſt breach of ſocial virtue, and not only tends to depopulation, but too often renders the minds of both maſters and ſlaves utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depraved and inhuman, by the hateful extremes of exaltation and depreſſion.</p>
                  <p>If ſuch a toleration ſhould ever be gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally admitted in England, (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) we ſhall no longer deſerve to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a civilized people; becauſe, when the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011985_0173_0F87EEA5996C4918"/>
cuſtoms of uncivilized nations, and the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilized cuſtoms which diſgrace our own colonies,</hi> are become ſo familiar, as to be permitted amongſt us with impunity, we ourſelves muſt inſenſibly degenerate to the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of baſeneſs with thoſe from whom ſuch bad cuſtoms were derived, and may too ſoon have the mortification to ſee the <hi>hateful extremes of tyranny and ſlavery foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered under every roof.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Then muſt the happy medium of a well regulated liberty be neceſſarily compelled to find ſhelter in ſome more civilized country, where ſocial virtue, and that divine precept, "<hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf,</hi>" are better underſtood.</p>
                  <p>An attempt to prove the dangerous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, injuſtice and diſgrace of tolerating ſlavery amongſt Engliſhmen, would in any former age have been eſteemed as ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ridiculous, as if a man ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake in a formal manner to prove, that darkneſs is not light.</p>
                  <p>Sorry am I, that the depravity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age has made a demonſtration of this kind neceſſary.</p>

                  <p>Note, at page 63. According to the laws of Jamaica printed at London in 1756. <q>If any ſlave having been one whole year in this iſland, (ſays an act, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 64, clauſe 5. p. 114) ſhall run away, and continue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from his owners ſervice for the ſpace of thirty days, upon complaint and proof &amp;c. before any two juſtices of the peace, and three freeholders, &amp;c. it ſhall and may be lawful for ſuch juſtices and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders to order ſuch ſlave to be puniſhed by <hi>cutting off one of the feet of ſuch ſlave,</hi> or inflict ſuch other corporal puniſhment as they <hi>ſhall think fit.</hi>
                     </q> Now that I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my readers what corporal puniſhments are ſometimes thought fit to be inflicted, I will refer to the teſtimony of ſir Hans Sloan, (ſee voyage to the iſlands of Madeira, Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, &amp;c. and Jamaica, with the natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the laſt of theſe iſlands, &amp;c. London
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011985_0175_0F87EEA719622F28"/>
1707. Introduction, p. 56, and 57.) <q>The puniſhment for crimes of ſlaves (ſays he) are uſually for <hi>rebellions</hi> burning them, by nailing them down on the ground with crooked ſticks, on every limb, and then applying the fire by degrees from the feet and hands, burning them gradually up to the head, whereby <hi>their pains are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant;</hi> for crimes of a leſſer nature <hi>gelding,</hi> or <hi>chopping off half the foot</hi> with an axe. Theſe puniſhments are ſuffered by them with great conſtancy.—For negligence, they are uſually whipped by the overſeers with lance-wood ſwitches, till they be bloody, and ſeveral of the ſwitches broken, being firſt tied up by their hands in the mill houſes.—Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are whipped till they are raw, ſome put on their ſkins pepper and ſalt, to make them ſmart; at other times their maſters will drop melted wax on their ſkins, and uſe ſeveral <hi>very exquiſite torments.</hi>
                     </q> Sir Hans adds, <q>Theſe puniſhments are ſometimes merited by the blacks, who are a very perverſe generation of people, and though they appear very harſh, yet are ſcarce equal to ſome of their crimes, and inferior to what puniſhments other Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean nations inflict on their ſlaves in the Eaſt-Indies, as may be ſeen by Moquet, and other travellers.</q> Thus ſir Hans Sloan
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011985_0176_0F87EEA7D9631D70"/>
endeavours to excuſe thoſe ſhocking cruelties, but certainly in vain: becauſe no crimes whatſoever can merit ſuch ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unleſs I except the crimes of thoſe who deviſe and inflict them. Sir Hans Sloan indeed, mentions <hi>rebellion,</hi> as the principal crime, and certainly it is very juſtly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a moſt heinous crime, in a land of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where government is limited by equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and juſt laws, if the ſame are tolerably well obſerved; but in countries where ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power is exerciſed with ſuch intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cruelty, as is before deſcribed, if reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be a crime, it is certainly the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural of all others.</p>
                  <p>But the 19th clauſe of the 38th act, would indeed on a ſlight peruſal induce us to conceive, that the puniſhment for rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not ſo ſevere as it is repreſented by ſir Hans Sloan; becauſe a ſlave, though <hi>deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rebellious,</hi> is thereby condemned to no greater puniſhment than tranſportation. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs if the clauſe be thoroughly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered we ſhall find no reaſon to commend the mercy of the legiſlature; for it only proves, that the Jamaica law-makers will not ſcruple to charge the ſlighteſt and moſt natural offences with the moſt opprobrious epithets; and that a poor ſlave who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps has no otherwiſe incurred his maſter's
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011985_0177_0F87EEA8995CC470"/>
diſpleaſure than by endeavouring (upon the juſt and warrantable principles of ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) to eſcape from his maſter's tyranny, without any criminal intention whatſoever, is liable to be <hi>deemed rebellious,</hi> and to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned as a capital offender. <q>For every ſlave, and ſlaves that ſhall run away and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue but for the ſpace of twelve months, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch ſlave or ſlaves as ſhall not have been three years in this iſland, ſhall be <hi>deemed rebellious,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. (ſee act 38, clauſe 19. p. 60.) Thus we are enabled to define what a Weſt Indian tyrant means by the word <hi>rebellious.</hi> But unjuſt as this clauſe may ſeem, yet it is abundantly more merciful and conſiderate than a ſubſequent act againſt the ſame poor miſerable people, becauſe the former aſſigns no other puniſhment for perſons ſo <hi>deemed rebellious</hi> than that they, "<hi>Shall be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported</hi> by order of two juſtices and three freeholders," &amp;c. whereas the latter ſpares not the blood of theſe poor injured fugitives: For by the 66th act, a reward of 50 pound is offered to thoſe who, <q>ſhall kill or bring in alive any <hi>rebellious ſlaves,</hi>
                     </q> that is, any of theſe unfortunate people whom the law has "<hi>deemed rebellious,</hi>" as above; and this premium is not only tendered to commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned parties (ſee 2d. clauſe) but even to any private "<hi>hunter, ſlave or other perſon,</hi>" (ſee 3d.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011985_0178_0F87EEA9595A9DA8"/>
Thus it is manifeſt, that the law treats theſe poor unhappy men with as little ceremony and conſideration, as if they were merely wild beaſts. But the innocent blood that is ſhed in conſequence of ſuch a deteſtable law, muſt certainly call for vengeance on the murderous abettors and actors of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate wickedneſs: And though many of the guilty wretches ſhould even be ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and abandoned as never afterwards to be capable of ſincere remorſe, yet a time will undoubtedly come, when they will ſhudder with dreadful apprehenſions, on account of the inſufficiency of ſo wretched an excuſe, as that their poor murdered brethren were by law "<hi>deemed rebellious.</hi>" But bad as theſe laws are, yet, in juſtice to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of Jamaica, I muſt acknowledge, that their laws are not near ſo cruel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human as the laws of Barbadoes and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, and ſeem at preſent, to be much more reaſonable than they have formerly been, many very oppreſſive laws being now expired, and others leſs ſevere enacted in their room.</p>
                  <p>But it is far otherwiſe in Barbadoes; for by the 329th act, p. 125. <q>If any Negro or other ſlave, under puniſhment by his maſter, or his order, for running away, or any other crimes, or miſdemeanors to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

his ſaid maſter, unfortunately ſhall ſuffer in life, or member, (which ſeldom happens) (but it is plain by this law that it does ſometimes happen) <hi>no perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall be liable to any fine therefore, but if any man ſhall, of wantonneſs, or only of bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mindedneſs, or cruel intention, wilfully kill a Negro or other ſlave of his own.</hi>
                     </q>—Now the reader, to be ſure, will naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that ſome very ſevere puniſhment muſt in this caſe be ordained, to deter, the <hi>wanton, bloody minded, and cruel</hi> wretch from <hi>wilfully killing</hi> his fellow creatures; but alas! the Barbadian law-makers have been ſo far from intending to curb ſuch aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned wickedneſs, that they have abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made this law on purpoſe to ſkreen theſe enormous crimes from the juſt indignation of any righteous perſon, who might think himſelf bound in duty to proſecute a bloody minded villain; they have, therefore, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumptuouſly taken upon them to give a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it were, by law, to the horrid crime of wilful murder; and have accordingly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that he who is guilty of it in Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, though the act ſhould be attended with all the aggravating circumſtances before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, "<hi>ſhall pay into the publick treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (no more than) <hi>fifteen pounds ſterling;</hi>" but if he ſhall kill another man's, he ſhall pay to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011985_0180_0F87EEAAD959E228"/>
the owner of the Negro, double the value, and into the public treaſury, <hi>twenty five pounds ſterling,</hi> and he ſhall further, by the next juſtice of the peace, be bound to his good behaviour, during the pleaſure of the governor and council, <hi>and not be liable to any other puniſhment or forfeiture for the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt conſummate wickedneſs, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that any body of people, under the ſpecious form of a legiſlature were ever guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of: This act contains ſeveral other clauſes which are ſhocking to humanity, though too tedious to mention here.</p>
                  <p>According to an act of Virginia (4 Anne ch. 49. ſec. 37. P. 227.) <q>after proclamation is iſſued againſt ſlaves that run away and lie out, it is lawful for any perſon whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>to kill and deſtroy ſuch ſlaves by ſuch ways and means as he, ſhe, or they ſhall think fit,</hi> without accuſation or impeachment of any crime for the ſame,</q> &amp;c. And leſt private intereſt ſhould incline the planter to mercy, (to which we muſt ſuppoſe ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can have no other inducement) it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and enacted in the ſucceeding clauſe, (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 38.) <q>That for <hi>every ſlave killed,</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this act, or <hi>put to death by law,</hi> the maſter, or owner of ſuch ſlave, <hi>ſhall be paid by the public.</hi>

Alſo by an act of Virginia (9 Geo. I. ch. 4. ſect. 18. p. 343) it is ordained, <q>That, where any ſlave ſhall hereafter be found notoriouſly guilty of going abroad in the night, or running away, and lying out, and cannot be reclaimed from <hi>ſuch</hi> diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly courſes by the common method of puniſhment, it ſhall and may be lawful, to and for the court of the county upon complaint and proof thereof to them made by the owner of ſuch ſlave, to order and direct every ſuch ſlave to be puniſhed by <hi>diſmembering or any other</hi> way, not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, as the ſaid county court <hi>ſhall think fit.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I have already given examples enough of the horrid cruelties which are ſometimes <hi>thought fit</hi> on ſuch occaſions. But if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and moſt natural act of <q>

"<hi>Having their conſciences ſeared with a hotiron,</hi>" they ſeem to have loſt all apprehenſions that their ſlaves are men, for they ſcruple not to number them with beaſts. See an

act of Barbadoes, (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 333. p. 128.) intitled, <q>An act for the better regulating of <hi>outcries,</hi> in open market, here we read of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, cattle, coppers, and ſtills, and other chattels,</hi> brought by execution to open market to be outcried,</q> and theſe (as if all of equal importance) are ranged together "<hi>in great lots or numbers to be ſold.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>—Page 70. In the 329 act of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does (p. 122) it is aſſerted, that, <q>brutiſh ſlaves deſerve not, for the baſeneſs of their condition, to <hi>be tried by a legal trial of twelve men of their peers or neighbourhood,</hi> which neither truly can be rightly done, as the ſubjects of England are;</q> (yet ſlaves alſo are ſubjects of England, whilſt they remain within the Britiſh dominions, notwithſtanding this inſinuation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) <q>nor is execution to be delay'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, in caſe of ſuch horrid crimes committed,</q> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A ſimilar doctrine is taught in an act of Virginia, (9 Geo. I. ch. 4. ſect. 3. p. 339.) wherein it is ordained, <q>that every ſlave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch offence as by the laws ought to be puniſhed by death or loſs of member, ſhall be forth with committed to the common goal of the county, &amp;c. And the ſheriff of ſuch county, upon ſuch commitment, ſhall forthwith certify the ſame,</q> with the cauſe
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011985_0183_0F87EEAD1954D918"/>
thereof, to the governor or commander in chief, &amp;c. who is thereupon deſired and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to iſſue a commiſſion of oyer and terminer; <hi>To ſuch perſons as he ſhall think fit;</hi> which perſons, forthwith after the receipt of ſuch commiſſion, are impowered and requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cauſe the offender to be publicly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned and tried, &amp;c. without the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a jury, &amp;c. Now let us conſider the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tendency of thoſe laws. As Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we ſtrenuouſly contend for this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and immutable neceſſity of trials by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: but is not the ſpirit and equity of this old Engliſh doctrine entirely loft, if we partially confine that juſtice to ourſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, when we have it in our power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to others? The natural right of all mankind muſt principally juſtify our inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this neceſſary privilege in favour of ourſelves in particular, and therefore if we do not allow that the judgment of an impartial jury is indiſpenſably neceſſary in all caſes whatſoever, wherein the life of man is depending, we certainly undermine the equitable force and reaſon of thoſe laws, by which <hi>we ourſelves are protected,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are unworthy to be eſteemed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtians or Engliſhmen.</p>
                  <p>Whatever right the members of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial aſſembly may have to enact <hi>bye laws,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="unknown:011985_0184_0F87EEADD9543CD8"/>
for particular exigences among themſelves, yet in ſo doing, they are certainly bound in duty to their ſovereign, to obſerve moſt ſtrictly, the fundamental principles of that conſtitution, which his majeſty is ſworn to maintain; for whereſoever the bounds of the Britiſh empire are extended, there the common law of England muſt of courſe take place, and cannot be ſafely ſet aſide by any <hi>private law</hi> whatſoever, becauſe the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of an unnatural tyranny muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily endanger the king's dominions. The many alarming inſurrections of ſlaves in the ſeveral colonies, are ſufficient proofs of this. The common law of England ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſo eſtabliſhed in every province, as to include the reſpective <hi>bye laws</hi> of each province; inſtead of being by them <hi>excluded</hi> which latter has been too much the caſe.</p>
                  <p>Every inhabitant of the Britiſh colonies, black as well as white, bond as well as free, are undoubtedly the <hi>king's ſubjects,</hi> during their reſidence within the limits of the king's dominions, and as ſuch, are entitled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal protection, however bound in ſervice to their reſpective maſters. Therefore, when any of theſe are put to death, <q>
                        <hi>without the ſolemnity of a jury,</hi>
                     </q> I fear that there is too much reaſon to attribute <hi>the guilt of murder,</hi> to every perſon concerned in ordering the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011985_0185_0F87EEAE995248D8"/>

If ſuch laws are not abſolutely neceſſary for the government of ſlaves, the law-makers muſt unavoidably allow themſelves to be the moſt cruel and abandoned tyrants upon earth, or perhaps, that ever were on earth. On the other hand, if it be ſaid, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to govern ſlaves without ſuch inhuman ſeverity and deteſtable injuſtice, the ſame will certainly be an invincible argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the leaſt toleration of ſlavery amongſt chriſtians, becauſe the temporal profit of the planter or maſter, however lucrative, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compenſate the forfeiture of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting welfare, or (at leaſt I may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay) the apparent danger of ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.</p>
                  <p>Oppreſſion is a moſt grievous crime; and the cries of theſe much injured people (though they are only poor ignorant hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens) will certainly reach heaven!

                  <p>GEORGE WALLIS, in his <hi>ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of the principles of the laws of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſpeaking of the ſlavery of the Negroes in our colonies, ſays "We all know that they (the <hi>Negroes</hi>) are purchaſed from their Princes, who pretend to have a right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them, and that they are, like other commodities, tranſported by the merchants who have bought them, into <hi>America,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be expoſed to ſale. If this trade ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a moral or a rational juſtification, every crime, even the moſt atrocious, may be juſtified. Government was inſtituted for the good of mankind; kings, princes, governors, are not proprietors of thoſe who are ſubject to their authority; they have not a right to make them miſerable. On the contrary, their authority is veſted in them, that they may, by the juſt exerciſe of it, promote the happineſs of their people. Of courſe, they have not a right to diſpoſe of their liberty, and to ſell them for ſlaves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,

no man has a right to acquire or to purchaſe them; men and their liberty are not (<hi>in commercio</hi>) they are not either ſaleable or purchaſable. One, therefore, has nobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but himſelf to blame, in caſe he ſhall find himſelf deprived of a man, whom he thought he had, by buying for a price, made his own; for he dealt in a trade which was illicit, and was prohibited by the moſt obvious dictates of humanity. For theſe reaſons every one of thoſe unfortunate men who are pretended to be ſlaves, has a right to be declared to be free, for he never loſt his liberty; he could not loſe it; his prince had no power to diſpoſe of him. Of courſe the ſale was <hi>ipſo jure</hi> void. This right he carries about with him, and is entitled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where to get it declared. As ſoon, therefore, as he comes into a country in which the judges are not forgetful of their own humanity, it is their duty to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he is a man, and to declare him to be free. I know it has been ſaid, that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions concerning the ſtate of perſons ought to be determined by the law of the country to which they belong; and that, therefore, one who would be declared to be a ſlave in <hi>America,</hi> ought, in caſe he ſhould happen to be imported <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

more barbarous. Ought the judges of any country, out of reſpect to the law of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſhew no reſpect to their kind, and to humanity; out of reſpect to a law, which is in no ſort obligatory upon them, ought they to diſregard the law of nature, which is obligatory on all men at all times, and in all places: Are any laws ſo binding as the eternal laws of juſtice? Is it doubtful, whether a judge ought to pay greater regard to them, than to thoſe arbitrary and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man uſages which prevail in a diſtant land? Aye, but our colonies would be ruined if ſlavery was aboliſhed. Be it ſo; would it not from thence follow, that the bulk of mankind ought to be abuſed, that our pockets may be filled with money, or our mouths with delicacies? The purſes of highwaymen would be empty in caſe robberies were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally aboliſhed; but have men a right to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire money by going out to the highway? Have men a right to acquire it by rendering their fellow creatures miſerable? Is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to abuſe mankind, that the avarice, the vanity, or the paſſions of a few may be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified? No!

therefore our colonies be ruined, but let us not render ſo many men miſerable. Would not any of us, who ſhould—be ſnatched by pirates from his native land, think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cruelly abuſed, and at all times entitled to be free. Have not theſe unfortunate <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> who meet with the ſame cruel fate, the ſame right?

Let us not, therefore, defend or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a uſage which is contrary to all the laws of humanity.</p>
                  <p>But it is falſe, that either we or our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies would be ruined by the abolition of ſlavery. It might occaſion a ſtagnation of buſineſs for a ſhort time. Every great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration produces that effect; becauſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind cannot, on a ſudden, find ways of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of themſelves and of their affairs: But it would produce many happy effects.

Let the Negroes free, and in a few generations, this vaſt and fertile conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent would be crowded with inhabitants; learning, arts, and every thing would flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh amongſt them; inſtead of being inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by wild beaſts, and by ſavages, it would be peopled by philoſophers, and by men."</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But, notwithſtanding this, we ourſelves (who profeſs to be chriſtians, and boaſt of the peculiar advantage we enjoy, by means of an expreſs revelation of our duty from heaven) are in effect, theſe very untaught and rude heathen countries. With all our ſuperior light, we inſtil into thoſe, whom we call ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage and barbarous, the moſt deſpicable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of human nature. We, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our power, weaken and diſſolve the univerſal tie, that binds and unites mankind. We practice what we ſhould exclaim againſt, as the utmoſt exceſs of cruelty and tyranny, if nations of the world, differing in colour, and form of government from ourſelves, were ſo poſſeſſed of empire, as to be able to reduce us to a ſtate of unmerited and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſervitude. Of conſequence we ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice our reaſon, our humanity, our chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to an unnatural ſordid gain.

to prevent the propagation of the goſpel, by repreſenting it as a ſcheme of power and barbarous oppreſſion, and an enemy to the natural privileges and rights of men.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps all, that I have now offered, may be of very little weight to reſtrain this enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, this aggravated iniquity.

                  <head>EXTRACT From an ADDRESS IN THE VIRGINIA GAZETTE, of MARCH 19, 1767.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Mr. RIND,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>PERMIT me, in your paper, to addreſs the members of our aſſembly, on two points, in which the public intereſt is very nearly concerned.</p>
                  <p>The abolition of ſlavery and the retriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of ſpecie in this colony, are the ſubjects on which I would beſpeak their attention.—</p>
                  <p>Long and ſerious reflections upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conſequences of ſlavery have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me, that it is a violation both of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and religion; that it is dangerous to the ſafety of the community in which it prevails; that it is deſtructive to the growth of arts and ſciences; and laſtly, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a numerous and very fatal train of vices, both in the ſlave, and in his maſter.</p>
                  <p>To prove theſe aſſertions, ſhall be the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the following eſſay.</p>
                  <p>That ſlavery then is a violation of juſtice,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011985_0198_0F8DA1B2754E9B40"/>
will plainly appear, when we conſider what juſtice is. It is truly and ſimply defined, as by <hi>Juſtinian, conſtans et perpetua volun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>as, ejus ſuum cuique tribuendi;</hi> a conſtant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give every man his right.</p>
                  <p>Now, as freedom is unqueſtionably the birthright of all mankind, <hi>Africans</hi> as well as <hi>Europeans,</hi> to keep the former in a ſtate of ſlavery, is a conſtant violation of that right, and therefore of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The ground on which the civilians who favour ſlavery, admit it to be juſt; namely, conſent, force and birth, is totally diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For ſurely a man's own will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, cannot be allowed to introduce ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant an innovation into ſociety as ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or to make himſelf an outlaw, which is really the ſtate of a ſlave, ſince neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to, nor aiding the laws of the ſociety, in which he lives, he is neither bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them, nor entitled to their protection.</p>
                  <p>To found any right in force, is to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate all right, and involve every thing in confuſion, violence and rapine. With theſe two the laſt muſt fall, ſince if the parent cannot juſtly be made a ſlave, neither can the child be born in ſlavery. "The law of nations, ſays baron <hi>Monteſquieu,</hi> has doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed priſoners to ſlavery, to prevent their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlain; the <hi>Roman</hi> civil law, permitted debtors whom their creditors might treat
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011985_0199_0F87EE44DA20B880"/>
ill, to ſell themſelves. And the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires that children, whom their parents being ſlaves cannot maintain, ſhould be ſlaves like them. Theſe reaſons of the civilians are not juſt, it is not true that a captive may be ſlain, unleſs in a caſe of abſolute neceſſity; but if he hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſlavery, it is plain that no ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity exiſted, ſince he was not ſlain. It is not true that a free man can ſell himſelf, for ſale ſuppoſes a price, but a ſlave and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty becomes immediately that of his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſlave can therefore receive no price, nor the maſter pay, &amp;c. And if a man cannot ſell himſelf, nor a priſoner of war be reduced to ſlavery, much leſs can his child." Such are the ſentiments of this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious civilian; his reaſonings, which I have been obliged to contract, the reader in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in this ſubject, will do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult at large.</p>
                  <p>Yet even theſe rights of impoſing ſlavery, queſtionable, nay refutable as they are, we have not to authorize the bondage of the <hi>Africans.</hi> For neither do they conſent to be our ſlaves, nor do we purchaſe them of their conquerors. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> merchants obtain them from <hi>Africa</hi> by violence, artifice and treachery, with a few trinkets to prompt thoſe unfortunate****people to enſlave one another by force or ſtratagem. Purchaſe
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011985_0200_0F87EE459A1EC480"/>
them indeed they may, under the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an act of the Britiſh parliament. An act entailing upon the <hi>Africans,</hi> with whom we are not at war, and over whom a Britiſh parliament could not of right aſſume even a ſhadow of authority, the dreadful curſe of perpetual ſlavery, upon them and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for ever. <hi>There cannot be in nature, there is not in all hiſtory, an inſtance in which every right of men is more flagrantly violated.</hi> The laws of the antients never authorized the making ſlaves, but of thoſe nations whom they had conquered; yet they were heathens and we are chriſtians. They were miſled by a monſtrous religion, diveſted of humanity, by a horrible and barbarous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; we are directed by the unerring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the revealed religion we poſſeſs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by its wiſdom, and humanized by its benevolence; before them were gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with paſſions, and horrible for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cruelty and vice; before us is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable pattern of meekneſs, charity, love and juſtice to mankind, which ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently diſtinguiſhed the founder of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity and his ever amiable doctrines.</p>
                  <p>Reader, remember that the corner ſtone of your religion is to do unto others as you would they ſhould do unto you; aſk then your own heart whether it would not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor any one, as the moſt outrageous viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011985_0201_0F87EE465A2125E0"/>
of that and every other principle of right, juſtice and humanity, who ſhould make a ſlave of you and your poſterity for ever. Remember that God knoweth the heart, lay not this flattering unction to your ſoul, that it is the cuſtom of the country; that you found it ſo: that not your will but your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity conſents. Ah! think how little ſuch an excuſe will avail you in that awful day, when your Saviour ſhall pronounce judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on you for breaking a law too plain to be miſunderſtood, too ſacred to be violated. If we ſay we are chriſtians, yet act more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly and unjuſtly than heathens, with what dreadful juſtice muſt this ſentence of our bleſſed Saviour fall upon us: "Not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my father which is in heaven." (<hi>Matthew</hi> vii. 21.) Think a moment how much your temporal, your eternal welfare depends upon an abolition of a practice, which deforms the image of your God, tramples on his revealed will, infringes the moſt ſacred rights, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates humanity.</p>
                  <p>Enough I hope has been aſſerted to prove that ſlavery is a violation of juſtice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. That it is dangerous to the ſafety of the ſtate in which it prevails, may be as ſafely aſſerted.</p>

What one's own experience has not taught, that of others muſt decide. From hence does hiſtory derive its utility; for being, when truly written, a faithful record of the tranſactions of mankind, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that flowed from them, we are thence furniſhed with the means of judging what will be the probable effect of tranſactions ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar among ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>We learn then from hiſtory, that ſlavery, wherever encouraged, has ſooner or later been productive of very dangerous commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I will not trouble my reader here with quotations in ſupport of this aſſertion, but content myſelf with referring thoſe who may be dubious of its truth, to the hiſtories of <hi>Athens, Lacedemon, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>How long, how bloody and deſtructive was the conteſt between the Mooriſh ſlaves, and the native Spaniards? and after almoſt deluges of blood had been ſhed the Spaniards obtained nothing more, than driving them into the mountains.—Leſs bloody in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, tho' not leſs alarming have been the inſurrections in Jamaica; and to imagine that we ſhall be for ever exempted from this calamity, which experience teaches us to be inſeparable from ſlavery, ſo encouraged, is an infatuation as aſtoniſhing as it will be ſurely fatal.—&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>EXTRACT OF A SERMON, PREACHED BY THE BISHOP OF GLOUCESTER, Before the SOCIETY for the PROPAGATION of the GOSPEL, at their anniverſary meeting, on the 21ſt of February, 1766.</head>
                  <p>FROM the free-ſavages I now come (the laſt point I propoſe to conſider) to the ſavages in bonds. By theſe I mean the vaſt multitudes yearly ſtolen from the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite continent, and ſacrificed by the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts to their great idol, the GOD OF GAIN. But what then, ſay theſe ſincere worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of <hi>Mammon,</hi> they are our own property, which we offer up. Gracious God! to talk (as in herds of cattle) of property in rational creatures! creatures endowed with all our faculties, poſſeſſing all our qualities but that of colour; our brethren both by nature and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:011985_0204_0F87EE489A1C8260"/>
grace, ſhocks all the feelings of humanity, and the dictates of common ſenſe. But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! what is there in the infinite abuſes of ſociety which does not ſhock them? Yet nothing is more certain in itſelf, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to all, than that the infamous traffic for ſlaves directly infringes both divine and human law. Nature created man free; and grace invites him to aſſert his freedom. In excuſe of this violation, it hath been pretended, that though indeed theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable outcaſts of humanity be torn from their homes and native country by fraud and violence, yet they thereby become the happier, and their condition the more eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But who are YOU, who pretend to judge of another man's happineſs? That ſtate, which each man, under the guidance of his maker, forms for himſelf; and not one man for another. To know what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes mine or your happineſs, is the ſole prerogative of him who created us, and caſt us in ſo various and different moulds. Did your ſlaves ever complain to you of their unhappineſs amidſt their native woods and deſarts? Or, rather, let me aſk, did they ever ceaſe complaining of their condition under you their lordly maſters? where they ſee, indeed, the accommodations of civil life, but ſee them all paſs to others, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, unbenefited by them. Be ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011985_0205_0F87EE495A18C558"/>
then, ye petty tyrants over human free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to let your ſlaves judge for themſeves, what it is which makes their own happineſs. And then ſee whether they do not place it in the return to their own country, rather than in the contemplation of your grandeur, of which their miſery makes ſo large a part. A return ſo paſſionately longed for, that deſpairing of happineſs here, that is, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping the chains of their cruel taſk maſters, they conſole themſelves with feigning it to be the gracious reward of heaven in their future ſtate; which I do not find their haughty maſters have as yet concerned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to invade. The leſs hardy indeed wait for this felicity till overwearied nature ſets them free; but the more reſolved have recourſe even to ſelf-violence, to force a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier paſſage.</p>
                  <p>But it will be ſtill urged, that though what is called human happineſs be of ſo fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic a nature, that each man's imagination creates it for himſelf, yet human mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Now, from the worſt of human miſeries, the ſavage <hi>Africans</hi> by theſe forced emigrations, are intirely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, ſuch as the being perpetually hunted down like beaſts of prey or profit, by their more ſavage and powerful neighbours—In

truth, a bleſſed change!—from being hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to being caught. But who are they that have ſet on foot this general HUNTING? Are they not theſe very civilized vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of humanity themſelves? who tempt the weak appetites, and provoke the wild paſſions of the fiercer ſavages to prey upon the reſt."</p>
