            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS,&amp;c.</head>
            <p>MANKIND in every age, and at every period of the world, have been unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in their ſentiments concerning Liberty, which they have univerſally eſteemed as one of the moſt ſacred and invaluable bleſſings,—as a right naturally belonging to all,—and of which no human authority could poſſibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them. The human mind ſeems to have implanted in it by nature, a certain deſire after Freedom, which rendering the ſmalleſt degree of confinement or reſtraint, irkſome and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, appears to have been given for the very purpoſe of ſecuring us in that ſtate of Liberty and Independence, wherein we were all born, and to which we have all indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately a claim. But cuſtom, whoſe laws are arbitrary and tyrannical, has gained to great
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:044751_0005_101F01C8ADD96958"/>
an aſcendency over our reaſon, that we are not ſurprized when we behold the moſt civilized and enlightened nations, deviating from thoſe ſimple and invariable rules of nature which muſt be perceptible even to the moſt ignorant and unlearned people. Blinded by it, the moſt virtuous and reſpectable people, have rendered themſelves contemptible, and degenerated into viciouſneſs; and under its influence, we may at preſent behold the virtuous citizens of America, giving their ſanction to a practice, which, in the criminality and injuſtice of its nature, has not been exceeded by the people of the moſt barbarous ages.</p>
            <p>THE Slavery of the unfortunate Africans, is the practice to which I advert. It is a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the moſt ſhameful and inhuman nature, and demands the attention of every citizen who would wiſh to be eſteemed either virtuous or honeſt; for honeſtly does not always conſiſt in a ſtrict adherence to the laws, which are frequently defective in their nature, and in many inſtances give ſanction to the moſt frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent dealings. In order to avoid error, and the commiſſion of injuſtice, we need only to conſult our own boſoms; where the virtuous and honeſt man will meet with an approbation
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:044751_0006_101F01CB74D5F870"/>
of his conduct; and the vicious and diſhoneſt man, although patronized and protected by the laws, will meet with reprehenſion, for his diſhoneſty and baſeneſs. It is to this tribunal, and not to that of the laws, that I wiſh to ſubmit the propriety of the practice at preſent in debate. For although by the laws of our country we may be licenſed in the enſlaving of the Negroes, and in treating them in what manner we pleaſe, nevertheleſs, as thoſe laws are of our own creation, and may conſequently be replete with error and injuſtice, it becomes thoſe who are the authors thereof, to inſpect into the nature of them, and to abrogate whatever part of them may be improper, or inconſiſtent with thoſe ſuperior laws of nature; on which all laws, if either rightful or juſt, muſt indubitably be founded.</p>
            <p>THAT all men have naturally a right to Liberty, and that to deprive them of it, is the moſt arbitrary and unauthorized extenſion of power (even if there were no other laws in exiſtence which reſpected it, and if our own reaſon did not very evidently point it out to us) muſt moſt manifeſtly appear from the repeated declarations of our Congreſs, and the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the different States; all of which, in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:044751_0007_101F01CE12B39900"/>
the moſt poſitive manner aſſert, that all men are poſſeſſed of certain natural, inherent rights, of which they cannot be diveſted, but by the moſt arbitrary and unjuſtifiable meaſures.</p>
            <p>IT is an invariable and an undoubted max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, that wherever there is a right exiſting on the one part, there muſt neceſſarily be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation on the other; that is, if the Negroes are rightfully entitled to their liberty, there is a conſequent obligation on us, not to injure or moleſt them in the peaceable enjoyment of it, ſince it would be the height of abſurdity to ſuppoſe that they could poſſeſs a juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable title to their freedom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that we could at the ſame time be poſſeſſed of an equal right of depriving them of it.</p>
            <p>THE only queſtion therefore which can ariſe on a mature conſideration of the ſubject, is in my opinion this, Are the Negroes men? For if they be men, and if all men have a right to liberty, as is univerſally acknowledged, and as you alſo moſt particularly aſſert, they muſt indubitably, as men, be entitled to a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of that right; and you, conſequently, nor no other nation in the world, can right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deprive them of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:044751_0008_101F01CF9D37EB60"/>UNDER what pretext then do we retain them; or rather, with what juſtice did we at firſt reduce them from a ſtate of liberty, to that of the moſt abject ſervitude? For ſince we cannot poſſibly diſcover in the laws of nature, which are the baſis of all rightful laws, any rightful power which we can have, to exerciſe the ſmalleſt degree of authority over the Africans, more than over any other nation in the world, thoſe perſons who can perſuade themſelves that the enſlaving them is not one of the moſt unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and inhuman practices that ever cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized the people of any country, or time, muſt either be entirely deveſted of every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of humanity,—or muſt be ſo extremely ignorant as to ſuppoſe that the Creator of the univerſe made a diſcrimination between the White People and the Negroes, with reſpect to their privileges, and that he gave the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence to the White People; to whom it became the Negroes, either on account of their unbecoming colour, or as M. Monteſcue very ironically obſerves, of their ſhort and curly hair, to be obedient and ſubmiſſive;—a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which however ridiculous it may be, is nevertheleſs not more ſo than many others which are uſed by the proprietors of Negroes, in vindication of their conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:044751_0009_101F01D23B696578"/>THE introduction of the Negroes into this country, was one of the greateſt proofs which the Britiſh crown could give, of their tyranny and baſeneſs. In order to increaſe the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the country, they did not think it ſufficient to ſend over a number of criminals, who being detrimental to ſociety were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of living longer in their own country, but alſo by the eſtabliſhment of the Guinea trade, ſent over thouſands of miſerable wretches, over whom we were privileged to exerciſe the moſt unlimited authority, for the purpoſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the wealth and richneſs of the then colonies, and the conſequent advantages to the mother country. This traffic obtained imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the countenance of the laws, by means of the Britiſh governors on the continent, who ſtudious only of the intereſt of the crown, were ready to adopt any meaſures which might have a tendency to increaſe it. But however fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant the injuſtice, or however glaring the inſolence of the meaſure, I am ſorry to obſerve that they have paſſed away entirely unnoticed; and that altho' free, we ſtill purſue a practice which would have rendered us contemptible, even as the ſubjects of a different power. Many of our citizens are irrational enough
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:044751_0010_101F01D51302FD38"/>
or at leaſt are ſo blinded by their intereſt, as to imagine t hat the purchaſe of the Negroes from the Britiſh, or thoſe acting under their authority, was ſufficient of itſelf to afford a rightful and compleat title, not only to them but alſo to their poſterity forever. But thoſe perſons might, with as much propriety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the purchaſe of any article from a thief, who had wrongfully gotten it into his poſſeſſion, would have an effect to deprive the original poſſeſſor of his right, and to veſt it in the purchaſer; which would be entirely to overthrow that juſt, tho' ſimple maxim, which informs us that no man can give that which is not his own; and would open a field to the commiſſion of every ſpecies of diſhoneſty and fraud.</p>
            <p>IT muſt unavoidably inſpire with horror, a mind poſſeſt of the moſt trifling portion of ſenſibility, to reflect on the many and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous cruelties which have been practiſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe ignorant and inoffenſive people, by the conſent of our government, and under the ſanction of our laws. The wars which have been carried on among them for a ſeries of years, have taken their riſe, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, from the lucrative diſpoſitions of thoſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:044751_0011_101F01D9C82CA6C0"/>
nations which may have promiſed to themſelves a conſiderable profit from the ſale of thoſe whom they might have captured from another nation, leſs numerous and leſs powerful than themſelves.</p>
            <p>THE barbarous and uncivilized people make war, and the civilized and enlightened people ſhare with the victorious in the cruel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable conſequences of it. It is true that we have not been ſpectators, but we may very eaſily form a judgment of the horrors and diſtreſs which have been the neceſſary and inevitable conſequences of those ſavage wars. Our ears have not been ſaluted by the groans of wounded and of dying wretches, nor have our eyes beheld the outrages and devaſtations which have been committed by the conquerors, on the country of the vanquiſhed. We hear not the ſighs of parents for their unfortunate children, nor the cries of children for their abſent parents; of whoſe protection and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, death or an extenſive ocean, muſt forever deprive them. We hear not the reiterated lamentations of the huſband for his wife, or of the wife for her huſband; but we behold thoſe very perſons when they arrive in our country, where, with all theſe agonizing and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:044751_0012_101F01DCA1DDA5B0"/>
torturing reflections,—after having been drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged away from their friends, relations, and every thing that could be dear to them,—after having been caſt into a nauſeous dungeon, and brought through tempeſtuous ſeas, inſtead of meeting with a little conſolation, or receiving ſomething which might in ſome degree, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for their liberty, they are compelled to labour continually in the fields, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all the additional miſeries and diſtreſs of which the human mind is ſuſceptible; and to ſuffer the moſt excruciating tortures the body can poſſibly endure, or the unrelenting hand of cruelty can inflict. But not content with the barbarity and injuſtice which we exerciſe upon the fathers, we have extended our inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity ſtill farther, towards their guiltleſs and unoffending offsprings. From whom do we derive an authority over <hi>them</hi>? Is the unborn infant, involved alſo in the fate of its unhappy parent? Is it becauſe diſtant from its country and its friends, cut off from every right and every privilege of Men? Or do we rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ourſelves beings of a ſuperior order, and determine to viſit upon it, and its poſterity forever, the calamities of its father?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:044751_0013_101F01DE2887BF68"/>IF we cannot juſtify ourſelves in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſuch acts as theſe, upon princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of right: If in the place of law or juſtice, we ſubſtitute violence and ſuperior force, then are we again returned to that ſtate of anarchy and diſorder, wherein one man may ſeize upon another's property, injure his perſon, or even take away his life, without the dread of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or the apprehenſion of being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to make the ſmalleſt degree of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the injury which he may have done. If force be our law, then do we ſubject our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the government of the Negroes, whenever by their numbers they may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered capable of exerciſing it. The law by which we hold them, being in their favour, we cannot reckon it unjuſt that they ſhould wreſt the rod of deſpotiſm from our hand, and inflict it with as little humanity on us as we have been accuſtomed to inflict it upon them.</p>
            <p>IF we would but conſider for a moment, the origin of the conteſt between Great-Britain and ourſelves, and would but condeſcend to compare their ſituation with reſpect to us, to our then ſituation with reſpect to what was at that time called the Mother Country, we ſhall be able to diſcover the injuſtice of our conduct
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:044751_0014_101F01E222632190"/>
towards the Africans, in a plainer and more conſpicuous light. What, in the firſt place, was the cauſe which induced us into that war?—a war, which although juſtifiable, was as cruel and unnatural as, that between a parent and a child. Was it not the apprehenſion which we entertained, of a diſpoſition in the Mother Country to incroach upon our natural Liberties, and to diveſt us of thoſe privileges to which all mankind are entitled, and which we conſidered as our birth-right? We were not in a ſituation ſimilar to that of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, nor could we apprehend that the Britiſh crown ever had it in contemplation to reduce us to ſuch an one; yet notwithſtanding, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of a juſt and lively ſenſe of our rights, we contemned the idea of being ſubject to the inſolence and caprice of a Parliament; and were led on to break every tye of relationſhip, of friendſhip and affection, rather than to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer tamely, what we conſidered as an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable exerciſe of power. But how much more deplorable than ours could have been, muſt be the ſituation of the Negroes in our country. They do not enjoy any of thoſe privileges which we eſteemed ſo eſſential to our exiſtence, as to hazard our lives in order
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:044751_0015_101F01E3A8A23CA8"/>
to obtain them. In point of liberty, they are by no means to be conſidered as ſuperior to the Brutes in our fields, and are inferior to thoſe who range the foreſts, and partake of nature's gifts. The world has at all times afforded us examples of licentiouſneſs and vice; but if we can reflect on all theſe, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which reſpect our fellow creatures, without commiſerating their fate, or making a ſingle effort, in order to relieve them of it, we may aſſure ourſelves that the hiſtory of our time will equal that of our moſt barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous predeceſſors, in the number of examples which it will furniſh both of licentiouſneſs and depravity.</p>
            <p>THE United States of America, have, by one of the moſt vigorous exertions that ever adorned the page of ancient or of modern hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, eſtabliſhed to themſelves that Liberty and Independence which they ſo ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; and to which, as men, they conceived they had a claim.—Their Legiſlators are the guardians of that Liberty; but how inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with the ſacred nature of their truſt, and the dignity of their ſtation, do they conduct themſelves! Whilſt with one hand they are vigorouſly ſupporting the ſtandard of Liberty,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:044751_0016_101F01E655C94540"/>
they are exerciſing with the other, the rod of Slavery and Deſpotiſm;—whilſt engaged in preſerving their conſtitutions from violation or infraction, they violate one of its moſt eſſential articles, and ſubvert the very baſis on which it is conſtructed. By their conſtitutions it is declared, that Liberty is inherently the property of all; and nevertheleſs, in open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that principle, (to which one would ſuppoſe they are not only bound by every tye of juſtice, but alſo of honor, to comply) they deprive more than two-thirds of their inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of their freedom, without being able to aſſign a ſingle reaſon for which they do it, or offering a ſingle argument in vindication of the meaſure.</p>
            <p>IF we properly conſider the principles by which the human mind is moſt generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, we ſhall be induced alſo to believe the injuſtice of this practice is not more flagrant, than its conſequences may in time be detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. The moſt ignorant and unenligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened nations may, like thoſe who have already become civilized and enlightened, emerge from their ſtate of ignorance and incogitancy, and be poſſeſt of the ſame ſentiments of their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and right, with thoſe who exiſt in a ſtate
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:044751_0017_101F01E7DAA4F028"/>
of liberty and refinement;—and ſhould the Negroes, while living in ſubjection to us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thoſe ſentiments, and be diveſted of thoſe ſervile notions by which they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent influenced, what ſhould we not have to apprehend from their indignation and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When created by a ſenſe of injuries ſuſtained, how dreadful, and how greatly to be apprehended, are the inſurrections of the injured;—imbecility, or a want of numbers, can alone be ſufficient to prevent them from gratifying their revenge, by retaliating fully on their oppreſſors. It would be prudent then to conſider well theſe conſequences, before the time come when we may probably experience them. If we have no regard to the juſtice, let us at leaſt pay ſome attention to the policy of our practices, which in the preſent inſtance would, I am convinced, be ſufficient to induce us to diveſt ourſelves of our property in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, as ſpeedily as poſſible; for the profits which are derived from them, are in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, too trifling to render it our intereſst to retain them.</p>
            <p>PROPORTIONABLE to the number of ſlaves, muſt be the quantity of one's land; and by how much the greater may be the number of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:044751_0018_101EFE88D6FA5EB8"/>
them, by ſo much the greater muſt be the quantity of proviſion, and the additional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences which attend a family; ſo that, as the profit is increaſed on the one hand, it is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalanced by the expences which inevitably attend it on the other. The number of the Negroes in the ſouthern States, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in that of Virgina, daily continues to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; while that of the White People, by reaſon of the emigrations to other parts of the country, continues as rapidly to decreaſe.—The poor man, whoſe land is already almoſt worn out by cultivation, induced to diſpoſe of it to his more wealthy neighbour, (whoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities for territory annually increaſing, is obliged to purchaſe that which may be moſt convenient to him) appropriates the money which he obtains by the ſale of his land, to the purchaſe of other in a more fertile country, where he may obtain a ſufficiency for himſelf, upon more moderate terms. This has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the very great emigrations which have been made, for ſeveral years paſt, from the adjacent States, to the ſettlement of Kentucke; where the fertility of the country, and the ſmallneſs of their taxable poſſeſſions, render their ſubſiſtence more eaſy, and conſequently their life more agreeable to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:044751_0019_101F01F0DD8576F0"/>THE Negroes will always in time of war, prove injurious to the country wherein they live; for being naturally inimical to thoſe who are their oppreſſors, they will avail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of every opportunity which may offer, of liberating themſelves from their oppreſſion: And as an enemy will never fail to ſeize every occaſion of the kind, we may with ſafety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Country or State which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes a conſiderable number of ſlaves, is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of defending itſelf againſt invaſions from abroad; and whenever attacked, will unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably become an eaſy conqueſt to its invaders.</p>
            <p>CONSIDERING every circumſtance therefore which relates both to policy and right, we are bound by the duty which we owe to humanity and ourſelves, to adopt the moſt immediate and effectual mode of aboliſhing a practice, in its nature ſo tyrannical, and ſo unworthy of mankind.—Let Liberty, of whom we have ſo rapturouſly ſpoken, and in whoſe cauſe we have ſo obſtinately fought, preſide univerſally over our country, and be the directreſs of our ſteps.—Let that patriotic ſpirit, of which we ſo greatly boaſt, diſplay itſelf in our conduct in the preſent inſtance; and then, and not till then, ſhall we be a virtuous and an honeſt
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:044751_0020_101F01F261D1E1F8"/>
people.—Let our conduct be always uniformly juſt as well towards our <hi>own</hi> citizens, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe of other nations.—Let this riſing country be forever an example of virtuous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm and unblemiſhed faith.—Expel from its ſhores the advocates of deſpotiſm and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; and as we have obtained our Liberty, <hi>ſo</hi> let us watch over and protect it.</p>
            <p>WHEN nations or individuals, act inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with thoſe principles by which they have profeſſed themſelves to be led and actuated, they render themſelves contemptible in the eyes of all who are ſpectators of their conduct; and deſtroy all the confidence and faith which might have been previouſly repoſed in them.</p>
            <p>AFTER the effuſion of ſo much blood in the defence of our rights, (which we did not conſider as peculiarly belonging to ourſelves, but as the unalienable property of all mankind) let us evince to the world that our ſentiments are equally noble with our declarations; that we are in reality guided by that love of Liberty which induced us into the field of battle, and that hatred of uſurpation with which our minds have apparently been fraught.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:044751_0021_101F01F3FA8FC688"/>THE memory of thoſe who have fallen in our cauſe, who have bled in the ſupport of our honor and our rights, requires that we ſhould be vigilant of what we have obtained, ſo that they may not have bled for us in vain; that a remembrance of the ranſom which they have given for our Liberty, may not be effaced from our minds; but that its benefits may be equally imparted to all our countrymen, and impartially diffuſed throughout all the States.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject is plain, and I ſhould conceive that it would be to doubt both your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and humanity, to expatiate longer on it, or to offer more arguments, in order to prove what in its nature is ſelf-evident and ſimple. What I have laid down for your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal, has been dictated by the higheſt zeal for your proſperity and welfare.—It has been dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by thoſe principles of humanity which I ſhall always eſteem it as the greateſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to poſſeſs; and although it ſhould be of no effect, and ſhould paſs away entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded, I ſhall conſole myſelf with this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable reflection,—"That my motives were commendable and good." On the contrary, ſhould it contribute in the leaſt to call up your
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:044751_0022_101F01F6979F2268"/>
conſideration on the ſubject, which is all that I conceive to be neceſſary to the acquiring ſo deſirable an end, I ſhall deem myſelf inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably happy and ſufficiently rewarded, in the abolition of a practice, which involves in it conſequences of ſo important a nature to the inhabitants of this Continent.</p>
