            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>While we ſcud before the wind;</l>
                  <l>Reef the mainſail, 'till it ceaſes,</l>
                  <l>While ſhe floats, boys, never mind.</l>
                  <l>On the larboard tack we venture,</l>
                  <l>And behold a craggy ſhore,</l>
                  <l>As the deſtin'd port we enter,</l>
                  <l>While the raging billows roar.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>True to honor and to duty,</l>
                  <l>All ſuch maxims ſailors boaſt,</l>
                  <l>Yet we drink to love and beauty,</l>
                  <l>And can give the ſeaman's toaſt:</l>
                  <l>"Wives and ſweethearts," on the ocean,</l>
                  <l>We all ſwig it to a man;</l>
                  <l>Fearing danger's all a notion,</l>
                  <l>Let us booze the flowing can.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The boatſwain piping, loudly thunders,</l>
                  <l>To your quarters ſore and aft;</l>
                  <l>The great guns ſpunge, prepare for wonders,</l>
                  <l>While, my lads the wind's abaft:</l>
                  <l>With grape, we can nine pounders rattle,</l>
                  <l>Naval heroes drink and ſing;</l>
                  <l>He that bravely falls in battle,</l>
                  <l>Gains more honor than a king:</l>

                  <l>JOVE'S a God of ten thouſand, the monarch I know,</l>
                  <l>Loves his bottle, girl, ſong, and a jeſt,</l>
                  <l>Has a monſt'rous regard for choice ſpirits below,</l>
                  <l>And is charm'd when his creatures are bleſt.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But he's vex'd when a fool takes it into his head,</l>
                  <l>That he's loſt if he meddles with pleaſure;</l>
                  <l>And thinks; too, the fellow confounded ill bred,</l>
                  <l>To refuſe when he offers the treaſure.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When a zealot has turn'd up the white of his eyes,</l>
                  <l>With long phiz, and a puritan ſtrain;</l>
                  <l>I have ſeen the God laugh; and in fun from the ſkies,</l>
                  <l>Make up mouths at the blockhead again.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then puſh round the bottle, let each give his ſong,</l>
                  <l>Wit, humour, and friendſhip attend us,</l>
                  <l>And while for enjoyment our paſſions are ſtrong,</l>
                  <l>Let's aſk not his Godſhip to mend us.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus we'll revel 'till morning peeps into our glaſs,</l>
                  <l>Then to ſcenes of new rapture remove,</l>
                  <l>To embrace with devotion a wife or a laſs,</l>
                  <l>And be bleſt on the boſom of love.</l>
