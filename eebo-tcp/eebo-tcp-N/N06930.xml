            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WE implore thee, O KING of kings, to crown with the bleſſings of heaven and earth our moſt gracious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord GEORGE III by Thy Grace King of Great Britain and Ireland and of all the dominions thereunto belonging, defender of the Faith, and throughout all his realms, ſupreme in all cauſes eccleſiaſtical and civil.

BLESS, O LORD, Her Royal Highneſs the Princeſs Dowager of WALES, and all the Royal Family: enrich them with thy heavenly Grace, and proſper them with all Happineſs.</p>
            <p>ILLUMINATE with the truth of thy doctrine the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of Thy moſt holy word and ſacraments, the ARCHBISHOPS, BISHOPS, PRIESTS and DEACONS of the Church of ENGLAND, and the Miniſters of all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant churches. Pour down upon them the continual dew of thy bleſſing, that they may be holy and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in their lives, and faithful ſtewards of Thy myſteries.</p>
            <p>BLESS the Nobility and Magiſtracy: endue them with grace and wiſdom, that they may all in their ſeveral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, maintain religion and virtue. In more eſpecial duty, We pray for His Excellency the GOVERNOUR of this Province, His Honour the Lieutenant-Governour, The Honourable Council, and Houſe of Repreſentatives. So bleſs them in their reſpective ſtations, that <q>wiſdom and knowledge may be the ſtability of our times, and the fear of Thee our treaſure.</q>

            <p>FATHER of Lights, from whom deſcendeth every good and perfect Gift, grace with thy divine favour and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten with Thy Spirit all ſeminaries of learning and religious Education; particularly the univerſities of EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLAND,

In all humility, conſcious of our own unworthineſs, we implore thy mercy, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and acceptance through the Merits and puiſſant Mediation of Thy Son JESUS CHRIST; TO WHOSE MOST SACRED NAME, and to the promoting of whoſe Glory and Kingdom, WE CONSECRATE THIS CHURCH, and ourſelves, the living Temples of the HOLY GHOST.

Grant ſucceſs to their chriſtian purpoſes for the advancement of True Religion: endue their Miſſionaries with fidelity to their truſt, a ſincere faith, unfeigned charity, and ſanctity of manners.

            </epigraph>
            <p>TO underſtand the nature and genius of the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is neceſſary to examine it in it's firſt principles and review it's original conſtitution: when in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of truth it had ſo divine an influence on the manners and hearts of it's profeſſors. In an enquiry of this kind, we may find great aſſiſtance from the whole book (and particularly from the above-cited paſſage) of the acts of the holy apoſtles: in which are recorded the firſt converſions to the faith, the arguments uſed by inſpired teachers, the doctrines and conduct which they held eſſential to the votaries of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>THE manners of chriſtians, the conditions of their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the conſtituent principles of the firſt church-ſociety, are expreſſed in the text, from the practice of the primitive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, with ſo much exactneſs; that an enquiry into them will furniſh a moſt perfect model for the forming a chriſtian ſociety on the maxims of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>THE firſt eſſential in the inſtitution of this amiable fraternity is ſtedfaſtneſs in the DOCTRINE of the Apoſtles.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:008789_0010_102FE2554C0141E8"/>
THE next is CHURCH-COMMUNION.</p>
            <p>THE third is the commemoration of their common Lord in the BREAKING OF BREAD or celebrating the holy euchariſt.</p>
            <p>THE fourth and laſt is PRAYER.</p>
            <p>BENEVOLENCE and purity of manners was the natural reſult of ſuch an inſtitution: and the church of JERUSALEM, the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and mother of all, was equally diſtinguiſhed by ſimplicity and innocence, virtue and fraternal love; as by truth of doctrine, unity of its members, frequency of euchariſt, and fervour of devotion.</p>
            <p>APOSTOLIC doctrine, union, ſacraments and prayer are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by the authority of this reſpectable precedent, requiſite to the right conſtitution of a chriſtian church; and are thoſe eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials ſo much ſought after, in which all who agree compoſe ONE SOCIETY, notwithſtanding ſmall differences of ritual, diſcipline or polity.

            <p n="1">1. THE firſt thing obſervable in this tranſaction is the forcible addreſs of the apoſtles to the conſciences of their Jewiſh audience; convincing them of their guilt in crucifying and rejecting the LORD of life; inſiſting on the proofs of his reſurrection, both from ancient oracles and their own teſtimony; and aſſerting his divine legation from the ſignal miracles by which GOD had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him. Pierced to the heart by this pathetic remonſtrance, they fervently ſolicit the Apoſtles to teach them <hi>what they ſhall do</hi> to eſcape the puniſhment of their impiety. St. Peter's reply is remarkable, as it includes the eſſentials of the chriſtian religion, or of that DOCTRINE mentioned in the text as the firſt requiſite in the conſtitution of a true church.

            <p>YET the ſuperadding human inſtitutes to theſe primary truths and principles of chriſtianity, appeared very early in the attempts of blending the ritual of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> with the doctrines of faith and repentance: and afterwards more flagrantly in the portentous <hi>hereſies</hi> of the firſt ages. Theſe were ſucceeded by the politic ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church: and the barbarous ſophiſtry of explaining religion by the philoſophy and logic of the Greeks, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſubtleties of the <hi>ſcholaſtic</hi> metaphyſics; which from a ſimple creed and plain rule of life, have tortured chriſtianity into a continued aenigma. Formed in theſe ſchools, though their barbariſm was poliſhed by the ſtudies of humanity; the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorers of religion in the XVIth century, ſtill continued to violate it's ſimplicity, by inventing new doctrines, and embaraſſing reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with acceſſory difficulties.</p>

By a diligent ſearch of the ſcriptures, and by employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the aids of learning that may beſt illuſtrate them; by this ſtudy, accompanied with a love of truth and a moral practice, we ſhall beſt diſcern what doctrines are ſpecifically included in the notion of faith: what duties are implied and comprehended under that of repentance. The firſt, conſidered ſyſtematically, implies a firm, ſincere, and <hi>practical</hi> BELIEF (if I may ſo expreſs a faith that operates by virtuous practice) including all the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the MEDIATORIAL oeconomy, or ſcheme of REDEMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION: which, being matter of pure revelation, and depending ſolely on divine authority, is to be collected <hi>only</hi> from the inſpired ſcriptures. To give an exact analyſis of the chriſtian faith would be a work of much induſtry. At preſent, it may be ſufficient to remark, that the eſſentials of which it conſiſts are ſummed up with ſufficient accuracy, in that beſt medium of unity and peace, the CREED aſcribed to the apoſtles.</p>
            <p>THIS very ancient ſymbol may be conſidered as the palladium of chriſtianity—and as it muſt be guarded by all parties with moſt religious care, and preſerved inviolable from the ſacrilegious hands of hereſy and infidelity;—ſo, thoſe who are ſtudious of what is moſt uſeful and important in religion, will not find it adviſeable to extend their creed beyond the limits preſcribed by ſimple antiquity, by inſerting into it the many problematical ſpeculations, which a curious mind may form on ſcattered hints of the divine volumes.</p>
            <p>THE particular duties, comprehended in that REPENTANCE which comprizes all our moral obligations, may be illuſtrated by the chriſtian ethics, by a careful ſcrutiny and obſervation of the human heart, and even by the rational deductions of ancient

philoſophy. Revelation does not give a <hi>regular</hi> ſyſtem of ethics; in this part, ſhe appeals to Reaſon and Nature, which however, by occaſional precepts, ſhe reforms and completes, ſweetens, adorns, and elevates. Philoſophy, though erroneous as to the principles and means and motives of duty, yet by calling in the aid of eloquence, deſcribes and inforces particular moral truths and virtues in a manner ſo touching, ſo perſuaſive, ſo reaſonable; as much confirms that<note n="*" place="bottom">DR.

AS the reſult of what hath been advanced on the ſubject of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic doctrine, we may deduce the principles on which the miniſters of the goſpel may moſt uſefully conduct themſelves in teaching it. The province of man is, not an amuſing theory, but life and action: and the moſt exalted ſpeculations can be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of uſe as they terminate in practice, and produce the effects of righteouſneſs and piety. Aiming at ſo noble a purpoſe as (in his own department) THE RESTORING OF PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ITY, a miniſter will endeavour to <hi>declare the whole counſel of God,</hi> as revealed in holy ſcripture: and will employ his utmoſt diligence and capacity, in clearly explaining the whole ſyſtem of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; from thence deducing the particular duties of morality: which ſhould be accurately defined and ſtated, and urged on the conſcience by arguments and perſuaſives, for the moſt part, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chriſtian, drawn from the precepts, example and authority of our LORD and SAVIOUR, and inforced by their true and adequate ſanctions, the rewards and puniſhments he hath ſet before us. A moral theory, propoſed in the manner of ancient philoſophy, may be ſometimes of uſe to recommend the practice of civil virtues, and to influence the will from motives of prudence, honour, pleaſure, or advantage. Theſe may occaſionally be added to, but muſt not ſuperſede, the only legitimate motives, principles, and ſanctions of moral conduct, the love of God, obedience to his will, the hope and fear of his promiſes and terrors.</p>

AN enquiry into 'the degrees of unity in the city of GOD (which the Lord BACON ranks among the deficients in theology) may beſt be introduced by the ſentiments of that illuſtrious phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.</p>
            <p>
               <q>IT imports exceedingly the peace of the Church, that the league of Chriſtians, preſcribed by our Saviour in thoſe two clauſes which ſeem to croſs one the other, were well and clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; whereof the one defines thus, <hi>He that is not with me, is againſt me, Luc. xi.</hi> 23. the other thus, <hi>He that is not againſt us is for us, ibid. ix.</hi> 50. From thoſe two ſeveral aſſertions it plainly appears, that there are ſome articles, wherein whoſoever diſſenteth is to be held as not comprehended in the league: and there are other articles, wherein a man may diſſent, and yet the league be kept intire. For the bounds of chriſtian community are ſet down, <hi>one faith, one baptiſm,</hi> and not <hi>one rite, one opinion.</hi> Wherefore it will be found a matter of great moment and uſe, to define what, and of what latitude, thoſe points are, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate men from the body of the church, and caſt them out and quite caſhier them from the communion and fellowſhip of the faithful.</q> And in the judgment of the ſame noble writer, <q>the peace and unity of the church, would be moſt effectually conſulted,—if the points fundamental and of ſubſtance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, were truly diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed from points not merely of faith, but of opinion, order, or good intention.</q>

AS PROTESTANT churches claim neither inſpiration nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, they muſt all be obnoxious to error; this ſhould natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lead to a reciprocal indulgence. Being all founded on free enquiry, ſo large a ſcope for difference of opinion as a <hi>dogmatic</hi> Theology affords, neceſſarily induces variety of deciſions. The many curious doctrines, invented in the dawn of Learning by an unreſtrained ſpeculation, and propoſed by their abetters as the terms of aſſociating, rent the Reformation into Parties: that glorious work itſelf having been effected, not ſyſtematically and with united counſels, but in a tumultuary and zealous manner. Thus from the fallibility of the human mind, from the genius of the reformed religion, and from ſome inauſpicious circumſtances attending its origin, we may trace the variations in the Proteſtant Church. To theſe cauſes we may add <hi>the ſpirit of dominion,</hi> which though it firſt occaſioned, certainly infected the great inſtruments of, that illuſtrious revolution, the Reformers themſelves: who by making the terms of aſſociating rigid and confined, and by perſecuting thoſe who would not ſubſcribe to them, ſhivered the ſimple Faith of the goſpel into ſects and ſeparations.</p>
            <p>UNION of faith, charity, peace; not a political unity in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal government: is eſſential to chriſtianity, and required of neceſſity<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note> in the New Teſtament: and it ſeems an equally falſe perſuaſion, that church-communion demands unity of ſentiment in the utmoſt ſtrictneſs, not only as to a few plain fundamental articles, but as to particulars neither neceſſary to ſalvation nor perſpicuous to human reaſon.</p>
            <p>THAT intolerant ſpirit, ſo contrary to the humanity of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which would exclude from the communion of Saints all who
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008789_0019_102FE26A43A90300"/>
are not within the national Eſtabliſhment, certainly changes the terms of ſalvation; which (as we have ſeen above) are only faith and repentance, not fellow-memberſhip in church-communion. An univerſal conformity of mere outward profeſſion, inforced by civil penalties, would perhaps deſtroy the whole power of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and inſtead of making conſcience the arbitreſs and judge, would render her the ſlave of public opinion: which would neceſſarily induce much hypocriſy, with an almoſt general <hi>ſpirit of unbelief,</hi> indifference, and inſincerity.</p>
            <p>I WOULD not aſſert, with the ſophiſt THEMISTIUS<note n="*" place="bottom">ap. SOCR. H. E. IV. 32.</note> to the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperor VALENS, that 'the DEITY is delighted with diverſity of worſhip, as beſt ſuited to the unſearchableneſs of his nature.' For unity being as eſſential to truth as to GOD himſelf, diverſity of religious opinions muſt imply error ſomewhere: and falſhood, as ſuch, can never be acceptable to GOD; though circumſtances may ſoften its evil aſpect: and where the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is the ſame, perhaps the <hi>mode</hi> may alter, without any important ill influence.</p>
            <p>IT may be uſeful to adapt theſe ſentiments to the preſent ſituation of the chriſtian church, which has now ſo flouriſhing an appearance in the AMERICAN Britiſh empire.</p>
            <p n="1">1. RELIGIOUS moderation is conſiſtent with the firmeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to our own eſtabliſhment. That temporizing ſpirit, or levity of principle, which can reſign eſſentials, or blend incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, is either an artifice to ſerve men's ſecular purpoſes by making their advantages on both ſides, or an argument of fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and an unſettled judgment.

Truth indeed, the object of religion, being ſimple and one, is diſcredited by ſects and parties, ſome of which muſt very more or leſs from the authentic ſtandard: but peace, the object of ſociety and civil government, is ſo well ſecured by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate forbearance and charity, and by a judicious toleration; that where theſe are kept inviolable, diverſity of opinions will not affect the quiet of a ſtate or of ſmaller communities.

            <p n="3">3. IT is not indifferent in what particular church or ſociety, we profeſs our Faith in CHRIST, or whether we aſſociate ourſelves to any church at all. This were to argue like the philoſopher, who becauſe he eſteemed himſelf a citizen of the <hi>world</hi> would not become a citizen of <hi>Athens:</hi> a maxim, which if univerſally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, would diſſolve all ſocieties, and deprive mankind of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſuccour and protection. Since the providence of GOD hath
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008789_0021_102FE26FCF3E11B0"/>
permitted thoſe, who ſeceded from the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into numerous ſects and parties; it is contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of human ſociety, to ſtand aloof from them <hi>all:</hi> and not to attach ourſelves uniformly and ſtedfaſtly to ſome <hi>one</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, would argue a ſickleneſs and inconſtancy, unbecoming the importance of Religion. Education uſually determines this point. But as it is the privilege, ſo it ſeems the duty of reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men, to undertake the taſk of a free, ſerious, and intelligent enquiry: and, after a mature examination, <hi>uniformly</hi> to claſs themſelves with that ſociety, which comes neareſt to the purity of the goſpel, and which beſt preſerves that apoſtolic union, doctrine, euchariſt and liturgy, which are eſſential to the right conſtitution of a chriſtian church. In ſo momentous a concern as every man's religion, if ſincere, is to himſelf as an individual; much <hi>leſs</hi> than abſolute rejection of, or invincible prejudices and objections againſt, thoſe proteſtant churches, from whom we do not differ in the eſſence of DOCTRINE;—a reaſonable <hi>preference</hi> of one church or ſociety before another;—a well-grounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, that a man's private religious improvements are moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by uniting in ſuch or ſuch a communion;—all theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives—eſpecially, if that communion be a national church, or one in which he hath been baptized and educated;—ſeem to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to determine his adherence to that particular community, whoſe doctrines and mode of worſhip he finds are beſt adapted to advance his piety, purify his heart, and enlarge his benevolence.</p>
            <p>III. AS a third characteriſtic of the primitive and archetypal church of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the hiſtorian obſerves, that <hi>they continued ſtedfaſtly in</hi> BREAKING OF BREAD. That by this deſcriptive<note n="*" place="bottom">in fractione Euchariſtiae. <hi>Vers. Syriac.</hi>
               </note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is meant the celebration of the holy communion, is a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008789_0022_102FE27210D7EF78"/>
point ſo generally agreed, that it hardly requires any proof. The moſt ancient chriſtians generally concluded their charitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſts and ſacred aſſemblies, with the ſolemnity of the communion. In imitation of ſo venerable examples, this ſacrament is and ought to be held eſſential to the form and conſtruction of all chriſtian churches; and that, for theſe following reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. AS <hi>commemorative</hi> of the ſacred Head and Founder of our religion. 2. As a <hi>faederal</hi> rite, confirming the covenant between CHRIST and his church. 3. As a mark of <hi>union</hi> between CHRIST and his members, of the <hi>communion</hi> or charity of the members one with another.</p>
            <p>THE breaking of bread, and the pouring of wine, as a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the body and blood of JESUS CHRIST broken and ſhed for us upon the croſs, is an expreſſive rite which derives its origin from very ancient religious inſtitutions. GOD, in both his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, hath condeſcended to the infirmities of his creatures, in conveying religious ideas, and preſerving the memory of them, by the intervention of external ſigns. The aſſent of faith, the deductions of reaſon, and the powers of the imagination are in our preſent ſtate inferior to in their energy, and quickened in their operations by ſtrong and lively impreſſions on the ſenſes. This method was employed moſt amply in the Jewiſh ritual, which is every where a material language, a ſpeaking emblem: in particular the rite of the paſſover (between which and the chriſtian euchariſt there is diſcernable an exact analogy) moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly repreſented the deliverance of the Iſraelites from the Egyptian tyranny, and typified our redemption by JESUS CHRIST. In this laſt revelation (as being deſigned for univerſal influence, and ſo not adapted only to the genius of oriental manners) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008789_0023_102FE274595BA748"/>
emblems and ſignificant rites are more ſparingly a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hibited: and the only poſitive inſtitutions of chriſtianity are its two auguſt and expreſſive ſacraments. The ablution of baptiſm, expreſſing the ſtipulation <hi>of a good conſcience towards God,</hi> is an initiation of all into this holy faith: the euchariſt ſo perfectly adumbrates the paſſion of JESUS CHRIST, and by uninterrupted uſage has ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the authentic memory of that event, the very baſis of His religion; that for the nobleſt purpoſes our LORD, ſo near his death, injoined his apoſtles, and in them the church, to 'do this in <hi>remembrance</hi> of Him.'</p>
            <p>IN a <hi>federal</hi> reſpect, this commemoration ratifies the faith and obedience of His ſubjects. Feaſting on ſacrifices was an ancient uſage in confirmation of alliances and compacts: and in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the ſacrifice of CHRIST, GOD and man ſeverally ratify that ſolemn covenant, of which JESUS CHRIST undertook the mediation: the terms of this compact being on the part of GOD pardon and acceptance, in conſideration of the atonement made on the croſs: on the part of man, repentance and univerſal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. This ſacred and ſolemn confirmation of the baptiſmal covenant, muſt in true believers be very inſtrumental to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing their ſins, advancing their ſanctification, and confirming their allegiance to their LORD and Head. But I am obliged on this occaſion rather to glance at this illuſtrious argument, than to give it an accurate inſpection: and I haſten to a curſory view of the third circumſtance, wherein the euchariſt muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as eſſential to the completeneſs of chriſtian worſhip: namely,</p>
            <p>AS a mark of <hi>union</hi> between CHRIST and His members, and of the communion and charity of the members one with another.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008789_0024_102FE277034EC958"/>
This idea is accurately expreſſed in the devotions of our Liturgy, which teaches us, that by 'the ſpiritual food of the moſt precious body and blood of our Saviour JESUS CHRIST, we are aſſured, that we are <hi>very members incorporate in his myſtical body,</hi> which is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed company of all faithful people.' And in the ſame prayer, we implore the aſſiſtance of the divine grace, 'that we may <hi>continue in that holy fellowſhip,</hi> and do all ſuch good works as GOD hath prepared for us to walk in.' This union and communion is clearly aſſerted by St. Paul.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 16. 17.</note>
               <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt; the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? For we, being many, are one bread and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HENCE it appears, that the charity we exerciſe in the ſacrament, is not only that ſincere and hearty forgiveneſs of all injuries and offences, which is the heroiſm of a chriſtian, triumphing over the evil diſpoſitions of nature; but this commemoration of divine love, is itſelf a ſublime act of love to GOD and benevolence to man. The former will intereſt the heart and affections in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing our obedience to his holy and reaſonable laws of virtue: the latter, conſiſting in a ſtrong inclination to promote human happineſs, leads us to conſider all mankind, and eſpecially all chriſtians as one body. This was the charity which ſo eminently characterized the church of JERUSALEM; wherein <hi>all that believed were together, and had all things common: parting their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and goods to all, as every one had need; and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of them that believed were of one heart and of one ſoul.</hi> Such were the graces of that original church; at its firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſmall in extent, few in number; but <hi>perfect and complete in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008789_0025_102FE279494AB920"/>
all the will of</hi> GOD, rich in all the fruits of the SPIRIT, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing in all the exuberance of charity.</p>
            <p>BUT, to the glory of religion, as well as of our age and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; we need not go back to primitive times, for inſtances of the happy effects of this ſocial and benevolent ſpirit. By means of ſuch a diſpoſition, when general and public, we ſee the moſt uſeful deſigns formed and executed, to which the utmoſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and liberality of a few individuals would be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal. By means of ſuch united efforts among yourſelves, you ſee a noble undertaking in a great meaſure performed, without being too burdenſome to any, while the weight of it is born by the combined ſtrength of all. By the union of your counſels and expence, this TEMPLE hath aroſe, to the glory of GOD, and the promoting of chriſtianity, with a<note n="*" place="bottom">In urbe Templum aedificas? pulcherrimum id ſit omnium in urbe palatiorum. in villâ? aequet, immo vincat, reliquas in villà aedes. <bibl>MR.

               </note> beauty and elegance, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming the majeſty of religion. Much hath been done already by your munificence, towards compleating a ſtructure, the leſt merit of which is the honour it does to our country, by adding to the few ſpecimens we have of excellence in the fine arts: which, under the conduct of a good imagination, have ſo much influence in poliſhing and humanizing the mind; and when employed in the ſervice of religion, are ſo expreſſive of reverence to the DEITY; that they may juſtly be conſidered (as they were by the ſages of antiquity) in a moral view, and made ſubſervient to the nobleſt purpoſes of policy, ethics, and devotion. This deſign ſtill demands, towards compleating it, the liberality of an enlarged benevolence: and as I am perſuaded it hath been begun and conducted on truly <hi>chriſtian</hi> principles, with views of adding
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008789_0026_102FE27AE4178C38"/>
to the extent and ſtability of our common faith, uninfluenced by party, bigotry, or intolerance; I do not ſcruple, in the warmeſt manner, to recommend the promoting of this good work, as well deſerving a general patronage and munificence.</p>
            <p>THIS ſhort digreſſion will not be thought foreign to this day's ſolemnity, or to the ſubject which introduced it,—that high and ſacred expreſſion of benevolence, which we exert in that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of CHRIST's body and blood, which is eſſential to the form and conſtitution of a pure and apoſtolic church.</p>
            <p>IV. The order of the text leads me to a ſhort diſcuſſion of the fourth and laſt requiſite in the churches of CHRIST, namely, that of PRAYER. In this friendly converſe and exalted intercourſe between GOD and man, the ſoul is purified from ſenſe and paſſion, the imagination is elevated and refined, the heart is humble, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and holy, the will reſigned and obedient, and all our intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual powers are enlightened by contemplation, 'ſtedfaſt in faith, joyful through hope,' and inflamed with ſacred love. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of a preſent DEITY hearing and accepting our prayers and praiſes; the ſtorms of paſſion ſubſide, the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes, the ſoul aſſerts its divine original, and in ſome ſort aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates itſelf to the 'Father of ſpirits.' Hence we may collect how indiſpenſable in the life of a chriſtian is the duty of prayer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>public,</hi> private, or domeſtic. The firſt of theſe is principally intended by the writer of the Acts in this place. From the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hiſtorian,<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ii. 46. iii. 1.

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008789_0027_102FE27D227CFEA8"/>
moderation, and an expreſs authentic teſtimony of the lawfulneſs, the uſe, and authority of a PUBLIC LITURGY.</p>
            <p>I SHALL not enter into a minute enquiry of ancient offices; whether eſſential to the church, whether any were compoſed by the apoſtles or their immediate ſucceſſors, for the general uſe of the faithful. It is probable, that the biſhops and paſtors of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churches compoſed their reſpective forms, adapted to their ſtate and times, and occaſionally altered or varied, by their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. But the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a liturgy, or of offering our public prayers in precompoſed words. I do not chooſe to contend for: its <hi>expediency</hi> will perhaps appear from the following obſervations, which are ſtrictly applicable to that of our own church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A PRECOMPOSED FORM aſſiſts and regulates devotion, as it ſupplies the mind with apt expreſſions and clear ideas, which every where ought to accompany that great duty: it being as requiſite to pray<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 15.</note> with a right <hi>underſtanding,</hi> as with a fervent <hi>ſpirit.</hi> It not only more ſtrongly and juſtly affects the heart and imagination, but compoſes the mind to a train of devout think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by aſcending methodically through the various parts of prayer,<note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1.</note>
               <hi>ſupplications, petitions, interceſſions, and giving of thanks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. IT prevents impropriety and inconſiſtence; which, highly unbecoming any part of ſo reaſonable a ſervice as religion, is moſt incongruous in our addreſs to the Majeſty of heaven. When men approach the throne of an earthly monarch, they are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and exact in arranging their ideas, ſelecting their words, and embelliſhing their addreſs with a dignity of ſtyle becoming that of the prince. In the caſe of prayer as well as ſacrifice, the prophet's
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008789_0028_102FE27EAB4A2B28"/>
criterion is applicable: <hi>'Offer it now unto thy governor—will he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy perſon? ſhould I accept this of your hands? for I am a great King, ſaith the</hi> LORD <hi>of hoſts.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mal.</hi> i. 8, 13, 14.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether in the pious effuſions of unpremeditated devotion, or in the more elaborate exactneſs of compoſition; whatever is moſt accurate in reaſon, moſt auguſt in imagination, moſt ſublime in eloquence, ſhould be humbly offered in adoration to the Giver of theſe and of all good gifts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A PRINCIPAL uſe of a judicious form of common Prayer, is to include in our moſt ſolemn devotions the eſſentials of our <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>faith:</hi> which is the moſt effectual method of impreſſing them, both on the underſtanding and conſcience, and of ſecuring the ſincerity of our profeſſion. To this ſtability of our public forms we may perhaps be indebted for that remarkable <hi>freedom from</hi> FALSE RELIGION, which hath ever diſtinguiſhed the reformed church of ENGLAND: the purity of her faith and morals having never been generally ſullied by any tincture of ſuperſtition, enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, hereſy, or licentiouſneſs. The doctrines and duties of the goſpel are ſo interwoven by moſt ſignificant definitions in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Liturgy; that the moſt illiterate, who are capable of attention and piety, may collect from it the principles of 'our common ſalvation.' Its uſe is no leſs important as a guard and preſervative againſt heretical opinions. Moſt of the depraved doctrines, that have corrupted and deformed religion, are ſo explicitly condemned in our public offices; that it is ſcarce poſſible for a diſciple of <hi>Arius,</hi> of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> or any other haereſiarch, to ſhelter himſelf under the communion of that church, which ſo openly declares againſt their dangerous errors. That ſuch a Liturgy, (though compoſed on ancient models, and in which the wiſdom of CRANMER, the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of RIDLEY, the piety of martyrs and confeſſors, and the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008789_0029_102FE282893358C0"/>
temperate criticiſm of its ſubſequent reviewers, combined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a moſt accurate form of devotion) that it ſhould ſtill be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſome exceptions, is a neceſſary imperfection of even the happieſt efforts of human reaſon and induſtry; not excepting the beſt tranſlations of Holy Scripture, and our own in particular; which is thought by the ableſt judges to be capable of much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, by the collation of MSS and verſions, and other aids of ſacred literature: a work, which would give a new luſtre to religion, and which, it is hoped, will do honour to the learning and piety of the preſent age. But to return to our liturgy; if notwithſtanding ſmaller blemiſhes, the purpoſes of devotion are effectually ſerved by it; if it maintains order, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and propriety in our adminiſtration; if it excludes hereſy from our doctrines; if it preſerves inviolate the apoſtolic faith and ſacraments; let theſe important uſes vindicate it to others, recommend and indear it to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>AS no Proteſtant can aſſert the perfection or infallibility of the viſible church; ſo we need not ſcruple to acknowledge, that in the beſt eccleſiaſtical conſtitutions there are defects and errors, which as a private man cannot amend, ſo a good ſubject and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble chriſtian will not aggravate or miſrepreſent; but will think it his duty to ſubmit to uneſſential imperfections, for the ſake of peace, order, and obedience. After ſo large a conceſſion, we may do ſo much juſtice to the conſtitution of the church of ENGLAND, as to remark that it is eminently diſtinguiſhed in thoſe IV great apoſtolic requiſites, which we have deſcribed as the notes or marks of a true church, and as eſſential to a chriſtian ſociety. For the purity of her <hi>doctrine,</hi> we may appeal to the united ſuffrage of all the proteſtant churches: its terms of <hi>communion</hi> are evangelical faith and repentance: its government and diſcipline are founded on the uſages of the moſt remote and pure antiquity: the <hi>eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:008789_0030_102FE284C9F03468"/>
is reſtored to the ſimplicity and integrity of the divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: its <hi>liturgy</hi> is as perfect as the circumſtances of times, and the ſtate of religion would admit.</p>
            <p>WITH hearts enlarged by devotion and charity, let us, my friends, approve ourſelves not unmindful of the divine goodneſs, which hath made us members of ſo pure a church, and hath given us an eaſy acceſs to all the ordinances of religion. Let us not ſpend our lives in the unavailing poſſeſſion of them; but by a right improvement of theſe <hi>means</hi> and <hi>inſtruments,</hi> let us labour to attain the <hi>end of our faith, even the ſalvation of our ſouls.</hi> And while we piouſly conſecrate this material temple to the pure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of that GOD, who is uncircumſcribed by ſpace, whoſe <hi>throne is heaven,</hi> and <hi>earth His footſtool;</hi> let us remember above all things to conſecrate to HIS ſervice thoſe more ſolemn temples of the HOLY GHOST, our ſouls and bodies, both collectively, as a chriſtian ſociety, and ſeverally, as individuals,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 19—22.</note> 'Know ye not, that ye are the temple of GOD, and that the SPIRIT of GOD dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you?

            <p>THESE colonies very ſenſibly feel the benign influence of His Majeſty's government, while defended and enlarged by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of a GENERAL, who equally eminent in courage and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, ſeems to have accepted the command of armies, with the noble purpoſe of ſaving the lives of mankind.</p>
            <p>WHILE this province flouriſhes under a GOVERNOUR, who has drawn his politics from the ſchools of philoſophy, and the free ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the engliſh conſtitution; in an age of learning, humanity and moderation; we have every circumſtance concurring to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize and protect a church, which, we hope, is conſtituted on a pure and apoſtolic model. Let us not be wanting to ourſelves, in improving our advantages to the beſt purpoſes of piety and virtue.</p>
            <p>NOT the leſt of thoſe inſtruments, by which JESUS CHRIST will extend his ſpiritual empire on earth, and render his religion univerſal; is that illuſtrious SOCIETY FOR THE PROPAGATION OF HIS GOSPEL, the ſucceſs of whoſe pious deſigns is a ſignal diſtinction of the XVIIIth-Century; and in ſome degree emulates the purity and extent, with which the chriſtian faith was diffuſed in the firſt ages of the church. Should GOD give his people the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008789_0032_102FCA3EB77426D8"/>
bleſſing of Peace, it may be hoped in a time ſo favourable to their intentions, that the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS will, by HIS bleſſing on their prudent and unwearied zeal, ſtill more irradiate the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> world. The attempt indeed of teaching ſavages a divine philoſophy, before they have acquired any tincture of humanity, is judged by the ableſt reaſoners, and found by experience prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ineffectual. As chriſtianity addreſſes its doctrines to the heart, and its evidence to the reaſon of mankind: armed with no force but that of truth, it offers itſelf in the way of perſuaſion; which ſuppoſes its converts capable of underſtanding its doctrines and precepts, and the proofs of their authority. It argues great ignorance of the human mind, to ſuppoſe that uncivilized bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians can admit the goſpel with any ſtability or continuance. The chriſtian faith hath always met with the readieſt and moſt durable reception among the moſt learned and civil nations. While EUROPE, which is ſo poliſhed by ſcience and arts, hath generally ſubmitted to the empire of JESUS CHRIST; other parts of the world are either in total darkneſs and ignorance, or but partially illuminated; and that, in very near proportion to the ſtate of civil ſociety. The conſequence is obvious from ſo clear a fact, which points out the only method of diffuſing the faith among the ſavages of our own continent.</p>
            <p>THE wiſdom of <hi>policy</hi> muſt prepare the way for the reception of religion. Peace and its attendant bleſſings of commerce and the arts, will ſoften the ferocity and ſuppreſs the hoſtilities of a barbarous people.
