            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>I certify you brethren, that the Goſpel which was preached of me, is not after man—but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ST. PAUL begins this epiſtle with a very intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalutation, "Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf a ranſom for our ſins, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil world, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God and our Father—to whom be glory forever amen." This introduction has particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reference to the occaſion of his writing, which was, to ſuggeſt to the Galatians that they had not kept the goſpel of Chriſt. "I marvel that ye are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt, unto another goſpel." And alſo to call back their minds to the ſimplicity, purity, and truth, of that goſpel which had been delivered them by Chriſt and his apoſtles. "Tho' we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other goſpel unto you than that we have preached, let him be accurſed." He then makes an appeal to his manner of preaching, in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036313_0004_1008E5DF076C2968"/>
which without fear or flattery, he had ſet forth the character, office, and atonement of Chriſt. "Do I now perſuade men, or God? Or do I ſeek to pleaſe men?" And further, he calls them to witneſs that he had preached to them the true goſpel—"I certify you, brethren, that the goſpel which was preached of me is not after man—but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt." How important is it, eſpecially in this day of religious darkneſs, that every miniſter of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould be able to ſay he has preached no other goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but that of Chriſt! That he has not received his doctrines, from the commandments of men, nor framed his goſpel, after the rudiments of the world; but that he has learnt it after Chriſt! That he has not ſhunned to declare the whole council of God. Alas! How much greater reaſon, than the apoſtle, have they to ſay who is ſufficient for theſe things!</p>
            <p>The ſubject naturally leads us,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To recollect what we have received as the goſpel, and where it is to be found.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To enquire whether we have received the true goſpel.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſhow in what reſpects, this ſubject applies to us, and what uſe may be made of the application.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What have we received as the goſpel? and where is it to be found?</p>
            <p>We have received the following things, as conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting that holy ſyſtem of faith, diſcipline, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which is contained in the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The eternal exiſtence, and infinite perfections, of one only living and true God; who is the author of all things; the alone fountain of truth, juſtice, mercy, and happineſs. Whoſe character is exhibited to us in three perſons, the father, who is the ſource; the ſon, who is the miniſter; and the holy ghoſt, who is the efficient of divine grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God made all things for his own glory, and the good of his creatures. Theſe are his ultimate ends; therefore, even the wrath of man, ſhall praiſe him;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036313_0005_1008E5C9673717D0"/>
and the greateſt poſſible good, ſhall be the final iſſue of all his operations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Man was created originally upright; but he has fallen from this ſtate, on the trial of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and loſt communion with God; is prone to evil, and from the neceſſity of his natural inclinations, grows up into a ſtate of ſin; the full wages of which, is death temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God has entered into a covenant with his ſon, to ſave man in a way of grace, and on this purpoſe, Chriſt has come in the fleſh—has made an atonement for ſin—explained the conditions of the covenant of grace; and promiſed ſalvation to thoſe who comply with them. We are therefore juſtified, through faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who has honored the law of God, and opened the way for the return of ſinners, to the great author of life and goodneſs, from whom they have departed; and in a manner, equally well adapted to their ſituation, and to the honor of the univerſal governor. Therefore—</p>
            <p n="5">5. Evangelical faith, implies not only a belief in Chriſt, as the Meſſiah; but a true repentance of ſin; and a converſion to holineſs, by a divine operation of the ſpirit of God, in the means of grace—producing in order, faith, repentance, truſt in God, love of Chriſt, and general, though not perfect righteouſneſs of character.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Though chriſtians are not perfect in this life; yet all, who truly believe in Chriſt, are ſealed by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the new covenant, unto eternal ſalvation; and have the promiſe of God, that they ſhall not fall away, ſo as finally to looſe the bleſſings of redemption.</p>
            <p n="7">7. There will be a reſurrection of the dead, both of the righteous and the wicked, to a righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, where, each one will appear in his own character, and anſwer for himſelf; and they will be ſentenced reſpectively, to everlaſting miſery, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:036313_0006_1008E5E165AFC038"/>Theſe are the principal doctrines, which we have received, as contained in the goſpel; laying the main ſtreſs, on the great atonement, the awful depravity and ſpiritual death of unbelievers, and the abſolute neceſſity of regeneration to holineſs, through faith, repentance, and ſanctification.</p>
            <p>With no leſs reverence, have we received the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and ſacraments, as of chriſtian and apoſtolic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Believing, that the ſabbath is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as holy time; devoted to the ſervice of God, and the ſpiritual good of our ſouls—That baptiſm is to be received, as a ſign, or ſeal of our covenant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, and the church—that all baptized chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are branches or members of the church; and are to be treated as ſuch, until admitted to open per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſtanding; by having taken their infant covenant vows upon themſelves, in a public profeſſion, that they believe in Chriſt, and are his diſciples.</p>
            <p>That the Lord's ſupper, is a confirming, as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is an initiatory ſeal, of the chriſtian covenant— that it is deſigned to collect the followers of Chriſt; to ſupport their friendſhip, and quicken their graces: and that all, who are in open, perſonal ſtanding, in the church, have a right to partake of it. That all baptized children, of ſuitable age, are to be called on, to own or renounce, their faith in Chriſt, into whom they have been baptized; that they may be dealt with accordingly, and that all who have named Chriſt, ſhould depart from iniquity, and feel the moſt ſolemn obligations, to watch over each other, in the ſpirit of charity, communion, and diſcipline.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We are now led to enquire, whether we have received the true goſpel.</p>
            <p>From the great variety of opinions held by chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, it would ſeem, their charity muſt be very wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extended; as there is no denomination, which is a ſtandard for all the reſt—conſequently, that they ought to be ſuſpicious of themſelves. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may doubtleſs, have ſatisfactory evidence,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036313_0007_1008E5CC1AF1C038"/>
that we have received the eſſential truth of the goſpel; and perhaps may find, that we have ſome advantage, in point of orthodoxy, over other denominations of chriſtians.</p>
            <p>To prove that we have received the goſpel, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its moſt eſſential ſenſe, but even its faireſt form, ſeveral things will be diſtinctly mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have taken no man, or body of men, for our guide. We derive all our authority in diſcipline, the articles of our faith, and the rules of our conduct, ſolely from the ſcriptures. And we have derived them, without the fear of man, or the prejudice of opinion. With the ſcriptures open before us, we have gone to the great fountain of light and grace, in prayer; and we truſt, he has given us ſome proper ſenſe of his goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The principal doctrines of our goſpel, appear to be eſſential parts of the chriſtian ſcheme. They are like pillars, and foundation ſtones, in the building, which removed, the ſuperſtructure muſt fall. They are ſuch, as we ſhould expect would be plainly ſpoken of, and clearly marked, on the very face of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Can we open our bibles, without meeting with the depravity of man, the atonement of Chriſt, the neceſſity of regeneration, the reſurrection of the dead, and the judgment of the world by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Take away any of theſe doctrines; and ſee how the goſpel will ſtand. If you remove the atonement, in what will the goſpel differ, from the morals of Zoroaſter, Socrates, or Seneca? except, that it is the beſt ſyſtem of morality which can be found? Remove this, and you deny the depravity of man, the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and a future judgment.</p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſaid, of any other conſtituent part of the goſpel. If you deny depravity, you ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regeneration unneceſſary; and the atonement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes abſurd—deny regeneration; and Chriſt would be the miniſter of ſin—deny the reſurrection of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036313_0008_1008E5E372CF2FD8"/>
the dead, and a future judgment; and religion will be licentiouſneſs; and the whole moral government of God will be deſtroyed. They who hold theſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and thoſe neceſſarily attached to them, muſt be eſſentially right. And if all others are conſidered as uneſſential opinions, in which men agree, or differ, according to the prejudice of education, the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the paſſions, or the advantages of enquiry; we ſhall, perhaps, ſtand ſo much the fairer chance, to receive the light of philoſophy, while we are ſolemnly impreſſed, with the awful myſtery of the goſpel; and may breathe the ſpirit of benevolence and charity, while we are earneſtly contending for the faith, once delivered to the ſaints.</p>
            <p>This may, in general, be ſaid of the churches in this country. It is our endeavour, to hold faſt the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential truths of the goſpel, with a charitable and lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral temper, towards thoſe who differ from us in the uneſſentials of religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We, my brethren, in particular, have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid extremes of opinion, or practice, into which ſome have gone. In ſupporting the divine ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, we have not made God the author of ſin. We have held the awful depravity and death of the ſinner, without denying the uſe of means. In terms of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, we have not ſuffered ourſelves to be exalted, above the claims of an imperfect, probationary, and militant church.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, we have not denied the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of God. We have not made Chriſt the mere miniſter of grace; by repreſenting man, as working out his own matter of juſtification. We have not ſeparated the means and inſtruments of grace, from their Almighty agent. Nor have we opened the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the church, to every intruder. It has been our endeavour, to gather into the church, the ſincere enquirers after truth, and the humble followers of Jeſus Chriſt: forming our judgment, on the rectitude
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036313_0009_1008E5CE30D0CF98"/>
of their lives, and the ſpirituality of their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another argument in our favour, my brethren, is the ſimplicity of our ſcheme. This mark of truth, has always diſtinguiſhed it, from the affectation and obſcurity of falſehood. Our ſyſtem, without the corruptions of the beaſt, the additions of the falſe prophet, or the deceitful workings of the dragon, has been eſſentially the faith of the orthodox church, thro' all changes of chriſtianity—the ſtandard, from which erroneous diſſenters, ſpeculative believers, met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphyſical doctors, and aſſuming popes, have varied; and to which the reformed have conſtantly returned. It is ſuch, as to its plainneſs, purity, and power, as the great divine teacher would inculcate—ſuch, as fiſhermen could underſtand, and men of all capacities receive. It is a ſtructure, which in the light of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred, diſcovers no diſproportion, to the moſt diſcerning eye. It ſhows, more clearly than ever, its divine original. It does not, like the image of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar, manifeſt unſound materials; but with pyramidal ſtrength, it ſecurely rears its lofty head to heaven; and bids defiance to the rage of man, the arts of Satan, and the waſte of time.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We cannot help mentioning, the tendency of our faith, to unite and ſtrengthen the church of Chriſt. It removes the firſt occaſion for controverſy and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by ſetting noneſſentials in their proper place, and by addreſſing itſelf to the plaineſt underſtanding. When the conſtituent parts of the goſpel, are candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained, and judiciouſly ſettled, all capacities may underſtand it, and unite in it, who are not eſſentially defective in religious experience.</p>
            <p>My predeceſſor<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. NATHAN STRONG.</note> was an eminently wiſe and good man, whoſe long, and ſucceſsful labours, are yet in bleſſed memory, with you who have been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his miniſtry. He was well acquainted with
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036313_0010_1008E5E548869E00"/>
the oil and compoſition of the ſanctuary. He gave you the goſpel in its ſimplicity; without exciting you to controverſy, or lulling you into apathy. Adapting the great eſſential practical truths of religion, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained them without affectation, and held them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering. His venerable example, I have, with ſhort ſteps, and feeble exertions, endeavored to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For theſe reaſons, there has been a great har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the ſentiments of this church; which I pray God may continue, for your peace and love in the Lord Jeſus. May you neither degenerate into care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of what you believe and profeſs; nor fall into contentions on circumſtantial and ſpeculative ſubjects; as if Chriſt was to be divided, between Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas. How much is Chriſt diſhonoured, by ſaying I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas. Alas! How far, from the proper ſpirit of thoſe, who are all profeſſedly one in Chriſt Jeſus; of whom the whole family, in heaven and earth, is named!</p>
            <p n="6">6. The laſt thing I ſhall mention, in confirmation of our goſpel, is the manifeſtation of its power in the converſion of ſinners. The work of grace has ſhown us, that the articles of our faith are from God. We find them deeply impreſſed on the minds, of all thoſe who are born again to a lively ſenſe of the truth, and of their need of Chriſt. They have been convinced of the evil of ſin. They have ſeen the value and wonder of the atonement. They have felt the awful terrors of judgment upon the impenitent— the juſtice of God in them; and the neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled to him from a new heart and life. And when they have been able to take hold of the new covenant, they have evangelically repented of ſin. They have admired the grace of the goſpel; and have expreſſed their joy in prayer, for divine aſſiſtance; and in praiſe to God and the Lamb, for bringing ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to a guilty world. We may add, the ſpirit of the Lord who beareth witneſs with our ſpirits, hath taught us that our goſpel is the wiſdom of God, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036313_0011_1008E5D3030E2678"/>
the power of God. Many of us, who were once dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, hope we have been quickened in Chriſt Jeſus, unto that new, and holy life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuch ſtrong and indubitable features of divine truth, as give us the higheſt evidence, that we have received the goſpel of Chriſt in ſimplicity.</p>
            <p>Having conſidered what we have received as the goſpel; and whether we have received the true goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we proceed—</p>
            <p n="3">III. To enquire how this ſubject applies to us; and what uſe may be made of the application.</p>
            <p>Our ſituation, is ſimilar to that of thoſe mentioned in the text. I was called by the providence of God, to preach the goſpel to you, as the apoſtle had done to the Galatians; and am now ſeparated from you, as he was from them. I ought to be able to call you to witneſs, "that the goſpel which was preached of me, is not after man—but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt." And you ought to be able, to bear teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for yourſelves, that you have received it as it is in Jeſus. For if it ſolemnly concerns me, to know whether I have been faithful to declare the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God; the enquiry is equally intereſting to you, whether you have heard the will of God, and been careful to obey it.</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, more particularly attend to the uſe, which may be made of this ſubject, in applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ourſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If this ſubject has convinced you, that your goſpel is the truth, how important is it, that you ſhould preſerve it from thoſe innovations, which tend to its corruption. Innovations there are, my breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, which have this tendency. You are already un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cenſure, by thoſe who affect a purer church. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſy and orthodoxy, I am ſenſible, are a mere <hi>vice verſa,</hi> in the mouths of different parties, like the <hi>meum and tuum</hi> of commerce. But you will feel the neceſſity of ſtanding on your guard, when you conſider, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036313_0012_1008E5E7D72DF9A8"/>
the charge of hereſy is one of thoſe excitements, which the beaſt has uſed, to make the world wonder after him. I ſincerely hope, you will not become a prey; either to thoſe daring metaphyſicians and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous innovaters, whoſe object, like that of French politicians, will be to revolutionize, or divide and ruin you; or to thoſe preying moraliſts, whoſe preaching would harden you into ſtone, or convert you into diſciples of "illuminated" morality.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſubject ſuggeſts to our minds, that ſtate of man, which gives occaſion for preaching the goſpel. The firſt notion of the goſpel, carries the idea of an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful depravity. If man was not in ſuch a ſtate, ſo great preparations for his return to God, would not only be unneceſſary; but they would be abſurd, and prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous, as coming from infinite wiſdom. It is becauſe this truth is not felt, that the preaching of the goſpel, is an offence to the Jews, and fooliſhneſs to the Greeks. A ſenſe of our depravity, makes the goſpel appear to be the wiſdom of God, and the power of God. If I have not inculcated this great truth, I have neglected an eſſential part of the council of heaven—You have not yet been taught the occaſion of Chriſt's coming. Or if I have preached this doctrine, and you have not heard, you have had no ſenſe of the holineſs of the law againſt which you have ſinned. You have not learnt that the law is before the goſpel; nor felt that the wages of ſin is death. Conſequently, you have ſeen no beauty in the goſpel ſyſtem, nor any need of the atonement of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are led to conſider, what is the deſign of the goſpel. It is not merely to ſhow us our condition, as ſinners, who have loſt the communion and favor of God: it carries a much nobler idea. By convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing man of ſin, it deſigns to diſplay the character of God; who manifeſts himſelf, not only a being of righteouſneſs and truth, but of benevolence and mercy—a being, who takes no delight in afflicting his creatures, even with a ſenſe of their own wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036313_0013_1008E5D4917AF1F0"/>
by ſin. Whoſe love is ſuch, that he has open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a way for ſinners, thro' the ſacrifice of his own ſon; by whom the honor of the law is reſtored; and means prepared, thro' which, by divine grace work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, we might have the ſpirit of adoption, and be able to uſe the natural language of children who have never gone aſtray. "Our father who art in heaven; may thy kingdom come; work in us that which is well pleaſing in thy ſight; and finally may we be admitted into thy preſence without ſpot, thro' the merits of the Lord Jeſus, to the praiſe of thy grace."</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence we may ſee in what character, we are to receive the preachers of the goſpel. They are to be received; not as moraliſts; not as philoſophical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; not as public orators and critics; but as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Jeſus Chriſt, ſent, to make known the will of God in the myſtery of grace—who are to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from the terrors of the law, and the conviction of ſin, to ſhow the coming and glory of Chriſt; and to lead ſinners to embrace his goſpel; that they may honor, both the juſtice and mercy of God; in their return; and enjoy him forever. Therefore ſays the great apoſtle, "We preach not ourſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and ourſelves your ſervants, for Jeſus' ſake."</p>
            <p>If theſe things are true, how inconceivably ſolemn, is the preaching of the goſpel! The miniſters of Chriſt ſhould be able, in the language of St. Paul to the Galatians, to call God to witneſs for them.— "Behold, before God, I lie not." They have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, the unſearchable riches of Chriſt— they come to their hearers on an angels' errand; to tell them their ſituation; and to ſhow them what God has done in Chriſt for their ſalvation—to convince them of the irrecoverable loſs of thoſe that die impenitent; to make them flee for their lives to Jeſus Chriſt, as to an ark of ſafety, and city of refuge, from the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of blood—to perſuade them, if poſſible, to lay
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036313_0014_1008E5E965EAA658"/>
hold on the hope ſet before them, which, like an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor entering within the vail, will finally conduct them to the embraces of him, who is the author and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of faith; and into the preſence of God, where is fullneſs of joy.</p>
            <p>How very far then, is that unruly, carping diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which is often exerciſed toward miniſters, from the ſpirit of ſerious and candid hearers of the goſpel! Miniſters are, indeed, ſinful and imperfect men; but God has ſeen fit to commit this treaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to earthen veſſels, that the excellency of its power, above what we ſhould expect from ſuch inſtruments, might be of him who worketh all things, according to the counſel of his will. You remember the words of our Saviour to his apoſtles, "whoſoever receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that ſent me." Moſt people hear the goſpel as if it was not addreſſed to themſelves, but to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; or rather, as if the preacher was ſetting forth a ſcheme of ſalvation, for the inhabitants of Jupiter or Saturn. They do not ſeem ſo much as to think, that he is a meſſenger from God, to ſhow them the danger of their ſituation, and call them to repentance. How dreadful, my hearers, will be the ſituation of unfaithful miniſters, who have ſhunned to declare the whole counſel of God, and ſuffered ſinners to periſh without warning! And how much leſs awful, will be their condition, who have come to deſtruction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſpiſed privileges, ſinned againſt warnings, and trodden under foot the Son of God—to whom, after having rejected the goſpel of peace, even with God, the fountain of mercy, there remaineth no more ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice for ſin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The occaſion and the ſubject unite, in calling our minds to that ſolemn relation, which ſhortly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between us, but now is no more.</p>
            <p>Have I not preached to you the goſpel of Chriſt, in plainneſs and ſolemnity? Have I not dwelt on its moſt eſſential doctrines? Have I not ſhewn you the
<pb facs="unknown:036313_0015_1008E5D7278B4698"/>
danger of continuing in ſin; and the neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born again to a new and holy life? Have I not pointed out the laſt ſtate of the impenitent—that of yourſelves you cannot come to God; and if you could, that he could not receive you without a Saviour? In view of theſe truths, have I not led you to Chriſt, as the only way, the truth, and the life—as to an all-ſufficient Saviour, the ſon of God, who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God through him? He has gone before us, through the ſufferings of perſecution, and the agonies of death, to that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection, from the grave, which will ſhortly preſent all his followers, with immortal glory, into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his father, and our father.</p>
            <p>Let me aſk you, my hearers, how you have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved theſe truths? If I have been unfaithful, will it ſave you from giving your own account to God? But I am permitted this day to call you to witneſs that I have preached to you the goſpel of Chriſt; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the counſel of God. By the mercy of God I have one more opportunity, at leaſt, to deliver my own ſoul; by warning you not to put far away the evil day—to repent of your ſins—to accept of Chriſt, and turn unto God; while it is your accepted time, and your day of ſalvation. And I muſt, by no means, forget ſo to warn you, and you muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſo to improve, what you have heard from me, that we may not be afraid to ſee each others faces, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many millions, who will ſhortly be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before the bar of God, to hear their doom. God is witneſs to the truths you have now heard, and to all you ever heard. He hath given you a conſcience of theſe things, that he might not leave himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſs of his juſtice, in condemning thoſe who will not obey his goſpel. May you, who are yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, be awakened before it is too late; and God is able to convince you of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and judgment. If you are ever awakened you will ſee, that the truths I have taught you are real, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036313_0016_1008E5ED03E8F618"/>
Doubtleſs your conſciences now tell you I have ſpoken the truth. But hark! If the ſoft whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of conſcience, even in thoſe who are careleſs and ſecure are thus articulate, how loud muſt be her thunders, to the awakened ſinner, who ſtands in full view of the law, at the very foot of Sinai in flames, and hears diſtinctly the Almighty condemnation.— Alas! Who will be able to endure the ſentence of final judgment, which will ſoon be paſſed, upon all thoſe who know not God, and obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>May we all find mercy in the day of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. May the ſpirit of all truth, guide us now we are ſeparated. I aſk an intereſt in your prayers, that whether I continue in the work of the miniſtry, or not, God would lead me into the path of wiſdom, duty, and peace. My prevailing inclination has been not to leave the miniſtry; altho' my reaſons for it are weighty, as many of you are ſenſible. May the Lord give you another paſtor, more after his own heart, who ſhall keep you from being ſcattered upon the mountains of Iſrael; and feed you with the bread of life. The Lord forgive you, and bleſs you; and make us all ſo happy, as to meet in that land of promiſe, whoſe rivers flow with perpetual pleaſure from the throne of God; and whoſe fruits are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and unceaſing. Here the life of the ſaints is immortal—ſociety is perfect—love and righteouſneſs exclude contention—joys are unmingled with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and friends are never ſeparated.</p>
            <p>That this may be our portion, may God grant, thro' him who hath loved us and given himſelf for us—to him be glory, dominion, and praiſe. AMEN.</p>
