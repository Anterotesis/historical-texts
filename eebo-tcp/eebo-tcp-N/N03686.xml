            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE inſpir'd Evangeliſt cloſes his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Narrative of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> with this remarkable and inſtructive Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the Story of the great <hi>Doctor of the Gentiles:</hi> who, from a Deſtroyer of the Faith and Perſecutor of Chriſt, had long ſince, by the Grace of God beſtowed upon him, become an Apoſtle of Chriſt, and Preacher of the Faith, yea a Sufferer for the Goſpel; and was now evangelizing the famous City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:004510_0004_100D5E3185B332B0"/>
It had been foretold him in a Viſion, that as he had teſtified of Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſhould bear Witneſs at <hi>Rome</hi> alſo. He had himſelf promis'd, and once and again purpos'd a Viſit to the <hi>Romans;</hi> longing to <hi>have ſome Fruit among them, even as among other Gentiles.</hi> But being oblig'd to delay for a while, it ſeems as if ſome had tax'd him of <hi>uſing Lightneſs,</hi> in promiſing and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming; or we may ſuppoſe they might (like ſome at <hi>Corinth</hi> ) be <hi>puffed up, as though he would not come to them,</hi> either for Fear or Shame. Therefore he takes Occaſion in his <hi>Epiſtle to the Romans</hi> (written while yet unknown by Face unto them) to make thoſe ſolemn Proteſtations: <hi>I am a Debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, both to the Wiſe and to the Unwiſe; ſo, as much as in me is, I am</hi> READY <hi>to preach the Goſpel to You that are at</hi> Rome <hi>alſo: for I am</hi> NOT ASHAMED <hi>of the Goſpel of Chriſt.—From</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and round about unto</hi> Illyricum, <hi>I have</hi> FULLY <hi>preached the Goſpel of Chriſt. And I am</hi> SURE, <hi>that when I come unto You, I ſhall come in the</hi> FULNESS <hi>of the Bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agreably the Apoſtle was no ſooner arrived among them, altho' under ſome uncomfortable Reſtraints and manifeſt Diſadvantages, but he enters with Alacrity into this new Scene of Labours in the Word, ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (as he had wrote) <hi>not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>ready to preach</hi> it even at <hi>Rome;</hi> neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the Envy of any judaizing falſe Brethren of his own Communion there, nor the Malice of the unbelieving Jews; neither fearing the Power of pagan Idolaters, nor all the Sophiſtry of the Diſputers of this World. Fleſh and Blood indeed, had he conſulted that, might have prompted him to Silence, as a prudent Caution, and the beſt Security, in his preſent critical Situation; being under a judicial Proſecution by his own Countrymen, condemned by the Jewiſh Prieſts as violating their Law and the Cuſtoms of their Fathers, and upon his Appeal to <hi>Ceſar</hi> conſign'd over into the Hands of the <hi>Romans.</hi>—But our chriſtian Hero, at all Hazards, quickly begins his Teſtimony in <hi>Rome:</hi> and ceaſed not daily to teach and preach <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He had too
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004510_0005_100D5E330DC1CE08"/>
active a Genius, and too juſt a Senſe of the Worth of Time, to ſweel away any of his precious Hours in Sloth and Indolence; He had a moſt ſenſible Compaſſion for guilty periſhing Souls, and he felt the Love of Chriſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully conſtraining him; Neceſſity was laid upon him; and he found the Spirit of Glory and of God now reſting on him: So that, thus principl'd, thus fortify'd and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, he apply'd himſelf to the Work of an Apoſtle without Delay, and purſued it with a ſteady Reſolution, with ardent Zeal, and an indefatigable Induſtry; being in it ſometimes <hi>from Morning till Evening,</hi> and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Labours more abundant. From <hi>Rome</hi> he ſeems to have wrote almoſt all his Epiſtles. And here he ſeems to have eminently devoted himſelf to the Miniſtry of the Word: <hi>preaching and teaching with all Confidence;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>no Man forbidding him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Liberty was indulg'd him by the Authority of the Place: And tho' he wanted not for Adverſaries, they wanted the Courage or the Power to <hi>forbid</hi> and withſtand him. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Men of his own Nation, who ſeem every where to have diſtinguiſhed themſelves for their Spleen and Rancour againſt this Apoſtle, and often had made Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, and Inſurrection, and Conſpiracy againſt him in his own Country, wou'd doubtleſs now alſo at <hi>Rome,</hi> if their Power had been equal to their Will, have thunder'd out Menaces and Prohibitions, and laid all poſſible Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Way, to prevent his <hi>ſpeaking in the Name of Jeſus,</hi> or his preaching among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But <hi>Paul, a Priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and a Stranger at <hi>Rome,</hi> happily found more Indulgence here, than at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> being by the Favour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captain ſuffered to <hi>dwell by himſelf</hi> (with a ſingle Attendant) <hi>in his own hired Houſe,</hi> to admit what Company he pleas'd, to preach as often as he would; and none permitted to diſturb him.</p>
            <p>[By the Way, here's a teaching <hi>Example</hi> to Men in Power, to countenance faithful Preachers of the Goſpel: and how can perſecuting <hi>Rome</hi> at this Day, reflect on it without Bluſhing and Confuſion!]</p>
            <p>This Liberty afforded the Apoſtle a glorious Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: which he well knew how to value, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected not to make Uſe of to the beſt Advantage. A
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004510_0006_100D5E35F903DB10"/>
wide Door, and effectual, was here open'd to him, to ſend abroad the Sound of the Goſpel: he quickly filled <hi>Rome</hi> with this Doctrine, and it reach'd even <hi>Caeſar'</hi>s Houſehold. Some of all Stations, Characters, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances (it ſeems) crouded to his Miniſtry, as the Doves flock to their Windows: And 'tis ſaid here, like his Divine Maſter, <hi>he receiv'd all that came to him;</hi> whether Jew or Gentile, whether Male or Female, Old or Young, Bond or Free, Wiſe or Unwiſe: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded no Man's Perſon; he <hi>received all</hi> indifferently, without partial Reſpects or Diſrepects, for their Nation, Condition, Rank, or Figure in the World. And <hi>how</hi> did he <hi>receive</hi> them? Was it only to good Fellowſhip, to paſs away the Time together in empty Chatt and trifling Amuſements! No.—Or was it to doubtful Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſcholaſtick Babblings, and Oppoſitions of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, falſely ſo call'd! No.—Or was it to mercenary and ſelfiſh Ends, hoping for Money, or for Favour from 'em! No, nor this. But it was in pure Love, from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and diſintereſted Zeal for their Good, hoping to win their Souls to Chriſt, and bring them to God. With this noble View he <hi>received</hi> them all. All that had Ears to hear, He receiv'd, to <hi>preach</hi> to them, and to <hi>teach</hi> them, as <hi>Jeſus</hi> (it's ſaid) <hi>received the People, and ſpake to them of the Kingdom of God.</hi> And this he did with great Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Freedom and Aſſurance; not aſham'd of his Doctrine, nor balking the Truth; not ſparing Vice, Error, or any Thing contrary to ſound Doctrine; neither flattering the Vanity of the Great or Learned, nor deſpiſing the humble Condition of the Poor, or Illiterate. That's the Character of this Divine Apoſtle, in our Text; <hi>Preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching thoſe Things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</hi>

Here's the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of <hi>Revelation:</hi> Here's the Sum of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> And here's an inexhauſtible Fund of the moſt uſeful Preaching and Converſation.

            <p>A Door was now open'd to him of the Lord; a Door of Opportunity, and a Door of Utterance: and he ſpake <hi>boldly</hi> the Myſteries of God. Sometimes he remarks it to the Churches, that he had been <hi>with them in Weakneſs, and in Fear, and in much Trembling:</hi> tho' never to that Degree as to hinder him from declaring to them the Teſtimony of God, and triumphing in Chriſt. It ſeems, even inſpir'd <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had not the Preſence of the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them always in an exact Proportion. But in ſome Places, and on ſome Occaſions, they had the <hi>Joy of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> in ſignal Meaſures, ſo that at ſuch times they remarkably <hi>waxed bold:</hi> and never perhaps was <hi>Paul</hi> more <hi>thorowly made manifeſt,</hi> than among the <hi>Romans.</hi> His Speech and his Preaching was now very eminently <hi>in Demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi> His Faith ſeems now triumphant, and to ſpread all its Glories upon him. He needed a peculiar Preſence of God, to ſupport him under the Weight of that uncommon Service (private, as well as publick) which he muſt have upon his Hands in ſo great and populous a City, while <hi>all</hi> Comers at all Seaſons had free Acceſs to him.—Here too he had ſome of the moſt ſubtle and powerful <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> to conflict with; Here he had his <hi>Martyrdom</hi> in the neareſt Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; and here one of the bittereſt Trials was to befall

him, the <hi>Deſertion of Friends:</hi> on all which Accounts, as he remarkably needed <hi>his Lord to ſtand by him, and ſtrengthen him,</hi> ſo he had now a very remarkable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the gracious Preſence of Chriſt, which gave him Utterance and a Fortitude extraordinary. So that even in learned proud and imperious <hi>Rome</hi> he <hi>was</hi> bold in his God, to make known the Myſteries of the Goſpel; and preach'd Chriſtianity with much Power, with a victorious Faith, and intrepid Aſſurance. He preach'd the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> tho' amidſt <hi>Idol-Temples,</hi> and near the Palace of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> as jealous as he was for the Dignity of his Crown, or the Prieſts and Populace for the Honour of their Idols. The Apoſtle, while he was for allowing to <hi>Ceſar</hi> the Things that were <hi>Ceſar'</hi>s, yet boldly claim'd for GOD the Things that are GOD'S, and for CHRIST the Things that are CHRIST'S, in Oppoſition to the Works of the Devil, and the Uſurpations of Men. He dar'd preach the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> in the <hi>Imperial</hi> City, the Miſtreſs of the World, and the Mother of Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And here he triumph'd in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> tho' deſpiſed of Men. He glory'd in the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> though to the <hi>Jews</hi> a Stumbling-block, and to the <hi>Greeks</hi> Fooliſhneſs. They might pour Contempt on the Doctrine of a <hi>crucify'd Saviour,</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom not of this World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but he ſaw a Divine Glory in the Goſpel, and counting all Things but Loſs, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Jeſus, he <hi>preach'd the Things concerning Chriſt, and the Kingdom of God, with all Confidence,</hi> with the full Aſſurance of Faith, and the Rejoicing of Hope firm to the End; free from all anxious Diffidence, Reluctance, Fear, or Shame; and ſurmounting all Diſcouragements.</p>
            <p>Perhaps (by the Way) this his heroic <hi>Confidence</hi> might be one Occaſion of that happy Circumſtance, <hi>No Man forbidding him:</hi> for they might as well attempt to ſtay the Sun in the Heavens from its Courſe, as go about to forbid the Progreſs of this bold and zealous Preacher in his Work, who like the Sun was a burning and ſhining Light, and in the daily Revolutions of his Miniſtry went forth in the Strength of the Lord, rejoicing as a ſtrong Man to run a Race. But <hi>the good Hand of his God upon him,</hi> is principally to be ey'd in this remarkable
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004510_0009_100D5E3CED45EB88"/>
Concurrence of Events; the Boldneſs of the Apoſtle, and the Tameneſs of his Adverſaries. The God that ſtopt the Mouths of ravening Lions, in the Caſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> made all Iniquity to ſtop her Mouth, in the Caſe of this Apoſtle, and <hi>delivered him out of the Mouth of the Lion.</hi> So it was that God, who maketh Man's Mouth; even He, who put forth his Hand, and touched <hi>Jeremiah'</hi>s Mouth; He, who ſent one of the Seraphim, with a live-Coal from off the Altar, to touch <hi>Iſaiah'</hi>s Lips, and made his Mouth like a ſharp Sword; 'twas the ſame Hand of God, that open'd the Mouth of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and gave him that good Treaſure he had within, of Knowledge, Grace and Comfort, ſo that out of the Abundance of his Heart, his Mouth ſpake, <hi>of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the Things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all Confidence.</hi>

PROP. I. The Goſpel reveals to us <hi>the Kingdom of God and thoſe Things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it may be ſaid diſtinctly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Goſpel reveals to us <hi>the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if it be inquired, <hi>What</hi> Kingdom? I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">(1). It reveals to us a Kingdom of <hi>Providence,</hi> which extends thro' the univerſal <hi>Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It tells us, that <hi>God hath prepared his Throne in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and his Kingdom ruleth over all:</hi> reaches thro' all Worlds, Heaven, Earth, and Hell. The Doctrine of a Divine Providence is the Dictate of Reaſon, as well as Revelation: tho' the Glories of this Providential Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion are vail'd to the Eye of natural Reaſon. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears but <hi>a baſe Kingdom,</hi> without the Goſpel to ſhew us the Myſteries of it.—Nor can we by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture learn <hi>the Manner of the Kingdom,</hi> as adminiſtred by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Mediator; to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is committed, and who hath the Keys of Hell and of Death. This is one of the <hi>Peculiars</hi> of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: a Doctrine of Chriſtianity, full of Myſtery and Glory, and big with Leſſons of Duty.—But it is not the Kingdom of <hi>Nature,</hi> the Dominion of <hi>Providence,</hi> in any View of it, that our Text has ſo direct a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Goſpel reveals to us a Kingdom of <hi>Grace,</hi> which extends only to the Church and peculiar People of God in the Earth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> ſpoken of in our Text, and which is ſo celebrated a Subject in Revelation, means in general the Diſpenſation of Redemption by Chriſt; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that <hi>mediatory Dominion of Grace,</hi> which concerns <hi>Souls</hi> in this World, and which our <hi>Lord-Redeemer</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes over them by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Metaphor of a <hi>Kingdom</hi> is choſen to ſhadow out the <hi>Excellencies</hi> of this Diſpenſation of Grace; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to repreſent the glorious Rectitude, the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and bleſſed State of Things in a <hi>renewed Soul.</hi> It imports a Throne erected, a Divine Authority exerciſed, and a Divine Power exerted; a Law written, Allegiance ſworn, and Homage paid; a comely Order and Harmony reſtored; a Pardon diſpens'd, and Peace ſpoken; Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges

and Honours confer'd; great and precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes apply'd: a vital Union to Chriſt, the Head of his Body, the Church; and I may add, an Union of Hearts among all the Subjects of this Kingdom; and, what crowns all, the Stability of this Dominion and Happineſs. For the <hi>Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure: The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> The <hi>Throne of Chriſt</hi> in his People's Hearts <hi>ſhall endure for ever;</hi> and <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not be able to prevail againſt it.</hi> This Kingdom of Grace in the Soul, is <hi>a Kingdom that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:</hi> moleſted it may be, but not diſſolv'd.</p>
            <p>This is ſometimes called <hi>the</hi> Kingdom, by way of Eminence; becauſe it is incomparable for true Glory, Happineſs, and Duration; and becauſe this was <hi>that</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the diffuſive Spread and flouriſhing State whereof the <hi>Old Teſtament Prophecies</hi> ſpake of, upon which the <hi>Jews</hi> founded their Expectation of the <hi>Kingdom's being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to Iſrael,</hi> tho' their Notion of the Thing was all carnal and worldly.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſometimes call'd the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Kingdom; becauſe in its Nature it partakes of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and prepares us for it, tends to it, and ends in it.</p>
            <p>'Tis call'd in our Text, and elſewhere, the Kingdom of <hi>God:</hi> becauſe it is of a divine <hi>Nature,</hi> and of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Original,</hi> reſulting from the Purpoſe of Divine <hi>Grace</hi> from everlaſting, contriv'd by divine <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> effected by Divine <hi>Power,</hi> and exhibiting the Image of Divine <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;</hi> becauſe the Divine <hi>Sovereignty</hi> is here diſplay'd in its brighteſt Glory; becauſe a <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to God is the great Law of this Kingdom, and the <hi>Fruition</hi> of God is the great Reward of its Subjects; becauſe the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> which is of God by Faith, is the grand Baſis of this Kingdom; the <hi>Word</hi> of God, the Charter of its Privileges; the <hi>Chriſt</hi> of God, the Purchaſer, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, the Beſtower of them: in fine, becauſe this Kingdom ſtands in direct Oppoſition to the Kingdom of <hi>Satan,</hi> the god of this World; is above the Reach of human Uſurpation, and infinitely excells all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the <hi>Sons of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſpoken of in our Text, is primarily of a <hi>moral ſpiritual</hi> Kind, an <hi>inward</hi> Thing, <hi>in the hidden Man of the Heart.</hi> It's a Kingdom <hi>not of this World,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004510_0012_100D5E430EDCA830"/>
as our Saviour aſſures us; not of an earthly and temporal Reference; not lying in Civils, and mere Externals; not having Men's natural Lives, Liberties, and Properties in this World, for the immediate Object of its Dominion: No, but it is a Kingdom <hi>within</hi> Men, a Kingdom in the Soul, a Rule over the Underſtanding and Will, the Heart and Conſcience; rectifying and conducting the Powers of the <hi>inner Man;</hi> a Kingdom of heavenly Light and Love, and filial Liberty <hi>within;</hi> a Kingdom that conſiſts (as the Apoſtle expreſſes it) <hi>in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>—It is a Kingdom ſet up in Honour of <hi>God, our Saviour;</hi> that the Son of God may <hi>manifeſt his Glory,</hi> in deſtroying the Prince of this World, and that Men may with their <hi>Heart,</hi> as well as Lips, <hi>honour the Son, even as they honour the Father</hi>

                  <hi>Having multiply'd Scripture-Quotations in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I have for Brevity often omitted citing</hi> Book, Chapter <hi>and</hi> Verſe.</note>.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the Kingdom of Grace may be conſider'd as in ſome Reſpects under an <hi>outward</hi> and viſible, as well as an <hi>inward</hi> and inviſible Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> ſometimes in Scripture ſeems to be meant the <hi>viſible</hi> Kingdom of Chriſt, or the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Adminiſtration of his ſpiritual Government in the Church, mediately by his Word and Ordinances: as where we read of the <hi>Kingdom's</hi> being <hi>taken away;</hi> the <hi>Children of the Kingdom,</hi> their being <hi>caſt out,</hi> &amp;c.—The <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> of this outward Polity are exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to us in the ſacred <hi>Scriptures:</hi> The <hi>Subjects</hi> of it are viſible Saints: One eminent <hi>Sign</hi> or Badge of it is the holy <hi>Sabbath:</hi> An <hi>Oath</hi> of Allegiance to the King of <hi>Zion</hi> is adminiſter'd in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and a <hi>Recognition</hi> of the Vows of God upon us ſolemnly made at the <hi>Lord's Table: Societies</hi> for Communion in Worſhip, Church-Order, and Diſcipline, are inſtituted: and <hi>Officers</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, with a ſubordinate miniſterial Power, to lead and preſide in <hi>the Houſe of the Kingdom</hi> &amp;c.—Now the Kingdom of God, in this Notion of it, we muſt take

Heed that we don't reject, or ſlight: but acknowlege Chriſt's kingly Authority in his viſible Church and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances, by <hi>a profeſſed Subjection to the Goſpel,</hi> and by a Care to <hi>walk in all his Commandments and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, blameleſs.</hi> We muſt make it our Concern and Study, to <hi>hold faſt the Form of ſound Words,</hi> and to <hi>keep the Ordinances as they have been delivered to us; confeſſing Chriſt before Men,</hi> and honouring him by all due Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegements in external Practice.—It's uſual to ſay, There's the <hi>viſible Kingdom of God</hi> among a People ſo doing.</p>
            <p>We may note here, The <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> as to it's external Appearance, Form, or Mode, has paſs'd under a Variety of Diſpenſations, Revolutions and Degrees of Advancement, ſince its original Foundation. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has ever been ſubſtantially one; but adminiſter'd at ſundry Times in divers Manners. The laſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which is commonly nam'd the <hi>Goſpel-Diſpenſation,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of God incarnate, is the moſt perfect of all. This was long lookt for by the <hi>Jews;</hi> tho' they had wrong Ideas of its Nature and Deſign. We read of devout Men among them, <hi>who waited for the Kingdom of God.</hi> And the Phariſees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the Time, <hi>when the Kingdom of God ſhould come;</hi> meaning, when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> would inherit the Throne of his Father <hi>David,</hi> and introduce his expected Reign.</p>
            <p>It's thought by ſome, this <hi>viſible</hi> Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is only intended, where Chriſt ſays to the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Phariſees, <hi>No Doubt the Kingdom of God is come upon you;</hi> and concerning the <hi>little Children</hi> bro't to him, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> So where the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Hebrews</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>received a Kingdom which cannot be moved;</hi> and the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to be <hi>delivered from the Power of Darkneſs, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son.</hi>—But I can't help thinking, altho' <hi>that</hi> Senſe be comprehended, yet there's a richer and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Senſe, which is by no means to be excluded, in the moſt (if not all) of theſe, and other ſuch Paſſages.</p>
            <p>If we wou'd <hi>ſpeak of the Glory of God's Kingdom, and talk of his Power,</hi> we muſt turn our Eye to the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>vital</hi> Diſpenſation. The <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> conſider'd subjectively, is in its general Notion the ſame with what

is elſewhere denominated the <hi>New Creature, the Image of God,</hi> &amp;c. It means that Syſtem of heavenly Graces, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought in the Soul by the Power of God, in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And how great is its Beauty and Worth, its Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Neceſſity! The <hi>Externals</hi> of the Kingdom are, in their Order and Place, truly excellent and highly amiable. <hi>His Foundation is in the holy Mountains: The Lord loveth the Gates of</hi> Zion, <hi>more than all the Dwellings of</hi> Jacob: <hi>Glorious Things are ſpoken of thee, O City of God.</hi> But among all its Glories, this is the moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable; <hi>Of</hi> Zion <hi>it ſhall be ſaid, This and that Man was</hi> BORN <hi>in her.</hi>—What are all the viſible Beauties and Benefits of the outward Diſpenſation, to thoſe of the ſecret inviſible Empire of God, ſet up in a Soul, in the <hi>new</hi> BIRTH! <hi>The King's Daughter is all glorious</hi> WITHIN. As for the Glory of <hi>external</hi> Advantages, it lies in their being Divine Appointments, and wiſely adapted Means, own'd and ſanctify'd of God, to ſubſerve the bleſſed Purpoſes of his Grace, in regard to the <hi>internal</hi> Diſpenſation. They are a noble <hi>Apparatus</hi> &amp; <hi>Attendant</hi> to this: but <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> from this, the <hi>external</hi> Frame of Chriſtianity fails of its genuine Uſe and End; and in that Regard hath no Glory, however ſplendid an Appearance it may make. The viſible Diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace, without the inviſible Work of Grace in the Heart; the mere <hi>Form of Godlineſs,</hi> tho' brighten'd with the fair Shew of all homiletical Virtues, giving Perſons or Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties <hi>a Name that they live;</hi> This is certainly but the Shadow, not the Subſtance and Reality of the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi>—Reigning <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> (which is conſiſtent with the Height of external Zeal in Offices of Devotion and Duties of moral Practice) determines Men real Slaves to the <hi>Prince of Darkneſs:</hi> and we have Reaſon to fear, many a Church on Earth, that calls it ſelf a Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is indeed little elſe but a <hi>Synagogue of Satan.</hi> However highly they may make their Boaſt in God and his Kingdom, little more can be ſaid, than that <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is come nigh them.</hi>—We may, in regard of Convictions and Reformation, be <hi>not far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God;</hi> and yet in Fact not <hi>receive</hi> it. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, where there's a truly proſperous State of <hi>Externals</hi> in

            <p>
               <hi>Receiving</hi> the Kingdom of God, means a vital Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and active Aſſumption; moſt aptly expreſſing the Nature and Operation of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is a receptive and accepting Grace; whoſe Seat is in the <hi>Heart</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> and whoſe Office is to <hi>receive Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, our Righteouſneſs.</hi>—The <hi>Soul</hi> of Man is the prime Object of the whole Adminiſtration of this Kingdom; and it is in its whole Genius &amp; Frame <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> ſuited to our immortal Part.—The <hi>Law</hi> of this Kingdom is ſpiritual: I mean <hi>the royal Law of Liberty, the Law written, not with Ink, nor in Tables of Stone, but in fleſhly Tables of the Heart;</hi> reaching to the inmoſt Receſſes of the Soul, and <hi>bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chriſt.</hi>—The <hi>Service of the Kingdom</hi> is in its Nature, its Principles and Motives, ſpiritual: 'Tis a worſhiping God <hi>in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> a ſerving Him <hi>with our Spirit</hi> in the Goſpel of his Son.—The <hi>Privileges</hi> of this Kingdom are <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings</hi> and <hi>heavenly Things in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 'Tis a Kingdom <hi>in</hi> this World, but not <hi>of</hi> it, not derivative from it, nor terminating in it, not participating of it, nor dependent upon it.—Its <hi>Properties,</hi> its <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Ends,</hi> are all ſublime and ſpiritual.—The diſtinguiſhing <hi>Character</hi> of ſuch as have <hi>receiv'd</hi> this Kingdom is, <hi>They that be ſpiritual; ſpiritually minded, walking in the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.—Which leads me to obſerve, The grand Operator, in ſetting up and advancing this Kingdom, is the bleſſed <hi>Spirit of Grace:</hi> He is the immediate Agent, and (ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking) the ſole Efficient. Indeed the Apoſtle ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times intitles Miniſters <hi>Fellow-workers to the Kingdom of God:</hi> But this is to be underſtood of their Employment in the <hi>external</hi> Adminiſtration. For they have not, by any Art of their own, an Acceſs to the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men; nor Power, as of themſelves, to produce the Kingdom of God <hi>within</hi> Men. In reſpect of this Effect, the ſame Apoſtle confeſſes himſelf <hi>Nothing:</hi> but <hi>glories in his Infirmities, that the Power of Chriſt might reſt upon him. We have this Treaſure</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in earthen Veſſels, that the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Power may be of God, and not of Men.</hi> And
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004510_0016_100D5E4CA2C50040"/>
when it pleaſes God to <hi>ſend forth the Spirit of his Son into our Hearts,</hi> exerting his Divine Influences in Concurrence with the Miniſtry of the Word, it is ſeen that <hi>the King-of God is not in Word, but in Power.</hi> The holy Ghoſt with unerring Wiſdom &amp; Skill conducts the Affairs of this ſpiritual Kingdom; and with uncontroulable Liberty, with an Energy invincible, and overpowering all Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he proſecutes the glorious Deſigns of it: ſets it up in Regeneration, and carries it on in progreſſive Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.—But in the whole He acts in Subordination to the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who is repreſented as the ſupreme Truſtee of Divine Power, and prime Head of Influences, whom the Father hath <hi>ſet King on his holy Hill of</hi> Zion. <hi>Unto the</hi> SON <hi>he ſaith, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever: Sit thou at my right Hand, until I make thine Enemies thy Footſtool: Thy People ſhall be willing in the Day of thy Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it be ſubjoin'd here; This is a Kingdom that is daily carrying on among Men, and ſhall be commenſurate in <hi>Duration</hi> with Earth and Time, yea with Heaven and Eternity.

               </gap> beatific Influx. The Goſpel acquaints us, that it was <hi>prepared from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World;</hi> declares it the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of the Croſs of Chriſt; makes the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of it to them that are in Chriſt; pronounces <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Fore-runner,</hi> who is for us entred into it, and ſet down with his Father in his Throne; proclaims <hi>Jeſus</hi> the final <hi>Judge,</hi> the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and the <hi>Life;</hi> in a Word, reveals the incarnate SON of God, as together with the FATHER, and the SPIRIT (One God over all, bleſſed for ever) the <hi>eternal</hi> Object of Worſhip and Happineſs to the Saints in Light. Hence theſe are repreſented as ſtanding before the <hi>Throne of God and the Lamb,</hi> reigning with Him <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>But what is <hi>the Manner of the Kingdom</hi> above, what it's peculiar Laws and Methods of Adminiſtration (whether in the preſent State of ſeparate Souls, or the future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection-State) and what its admirable Immunities, divine Treaſures, exalted Honours, Delights, &amp; verily <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, neither Ear heard,</hi> nor of theſe Things is <hi>the Heart of Man,</hi> in this our degenerate and feeble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, capable of forming or admitting any exact and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate Ideas.—Only the Goſpel reveals ſo much as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently aſſures us, in the general, it is a Kingdom of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Glory, immenſe Riches, and ecſtatick Pleaſures without End.—<hi>Enough</hi> this, in the Senſe of inlighten'd Reaſon, to draw our Attention, to attract our Deſires, and warm our Affections, to excite our Hopes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us in the Purſuit of this Kingdom of God: <hi>Enough,</hi> to nouriſh the Saints Faith and Love and ſpiritual Life, to refreſh us in our Pilgrim-State, to eaſe our Griefs, and ſilence our Complaints, while under many Burdens, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004510_0018_100D312A279E0760"/>
through mighty Oppoſitions, we are walking in the <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Way,</hi> which leads to the Kingdom.—Thus much concerning it we have reveal'd to us, with infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: and nothing further was really needful for us at preſent to know. What of the <hi>Glory</hi> remains <hi>to be revealed,</hi> we ſhall <hi>know hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it be obſerv'd now, Thô this State of <hi>Glory</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be ultimately reſpected in our Text; yet it's the State of <hi>Grace</hi> here on Earth, that is more immediately in View. <hi>The Kingdom,</hi> thô a <hi>heavenly</hi> Kingdom, thô <hi>not of this World</hi> (neither eſtabliſh'd on a worldly Deſign, nor having its Iſſue in the preſent World) yet has its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence and Operation here.—This ſpiritual Kingdom has been erected and ſupported among Mankind <hi>from the Beginning:</hi> taking the Date of its <hi>Projection</hi> from the Days of <hi>Eternity,</hi> but of its actual <hi>Riſe</hi> from the Days of our <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> commencing with that primitive and fundamental Promiſe made upon their Fall, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's Head.</hi>—All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long thrô the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ages, there was in one Degree or another the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> among Men. Yet the moſt illuſtrious Diſpenſation of it was reſerv'd to be the Diſtinction of the Church's <hi>laſt Age.</hi> Says our Lord, <hi>From the Days of</hi> John Baptiſt <hi>the Kingdom of God is preached, and every Man preſſeth into it.</hi> But in the Days of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, this was eminently the Caſe. Then was that Saying of our Lord fulfilled, <hi>I tell you there be ſome ſtanding here, which ſhall not taſte of Death, until they have ſeen the Kingdom of God come with</hi> POWER. Truly, then was there an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diſplay of the Power of God, in a quick Progreſs of his ſpiritual Kingdom, in its wide Extent, and in the tranſcendent Degree of its Proſperity and Glory, as to the Internals, as well as Externals of it. Then Converſions were numerous; <hi>Thouſands</hi> at a Time <hi>added to the Lord; Nations born in a Day.</hi> And the Converts of <hi>Zion,</hi> in that happy Seaſon, appear to have had the Spirit in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Meaſures. Not to mention their miraculous Gifts, it ſeems their heavenly Graces were in general very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in a flouriſhing State; having a Vitality, a ſenſible Growth &amp; Evidence, beyond what's common.—O when
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004510_0019_100D5E534F73AC58"/>
ſhall we ſee the Return of ſuch triumphant <hi>Days of the Son of Man!</hi> By the Grace of God we have a Proſpect of another bleſſed Period, that will even <hi>exceed in Glory:</hi> when the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel</hi> ſhall <hi>fly like Lightning,</hi> with reſiſtleſs Power and aſtoniſhing Succeſs; ſhall again be preach'd <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven</hi> in a remarkable Manner, and <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> be every where diffus'd and eſtabliſh'd thrô all the Earth; when <hi>the Kingdom and the Greatneſs of the Kingdom ſhall be given to the People of the Saints of the moſt High.</hi> We ſhou'd pray for the haſtning of thoſe glorious <hi>Times of Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time we have it to acknowlege unto the Praiſe of a ſovereign God, that there is <hi>even now a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according to the Election of Grace,</hi> and a promiſing Appearance of the Increaſe of their Number, who have <hi>receiv'd the Kingdom of God,</hi> thô in lower Meaſures. For this <hi>heavenly Kingdom</hi> as it now exiſts and appears in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, eſpecially in its Beginnings, ſeems in general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively but as <hi>a Grain of Muſtard-Seed,</hi> in regard to its <hi>ſmall</hi> Figure, and at leaſt oftentimes but as <hi>Leven hid in Meel,</hi> with regard to its <hi>ſecret</hi> Operation; yet there's the Reality, and a gradual Prevalence. Every one that is <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> does actually <hi>ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> in its initial Diſpenſation. To ſuch it's given to <hi>know</hi> vitally and experimentally <hi>the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> For it muſt be noted, that (properly ſpeaking) the Kingdom of <hi>Grace</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Glory</hi> are not <hi>two</hi> Kingdoms, ſpecifically or eſſentially diſtinct; but only differing gradually, and in reſpect of their various Modes of Adminiſtration: Otherwiſe, they are for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one and the ſame, and go under the common Name of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The State of <hi>Grace,</hi> and the State of <hi>Glory,</hi> are not only connected inviolably in the Purpoſe and Covenant of God, but alſo nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and united in their general Nature. <hi>Heaven</hi> comes down into the Soul in <hi>Regeneration;</hi> this is the actual Commencement of heavenly Bliſs. The Kingdom of <hi>Grace</hi> is the Kingdom of <hi>Glory</hi> in its inchoate and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Eſtate. And what's the Kingdom of <hi>Glory,</hi> but the Kingdom <hi>Grace</hi> in its Conſummation, its triumphant State, and full diſplay under a varying Form of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration?</p>

I ſhall now cloſe this Point with ſuggeſting a few practical <hi>Reflections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this we ſee the <hi>forlorn</hi> and <hi>wretched</hi> State of Souls <hi>unregenerate,</hi> in that they are Strangers to the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> in this World; and continuing ſo, muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> be excluded the Kingdom of God in the next.—By this we ſee how <hi>happy</hi> is the Day of a Sinner's <hi>Converſion,</hi> and the Occaſion there is for <hi>Joy</hi> at every ſpiritual <hi>Birth,</hi> when a Soul is initiated into the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi>—We ſee the Reaſon of believing <hi>Parents</hi> ſo anxiouſly <hi>weeping for their Children</hi> while in a State of Nature, and <hi>travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Birth again, until Chriſt be formed in them, the Kingdom of God</hi> ſet up in their Souls.—What <hi>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Sentiments ſhould we have of the <hi>Saints,</hi> thô <hi>poor</hi> in this World, yet <hi>rich</hi> in Faith, and Heirs of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom!</hi>—And what mutual <hi>Endearment</hi> ought there ever to ſubſiſt between all theſe! <hi>Theſe,</hi> who are <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the Kingdom and Patience of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> here, and will hereafter be Companions for ever in the <hi>Kingdom and Joy of their Lord.</hi>—Let it be added; while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect with Grief and Shame on our Apoſtacy and Fall in <hi>Adam</hi> (by whom came <hi>Sin</hi> into the World, and by this the Kingdom of the <hi>Devil,</hi> that wicked Spirit which rules in the Children of Diſobedience ever ſince) we ſhou'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and magnify the ſtupendous Wiſdom and Grace of God in raiſing up a <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> to repair the ſuffering Honour of his violated Law, to dethrone the Enemy of our Souls, and <hi>reſtore the Kingdom to Iſrael.</hi>—And ſhou'd we not with equal Wonder and Praiſe celebrate the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> who hath <hi>reſtored that which be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not away,</hi> and has done this at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his own precious <hi>Blood;</hi> by the Merit of which he <hi>purchaſed</hi> the Kingdom of God, and in Virtue of which he receiv'd Power, in his riſen State, to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bleſſing to whom he will; even to <hi>as many as the Father hath given him</hi> for a peculiar People to himſelf. The <hi>Kingdom is the Lord's;</hi> his Property, and at his Diſpoſe. Hence that of Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed to me a Kingdom.</hi> And we read, <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right Hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance unto Iſrael,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004510_0021_100D5E57C2D7C0B0"/>
and Remiſſion of Sins:</hi> which two Redemption-Bleſſings are the leading Benefits of the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> the firſt royal Donatives of our <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Saviour.</hi> O what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Adoration and Thankſgiving to Chriſt do theſe Reflections preſent to us! Shall we not all join in the Cry of the Multitude that followed him at his triumphant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Hoſanna! Bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Bleſſed be the Kingdom of our Father</hi> David, <hi>that cometh in the Name of the Lord; Hoſanna in the higheſt!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in many of theſe Hints I have been inſenſibly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating the proper Thoughts on the other Article before us: which therefore I ſhall be the briefer upon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Goſpel reveals to us <hi>thoſe Things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Light of Reaſon we have ſome Notions of the Being and Perfections of God, and his Kingdom of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: but <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> intended in our Text, and <hi>the Things that concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (which do abundantly improve and add to rational Light in the Things of Nature and Providence) are diſcoverable only by the ſupernatural Light of Revelation. <hi>The Kingdom of God</hi> is a Kingdom of Grace, conſtituted and adminiſtred <hi>according to the Counſel of his own Will:</hi> And hence Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation was neceſſary to the Knowledge of that. So <hi>the Things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are Matters of pure Revelation: ſuch as the natural Reaſon of Man cou'd never have brought to Light. 'Tis the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Glory of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to reveal theſe Things to the Sons of Men.</p>
            <p>And what a rich Variety of Things, great and glorious <hi>Things concerning Chriſt,</hi> are diſcovered to us in the Goſpel of his Grace! <hi>The Kingdom of God</hi> is a comprehenſive Article among <hi>thoſe Things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and ſometimes they ſeem all to be ſum'd up in that. But the Apoſtle here adds a more extenſive Phraſe, in order to include <hi>all other Things</hi> not ſo evidently couch'd in the Idea of <hi>the Kingdom of God.</hi> The whole Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in ſacred Writ, from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> is relative to CHRIST, in ſome Manner and Degree: But our Text eminently points us to thoſe Things which have
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004510_0022_100D5E59E7EF3888"/>
a more <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>next</hi> Reference to him in the Chriſtian Revelation.</p>
            <p>Thus for Inſtance, the Goſpel reveals to us the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Chriſt, as <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh;</hi> his <hi>Office,</hi> as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, under the ſeveral Characters of a Prophet, and a Prieſt, as well as King; the <hi>Covenant of Redemption,</hi> and the Promiſes made to Him before the World began; the <hi>Predeſtination</hi> of the <hi>Elect</hi> unto Life in and by him; the <hi>Types</hi> &amp; <hi>Prophecies</hi> of Him in old Time, and their punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Accompliſhment</hi> in Him; the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Myſtery</hi> of his Incarnation, Conception and Birth, his Life, Miracles and Sufferings, his Death and Reſurrection, his Aſcenſion into Glory, and ſitting down at the right Hand of the Majeſty in the Heavens; ſo the <hi>Doctrine</hi> he taught, the Laws and Inſtitutes he made, the Promiſes he gave, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Perſon, or by his inſpir'd Miniſters; the Miſſion of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> as a Teacher, Sanctifier and Comforter, his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Agency, and abiding Preſence; the Commiſſion and Inſpiration of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the Revelations made to them, and publiſhed by them, their Miniſtry and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, confirm'd with Signs and Wonders; his ſetting up of the <hi>Goſpel-Church,</hi> demoliſhing the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and viſiting the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to take out of them a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for his Name.—In brief, we have revealed to us the <hi>Example</hi> of Chriſt; his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> in the Merit thereof; the unſearchable Riches of his <hi>Grace,</hi> and the abſolute <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of his Power to ſave; the <hi>Way</hi> of Salvation by him, the <hi>Benefits</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Him, and the <hi>Duties</hi> we owe to Him; his being the <hi>Head</hi> of his Body, the Church, and Head over all Things to the Church; his being appointed the <hi>Heir</hi> of all Things, and <hi>Judge</hi> of the World; his <hi>ſecond</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, his <hi>raiſing</hi> the Dead, and diſpenſing both Rewards and Puniſhments everlaſting.—This is an incomplete and immethodical Abſtract of <hi>thoſe Things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I pretend not to an exact and perfect Enumeration: much leſs to a perfect Comprehenſion of the Meaning of all theſe Things. But when I meditate them, I ſoon find my ſelf loſt in Wonder, and can't or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Speech by reaſon of Darkneſs. <hi>Without Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,</hi> GREAT <hi>is the Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> the Myſtery of

               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Yet all that's neceſſary to be known by us in our preſent State, is in the Goſpel ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently revealed: and as for what tranſcends our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, this however muſt exerciſe our Humility, our Faith and Hope, and remain the Subject of our adoring Thoughts.</p>

            <p>PROP. II. <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel are to</hi> preach <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and</hi> teach <hi>thoſe Things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Text tells us, the Apoſtle did ſo; tis remark'd of of him twice in this Chapter, and often elſewhere: and this is recorded <hi>for our Admonition,</hi> upon whom the Ends of the World are come.—Here let it be ſaid briefly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt preach the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> revealed in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Our Context ſpeaks of <hi>Paul's expounding</hi> and <hi>teſtifying the Kingdom of God.</hi> And we read (Chap. 19. 9.) of his <hi>daily diſputing, and perſuading the Things concerning the Kingdom of God.</hi> Even thus Miniſters muſt labour (every one, as of the Ability, which God giveth) to <hi>teſtify,</hi> and <hi>expound,</hi> alſo (if need be) to <hi>diſpute,</hi> and <hi>perſuade</hi> theſe Things.</p>
            <p>We ſhould <hi>teſtify</hi> the Kingdom of God, aſſerting its Reality and Exiſtence; and it will be well, if we are able to <hi>witneſs</hi> unto this from our own happy <hi>Experience.</hi> So we muſt <hi>expound</hi> it, as we are able, in its whole Extent and Compaſs; its Nature, its Properties, and Purpoſes; the Laws and Benefits of it; the Promiſes concerning it; and the <hi>Truths</hi> relating to it, or inſeparably connected with it; particularly the Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> that Truth which is ſo evidently fundamental to the Scheme of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and without a due Attention to which we ſhall be likely to entertain very crude Conceptions of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God;</hi> alſo the Doctrine of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> its Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity reſulting from Original Sin, its Author the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> its Fruits in the chriſtian Life, its eſſential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with eternal Happineſs, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> without a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to which important Points, we ſhall have but very ſuperficial Notions of the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi> Hence, if we

wou'd <hi>expound,</hi> as we ought, the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> we ſhould ſtudy and preach theſe great Goſpel-Truths.—We muſt likewiſe be ready even to <hi>diſpute,</hi> as the Apoſtle did, and <hi>contend earneſtly for the Faith,</hi> in regard of <hi>the Things pertaining to the Kingdom of God;</hi> with Meekneſs and Wiſdom inſtructing ſuch as oppoſe themſelves; labouring to convince Gainſayers, and put them to Silence. We muſt contend againſt all the <hi>Enemies</hi> of the Kingdom of God; <hi>wreſtle againſt Fleſh and Blood,</hi> and againſt <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wickedneſſes in high Places; reſiſt the Devil and the World,</hi> Vice and Error, in all their various Forms, with the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> the Word of Truth.—And like the Apoſtle, we muſt alſo <hi>perſuade</hi> the Things concerning the Kingdom of God; reaſoning with Men out of the Scriptures, to convince them of the Folly of Rebellion, and the Wiſdom of Submiſſion to God; exhorting and calling Men to a profeſſed Subjection, and Obedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed to the Gentiles, <hi>that they ſpou'd repent, and turn to God, and do Works meet for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> He <hi>teſtified both to Jews, and Greeks, Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And the Diſciples he <hi>perſuaded to continue in the Grace of God,</hi> bringing forth the Fruits of the Kingdom, the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt to the Praiſe and Glory of God.</p>
            <p>In a Word, we muſt teach <hi>the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This enters into the Notion of preaching the Kingdom of God. The adorable <hi>Trinity</hi> all concur in the Diſpenſation of Redemption; acting each his diſtinct Part in the Affairs of this Kingdom: and ſo far as Divine Revelation will carry us, we muſt <hi>teſtify, expound,</hi> and <hi>perſuade</hi> theſe Things, as <hi>Things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</hi> We muſt preach the <hi>Father of Mercies</hi> and <hi>God of all Grace:</hi> we muſt preach the <hi>Spirit of Holineſs:</hi> and we muſt preach the <hi>Lord of Glory.</hi> While we remember the <hi>Creator,</hi> we muſt never forget the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and the <hi>

that have a <hi>near Relation</hi> to Chriſt, his Perſon and Mediation. So the Apoſtle did: he <hi>preach'd Jeſus, and the Reſurrection.</hi> He <hi>preach'd not himſelf, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord.</hi>—He <hi>preached Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though we are not to confine our Preaching wholly to <hi>the Things which</hi> in their direct Aſpect <hi>concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but may and ought to teach many Things that do but <hi>reductively</hi> and <hi>remotely</hi> concern Chriſt: Yet the ſpecial Subject, on which we ſhould often dwell, and very much lay out our Miniſtry, is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Things</hi> more <hi>immediately</hi> concerning Chriſt. Here muſt be the Emphaſis, the Accent, in our Preaching. We muſt preach <hi>the Things concerning the Name of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> his <hi>Perſon,</hi> Natures and Perfections both Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; his <hi>Meſſiahſhip,</hi> or mediatorial Character; his <hi>Charge</hi> of a peculiar People, <hi>choſen in him,</hi> and <hi>given him</hi> of the Father, before the World; his <hi>Miſſion,</hi> and <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> in Time; his <hi>Offices,</hi> and Execution of them; his <hi>States</hi> of Humiliation and Exaltation: the Authority, Excellency, and Uſefulneſs of his <hi>Doctrine</hi> &amp; <hi>Revelation;</hi> the Reaſons of his <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Sufferings;</hi> the Ends of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion;</hi> his <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Interceſſion in Heaven, his <hi>Prophetical</hi> Acts, and <hi>Regal</hi> Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; his <hi>ſecond Coming</hi> and Kingdom, the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and eternal <hi>Judgment.</hi> In Sum, his <hi>Purchaſes,</hi> his <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and <hi>Triumphs;</hi> the <hi>Benefits</hi> of his Salvation, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in Him; the Office of his <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Application of Redemption; the Neceſſity and Efficacy of his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> imputed to us, and received by <hi>Faith,</hi> in the Buſineſs of <hi>Juſtification;</hi> the Neceſſity and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy alſo of his <hi>Grace,</hi> in the Converſion of Sinners, and Perſeverance of Saints; the Stability of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> in him; the exceeding Riches of God's <hi>Mercy</hi> in and thro' him; the Greatneſs and Freeneſs of his <hi>Love,</hi> the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations</hi> of Gratitude we are under to him, and the righteous <hi>Claims</hi> he has upon us;—the <hi>Duties</hi> we owe him, and more eſpecially that comprehenſive Duty of <hi>believing</hi> in him, <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to his Righteouſneſs, and <hi>depending</hi> on his Grace, <hi>living by the Faith</hi> of the Son of God, and doing whatſoever we do, whether in Word
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004510_0028_100D5E663B5FDC10"/>
or Deed, <hi>in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his <hi>Grace</hi> in and with us, in Obedience to his <hi>Will,</hi> with a Reliance on his <hi>Merits,</hi> and with an Eye to his <hi>Glory; that the Name of our Lord Jeſus may be glorified in us, and we in him, according to the Grace of our God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it be ſubjoined now,</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhou'd preach <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>the Things concerning Chriſt,</hi> both in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and in their <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to one another.</p>
            <p>The Ideas are ſomewhat diſtinct, yet ſo united, as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to involve one the other: and it ſeems to me, there's no forming any juſt Notions of <hi>either</hi> Subject, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing <hi>both.</hi> While we preach the true <hi>Scripture-Doctrine</hi> on the one head, we do indeed implicitly teach the other: But it's abundantly beſt to be <hi>explicit,</hi> in preaching both together. This is to preach after the Manner of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> and primitive Miniſters, as they were taught of God, and led by the Spirit. (See <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 12.—<hi>Chap.</hi> 19. 8, 10. and Context <hi>ver.</hi> 23. with many other Places.) <hi>They</hi> are the proper Standard of Evangelic Preaching<note n="†" place="bottom">The Goſpel indeed <hi>at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in his perſonal Miniſtry: But the <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>full Declaration</hi> of it was left to his <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſpeaking by the Mouth of the Apoſtles, &amp; other inſpir'd Miniſters, after our Lord's Aſcenſion. <hi>Jeſus</hi> indeed, when he was riſen, abode forty Days on Earth, <hi>ſpeaking</hi> to his Diſciples <hi>of the Things pertaining to the</hi> KINGDOM <hi>of God,</hi> &amp; <hi>expounding to them, in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Things concerning</hi> HIMSELF: But thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of his, the Holy Ghoſt hath not been pleas'd to put on Record. And as for his Preaching <hi>in the Days of his Fleſh,</hi> it was very much in <hi>Parables,</hi> &amp; evidently with a deſign'd Reſerve, as to the <hi>Peculiars</hi> of Chriſtianity: But theſe, after his Aſcenſion, were clearly reveal'd by his Spirit to the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> &amp; they, with other faithful Men, <hi>fully preach'd the Goſpel.</hi> They are therefore the juſt Pattern, and adequate Rule of our Preaching.—See Mr. <hi>Jennings'</hi>s two excellent Diſcourſes, of <hi>preaching Chriſt</hi> &amp;c. Edit. N. E. <hi>p.</hi> 26, 29.</note> and it will
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004510_0029_100D5E68484EFFB8"/>
be our Honour, to follow their Example, left on Record for Imitation.—Our Charge is to <hi>preach the Word:</hi> and the Word we preach muſt be both the <hi>Word of the</hi> KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM and <hi>the Word of the Lord</hi> JESUS. The Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and thoſe concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> are, as in their Nature reciprocally dependant, ſo in Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation inſeparably connected: And ſurely <hi>what God hath joined together, Man may not put aſunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's Pity a Miniſter ſhou'd at any time lay the Plan of his Diſcourſe on <hi>one</hi> of theſe Subjects, ſo as to <hi>preclude</hi> the other: and much worſe it is, if he ever makes a Sermon without any explicit Regard to <hi>either</hi> of them. This (in plainneſs of Speech) is to <hi>handle the Word of God deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> and no Apology can in any meaſure juſtify ſuch' Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.—Every ſuitable Theme of a Pulpit-Diſcourſe is reducible under one or other of theſe Heads, improvable to ſerve the Purpoſes of both, or capable of receiving Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration and Enforcement from them. Whatever our <hi>Text</hi> is, the Things of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the Things of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may with the utmoſt Propriety and Pertinence be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, either under the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or the <hi>Application;</hi> and it will be a moſt faulty Omiſſion, in any Diſcourſe to paſs them wholly in Silence.—The Strain of our Preaching ſhou'd turn upon <hi>one</hi> or <hi>other</hi> of theſe Evangelic Subjects: frequently we ſhou'd conſider them <hi>both together,</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in one complex View: and when diſcourſing on <hi>either</hi> of them more <hi>directly,</hi> yet always remember their <hi>Connection</hi> and mutual Dependance, &amp; accordingly conſider the one in its <hi>Reference</hi> and <hi>Subſerviency</hi> to the other.</p>
            <p>In this Method of Preaching we ſhall be likely to <hi>declare the whole Counſel of God,</hi> and <hi>not keep back any Thing that is profitable,</hi> whether as to the Doctrinals or the Practicals of Revelation.—In this Way we ſhall lead our Hearers into the moſt <hi>diſtinct</hi> and moſt <hi>conſiſtent</hi> Notions of the Goſpel, in the Variety of its rich Contents.—In this Way, we ſhall <hi>ſhew our ſelves approved unto God, Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that need not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</hi>—And this is the Way <hi>to commend our ſelves unto every Man's Conſcience in the Sight of God,</hi> to ſuit every one's Reliſh, and to hit every one's Caſe, in the Multiplicity we have to do with.—This is the Way to preſerve the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004510_0030_100D5E6B6C0691A0"/>
               <hi>chriſtian</hi> Religion in its full and evident <hi>Diſtinction</hi> from Paganiſm, Judaiſm, Mahometiſm, and every falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This is the Way to keep the Goſpel <hi>diſtinguiſh'd</hi> from the Law, Faith from Reaſon, the Graces of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity from the Morals of Philoſophy, and the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Proteſtants from that of Papiſts.—In this Way we ſhall <hi>be able by ſound Doctrine both to exhort, and to convince the Gainſayers.</hi> This is the Way to remove the <hi>Offence of the Croſs,</hi> and to make <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> appear <hi>the Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>the Power of God.</hi>—This is the Way to keep Profeſſors <hi>ſound in the Faith,</hi>—and at the ſame time bring them to be <hi>obedient to the Faith.</hi>—In ſhort, This is the Way to advance the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and to promote the true <hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> and <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is Life eternal.</p>
            <p>On the one hand, <hi>Thoſe Things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> exhibit themſelves to us in their ſtrongeſt, their moſt beautiful and ſtriking Light, when diſcourſed in Conjunction with the Things pertaining to the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> When we teach the Things of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Things of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Things that be of God,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly with the <hi>Things of Chriſt:</hi> When we preach Chriſt Jeſus the <hi>Lord,</hi> and our <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> of our Profeſſion; <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the <hi>Prince;</hi> our <hi>Advocate,</hi> and <hi>Judge;</hi> the Object of our <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> &amp; of our <hi>Fear, Love</hi> &amp; <hi>Obedience:</hi> When we preach both his <hi>Croſs,</hi> and his <hi>Crown;</hi> both the <hi>Merits</hi> of his Death, and the <hi>Power</hi> of his Reſurrection; both the <hi>Sceptre</hi> of his Grace, and the <hi>Rod</hi> of his Anger; both his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Example;</hi> both his <hi>Promiſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Precepts;</hi> both <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of Sins, and <hi>Converſion</hi> thro' his Name; in a Word, both <hi>Repentance</hi> towards God, and <hi>Faith</hi> towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: When we thus teach and preach (ſkilfully harmonizing, tempering and balancing Subjects of ſuch a various Tendency and Aſpect) then <hi>the Things which concern Chriſt</hi> appear in their genuine Light, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Importance; carry with them the greateſt Force of Attraction, and are moſt likely to reach their practical Ends and Uſes. This is to handle the Matter wiſely; and they that <hi>win Souls,</hi> are wiſe.—But if we confine our Miniſtry to the ſublime Myſteries concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004510_0031_100D5E6DCA7D1EA0"/>
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and treat them in a ſpeculative and abſtract Manner, excluſively of their practical Inferences, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Things pertaining to the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> we preach the Goſpel of Grace in a very <hi>imperfect Manner,</hi> and may promiſe our ſelves but a very <hi>imperfect Succeſs.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, if ever the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> comes not in <hi>Word</hi> only, but in <hi>Power,</hi> it is when we preach it in Connexion with <hi>the Things that concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When conſider'd in one View with theſe Things, it then appears in its true Glory and Luſtre, and is preach'd with the moſt flaming Light, and ſucceſsful Energy. If we mean to ſave our own Souls, or theirs which hear us, we muſt take Heed to ourſelves and to our Doctrine, that we teach and live <hi>the Doctrine of Chriſt.</hi> We muſt <hi>keep the Faith,</hi> and <hi>preach</hi> it, pure and entire. Our Mouths muſt be fill'd with the great Arguments of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> the Principles of the Religion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> muſt reign in our Sermons; elſe they'll freeze on our Lips, however warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may ſeem to preach the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> in a moral Strain, with a philoſophic Turn of Thought.

Way, without reducing them to their proper Place and Uſe in the <hi>chriſtian</hi> Scheme, and without paying a due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>the Things concerning Chriſt,</hi> this is not (in the Senſe of Scripture) to <hi>preach the Kingdom of God.</hi>—What tho' the <hi>Text</hi> be taken out of the <hi>Bible!</hi> If the Sermon be in 2 philoſophical and unevangelic Strain, the Preacher might as well have taken his Text out of <hi>Seneca'</hi>s Morals.—I deny not, <hi>Morality</hi> is to be preach'd: but then it muſt be <hi>chriſtian</hi> Morality; a Morality ſpringing from <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and animated by Goſpel-Principles and Incentives, govern'd by Goſpel-Rules, and directed to Goſpel-Ends. <hi>Repentance</hi> is to be preach'd, but it muſt be excited by <hi>looking upon Him whom we have pierced.</hi> And <hi>Obedience</hi> is to be preach'd, but it muſt be the Obedience of <hi>Faith.</hi> A <hi>good Converſation</hi> is to be recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but it muſt be a good Converſation <hi>in Chriſt.</hi>—The <hi>Law</hi> is to be taught: but then it muſt be the Law as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in <hi>reveal'd</hi> Religion; and ſo taught, as that it may do the Office of a <hi>Schoolmaſter in bringing Sinners to Chriſt,</hi> and the Part of a <hi>Guide</hi> in conducting <hi>Saints</hi> through the Paths of moral Duty. <hi>The Law is good, if a Man uſe it lawfully,</hi> and teach it wiſely. By the Law is the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Sin:</hi> it is improvable to awaken <hi>Sinners</hi> by the Terror of the <hi>Curſe,</hi> to humble 'em by the Senſe of their own <hi>Depravity</hi> and ſpiritual <hi>Impotence,</hi> to drive 'em out of their <hi>falſe</hi> Confidences, and compel them to ſeek an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by a Senſe of their abſolute Need of his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Grace:</hi> And the <hi>Law</hi> is of Uſe alſo to the <hi>Believer,</hi> for the <hi>Direction</hi> of his moral Carriage, for the preſerving his <hi>Humility,</hi> and keeping him ever <hi>dependant</hi> upon <hi>Chriſt.</hi>—With ſuch Views as theſe, the <hi>Law</hi> is to be taught: and theſe <hi>Uſes</hi> of it are to be kept carefully in our own and our Hearers Eye.

Let me add, Another moſt neceſſary Point to be often inſiſted on, is the Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification</hi> by imputed Righteouſneſs, <hi>even the Righteouſneſs of God, without the Law.</hi> Among all <hi>thoſe Things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and by teſtifying of which the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> is advanced in the World, this is one very eminent Article, That <hi>Chriſt is the Lord our Righteouſneſs;</hi> that Chriſt <hi>is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one which believeth;</hi> That <hi>as by one Man's Diſobedience many were made Sinners, ſo by the Obedience of One</hi> (the ſecond <hi>Adam) many are made righteous;</hi> that <hi>thro' the Name of Jeſus, whoſoever believeth in him, receives Remiſſion of Sins, and the Juſtification of Life.</hi>—This <hi>Truth</hi> is the grand Baſis and Support of the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi> Indeed, what is the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> in its <hi>ſubjective</hi> Notion, but this great <hi>Truth</hi> bro't home to the Soul, powerfully apply'd, and producing its genuine Effects? Hence <hi>the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs,</hi> might well be put in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the one Object of our <hi>firſt</hi> Purſuit.—This <hi>Truth</hi> is the main Subject of <hi>the Teſtimony of Jeſus:</hi> to this gave all the <hi>Prophets</hi> and all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Witneſs.—<q>This <hi>Truth</hi> is that wherein the Stamp of Divine Authority on Scripture-Revelation is chiefly manifeſt. All the Parts of Revelation depend on this, and are connected with it; ſo that, take away this Truth (concerning Chriſt delivered for our Offences, and raiſed again for our Juſtification) take this out of the Goſpel, it will be <hi>another</hi> Goſpel, and the whole Doctrine of both Teſtaments will be utterly made of none Effect. This therefore is the great Touchſtone for the Trial of true and falſe Doctrine.—The Name whereby Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among the Subjects of his Kingdom is that, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> That's the Motto of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, whereby it's diſtinguiſh'd from all other Societies.</q>—This is peculiarly the <hi>characteriſtic Truth</hi> of the Goſpel, whereby Chriſtianity is conſpicuouſly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenc'd from the Religion of Nature, &amp; from all falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions.—This <hi>Truth</hi> exhibits the Subſtance of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Types in the Religion of the Jews, and is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Promiſes made to the Fathers.—This <hi>Truth</hi> (whatever any Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt may pretend)
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004510_0039_100D5E7FF0CB1E90"/>
does not make void the Law, but eſtabliſh it: declaring all Righteouſneſs fulfilled by our Surety, and being a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Principle of Obedience in the Believer.—This <hi>Truth</hi> ſignally contributes to illuſtrate the Wiſdom and Grace of God in Redemption, and to diſplay the Grace &amp; Glory of Chriſt the Redeemer.—This <hi>Truth</hi> is the prime En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Saint's Hope, and affords the firſt and great Relief to Sinners under the Spirit of Bondage. 'Tis the <hi>Truth,</hi> in this main Point eſpecially, that makes them free.—In a Word, <q>This <hi>Truth</hi> is the great <hi>Mean,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God puts forth his Power to ſave Sinners, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them to Him in his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> It was by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in the Goſpel, that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God our Saviour was at firſt ſet up and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the World: and it was by the <hi>Revival</hi> of this great Truth, after it had been buried under <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt'</hi>s Reign, that the Lord began to <hi>conſume that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one.</hi>—The Strength of <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s Kingdom, and its Safety, lies in this great Truth: So that they who wou'd advance <hi>his</hi> Kingdom, muſt bear this <hi>Truth</hi> about with them, in their Hearts, in all their Preaching, and in all their Converſation. And truly this wou'd be a Spring of daily <hi>Refreſhment</hi> to themſelves, and of great <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Boldneſs</hi> in all the Labours of the Goſpel-Miniſtry, and in all the Sufferings that attend it.<note n="*" place="bottom">

And if we have the Spirit of this Apoſtle, we alſo ſhall <hi>preach and teach with all</hi> holy <hi>Confidence.</hi>—I put in this qualifying Word, becauſe there is a Confidence that's <hi>faulty;</hi> the Reſult of Ignorance and Raſhneſs, and a Sign of Pride and Preſumption; highly unbecoming in a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> above all Men.

            </p>

USE 1. Let what has been ſaid, be apply'd by us, to <hi>raiſe</hi> our Thôts of <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>the Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt,</hi> and to direct us in forming <hi>worthy</hi> Ideas of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> expected, the Kingdom of the Meſſiah wou'd be a <hi>Temporal</hi> one: and the <hi>Diſciples</hi> themſelves were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly bro't to ſhake off their old Jewiſh Prejudice; nay, Chriſtians to this Day are apt to entertain too carnal and groſs Conceptions of it. But let us remember, Our Lord aſſures us, that <hi>his Kingdom is not of this World:</hi> and that <hi>it cometh not with Obſervation; for behold,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Kingdom of God is within you.</hi> It is not a Terrene King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; it ſhines not in worldly Pomp, but in a Celeſtial Beauty. It's Riſe and Progreſs is not after the manner of earthly Kingdoms, with mighty Noiſe, Oſtentation, and outward Shew: but it has its ſecret Subſiſtence in the Soul, makes a ſilent Entrance, and its Glory is inviſible to the bodily Eye.—Indeed, in a Senſe it may be ſaid to <hi>come with Obſervation,</hi> eſpecially in ſome Caſes, when uſher'd in by a remarkable Train of preparatory Convictions, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an illuſtrious Progreſs, and diſplaying it ſelf in very triumphant ſpiritual Victories and Succeſſes, drawing At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and exciting Admiration.—In a Senſe it may be ſaid to have an <hi>external Shew,</hi> as outward Means, the Word and Ordinances, under the Conduct of the Spirit, are employ'd in the Adminiſtration of it; and as the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> when it comes with <hi>Power,</hi> always produces obſervable Effects in the outward Life.—But ſtill it muſt ever be kept in Mind, that its Seat is in the <hi>hidden</hi> Man, its principal Operations are <hi>unſeen,</hi> and its Glory lies all in <hi>Spirituals.</hi>—How great is the Myſtery of this Kingdom! How tranſcendent its Dignity and Benefit! Let us main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain high and honourable Conceptions of it. And as thoſe that have a rais'd Opinion of its Worth and Advantages, let us wiſh its Proſperity, its extenſive Spread thro' all the Earth, and its more flouriſhing State where it is. That muſt be our daily fervent Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let it be remember'd, that <hi>the Things concerning Chriſt</hi> are related to this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and contribute to advance it. The Foundation, the Security, the Genius of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is <hi>Truth,</hi> the Truth as in <hi>Jeſus.</hi>—The Doctrine

of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Doctrine <hi>according to Godlineſs.</hi> Let us value it for its practical Tendency, as well as Divine Sublimity. Let us <hi>ſearch for Knowledge</hi> in this, <hi>as for hid Treaſures.</hi> Let our own and others Ignorance and Slight of theſe Things be the Matter of our mournful Regret: and let it be for a Lamentation, that there is in general no greater Appearance of the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and of a Regard to the <hi>Things of Chriſt,</hi> prevailing among us. But what <hi>Tokens for Good</hi> may be ſeen at this Day, in ſome hopeful Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings among our ſelves, and the Tidings of Joy we have from other Parts, both in <hi>Europe</hi> &amp; <hi>America,</hi> theſe chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our thankful Notice.</p>
            <p>USE 2. Let what has been ſaid, be apply'd by way of Incentive and Direction in the great Duty of <hi>Self-Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What will it profit, my Brethren, to have <hi>the Kingdom of God, and the Things that concern Chriſt,</hi> preach'd to us, unleſs, we have experienc'd indeed the inward and vital Diſpenſation hereof by the Spirit of Grace! Let us be willing then to <hi>come to the Light,</hi> and bring our ſelves to the Teſt.</p>
            <p>Have we ever had a thorow Conviction of our <hi>miſerable</hi> State by <hi>Nature?</hi> Been made to ſee and bewail our Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and to <hi>know the Plague of our own Heart?</hi> To ſee our ſelves under the <hi>Power of Satan</hi> and the Rule of Sin, <hi>hateful</hi> to God, and under the <hi>Curſe</hi> of his Law? To ſee the abſolute Neceſſity of a <hi>Change</hi> of our State? To ſee our utter <hi>Impotence</hi> to deliver our own Souls, and our utter <hi>Unworthineſs</hi> of Divine Relief?—And has this View of our wretched Caſe had its genuine Influence, to <hi>humble</hi> our Pride, and bring us to <hi>abhor</hi> ourſelves?—Have we <hi>beheld the Majeſty of God,</hi> and been <hi>perſuaded by the Terrors of the Lord,</hi> to throw our ſelves at the Foot of ſovereign Mercy?—Have we <hi>as in a Glaſs beheld the Glory of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>heard his Voice and ſeen his Shape at any Time?</hi> Have we heard Him ſpeaking to our <hi>inner Man,</hi> ſearching the Secrets of it, and inſtructing our very Reins? While the external Word has been ſounding in our Ears, has there been an <hi>inward</hi> Word ſpoken to our <hi>Hearts,</hi> making them even <hi>burn</hi> within us?—Has the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whoſe Office it is to glorify the Son, <hi>taken of the Things of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>ſhewn

them to us?</hi>—Are we <hi>of the Truth,</hi> on the Side &amp; under the Power of Truth, <hi>the Truth which came by Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>—Have we felt <hi>the Love of Chriſt conſtraining us,</hi> to ſubmit ourſelves to his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and his <hi>Yoke;</hi> to receive Him in all his Offices, and for all his Benefits; to prize Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Him; to love his Image, wherever we ſee it; to follow his Example, obey his Will, and ſeek his Glory; and long to <hi>dwell in our Maſter's Joy,</hi> free from all <hi>Sin,</hi> as well as Sorrow, and perfect in <hi>Holineſs</hi> for ever?</p>
            <p>Let Conſcience give a faithful Anſwer to theſe Queſtions. Let us expoſtulate with our ſelves in ſolemn manner; at the ſame time depending on, and imploring the Aids of the bleſſed <hi>Comforter:</hi> and let us employ our utmoſt Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we ben't deluded, by groundleſs Preſumptions, into a falſe Peace in this World, and eternal Perdition in the next. O what an awful Thing will it be for us, when we've been flattering ourſelves with Dreams of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> to find our ſelves at laſt in the <hi>Kingdom of Darkneſs!</hi> to ſink from the Views and Hopes of <hi>Heaven,</hi> into the Horror and Deſpair of Hell! Amazing will be the Diſappointment: and ten fold, yea ten thouſand fold the Torment!—If a Man thinketh himſelf <hi>Something,</hi> while he is <hi>Nothing,</hi> he <hi>deceiveth himſelf.</hi> The groſſeſt Folly!—O let us take Care that we ben't found amongſt thoſe <hi>Fools in Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE 3. Let <hi>Miniſters</hi> be reminded of the <hi>Leſſons of Duty</hi> taught them by the Example in our Text.</p>
            <p>We alſo are ſent to <hi>preach the Kingdom of God</hi> and the <hi>Things concerning Chriſt.</hi>—Theſe were the exalted Themes of the inſpir'd <hi>Apoſtle'</hi>s Miniſtry.—Theſe are Things which <hi>the Angels deſire to look into.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> when in the Spirit mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon them, tho't his Heart was <hi>inditing good Matter,</hi> &amp; when he ſpake of the Things which he had made <hi>touching the King,</hi> his Tongue was <hi>as the Pen of a ready Writer.</hi> Surely theſe are Things every way worthy to be ſtudy'd and preach'd.—Such Preaching is eminently ſuited to the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, its Spirit and Deſign, and to the End of our Miniſtry, the Glory of Chriſt, in the Converſion and Edification of Souls; peculiarly adapted to the Wants of Sinners, and to the Guſt of Saints.—Let us therefore, my Fathers and Brethren, be careful to lay out our Labours
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004510_0045_100D5E8DA496BAD0"/>
in the Word and Doctrine, on theſe great and important Subjects. Let none have Occaſion to complain, that <hi>of the Matter of the Kingdom we told 'em not,</hi> or that we <hi>ceaſed to preach and teach Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>—Sad it is, if any of us have been wanting here, or if we need to have <hi>the Way of the Lord expounded</hi> even to our ſelves <hi>more perfectly.</hi> O let us <hi>meditate on theſe Things,</hi> and <hi>give our ſelves wholly to them, that our profiting may appear unto all.</hi>—Let them fill our Sermons; and not merely be drag'd in, to make a ſort of eccentric and glimmering Appearance now and then. We ſhou'd take the Goſpel for our <hi>Vade Mecum. Let the Dead bury their Dead: but go thou, and preach the Kingdom of God. Go forth in the Strength of the Lord, and make Mention of his Righteouſneſs, even of his only.</hi>—Theſe Things let us preach and teach <hi>with all Confidence;</hi> with all humble Confidence internal towards <hi>God,</hi> and external towards <hi>Men.</hi> We have the Example of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> to countenance and quicken us.</p>
            <p>And I can't forbear obſerving here, We have in a freſh Inſtance ſeen this <hi>Pauline</hi> Spirit and Doctrine remarkably exemplify'd among us. We have ſeen <hi>a Preacher of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, fervent in Spirit, teaching diligently the Things of the Lord, ceaſing not</hi> even <hi>daily to preach the Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>the Things concerning Chriſt;</hi> and this <hi>with all Confidence.</hi> May I not ſay, that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> he preach'd <hi>came not unto us in Word only, but in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much Aſſurance? For your ſelves, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, know his Entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain!</hi>—And as for <hi>us,</hi> we have been ſurpriz'd—We have been pleas'd—And ſhall we not now ſtrive to imitate!—<hi>As every Man hath received the Gift, ſo let him miniſter the ſame.</hi> And as we've been <hi>put in Remembrance,</hi> let us <hi>ſtir up the Gift of God in us.</hi>—Brethren, pray for us.</p>
            <p>USE 4. Let what has been ſaid, recommend to all of you, the <hi>diligent Study</hi> and <hi>delightful Contemplation</hi> of theſe Things.—Surely, the Matter of our Preaching is worthy to be the Matter of your Meditation. I might enforce this Duty by a Variety of Conſiderations.—And I had tho't here to direct the Exhortation to our <hi>Candidates</hi> for the Pulpit. As you wou'd be <hi>Fellow-Helpers</hi> with us, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve

            <p>I hope, none of you will act as if I had been merely amuſing you with a tedious Diſcourſe on inſignificant Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences, and treat it accordingly with Coldneſs &amp; Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Surely, the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>the Things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt,</hi> are not Matters of empty Speculation, to be

made a Jeſt of, nor Matters of Indifference, to be trifled with. No, aſſure your ſelves, they are Things of the higheſt practical Concern, and of infinite Moment, in which your Souls and your everlaſting Intereſts are deeply involv'd. Let none of you then be careleſs forgetful Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Apply what has been ſaid, to excite in you a juſt Solicitude, that you may be found obeying that Call of our Saviour, Matth. 6. 33. <hi>Seek firſt the</hi> KINGDOM <hi>of God and his</hi> RIGHTEOUSNESS.—Underſtand the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as equivalent to thoſe in our <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's the <hi>Kingdom of God, which is within Men,</hi> and the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God, which is by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is the proper Object of the Sinners <hi>firſt</hi> Purſuit. Theſe are Bleſſings of the firſt Importance; they demand your firſt Thought and Care, and muſt be obtain'd, as ever you hope for future eternal Happineſs. If you are not <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and have not him <hi>of God made unto you Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. The <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> muſt be ſet up in your Souls, by the Operation of <hi>regenerating</hi> Grace; or you have no poſſible <hi>Meetneſs</hi> for the heavenly Inheritance. And the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God</hi> our Saviour, that <hi>everlaſting Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> which he bro't in by his <hi>Obedience unto the Death,</hi> muſt be <hi>upon</hi> you, unto the <hi>Juſtification of Life,</hi> through Faith in Chriſt; or you have no poſſible <hi>Title</hi> to Heaven and Bleſſedneſs, but muſt <hi>die in your Sins,</hi> and be herded among unpardon'd Devils for ever.—Think not to ſpin a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for your ſelves, by any Works that you can do: It will prove but a Spider's Webb, and not <hi>hide the Shame of your Nakedneſs.</hi> If you are <hi>Enemies of the Croſs of</hi> CHRIST, your <hi>End</hi> will be <hi>Deſtruction.</hi> Take Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that of Chriſt to the ſelf-righteous <hi>Phariſees,</hi>—Verily I ſay unto you, <hi>Publicans and Harlots enter into the Kingdom of God before you.</hi> And, again, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God, as a little Child, ſhall in no wiſe enter therein.</hi> You muſt be humbled, and bro't to lie abas'd at the foot of ſovereign Grace, to <hi>ſubmit to the Righteouſneſs of God;</hi> or you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>receive the Kingdom of God:</hi> and if you don't receive the Kingdom of God in this World, the Kingdom of Hell muſt inevitably be your Portion in the next.—But if you
