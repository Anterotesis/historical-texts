            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Quest. <hi>WHat is your Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> JACOBITE.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Who gave you that Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. The WILLIAMITES of this Nation in the Day when I declared my self a favourer of Popery, and promoter of Arbitrary Government.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Did they promise any thing farther for you to make you keep up your Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Pray tell me what it was?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They did promise three Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as my Forefathers had done, so I should Follow their Steps: in sideing with <hi>French</hi> Dragoons, and <hi>Iresh</hi> Cut-throats, against my native Country.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That I should renounce the <hi>English</hi> Laws and Liberties of the Subject?</p>
            <p n="3">3. That I should come very short of that love I ought to bear to the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and my <hi>Protestant Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Dost thou think thou art any wayes obliged to act, what they promised in thy Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes verily, and by <hi>Romes</hi> help so I will, and I heartily thank <hi>our Earthly Father Lewis le Grand,</hi> that
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000587_0004_0FA95B5E752C59B8"/>
he has taken us into his protection, and I question not but he will be as kind to us as he has been to the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> of his own Country.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But your Principles of Government both in Church &amp; State, are not the same which he has taught them there?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed we are not yet so absolutely <hi>refined</hi> in neither as 'tis there, but we have endeavoured to instil them into the People of our <hi>Nation</hi> for above these 30 <hi>Years?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What Principles have you taught them concerning the State?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We have taught them, that as there is but one <hi>God in Heaven,</hi> so there ought to be but one Government on Earth, and thats <hi>Monarchical both in Church and State,</hi> for as 'tis said, <hi>by me Kings Reign,</hi> so in the Church Bishops ought to govern, and those two are so twisted one in the other, that as 'tis our Maxime, <hi>No Bishop, no King,</hi> so they who are Enemies to <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> are Enemies to all Government both in Church and State; for as there can be no State with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Kings,</hi> so there can be <hi>no Church without Bishops,</hi> and therefore I blame the <hi>New Williamite Church of England,</hi> for composing a Form of Prayer for all the Reformed Churches, seeing we ne're own'd them for true Churches, tho we own the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for a true Church.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What do these Principles lead you to follow?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They lead us to follow and acknowledge Three Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our gracious Monarch K. <hi>James</hi> is our only King <hi>de Jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That his suppos'd Son the <hi>Welsh Prince</hi> will in due time redeem us and all of our Loyal Principles from
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000587_0005_0FA95B5F4F77EA48"/>
our present Bondage to a Prince of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That none are truly Loyal who are not of our <hi>Clubbs</hi> and <hi>Societies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Is there no Laws or Rule that you are to obey for your better direction, in practizing what you shall learn?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, there are two particular Orders which we should obey.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Which be they?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Render to <hi>Caesar</hi> the things which are <hi>Caesars.</hi> And 2. unto God the things that are Gods.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What do they chiefly teach you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Two Things.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Which be they?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We are taught what we are to render to our King. And 2. What we owe towards God.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What is it you render to your King?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We are to own him for a <hi>Caesar,</hi> and that he may govern <hi>despotically,</hi> and is not tyed up to the Laws of the Land to which he has <hi>sworn,</hi> but that he may <hi>impose Taxes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>without consent of Parliaments,</hi> and the People are bound in Conscience on pain of <hi>Eternal Damnation</hi> to obey; for we are not to enquire our <hi>Duty to our King</hi> out of the known Laws of the Land, but from the Holy Scriptures, as they are expounded by those Ancient Fathers of the Church, <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Marwaring,</hi> &amp;c. that gape after Court Perferment, who would fain Enslave the Subject to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What have you baen taught that you owe to God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To render to God the things that are Gods, as are the <hi>Ceremonies of our Church,</hi> which are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000587_0006_0FA95B60C2918820"/>
as holy as the <hi>Censors</hi> of Old, and we are not to part with the least of them to gratifie our weak Brethren, who are so Sacrilegious as to endeavour to robb the Church of the <hi>White Robe, the Wife of the Wedding Ring, the Infant of the Invisible Badge of Christanity,</hi> which he wears in his Fore-head, and the devout Christian of his genuflexion at the high Altar.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I will endeavour it three ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I will (as we have from the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) labour to foment the Differences amongst all Protestants whatsoever, that I may once more <hi>blow those Coals to a flame,</hi> as may consume them and their Church to Ashes, so as we may once again come to practice those things which I have now learned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I will endeavour to keep the wounds of the Church open and bleeding, and excite the most <hi>Furious of both Parties,</hi> and villifie moderate Men, and Men of <hi>healing Spirits,</hi> to make them be look'd on as <hi>Lukewarm Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans,</hi> and only fit to be spewed out of the mouths of both Parties, whilst we cry aha! so we would have it.</p>

I will as often as I can possible, keep up a correspondence with <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>French Court,</hi> as we have hither to done, by inviting the <hi>French last year,</hi> and by our continual advertising them of the <hi>State of the Kingdom,</hi> and what <hi>Ships</hi> are going out and coming in, that the Immortal <hi>Lewis</hi> may be in the better capacity to help us for at present; our <hi>Cause</hi> is so sunk, and low that within these six months, I have seen the melting

down of five of our <hi>Golden Candlestecks,</hi> for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Is there no other Rule that you are to practice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, but it has been exploded these thirty years.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What is it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self, or do as thou wouldst be done unto.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Have you any distinguishing Mark whereby you may know who are of the same Profession with you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes Two, as absolutely necessary to distinguish the Members of our Society.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What are they?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I. Health to our old Master King <hi>James:</hi> And 2dly. Another to our young Master the <hi>Welch</hi> Prince, who has all our good <hi>wishes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Why do you so often drink Healths to K.</hi> James?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Because as <hi>Mabomet</hi> said, there is a Devil in every Berry of the Grape, and when the Devil is got in, we are beholding to them that be a good Fine, will conjure him out again.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What mean you by the word</hi> Health?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I mean an outward Appearance of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and hearty Affection to King <hi>James,</hi> the <hi>Welch Prince,</hi> and the Popish Interest.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What is required of them who enter into these Societies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To examine themselves what Devil prompted them to invite in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> contrary to their Doctrine of <hi>Non-Resistance</hi> and <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> and whether they do heartily and unseignedly repent of that thing, and stedfastly purpose to continue their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000587_0008_0FA95B62119D56A0"/>
Loyalty to King <hi>James</hi> for the time to come, and if God should restore their old Master again, whether they would not soon grow weary of him, and <hi>Father Peters,</hi> and whether they are in Chariry with all men, especially with the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> who came in at their Invitation, but would not be prevailed on to go out again at their intreaty, being loth to leave them in a worse condition than he found them.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But are you not guilty of great Ingratitude to the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>that ventured all he had to save you from Ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He did'nt save us only, but Protestant Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters as well as we, and is kinder to them than we do desire.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But must your Eye be Evil, because his is good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The truth is, we would have all the water run into our MILL.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What reason can you</hi> Jacobites <hi>give that you had rather be Papists than Presbyterians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Because we can have more Elbow room a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Papists than amongst those straight lac'd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinarians.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What think you of some of the Fathers of the Church of the</hi> Highest Rank, <hi>that are for</hi> Peace and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement <hi>with others, since 'tis only in small matters that we differ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We snarle and Burlesque and affront them, because we think them Luke-warm in our Religion. For should we give the Dissenters an Inch they would take an Ell, nothing will satisfie them but the <hi>ruine of the Church</hi> as it is Established by Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:000587_0009_0FA95B62C6629520"/>
Quest. <hi>Suppose they were tryed and somewhat else would please them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I am never for yielding to that, for our Church is <hi>Sufficiently Reform'd</hi> already to our minds tho' not to theirs.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>How long may we teach</hi> Passive Obedience <hi>be fore the Great Men of the Kingdom will believe what we say?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Till Doomsday.</hi> For they will give the Parson the hearing, who to get Preferment will Preach up that Doctrine, but are very unwilling to be brought to practise it.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What made you no more concern'd for the loss of those brave Patriots of your Country,</hi> Essex, Russel, <hi>&amp;c. who lost their Lives in defence of their Country and its Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By reason we thought them not enough bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted to our ways, tho' they were for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet they were too moderate for to keep our Friendship long.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What must the poor</hi> Protestants in Ireland <hi>think of you, who were so near Ruine by the means of your slow Proceedings here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They know e're this what one of our Party said of them. Hang them they are a <hi>Pack of Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and especially Northward <hi>Scotch Presbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What Opinion will the</hi> States of Holland <hi>and the</hi> Protestant Princes of Germany <hi>have of you for your Carriage to a Prince that they assisted with Men and Mony to come to your relief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They may think if they had not been in danger themselves, by the growing greatness of the <hi>French King,</hi> it had been no matter if we had perished.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000587_0010_0FA95B650174F0A8"/>
Quest. <hi>What shall the Emperor of</hi> Germany <hi>think of you, hat you who pretend to be Protestants, should have any kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for</hi> King Lewis <hi>that would root out the</hi> Northern Heresie <hi>both at home and abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He may easily see that we are only Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants by the Custom of our Country where we live, &amp; that our Religion (for all our pretences) is to chuse, and say as one of his Predecessors once did, <hi>that the King of England is King of Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Why since you have so great a kindness for King</hi> Lewis, <hi>will be not attow the</hi> English Fugitives <hi>a Chappel in your old Masters Pallace for the Exercise of that</hi> little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>they carried over with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He is loath that any Heresie should be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Catholick ground, and as for the <hi>Doctrine of Non Resistance and Passive Obedience,</hi> his People have been taught that sufficiently by the <hi>Common Hangman,</hi> so that there is no need of our preaching it up there.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But are you not ashamed that you should be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Tools so long as you were in the former Reigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We did not think <hi>K. J.</hi> would have laid us aside so soon as he did, but he repented of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and if he had continued, we should have been his white Boys once more.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But will not the English and French Papists laugh at you, to see you so willing to be fool'd by them a second time, that have been cheated by them once already.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We have dine to think of that we are <hi>so mad,</hi> that we are got under the Yoke of Princes, that are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Looseness and Debauchery (and as we <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites</hi> think) smell too much of <hi>Puritanism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Seeing you are so much for the Papist and the</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Then we will march for the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> for our Master is to succeed <hi>Godfrey</hi> King of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as soon as the French Monarch has conquered <hi>Asia,</hi> and to be Crowned with Thorns in that Holy City as God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey was formerly.</p>

            <p>Quest. <hi>Who gave you this Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> A person of <hi>Quality,</hi> who wrote our Character last year.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Why did he give you this Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> For our sincere Affection to our <hi>Royal Majesty King William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Why do you bear such Affection to King William?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> For several Reason, as 1. For his great Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000587_0012_0FA95B68ED63C040"/>
of <hi>Temperance, Chastity, Magnanimity, Veracity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For his great Affection to the <hi>English Nation,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in putting in for our <hi>Timely Relief in</hi> 88. Pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us out of the Jaws, of that Hellish Monster of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had got us between his teeth, to devour us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For exposing his <hi>Royal Person,</hi> to great danger, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to recover the poor Protestans in that Kingdom, out of that <hi>Lost Condition,</hi> they were in, being outed of all their strong Towns, and Fortresses, but one, by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Treachery,</hi> and at the mercy of those Bloody Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, who had murdered 200000 Men Women and Children, of that Profession, in <hi>Cold Blood,</hi> in 1641.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For appearing in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to head the <hi>Confederates Forces</hi> raised to Chastise the insolency of the <hi>French King,</hi> who hath for a long time made his <hi>Sword, drunk with the Blood</hi> of Papists and Protestants, whose innocent blood Cries to Heaven for Vengeance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For that his <hi>Majesty, and his Ancestors,</hi> have ever since the reformation appeared more in the behalf of <hi>Oppressed Protestants,</hi> than any prince in Europe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>How can you own King</hi> Willam <hi>for your King, Seeing King</hi> James <hi>is yet living?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Lords <hi>Spiritual, and Temporal,</hi> together with the <hi>House of Commons</hi> voted, that <hi>King James</hi> had Abdicated the <hi>Government,</hi> and left the Throne vacant, which they thought fit, and necessary to fill up, with the next in <hi>Blood K.

            <p>Quest. <hi>How doth this make</hi> King William <hi>King</hi> de jure, <hi>tho he be King</hi> de facto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We look upon him, that is King <hi>de facto</hi> to be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000587_0013_0FA95B699B667B08"/>
King <hi>de jure;</hi> for we are told by a good Historian (in his answer to <hi>Varillas</hi>) of a Law made by <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th That whoever is in possession of the crown, is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as the <hi>Legal King,</hi> and the Author of that late Farce called the <hi>Royal Flight,</hi> or the <hi>Conquest of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> tell us, that to distinguish between a King <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>de facto;</hi> is a Jesuitical Nicety, and works like <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Cows Tail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But if King</hi> James <hi>both abdicated the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how can this Prejudice his Son the</hi> Prince of Wales? <hi>doth not his Right continue good still?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We have no <hi>Good Assurance</hi> that there was ever any such <hi>Prince,</hi> born of the late <hi>Queens</hi> Body, the whole <hi>Management</hi> of that affair, looks like a <hi>Popish Juggle and Cheat,</hi> put upon the Nation. <hi>Father Peters,</hi> giving out that 'twould be a Son long before the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Birth,</hi> a plain Evidence that it was a <hi>Jesuitical Contrivance</hi> to carry on Popish Designs, because <hi>Rome they saw would not be built in a</hi> D<hi>ay,</hi> they thought to take two days about it.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But why did you pray for him as</hi> Prince of Wales, <hi>in your Parish Churches, for some Considerable time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We knew not but that he was born of the late <hi>Queens Body,</hi> till we were informed by the <hi>Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants Remonstrance,</hi> that no <hi>Protestant Lady was at his Birth,</hi> and the whole business was managed by some <hi>French Madams,</hi> whom we can no more believe then we can their Master <hi>Lewis Le Grand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But may not this entail a War upon the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We have had war with <hi>France</hi> before now,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000587_0014_0FA95B6A5B9752F0"/>
and may have again more than once, tho' this had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been; and if we must all turn <hi>Quakers</hi> for fear of a War with <hi>France,</hi> 'tis as much as Mou<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Quest. <hi>But may he not have too much Advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, by reason of a Party that may be made amongst us, for this</hi> pretended Young Prince;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Papists and <hi>Popishly affected</hi> may be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, but a little wholsome severity will make them pluck in their Horns and be glad to be quiet.</p>
            <p>Quest. But what if any trho' <hi>Tenderness of Conscience conceive themselves obliged to this</hi> Young Prince, <hi>and that he ought to have all their good</hi> Wishes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Wishes and Woulders are no <hi>good Householders;</hi> let them hold there and not disturb the Peace of the Nation, and no body will molest them for the <hi>Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Consciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But will not this reflect upon the</hi> Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>that Princes of a different perswasion should be barred from their Right meerly because of their difference from us in Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I. A <hi>Popish Prince</hi> is not qualifyed by the <hi>Laws of this Land</hi> to Govern, nor so much as to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, if the <hi>Law</hi> be followed against him. Now the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> doth not oblige us to <hi>abandon our Laws and Priviledges,</hi> (which we enjoy as <hi>English Men</hi>) and hold up our <hi>Throats to a Popish Executioner,</hi> as long as we are sufficiently secured by the Laws of this Land from <hi>Popery and Tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>Popish Prince,</hi> can give us no <hi>Security</hi> to Govern us according to the known Laws of the Land; for the <hi>Popish Clergy</hi> will absolve him from his Oath, and make

him their tool wherewith to ruine both us and our Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This cannot in the least reflect upon our <hi>Religion</hi> For here a great <hi>Prince</hi> apprehending a <hi>surreptitious prince,</hi> set up by Papists to debarr <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Princess</hi> of their Rights, comes in with his <hi>Sword in his Hand</hi> in his own Vindication, and the <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi> came in before him, which struck such a terror into his enemies, that they <hi>fled, and carryed Young Perkin into another Land, a sufficient argument of their guilt;</hi> for it could be no Crime in the <hi>Midwife</hi> to deliver the Queen of a Son; neither had the pretended <hi>Young Prince,</hi> been in any danger among Protestants, who hate the <hi>Popish</hi> ways of sending <hi>Young Princes</hi> out of the world by <hi>Italian arts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We have no reason to Repent, that we suffered this <hi>brave Prince</hi> to enter quietly, according to our Doctrine of <hi>Non Resistance;</hi> for we have <hi>chan'gd Masters</hi> to our better Advantage, having now a King that <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns by Law, that invades no Mans Property, that no Jesuites in his Council to beard the Reverend Bishops of the Kingdom,</hi> that have right to sit there that doth not waste the <hi>Treasure of the Kingdom</hi> upon his <hi>L</hi>usts, but adds all his own to it to promote the publick welfare that seeks the <hi>good of the whole Nation,</hi> and to this end, hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to <hi>unite Protestants,</hi> which would be a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment to <hi>Popish Designs,</hi> who catch <hi>most Fish by troubling our Waters;</hi> a Prince that doth not side with <hi>one Party</hi> against another <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
