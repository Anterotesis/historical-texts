            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE Letters, of which the following ſheets contain a tranſlation, were addreſſed to an Inhabitant of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> much about the time when the United States were threatened with a Revolution, upon the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, with that which they deſcribe, but which the ſpirit of the Government, and the enlightened zeal of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple repreſſed, before the unhappy experience of <hi>Geneva</hi> had ſhewn the real nature and ultimate conſequences of it. They are the more worthy of attention, as the Author actually negociated, and ſigned the Treaty men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the firſt letter, with General <hi>Monteſquiou;</hi> and was an eye-witneſs to the firſt part of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the violation of that Treaty by the French introduced. To the preſent Edition, he has added ſome important facts, which either had not taken place, or were not known in <hi>England,</hi> when the former Editions were publiſhed, as well as ſome explanatory notes, which, he hopes, will not be thought unneceſſary to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> reader.</p>
            <p>When the Tranſlator firſt read theſe Letters, he thought it would not be mis-ſpending his time, to employ a few hours, in giving thoſe who do not underſtand the French language, an opportunity of receiving from them, ſome ſhare of the pleaſure and inſtruction they had afforded
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:033927_0003_0FF9FA780EFF2838"/>himſelf; and he was the more encouraged to undertake the taſk, as he obſerved an unuſual concurrence of opinion in thoſe who had read them, that a tranſlation might, at the preſent period, be as uſeful, as the originals themſelves are intereſting.</p>
            <p>In truth, the new political doctrines which have, for ſome time paſt, been propagated in <hi>Europe,</hi> are ſo well contrived to impoſe upon the imaginations, and to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead even the virtues of thoſe who liſten to them, that it is not to be wondered at, if ſome, in this country, have received them with approbation, and at firſt perhaps have felt a wiſh to ſee them reduced to practice. To ſuch, it is hoped that theſe Letters will be inſtructive, as they exhibit the reſult of the experiment in a country, in which it is impoſſible to ſay, that it was not fairly tried. They ſhew, as clearly as Hiſtory can illuſtrate any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition whatever, that the only object of thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate ſuch doctrines, is, and ever will be, the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own ſelfiſh purpoſes; that <hi>Liberty, Equality,</hi> and the <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> are terms adopted by them, merely to gain credit with the People; and that every Revolution effected upon their principles, muſt end as that of Geneva has ended, by putting all the power and all the wealth of the State into the hands of a few, who riot on the ſpoils of their Country, while the <hi>Sovereign People</hi> is left to amuſe the cravings of hunger, and the agonies of remorſe, with the rattles of <hi>Univerſal Suffrage,</hi> and <hi>perfect political Equality.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:033927_0003_0FF9FA780EFF2838"/>
It is true, that the ſcale on which the experiment was tried, is? ſmall one; but it is, perhaps, on that account better calculated to ſhew the action of the ſeveral parts, and their connexion with each other.</p>
            <p>It is certainly ſome excuſe for the friends of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and the people of property in <hi>Geneva,</hi> that they were borne down by the irreſiſtible weight of a Power which had previouſly determined, that no effort of theirs to preſerve their Conſtitution, ſhould be effectual. But no ſuch apology can ever be offered for the people of this Country: if the Conſtitution, and with the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the Liberty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ever fall a ſacrifice to the doctrines of <hi>Jacobiniſm,</hi> it muſt be her own fault. She has within herſelf a principle of ſecurity, which, if vigorouſly exerted, will enable her to ride through the ſtorm, that threatens to wreck her neighbours. That prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is the active union, and ſteady co-operation of all ranks of People in the Kingdom, to watch with vigilance and repreſs with ſeverity, the ſlighteſt attempt to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, under whatever pretext, or for whatever purpoſe, any part of that baleful ſyſtem into it.</p>
            <p>In ſo ſhort a ſpace of time as eighteen months did the Revolutionary Peſtilence reduce the once-happy and flouriſhing <hi>Geneva,</hi> to a ſtate of anarchy, miſery, and depopulation, of which modern Hiſtory affords no other example. And let not the people of this country forget that the firſt ſymptom of the contagion was the adoption
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:033927_0004_0FF9CC491D0CFF18"/>and uſe of the term <hi>Citizen:</hi> from the familiar eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that term, it proceeded to the right of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Suffrage,</hi> which was ſoon followed by the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>National Convention,</hi> as the <hi>Convention</hi> was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a <hi>Central Club,</hi> and this <hi>Central Club</hi> by the erection of a <hi>Revolutionary Tribunal,</hi> which, after ſuſpending the actual Government of the Country, and plundering, baniſhing, or putting to death, almoſt every man of property or principle within its reach, has at length eſtabliſhed a ſyſtem of deſpotiſm, whoſe wanton tyranny, and unprovoked cruelties, as completely refute the aſſertion, that the barbarities perpetrated in <hi>France</hi> are to be imputed ſolely to the combination formed againſt her, as the ſhare taken by that Power in the petty Revolution of <hi>Geneva,</hi> expoſes the impudent hypocriſy of the pretence, that ſhe never interferes in the domeſtic concerns of other Nations.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AN account of the melancholy events which have lately taken place in Geneva, naturally addreſſes itſelf to you. You have ever taken the livelieſt intereſt in the affairs of that Republic, and are perfectly acquainted with the hiſtory of thoſe long and painful exertions by which ſhe originally acquired, and had, till now, preſerved her Liberty. To you therefore a narrative of the manner in which ſhe has, perhaps for ever, loſt it, cannot be unintereſting; and may the fate of the moſt democratical, and, at the ſame time, one of the moſt happy States in the Old World, teach the inhabitants of the New, how feeble a barrier ſeparates liberty from licentiouſneſs, and how inevitably the abuſe of a bleſſing leads to the loſs of it!</p>
            <p>I need not inform you, Sir, that, after a long ſtruggle, the Conſtitutional Party at Geneva was obliged to yield, in 1782, to the irreſiſtible power of the Count <hi>de Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gennes.</hi> That Miniſter took infinitely greater pains to cruſh democracy, at Geneva, than to eſtabliſh it, at the ſame period, in America: his intrigues, however, were defeated, and he was obliged to reſort to more violent means. Some of the troops which had ſerved in America, marched into the town, and after driving away the principal defenders of our fundamental Conſtitution, erected on the ruins of it, not indeed an hereditary Ariſtocracy, but a form of Government, of which it is enough to ſay, that it required the conſtant ſupport of foreign force, to maintain it againſt the declared averſion of by far the greater part of the people of Geneva. It was impoſſible, however, that ſuch a ſyſtem could laſt longer than the Miniſter who framed it; and accordingly, upon the death of <hi>De Vergennes,</hi> the very men whoſe ambition he thought he had been gratifying in doing what he had done, concurred almoſt unanimouſly in
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:033927_0005_0FF9FA870DFE32F8"/>deſtroying it. Our ancient Republican Conſtitution was triumphantly reſtored; its advocates were recalled, and reinſtated in their offices; and the long conteſt between the people and the adminiſtrative bodies, completely ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in favour of the former.</p>
            <p>This happy event was begun in 1789, and completed in 1791, and is in many reſpects one of the moſt important in our hiſtory. It reſtored the cordial union, which had formerly pervaded every part of the State.<note n="*" place="bottom">For all common purpoſes the Executive Power was lodged in two Councils, one of which, called the <hi>Little Council,</hi> conſiſted of 28 mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who, when elected, hold their ſituations for life; the other, or <hi>Great Council,</hi> was compoſed of 250 members, who, by a law paſſed in 1791, were elected for ſeven years, and went out in rotation. The adminiſtration of juſtice was entruſted to the <hi>Little Council,</hi> under the direction of 4 Preſidents or <hi>Syndics,</hi> annually elected out of it, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to an appeal in moſt caſes to the <hi>Great Council:</hi> but the ſupreme ſovereign authority of the State reſided wholly and excluſively in the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the People, which was compoſed of ſuch as inherited or had purchaſed the title of <hi>Citizens.</hi> Such deſcendants of foreigners as were not entitled to the privileges of that character, were called <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and, by a law paſſed in 1791, might be admitted to them on pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſmall fine; but the number of citizens by birth was ſo great, and the fine by the payment of which the natives became citizens, was ſo inconſiderable, that nearly three fourths of the Geneveſe who were of age, and in ſolvent circumſtances, were members of the General Aſſembly.
<p>This ſovereign Body, thus compoſed, poſſeſſed the whole legiſlative power of the State: it elected all the magiſtrates, all the officers of State, and all the members of the two Councils; it made peace, and declared war; it ratified treaties with foreign Powers, and impoſed taxes. But at the ſame time it exerciſed theſe important prerogatives under reſtrictions which prevented the inconveniences naturally ariſing from ſo democratical a Conſtitution; for it could be convened by none but the Syndics and the two Councils; it could enter upon no buſineſs but ſuch as they laid before it; no buſineſs could be laid before it which had not previouſly been diſcuſſed and approved in each of the Councils; and finally, it had no power but of ſimply aſſenting to, or diſſenting from, what was laid before it, without modification, and without debate.</p>
                  <p>Such was the Conſtitution of Geneva, when the attack which is the ſubject of the following narrative was made upon it; and ſuch it had been ever ſince the reformation, with the exception of ſuch momentary interruptions as naturally happen, and are to be expected, in a State where almoſt every member of the community has, and any member of it may eaſily have, a ſhare in the Government. The ſalutary reſtrictions and judicious modifications which I have mentioned, had by degrees ripened the Conſtitution of Geneva into what Rouſſeau thought the <hi>Sublimeſt work of political wiſdom</hi> which the world had ever ſeen. The French affect to idolize the memory of Rouſſeau, in whoſe opinion "<hi>the moſt perfect liberty is dearly purchaſed by the effusion of a ſingle drop of blood."</hi> What would he have thought of his worſhippers, had he lived to ſee the object of his greateſt reverence, and moſt affectionate attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made the firſt ſacrifice on the bloody altars of a ſyſtem of which they call him the author?</p>
               </note> Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and manufactures flouriſhed; and our Univerſity, the copious ſpring of all our paſt and preſent enjoyments, communicated a ſpirit of exertion and enterpriſe to the arts and ſciences, which was not exceeded, in the moſt populous and extenſive kingdoms. Such was, and ſuch indeed had been the proſperity of Geneva, that, within the preſent century, our population had doubled, our wealth had increaſed in a ten-fold proportion, knowledge was very generally diffuſed, and foreigners ſaw with equal pleaſure and aſtoniſhment, that in a diſtrict, whoſe inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants did not exceed thirty thouſand, there were, at the ſame period, as many men of eminence in the arts, in
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033927_0005_0FF9FA870DFE32F8"/>polite literature, and in ſcience, as in any one of the three northern kingdoms of Europe: Such were the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of freedom and a good ſyſtem of education.</p>
            <p>But this pleaſing proſpect was of very ſhort duration; and our liberty had hardly begun to recover from the blow it had lately received, when another attack was made upon it from the ſame quarter, but under a different name; it was made under the ſacred name of <hi>Liberty</hi> itſelf, and with it has, I fear, for ever deſtroyed all the reſpectable qualities, and elevated virtues, which nouriſh and ſupport it. In ſhort, the French had no ſooner reſolved, in 1792, to attack the King of Sardinia, than we received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from Paris, on which we could depend, that General <hi>Monteſquiou;</hi> who was to command the expedition againſt him, had received ſecret orders, of a nature very hoſtile to Geneva. Theſe orders were given by the Briſſotins, who, it is well known, had projected a plan of ſurrounding France with a <hi>zone of Republics,</hi> formed on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with itſelf. Savoy was deſtined to form one of thoſe Republics, and Geneva was to be a capital of it; an honour, which it was to purchaſe, at the expence of its own newly-recovered Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:033927_0006_0FF9FA8BB0775170"/>
The Swiſs, our ancient and faithful Allies, prepared to ſhare our danger; and the moment they were applied to, ſent 1600 men to our aſſiſtance. Indeed no time was to be loſt; for General Monteſquiou advanced towards Geneva the very day after that on which he entered Savoy. His orders (which have ſince been publiſhed) were, that, <hi>as the poſſeſſion of Geneva was eſſential to the ſecurity of Savoy, be was to enter it, (by force if neceſſary) and take</hi> 20,000 <hi>muſkets which were in it, and of which the French Republic was in need.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The letter of <hi>Servan,</hi> the Miniſter at War, dated October 3. 1792, concluded with theſe words:—<hi>If you are told that theſe muſkets are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the defence of the town, you may remove their apprehenſions, by leaving them</hi> 4 <hi>or</hi> 5000 <hi>men to take care of them. You may thus convert Geneva into a barrier of the Republic.</hi>
                  <p>In a letter written but four days before, he ordered Monteſquiou to march towards Geneva, <hi>in order to give freedom of action to the friends of Liberty, who were in conſiderable numbers there, and to eſtabliſh a form of Government ſuitable to their wiſhes.</hi>

            <p>Our Allies, however, had time enough to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the town, before the French had completely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded it. On the 5th day of October 1792, the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whom we had ſent to enquire into the cauſe of this unexpected attack, were told by the French Commander, <q>That the Government of Geneva had inſulted the French Republic, by calling in the aid of the Swiſs, to repel an attack which was never intended to be made, and which nothing but that ſtep had ſuggeſted; that the Magiſtrates of Geneva were (perhaps without meaning it) the abettors of the enemies of France, and (as a proof of their ill-will towards her) had permitted ſome of the Emigrants to ſettle in Geneva, and others to paſs through it, in making their retreat into other countries.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this charge our Deputies anſwered, that diſtruſt is the only ſecurity of the weak, in their intercourſe with the ſtrong. They appealed to a letter written by one of the French Miniſters ſeveral days before the application to the Swiſs, in which, without ſeeming to think it probable, or even poſſible, that the Geneveſe would make any reſiſtance; and as if his intention had been to prepare them for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033927_0006_0FF9FA8BB0775170"/>he informed them of the reſolutions taken againſt them.—They juſtified their application to the Swiſs, by many precedents; and ſhewed, that whenever Savoy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſcene of war, Geneva had always claimed, and as regularly received, their aſſiſtance; that the right of taking that ſtep, which, after all, was only a precaution to prevent poſſible evil, was acknowledged in many ſolemn treaties, of which France herſelf was the guarantee, and had never given offence to any of her Monarchs, not even to Lewis XIV. in whoſe reign it had been reſorted to, as often as was thought neceſſary; and as a farther proof of the innocence of our intentions, they reminded the General, that we were at that moment the only ſovereign State which had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the French Republic; that, at the very beginning of the Revolution, we had opened our granaries, for the relief of one of their diſtricts, againſt the preſſure of a ſcarcity, to which we ourſelves were equally impoſed; and that, when that diſtrict was apprehenſive of a kind of counter-revolution, and had applied to us for aſſiſtance, we had furniſhed it with arms, which ſo far from being returned to us, as had been ſolemnly promiſed, were now to be employed againſt us.</p>
            <p>Theſe arguments, unanſwerable as they were, would have been of little avail, had they not been ſupported by all the influence, and all the abilities of the upright and honourable man, to whom they were addreſſed. In his report to the French Miniſtry, he ſtated the danger, as well as folly, of involving France in a diſpute with the whole Helvetic Body, which would certainly exert all its force to repel an attack, that, conſidering the comparative ſtrength of the two parties, would do ſo little honour to the magnanimity of the aſſailants. He repreſented this ſo ſtrongly, that his orders were countermanded, and he was directed to negociate an amicable arrangement, in which <hi>he was to uſe his whole addreſs againſt us, and at all events, to conclude the negociation in the ſame manner as if he had made himſelf maſter of the town by force, by leaving a French garriſon behind him.</hi> He again remonſtrated, and at length received full powers: a treaty was concluded on the 22d of October, on terms equally honourable to both parties,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033927_0007_0FF9FA9833F70638"/>by which, after ſtating, that the miſunderſtanding which had taken place between the two Republics, had been explained in the fulleſt and moſt ſatisfactory manner, it was agreed, that the French army ſhould retire to the diſtance of ten leagues, and the Republic diſmiſs the troops of its allies.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the treaty was ſigned, the French Reſident returned into the town, and in the name of the nation he repreſented, gave us the <hi>moſt ſolemn aſſurances of unalterable friendſhip.</hi> In conſequence of theſe aſſurances, we not only ratified, but had actually begun to fulfil the treaty on our part, when we were informed that the French Miniſtry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſanction it, unleſs ſome clauſes were inſerted, which Mr. <hi>Geneſt</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The fame perſon who was afterwards ſent in a public character to America, and who, if he is there ſtill, will not deny the truth of theſe aſſertions.</note> was ſent to negociate. We were, as you may imagine, ſurpriſed at ſuch conduct; but by the advice of our Allies, and on conſidering the nature of our ſituation, we accepted of the additional articles, and a new treaty was ſigned. But what was our aſtoniſhment, when we were again informed, that this ſecond treaty, which <hi>Le Brun,</hi> the Miniſter for foreign affairs, conſidered as unexceptionable, and earneſtly preſſed the Convention to ratify, was, after many affected delays, violently attacked on the 21ſt of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, by <hi>Briſſot,</hi> at the head of the Diplomatic Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and ſtigmatized as an <hi>igneminious capitulation?</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">This treaty, this <hi>ignominious capitulation</hi> (as it was called), was ſigned on the 2d of Nov. by <hi>F. A. P. Monteſquiou, J. F. Prevoſt, A. Lullin,</hi> and <hi>F. D'Ivernois,</hi> and begins with ſtating the circumſtances that had led to the miſunderſtanding between the two Republics, and the meaſures taken to remove it. It then proceeds thus: <q>The Plenipotentiary of the French Nation declares, in the name of his Conſtituents,—that the country he repreſents, is equally incapable of fearing her enemies, or of making a bad uſe of victory; and conſidering how recently ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, in the very moment of conqueſt, a conquered nation (Savoy) to itſelf, it is unreaſonable to ſuſpect her of any intention to attack the liberty of a nation, to which ſhe was bound by ties of alliance. Thoſe calculations of comparative ſtrength, which Deſpots are ſo much in the habit of making, and by the reſult of which they are induced either to attack, or to deſiſt from attacking their neighbours, will never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to by a people which has founded its own Rights upon the broad and comprehenſive baſis of the <hi>Rights of Man.</hi> The French Republic has reſiſted the interference of other nations in her domeſtic affairs, even at the expence of her own blood: ſhe feels therefore ſome degree of pride in declaring, that ſhe has not the moſt remote intention to introduce her troops either into the town, or any part of the territory of Geneva. Nor does ſhe mean to aſſume the ſmalleſt authority with her, or exert any kind of influence over her Government. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on the preſent occaſion, ſhe requires of the Magiſtrates of Geneva, to be contented with the means they have within their own walls, for defending the town, and ſecuring obedience tö the laws, it is becauſe ſhe conſiders that line of conduct as indiſpenſably neceſſary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the liberty of Geneva, as well as for the continuance of the neutrality which its magiſtrates have adopted, and which it is ſo much their intereſt to obſerve with ſcrupulous exactneſs. In ſhort, the intentions and views of France, have been ſo often and ſo diſtinctly declared, that it is impoſſible a free people can doubt their ſincerity. Tyrants only, and the abettors of tyranny, dare call them in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Plenipotentiaries of Geneva, on behalf of the Syndics and Council, declared, That having the honour to be the Magiſtrates of a free people, they neither now, nor at any future time, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any judge of their conduct, but God and their Countrymen. They therefore,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:033927_0007_0FF9FA9833F70638"/>The conſequence of this attack was, that the Convention refuſed to ratify it, and by a ſhort decree peremptorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us <hi>to diſmiſs the troops of the Swiſs by the 1ſt of December; in which caſe, it promiſed that thoſe of France ſhould reſpect our independence and evacuate our territory, if any part of it had been occupied by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The language of Briſſot on this occaſion is perhaps the moſt ſtriking inſtance afforded by the whole Revolution, of the real nature and genuine character of the principles on which the French conduct themſelves, in their intercourſe with other nations.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In truth, ſays he, the Republic of <hi>Geneva</hi> either has, or has not confidence in our integrity. If ſhe has, ſhe will be ſatisfied with our bare promiſe to reſpect her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence: if ſhe has not, the formality of a treaty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not add to her ſecurity. But whether ſhe has or has not that confidence, <hi>a free people muſt not ſuffer its honour to be called in queſtion.</hi>
               </q>—In another place he goes further, and ſays, <q>
                  <hi>Geneva</hi> muſt expect no peace, until <hi>perfect po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical equality is naturalized within her walls.</hi> She muſt expect no treaty with us but the introduction and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of our principles. Such is the revolution which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033927_0008_0FF9FAA32C4BA538"/>we preſume, which we feel it a duty to recommend to <hi>Geneva.</hi> Undoubtedly <hi>France</hi> will never forget her <hi>principle</hi> of not interfering in the domeſtic affairs of other nations. But <hi>France</hi> muſt never forget her <hi>oath</hi> to relieve <hi>all nations from oppreſſion,</hi> and to inform <hi>all nations of their rights. There muſt be a Revolution in Geneva, or there will be a Counter-Revolution in France.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The only queſtion, therefore, for your conſideration, is whether <hi>a free people either can or ought to bind itſelf by Treaties, and whether every Treaty is not as unneceſſary with Republics, as it is indecent with every other form of Government which does not derive its authority immediately from the People.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">It is to be obſerved that, in this report, Briſſot, after attempting to ſix upon us as a crime, that we had included ourſelves in the neutrality of the Helvetic Body, which he called <hi>an ill-diſguiſed acceſſion to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of Deſpots,</hi> urged againſt us with ſtill more vehemence, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern which the King of Great-Britain generouſly took in our affairs, at ſo critical a moment.
<p>Lord R. Fitzgerald, the Britiſh Miniſter in Switzerland, had written from Berne, on the 8th of October, to the Syndies and Council of Geneva, aſſuring them of the good-will of his Britannic Majeſty, and of his earneſt wiſhes for the continuance of the tranquillity, liberty and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of their Republic, which were ſo intimately connected with the quiet and happineſs of the whole Helvetic Body. "And I have no doubt," continued he, <q>that his Majeſty will entirely approve of the ſteps you have taken, which are juſtified by ancient uſage and ſolemn treaties, and are ſo eſſential to the preſervation of the neutrality obſerved by the Helvetic Union; a line of conduct to which, I am ſure, you want no perſuaſions of mine to induce you to adhere.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Briſſot commented on this letter, in the courſe of his report, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Ariſtocrats of Geneva have reſorted to other ſtratagems. They have endeavoured (and not-without ſucceſs), to excite the Cabinet of London againſt us, and have procured a Miniſter Plenipotentiary to be ſent to Geneva, to aſſure them, that the King of Great-Britain is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in their ſituation, and approves of their conduct. Doubtleſs the people of Great-Britain will hear, <hi>with indignation,</hi> that its influence has been employed in protecting the ariſtocracy of a few intriguers, and in cruſhing the freedom of a whole people. <hi>Doubtleſs, it will call thoſe who have dared to profane its name for ſuch a purpoſe, to a rigid account.</hi> But be that as it may, the French Republic will not retract. The appearance of a King upon the ſtage will not terrify us; nor ſhall the farce in which he is to be introduced, retard our juſtice.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This part of the report was as much applauded as any other; and it is worth remarking that it was delivered in the Convention preciſely <hi>two</hi> months before Mr. Chauvelin received orders to leave London.</p>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>On the manner in which this queſtion
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033927_0008_0FF9FAA32C4BA538"/>is anſwered, the fate not only of our own Revolution, but of thoſe which are to follow it, will depend.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved, that with a view to prepare the minds of the public for this Report, and to give an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of decency to ſo groſs a violation of the Law of Nations, the Briſſotin party had taken care, ſome days before, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an order from the Convention to arreſt <hi>Monteſquiou,</hi> and to bring him to Paris, to anſwer for his conduct.<note n="*" place="bottom">This decree was the natural conſequence of the boldneſs, with which he had, all along, reprobated their conduct towards the Geneveſe. Not ſatisfied with pleading their cauſe in his official correſpondence with the Miniſter for Foreign Affairs, he wrote in the following terms, on the 7th of October, to <hi>Garat,</hi> the Miniſter of Juſtice, of whom he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a better opinion than of his colleagues: <q>I conjure you not to follow the infamous example of Deſpotiſm; I call upon your pure and Republican heart, not to ſhut your ears to the indignant voice of an honeſt man. Exert all the vigour of real virtue in behalf of oppreſſed Geneva, and do not fuffer our country to be diſgraced by a wanton and abominable abuſe of power.</q>
                  <p>In a letter of the ſame date, to <hi>Vergniaux,</hi> the leading Member of the Convention, he ſays, <q>I am acting a part equally diſhonourable to my country and to myſelf. When I was ordered to negociate with the Geneveſe, I thought that the firſt diplomatic act of the French Republic, ſhould bear upon the face of it, the ſtamp of true greatneſs; I mean, moderation and juſtice. I laid out of my conſideration, the comparative power, and ſtrength, of the two nations: I raiſed Geneva, in my own imagination, to the level of France, and remembered only, that one free people was treating with another. The treaty was concluded, ſigned, and tranſmitted to Paris. With equal ſurpriſe and indignation, I learned, that the ſpirit, not of true greatneſs, but of childiſh vanity, had cavilled at ſome of the articles of it, and that I muſt propoſe alterations. I obeyed; and ſuch was the confidence my former conduct had inſpired, that thoſe alterations were accepted. Yeſterday, however, I received a letter from the Miniſter at War, directing me to make new preparations for hoſtility: again, I have obeyed, and I hope that the readineſs of my obedience will ſilence the calumnies, which my enemies circulate, ſo induſtriouſly, againſt me. But will You, Sir, you who are a man of talents and virtue—will You ſuffer the infancy of a Republic, on which the eyes of the Univerſe are fixed, to be polluted by the foul perfidy of Courts? Will you diſgrace your darling Country, by the ſcandalous repetition of the fable of the Wolf and the Lamb? Will it add to our honour, or to our power, to cruſh the feebleſt of our neighbours, to violate the moſt ſacred rule of univerſal juſtice, and to plunge ourſelves into an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional war? If I can avert ſuch a diſgrace from my Country, by awakening the feelings of an honeſt man, I ſhall do a virtuous action, and you will be worthy of the name of Frenchman. I am alarmed, and diſtreſſed, at the thought of being made the inſtrument of an act of perfidy, which the Miniſters would never have thought of, had they known the whole truth; I call upon you, Sir, whom I know to be a man of honour, to declare it to them, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had already given the Miniſters his opinion of their conduct, in the moſt unequivocal terms. It is, ſaid he, the exact counterpart of that of the Duke of Brunſwick; and your inſtructions, a mere copy of his Manifeſto. This reproach was too juſt, not to be deeply felt, and as deeply reſented: he was immediately accuſed, in the Convention, of having <hi>betrayed the intereſts,</hi> and <hi>ſacrificed the honour of his country,</hi> in the treaty he had negociated with us; <hi>of having chained down the valour of his troops, and diſgraced the French name, by granting terms to the Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates of Geneva, which a handful of his countrymen had refuſed to Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, and his numerous cohorts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not a ſingle voice was heard, in the Convention, in his favour, nor did any friend dare to inform him of the danger that awaited him. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the indiſcretion of the meſſenger who was ſent to ſeize him, gave the Geneveſe an opportunity of making him ſome return, for the ſervices he had rendered them, by facilitating his eſcape, which he had the good fortune to effect on the 14th of November. See <hi>Mémoirs Juſticatiſ pour le Citoyen Françcis, A P. Monteſquiou, Général de l' Armé des Alpes, adreſſe au Préſident de la Convention, Novembre,</hi> 1792.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, that part of their demands which related to the diſmiſſion of the Swiſs, it was no longer in our power to diſpute; as our Allies had, on the faith of the two treaties, ſuſpended their military preparations, and recalled the greater part of their troops. The neceſſity of our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion left us no choice; we conſented therefore to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033927_0009_0FF9CC64B564D2C0"/>of the reſt, and flattered ourſelves that our oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors would be ſatisfied, and that we had now nothing more to apprehend.</p>
            <p>But we were miſtaken; a danger, much greater than any we had encountered, threatened us. General <hi>Monteſquiou,</hi> having had the good fortune to make his eſcape, informed us, that it was the determination of the French Miniſtry, to leave no means untried, for effecting a Revolution at <hi>Geneva,</hi> on the ſame principles as that of <hi>France;</hi> and that we had no alternative but to anticipate them, or feel the conſequences of their interference.</p>
            <p>It was difficult for us to conceive, how we could make our Government more democratical, than it then was; ſince every free-man of <hi>Geneva</hi> exerciſed, in his own perſon, thoſe powers, which the <hi>French,</hi> from their numbers, had
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033927_0009_0FF9CC64B564D2C0"/>been obliged to intruſt to repreſentatives. But unfortunately for us, the Briſſotins, who then were the prevailing party at <hi>Paris,</hi> had lately ſucceeded in removing the diſtinction between <hi>active</hi> and <hi>inactive</hi> citizens; and repealing the law which reſerved the civil and military offices of the country, as well as the right of electing to them, to thoſe who had ſome property in it; a wiſe and ſalutary principle, and which, if it had been ſteadily maintained, would, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, have prevented a great deal of the miſery and diſtreſs, which the violation of it has brought upon <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But having deſtroyed that important diſtinction in their own Conſtitution, the Briſſotins ſoon found out an effectual mode of overturning it in ours; for as, by our Conſtitution, none were admitted into the General Aſſembly, but ſuch as inherited, or had acquired the title of <hi>Citizen,</hi> they raiſed a clamour againſt that diſtinction, and branded the Aſſembly itſelf with the epithets of <hi>ariſtocratical</hi> and <hi>hereditary,</hi> which they had contrived to make ſo odious. So far, however, was that Body from deſerving thoſe epithets, that, as has been already mentioned, more than two thirds of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſe were, at that moment, members of it, and any of the reſt might be admitted into it, upon payment of a fine ſo ſmall,<note n="*" place="bottom">In favour of the children of aliens born at Geneva, this fine was by degrees reduced to about ſix pounds ſterling, and was part of the funds of the hoſpitals, the arſenals, and other inſtitutions of public utility which had been founded by the Geneveſe in former ages.</note> as in fact to be below the rate neceſſary for ſecuring the independence of an elector, much more of a member of the Legiſlature itſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Natives,</hi> who, as I have already obſerved, were at Geneva what the claſs of <hi>inactive Citizens</hi> was in France, had, on the late invaſion, ſhewn themſelves extremely zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the defence of the Republic: and, indeed, with the exception of about fifty individuals, partly Citizens and partly Natives, who on the approach of the French had baſely deſerted their poſts, on pretence that, as friends to liberty, they ought not to oppoſe them—with this ſmall exception, all the Geneveſe breathed, on that occaſion, the ſame affectionate attachment to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033927_0010_0FF9FAC1883735E0"/>and were all animated with the ſame intrepid reſolution of dying in its defence. Indeed, the patriotic ſpirit ſhown on that occaſion, is one of the moſt brilliant, as I fear it is one of the laſt inſtances of the diſplay of that virtue, to be found in our hiſtory; for, no ſooner was it underſtood that war was declared againſt us, for having paſſed the firſt decree, by which Government had been directed to call in the 1600 Swiſs, than a ſecond decree was made, and ſent, by order of the General Aſſembly, to the French General, by which it was empowered to call in, as many more, as it might think neceſſary; and, on being informed, that the French Miniſtry affected to treat thoſe decrees as contrivances of our magiſtrates, who, they inſiſted, ſhould be puniſhed for ſuch <hi>perverſe</hi> and <hi>traitorous</hi> behaviour, the whole body of our national militia met, in arms, on the 10th day of October, and communicated to thoſe Magiſtrates, its entire approbation of their conduct, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the moſt ſolemn aſſurances of the firmeſt ſupport.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Magiſtrates ſhowed themſelves worthy of the confidence, and attachment of their fellow-citizens. They immediately wrote a letter to <hi>Le Brun,</hi> who was then Miniſter for Foreign Affairs, in which, after fully diſproving every charge brought againſt them, they offered their own lives and fortunes, if ſuch a ſacrifice would preſerve the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their country: "nay," ſaid they, <q>we will bleſs the hand, which takes them from us, if, by loſing them, we can tranſmit, to our children, the liberty we have received, from our forefathers; we will bleſs the hand, which, by ſacrificing us, averts the ſtorm that ſeems to hang over the Helvetic Body, and the French Republic, and ſaves the latter the indelible diſgrace, of beginning its career, with the ruin of the country, which gave birth to the Philoſopher, to whom ſhe gratefully looks up, as to the author of her freedom: we will bleſs the hand, which reſcues the age of liberty, from the mortification and ignominy, of ſeeing two free nations wantonly turning their arms againſt each other.</q> See <hi>Recueit de Pieces authentiques pour ſervir de ſuite à l'écrit intitulé, An accurate Statement of the Proceedings of the French towards the Republic of Geneva—London,</hi> 1739, <hi>Sold by Debrett, Piccadilly.</hi>

            <p>But the plan of our invaders was now changed, and meaſures, leſs violent, but more ſure, adopted; which have completely ſucceeded in deſtroying the liberty and happineſs of Geneva. No ſooner did the Natives diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, from what paſſed in the Convention, as well as from
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033927_0010_0FF9FAC1883735E0"/>other ſources of information, that the French had given up all thoughts of puniſhing the Magiſtrates, or of taking poſſeſſion of the town by force, and had, or affected to have, no other object than that of eſtabliſhing the right of <hi>univerſal ſuffrage,</hi> and of procuring the admiſſion of all the Geneveſe, without diſtinction, to the enjoyment of <hi>perfect political equality,</hi> than they began, in the moſt open man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to echo the language of the Convention, and to aſſert their right to what it intended to give them. They alſo began, in imitation of the French, to addreſs each other by the title of <hi>Citizen,</hi> to wear the Red Cap, to ſing the favourite Pariſian ſongs, and to make preparations for ſupporting their claims by force. In theſe views, ſome of the Citizens ſupported them; and either from motives of ambition, or from being themſelves the dupes of the faſcinating ſyſtem of what has been called <hi>the Rights of Man,</hi> put themſelves at their head. The ſoldiers of the French army, who were ſtill encamped in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, fanned the flames; and ſome of the officers actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made ſecret offers of their aſſiſtance. Such, Sir, was the origin of that revolutionary delirium, the effect of which has been, gradually to introduce, among us, all the miſeries of anarchy; and, in leſs than two years, has plunged our once-happy Republic into all the horrors, and all the crimes, which the fertile invention of Popular Tyranny can ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates, alarmed at this new kind of danger, which ſeemed to threaten, either the Conſtitution, or the political independence of the State, or perhaps both, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſecure at leaſt the latter, and immediately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a propoſal to admit all the inhabitants of the Republic, whether aliens or natives, that is to ſay, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of aliens, into the General Aſſembly, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, and without fine; and to take the opinion of the whole Body, thus conſtituted, on the propriety of further alterations. This propoſal, which was made by the Little and Great Councils, on the 1ſt of December, only wanted the aſſent of the General Aſſembly itſelf (which it would undoubtedly have received) to have the force of law; but in the mean time, the enemies of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033927_0011_0FF9FAD6AD8073E8"/>took indefatigable pains, to repreſent to the Natives, how humiliating it would be for them, to receive, as a favour, what was their natural and indefeaſible right, and which it was an additional inſult to reſtore to them, by the forms of the very Conſtitution, that had wreſted it from them.</p>
            <p>This doctrine ſpread ſo rapidly, and took ſuch root in the minds of the Natives, that without waiting for the meeting of the Aſſembly, which was fixed for the 6th of December, they ran to arms on the night of the 4th; and beſides declaring themſelves entitled to the rights in queſtion, they inſiſted that, in order to ſecure the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them, every department of the State ſhould be filled by individuals of their own party, and that a National Convention ſhould be immediately ſummoned, for the purpoſe of introducing the new principles, into every part of the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It is a certain fact, that this faction did not then amount to a fourth part of the inhabitants of Geneva; and our Magiſtrates have, more than once, been ſeverely blamed, by thoſe who either do not know, or do not advert to all the circumſtances of the caſe, for not immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing it by force. The truth is, that nothing but the fear of the probable conſequences, prevented their doing ſo: for, ever ſince the French had taken poſſeſſion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, we had been completely ſurrounded by the territory of France; her troops, in direct violation, even of the laſt treaty, were ſtill at our gates: the decree of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ordered all the French Generals to relieve the people of every country from <hi>the tyranny of oppreſſion,</hi> had juſt been received, and proclaimed, by the troops in our neighbourhood; the moſt violent of the Natives openly avowed their intention to take advantage of that decree, if neceſſary; and the French army only waited for the ſlighteſt appearance of commotion, to enter the City, where it was ſure of finding many friends, and where, by its intrigues, it had in fact already eſtabliſhed a ſort of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced guard.</p>
            <p>It was under theſe circumſtances, and in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, it poſſible, the political independence of their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033927_0011_0FF9FAD6AD8073E8"/>country, that the minority of the Geneveſe gave way to the minority. The members of the Little and Great Councils voluntarily reſigned their places to the chiefs of the new party, (moſt of whom were among thoſe who left their poſts at the approach of the French), and in reſigning them, required no other engagement from their ſucceſſors, than that they ſhould maintain peace and good order, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the independence of the Republic.<note n="*" place="bottom">The French made no ſecret of the importance which they thought the acquiſition of Geneva would be of to them; and when they ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the plan of intrigue for the former plan of force, <hi>Anacharſis Cloots,</hi> a principal character in the Convention, ſaid publicly in his place, that <hi>if Geneva perſiſted in refuſing to give herſelf to France, they muſt try to perſuade her to permit France to give herſelf to Geneva.</hi>
               </note> As this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, violent as it was, took place in a more quiet manner than the French army expected, it was diſappointed in its hopes of a tumult, which had been the immediate object of all its cabals, and which would have given it an opportunity of entering the town, and, under pretence of aſſiſting the oppreſſed, making us, in the end, a branch of their own Republic.<note n="‡" place="bottom">In order to take from the French every pretext for interfering any farther, the authors of the Revolution immediately announced the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of it, by planting the tree of liberty. A ſymbol ſo little known to our people was purpoſely choſen, in order to contraſt the ſyſtem it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the more ſtrongly with that it had ſupplanted; but, as it alſo ſhewed, that the new ſyſtem was perfectly eſtabliſhed, and had no need of farther aſſiſtance, it in that reſpect diſappointed the views of thoſe who had contributed to introduce it. It was not <hi>by accident</hi> that the inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it was ambiguous— <hi>This tree protects our city better then we can.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner, did the powerful Republic of France, in its very infancy, diſgrace its arms, by turning them againſt the petty Democracy of Geneva; and, in this manner, when it ſubſtituted negociation for force, did it diſgrace its diplomatic character, by expreſsly inſtructing its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, <hi>to exert his whole addreſs,</hi> and by openly violating two ſolemn treaties, on the faith of which we had diſarmed ourſelves, and diſmiſſed our allies. In this manner did it, in direct contradiction to its own principles, overturn a Conſtitution which was certainly the moſt democratical then known, and which had been adopted by the almoſt unanimous voice of thoſe who lived under it: and in this
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033927_0012_0FF9FAE8E8B43A20"/>manner was an inconſiderable State, which, in deſence of its conſtitution, had dared to oppoſe force by force, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for that offence, by its vindictive neighbour, to fall a ſacrifice to the baſeſt treachery. As a part of the deteſtable plan, the French Reſident waited immediately upon the new Magiſtrates, and informed them, that he would loſe no time in announcing to his Conſtituents <hi>the glorious event</hi> which had juſt taken place; and, while he amuſed them with profeſſions of admiration and eſteem, General <hi>Kellerman</hi> ſecretly drew an additional body of troops round the town, in hopes of an opportunity of entering it.</p>
            <p>The members of the new Government were now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely in poſſeſſion of the adminiſtration; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the manner in which they had come into power, it is extremely probable that, like the party in France to whom they were indebted for it, they never would have engaged in ſuch an undertaking, had they not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of being able to ſtop at whatever point they pleaſed, and to prevent their followers and adherents from going further than they wiſhed or meant them to go: for, it muſt be allowed, that many of them were men of ſome property, and even of ſome education; and if we except a few acts of violence, done under the forms of juſtice, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be expected at extraordinary periods, and ſome enormities of the populace, which, there is reaſon to ſuſpect, were committed at the inſtigation of particular individuals in Adminiſtration, they were in general active in their efforts to preſerve the independence of their country, as well as its internal quiet.</p>
            <p>It is equally true, however, that they had ſeveral conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able obſtacles to ſtruggle with. In the firſt place, they had to encounter the decline of trade and manufactures, the conſequences of the ruin of ſuch families as had inveſted their property in the French funds, and the incredible conſumption of the public revenue, which was almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted in ſalaries to the 120 members of the Convention, and to the new Magiſtrates, whoſe needy circumſtances rendered a large allowance abſolutely neceſſary. In the next place, they had to oppoſe the intrigues and artifices of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033927_0012_0FF9FAE8E8B43A20"/>the French Reſident,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Abbé <hi>Soulavie,</hi> who diſtinguiſhed himſelf in France ſoon after the Revolution, by an obſcene performance, called <hi>The Private Life of Marſhal Riehelieu.</hi>
               </note> who caballed againſt them in the moſt open manner, and the contempt and diſtruſt of Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſot's ſucceſſors, who, while they loaded them with <hi>fraternal embraces,</hi> and other outward marks of affection, never would conſider them as true confederates; and, notwithſtanding their title of Revolutionary Government, treated them<note n="†" place="bottom">This was carried ſo far, that, for the ſole purpoſe of increaſing the diſtreſs which Geneva then felt from want of proviſions, the French Agents conſtantly refuſed, under various pretences, to permit any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to be carried into the town from two ſmall diſtricts which belonged to us, and to which the road lay through the French territory, though the right of ſo doing was ſecured by numerous treaties. But I have heard that ſince the ſecond Revolution (which will be mentioned hereafter) the prohibition has been taken off.</note> with a degree of freedom, which they never dared to aſſume toward the other branches of the Helvetic Union, who, by ſteadily adhering to their ancient Conſtitutions, have never received, or expoſed themſelves to receive, the ſmalleſt mark of diſreſpect. Beſides this, they had to fight againſt a new faction, formed out of the refuſe of their own, and divided into two clubs, called the <hi>Marſeilleſe</hi> and the <hi>Mountaineers.</hi> Theſe clubs were not very numerous; but they were notoriouſly under the influence and direction of the French Reſident; both profeſſed the new doctrines to their utmoſt extent, and both (but particularly the latter) ſeemed prepared to imitate the conduct of thoſe who had carried them the fartheſt in France, and even to ſurrender themſelves and their country into their hands.</p>
            <p>So ſtrongly, however, was the great body of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſe attached to the idea of national independence, and ſo grateful did they feel, even to the new adminiſtration, for its efforts to maintain it, that they forgave the manner in which it had come into power, and overlooked both the faults it had already committed, and thoſe into which its incapacity, the violence of party, or the peculiar difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of its ſituation, daily and hourly led it. On more than one occaſion, the very Magiſtrates whoſe offices they had uſurped, came forward to aſſiſt and guide them; and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033927_0013_0FF9FAFB05770C40"/>ſome of them were even prevailed upon, to become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the new Convention, which met on the 25th of February, 1793, and was compoſed of 120 members. If ſat for about a year, and unfortunately, like that in Paris, ſoon fell under the controul of a Club, which had borrowed both its principles and its language from the Jacobins, to whom it had applied for a copy of their rules, and forms, and whoſe importance it affected to aſſume, on all occaſions.</p>
            <p>During the ſitting of the Convention, the friends of the old Conſtitution experienced, from the rabble of Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioniſts, every ſpecies of indignity, and inſult, which the capricious malice of men without education, and without property, could invent. Thoſe pretended reformers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raded the ſtreets, in the evening, with cudgels in their hands, and attacked, and ſeverely beat, ſuch as they thought averſe to their ſyſtem: nor did the Government take any effectual ſteps, to prevent theſe exceſſes, which were continued, for a conſiderable time, and were never puniſhed, though the country houſe of an Ex-Magiſtrate, who had been Commander in Chief during the late inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was pillaged for ſeveral days, and another perſon aſſaſſinated in open day-light, becauſe he had worn a white cap, inſtead of a red one. It is unneceſſary, and would be tedious, to enumerate all the mean cruelties which the diſciples of the new ſchool of Equality prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed: it is enough to ſay, that a deſcription of them would preſent a picture of Popular tyranny, as provoking by its inſolence, as the ſcenes which ſucceeded them were ſhocking, by their barbarity.</p>
            <p>Though the Convention affected to preſerve ſome of the forms of the old Conſtitution, yet, in order to deſerve the pompous name it had aſſumed, it thought itſelf bound to make a complete, and radical change in its principles; and in treating the petty abuſes of a ſmall Republic, to act as if they had been called upon to correct the invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate corruptions, and deep-rooted errors of an ancient and extenſive Monarchy. <hi>Deſpotiſm,</hi> ſaid one of the leading members of it, <hi>is a fiery meteor, which ſcorches the ſoil over which it paſſes.</hi> Even ſuch bombaſt as this had
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033927_0013_0FF9FAFB05770C40"/>its effect upon the diſtempered minds of thoſe to whom it was addreſſed, and was received with univerſal applauſe.</p>
            <p>In order to ingratiate themſelves with the French, one of their firſt ſteps was to aboliſh the Great Council, and to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a portion of the power of the Little Council to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly, by which means they deſtroyed the equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium between the executive and legiſlative branches, which the ancient Conſtitution had provided with ſo much care: but, on the other hand, it muſt be acknowledged that, in the laws they framed, they ſhewed great regard to perſonal ſecurity, and even eſtabliſhed the Trial by Jury. Perhaps, it would have been well to enquire, whether that noble inſtitution (which one of the greateſt nations of Europe conſiders as the moſt ſacred of all its rights, and its beſt ſecurity for the enjoyment of the reſt) is equally ſuited to ſo ſmall a State, as Geneva, where it is ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to prevent the influence of perſonal feelings, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conſiderations: but the introduction of it ſhewed, at leaſt, the goodneſs of their intentions.</p>
            <p>It muſt not be imagined, however, that a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, ſo unlimited as this, was approved by the greater part of thoſe who ſubmitted to it. The People at large had not forgot the ſound principles in which they had been educated; they knew perfectly well, that ſome degree of reſtraint is eſſential to the very exiſtence of liberty, and were extremely attached to the balances of the Old Conſtitution; conſequently every artifice was practiſed, that could ſecure the ratification of the New, by the General Aſſembly. The authors of it affected to aſſume the tone of friendſhip and confidence, towards thoſe who, they knew, diſapproved of it, and intreated them to give it their ſupport, if not from conviction of its goodneſs, at leaſt, to defeat the ſchemes of both the foreign, and the domeſtic enemies of the public peace, who, if it was rejected, would not fail to convert its want of ſucceſs into an opportunity of creating general confuſion; but more particularly for the purpoſe of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the inferior agents of the Revolution, who began to ſhew a ſpirit of inſubordination and turbulence, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with any ſocial order whatever, and only to be
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033927_0014_0FF9FB1017B18570"/>repelled, by the appearance of union, and general ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the new ſyſtem. They aſſured them, that it would amply provide for the ſecurity both of the perſons and of the property of thoſe who were to live under it, which, in the preſent ſituation of the Republic, was of more importance than the preſervation of any particular ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>This language was ſo ſpecious, and was accompanied by promiſes, apparently ſo ſincere, that they to whom it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, though they ſtill adhered to their principles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew their oppoſition; and, for the ſake of peace, or perhaps as chooſing the leaſt of two evils, agreed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the new Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It was accordingly propoſed, and adopted, in a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly on the 5th of February 1794, by 4,200 voices againſt 200; and as a farther proof of the conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatory diſpoſition, and amicable intentions of thoſe who ſupported it, the new offices were entirely filled up with its avowed friends. Nor was this all; for as the war, in which almoſt the whole of Europe was involved, had conſiderably affected the Watch-making buſineſs, which is the principal ſupport of the poor in Geneva; and as the ſtagnation of trade, as well as the habits of indolence, into which a great many of the workmen had been thrown by the Revolution, had reduced the lower claſſes of the People to conſiderable diſtreſs, very general ſubſcriptions were made by all thoſe in eaſy circumſtances, to keep them in employment until the market ſhould be again open.</p>
            <p>By ſuch generous and diſintereſted conduct, the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſeemed likely to weather the ſtorm, which had wrecked her more powerful neighbour. The Swiſs, who, for eighteen months paſt, had renounced every kind of official communication with us, thought they ſaw what the hiſtory of the world had produced no other inſtance of, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Country ſuddenly and completely diſſolved, and Anarchy not the conſequence. Aſtoniſhed at ſuch a phaenomenon, they yielded to the repeated and earneſt ſolicitations of ſome of the depoſed Magiſtrates, and conſented to correſpond with their ſucceſſors, who now
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033927_0014_0FF9FB1017B18570"/>aſſumed the title of <hi>Conſtitutional Government.</hi> In ſhort, the new Adminiſtration ſeemed to gain ſtrength every day, and to be better qualified for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their functions: even thoſe who diſapproved of the manner in which they had come into power, were ready to ſupport them againſt every attack. The greateſt part of thoſe who had abandoned Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, for fear of the exceſſes, into which, it was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to expect, that men unaccuſtomed to authority would run, gradually returned to it, and implicitly truſted to the aſſurances they received, that the Revolution <hi>was completed,</hi> and that they might depend on finding, under its protection, ſafety for their perſons, and ſecurity for their property.</p>
            <p>But, alas! the whole was a deluſion; and in an inſtant, the malignant genius of France again blaſted all our hopes.</p>
            <p>An advocate of the name of <hi>Bouſquet,</hi> who had taken an active part in the uſurpation of 1792, and been elected a Magiſtrate, was ſoon afterwards ſent in a public charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Paris. During his ſtay there, he imbibed from the leaders of the Jacobins (to whom his miſſion gave him conſtant acceſs) all the poiſon of their principles, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, after a year's abſence, to Geneva, full of theories of ſedition and revolution, and impatient to put them in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. With this view, he immediately joined the Marſeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſe and the Mountaineers, whom he found perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined, and prepared for any enterpriſe, by the induſtry of <hi>Soulavie.</hi> He immediately opened his plan, which conſiſted of five principal objects. Firſt, to wean the lower claſſes of the people from the confidence they placed in ſuch Members of the new Government, as had any character for integrity, by accuſing them of being ſecretly leagued with the Rich, or at leaſt of ſavouring and ſcreen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: Secondly, to ſtrip his colleagues, and even the General Aſſembly itſelf, of their authority, and to transfer all their powers to a few of his own partiſans, under the title of <hi>Revolutionary Government;</hi> Thirdly, to erect a Revolutionary Tribunal, which would ſoon rid him of all thoſe from whom he had any thing to fear; and by the reſentment which the effuſion of blood, as well as the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033927_0015_0FF9FB2708A159C0"/>loſs of their property, would naturally occaſion in the boſoms of the injured, make the retreat of his partiſans impoſſible: Fourthly, to adopt the French ſyſtem of making <hi>Terror the order of the day,</hi> ſo as to carry it into every claſs and deſcription of men, and make the ſmaller number maſters of the greater: Laſtly, to hold up the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed religion as an object of ridicule and contempt.</p>
            <p>The material parts of this plan, extenſive and difficult as it ſeems, were executed in a ſingle night. Indeed the author of it had no time to loſe, as it was abſolutely neceſſary that it ſhould be carried into execution, before a propoſal, then in contemplation, for laying another aſſeſſment on the people of property, could be made. For, as there was no doubt that the propoſal would be received without oppoſition, the ſucceſs of it would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any clamour being raiſed againſt that deſcription of men, and, at the ſame time, reſtore to the Adminiſtration, ſome part of the vigour which it had loſt, by its improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent management of the public finances.</p>
            <p>This, therefore, was the critical moment; and <hi>Bouſquet</hi> began the execution of his plan, by ſpreading reports of conſpiracies to effect a counter-revolution, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat at <hi>Geneva,</hi> the horrors which had been committed in <hi>la Vendée;</hi> and by taking every opportunity of declaring publicly, that, even though the Rich could be brought to conſent to the propoſed aſſeſſments, (which he ſtrongly inſinuated they would not) yet, in his opinion, there were means of relieving the miſeries of the People, much more effectual, than that of exempting them from the payment of taxes. "The Rich," he ſaid, <q>had too long waſted, in their own ſelfiſh pleaſures, that which ought to be applied to the maintenance, and comfort of the Poor; too long had they been ſuffered to inſult them by their wanton extravagance, and even by the wretched pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of alms which they affectedly diſtributed. The deſtruction of the pernicious ſpirit of Ariſtocracy, which had pervaded the Laws and Conſtitution, would anſwer no purpoſe, and would but palliate the evil, if it was ſuffered ſtill to influence the conduct and the ſentiments
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033927_0015_0FF9FB2708A159C0"/>of the Rich: nor would any thing ſhort of complete eradication anſwer any uſeful purpoſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The minds of the multitude being thus prepared, the night of the 18th of July 1794 (being the eve of the day on which the new aſſeſſments were to be propoſed) was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for the execution of the plot. The whole plan was laid, all the parts were aſſigned, every agent was at his ſtation, and the victims marked out: in the midſt of the night, the Conſpirators ran to arms, ſeized the artillery of the Town, and entered, by means of falſe keys, into the houſes of ſuch of the Citizens, as, they apprehended, might be inclined to oppoſe force to force, and diſarmed them before they knew what was intended againſt them. To diſguiſe their intentions the more completely, they put two of the new Syndics under arreſt, who have ſince been anxious to have it believed, that the blow was ſo ſudden as well as violent, that it was impoſſible for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to ward it off, which it would not have failed to do, had it been aware of it in time. But there are not wanting men of very good information, and of unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable veracity, who aſſert, in the moſt unqualified man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Magiſtrates were well acquainted with what was to happen, and wanted neither courage nor ſtrength to prevent it, had they been deſirous of it; but that, in fact, the detention of the two <hi>Syndics</hi> (which laſted but a few hours) was a farce, contrived between them and <hi>Bouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Indeed the two Syndics in queſtion were actually ſeen, on the night of the 18th, in the foremoſt ranks of the conſpirators, with arms in their hands.</note> and though they had not taken a direct and active part in the execution of the plot, they were ſtill to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as accomplices in it; and, beſides other reaſons, knew that its ſucceſs would relieve them, from the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable neceſſity of giving in their accounts, and expoſing the ſhameleſs manner, in which they had waſted the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic treaſure.</p>
            <p>However this may be, it is certain that Government took no ſtep to defeat the plot, or even to prevent the ſhocking lengths to which it was carried. From the nature of the attack, one would have ſuppoſed that the city had been ſtormed by a foreign Enemy; but the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematic
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033927_0016_0FF9FB3AAA54AF68"/>regularity with which it was conducted, together with the perfect knowledge the plunderers ſhewed, of the places in which the objects of their pillage were depoſited, ſoon convinced the unhappy ſufferers that their Enemies lived within the ſame walls, and, in many inſtances, under the ſame roof with themſelves. The Conſpirators were divided into ſmall bodies well armed, did not affect to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the authority by which they acted, left ſeals on what was too heavy to be carried off, and took care to include ſome of the poorer, and more obſcure Citizens, among thoſe whom they put into confinement. But with ſo little regard to humanity were theſe <hi>domiciliary viſits</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, that though the heat of the weather was exceſſive, the priſons were crowded with the aged, the infirm, the diſeaſed; and even with ſome who were torn from their beds in the height of malignant fevers. This work of horror was executed in a few hours, by not more than a hundred wretches, one half of whom were foreigners; but it had the effect which <hi>Bouſquet</hi> expected, and he was joined the next day, by the reſt of the populace, by every man of unfixed principles or of deſperate fortune, and by not a few of an oppoſite deſcription, who vainly hoped, that by appearing to countenance what had been done, they might acquire an influence over the perpetrators, ſufficient to prevent the execution of what was ſtill intended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bouſquet</hi> now collected all his aſſociates together, and addreſſing them by the title of <hi>Revolutionary Nation,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that a daily allowance ſhould be paid to thoſe patriots, who ſhould perſevere in the great work they had undertaken. He obſerved, that it was only by deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and vigorous meaſures, both at home and abroad, that the <hi>French</hi> had ſecured ſuch brilliant ſucceſs, in their glorious ſtruggles againſt Deſpotiſm; that theſe meaſures, ſevere as they might appear, were as eaſily to be reconciled to pure morality, as to ſound policy; and, both in their principle and in their effects, juſtified thoſe, with which, he ſhould propoſe to begin the reign of liberty, and virtue in <hi>Geneva.</hi> The Conſtitutional Government was then formally ſuſpended, and the whole Executive and Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power of the State, committed to a <hi>proviſional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutionary Tribunal,</hi> of which <hi>Bouſquet</hi> was of courſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033927_0016_0FF9FB3AAA54AF68"/>made Preſident. The number of perſons who were taken into cuſtody, increaſed every hour, and by the induſtry of Soulavie, who had given orders in all the neighbouring French diſtricts, that ſuch of the inhabitants of Geneva as retired to any of them ſhould be obliged to return, it ſoon amounted to near 600 perſons; among whom were moſt of the Magiſtrates who had been depoſed from their offices in 1792, many of the Profeſſors, and almoſt the whole of the Clergy, a body of men who did honour to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and to human nature, by their talents, their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, their mild and tolerant ſpirit, and the ſpotleſs purity of their lives. Leſt any of the latter ſhould eſcape, they were purſued even into the churches, which, in ſpite of the threats they heard on all ſides, of being treated as the prieſts had been treated in Paris, on the 2d of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, thoſe venerable men had entered, for the purpoſe of imploring the mercy of Heaven upon their diſtracted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In this manner, was the horrible ſentence formerly pronounced by Briſſot, ſulfilled to its utmoſt extent: <hi>There muſt be a Revolution in Geneva, or there will be a Counter-Revolution in France.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See p 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the midſt however of theſe ſhocking ſcenes, ſome few circumſtances ſhewed, that the native character of the Geneveſe was not to be depraved but by degrees. Some of the Revolutioniſts could not refrain from tears, when they were ordered to be the gaolers of their countrymen, and, in more than one inſtance, declared, that <hi>they envied their ſituation, and, if poſſible, would gladly exchange with them.</hi> But theſe, as well as many other expreſſions of regret and remorſe, were of little avail to the unhappy victims, whoſe adverſaries were too watchful to leave them any means either of eſcape or reſiſtance. One gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous effort, indeed, was made by the women of Geneva (for the experiment was too hazardous for men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in), who, to the number of two thouſand, went in a body to the Revolutionary Tribunal, to intercede for them; but their tears and entreaties had no other effect, than that of expoſing them to the brutal ridicule of the Judges, who ordered the fire-engines to be got ready, in
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033927_0017_0FF9FB52A4C24358"/>order to adminiſter what they profanely called, the rights of <hi>Civic Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This feeble obſtacle being removed, the Tribunal eagerly entered upon the diſcharge of its functions, and ordered eight of the priſoners to be brought up to trial, in which number, expreſs directions were given to include the Ex-ſyndic <hi>Cayla,</hi> who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf by the intrepid ſpirit with which he had oppoſed the former Revolution, the Ex-counſellor <hi>Prevoſt,</hi> whoſe principal offence was, that he had taken part in the negociation with General Monteſquiou, and the Advocate <hi>De Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tribunal ſat in the Town Hall: the Judges took their places with the ſlieves of their ſhirts tucked up, like butchers, their legs and breaſts naked, ſabres at their ſides, piſtols in their girdles, and bottles and glaſſes on the table. Some of the Judges could not ſupport a ſight ſo truly diabolical; two were taken out in a ſort of fainting fit, and four others permitted to retire. The reſt kept their places, and proceeded to the diſcharge of their functions, in the midſt of drunkenneſs, low witticiſms, and indecent buffoonery. <hi>Add power to paſſion,</hi> ſays an Author of great candour, when ſpeaking of tranſactions in Rome, exactly ſimilar to thoſe I am now deſcribing in Geneva, <hi>add power to paſſion, and there is no wild beaſt ſo ſavage as man.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Plut. in vitâ Ciceronis.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Although there was no direct charge againſt theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable men, nor the ſlighteſt evidence produced of any plan of a Counter-Revolution, which had been the pretext for taking arms, nor any queſtion aſked, in any degree relative to it, yet the trial of the eight laſted till the next morning (the 26th of July); and on opening the ballot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boxes, in which the opinions of the Judges were collected, it was found, that only two, neither of them Magiſtrates, were capitally convicted.</p>
            <p>When this circumſtance was known, the Marſeilleſe and Mountaineers, impatient for blood, ſurrounded the Tribunal, with threats of vengeance againſt the perfidious Judges, who had acted ſo inconſiſtently with their former profeſſions, and propoſed to make an immediate maſſacre
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033927_0017_0FF9FB52A4C24358"/>of all the priſoners. The Judges affected to be alarmed, and the next day returned to the Bench, and, amidſt the clamours and howlings of the Galleries, gave their opinions, not by ballot, as before, but openly; the conſequence of which was, that ſeven of the eight were condemned to die, by the very men who, but the day before, had acquirted ſix of them; and who, on both occaſions, called the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to witneſs the purity with which they gave their ſentence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Revolutionary Nation</hi> to whom an appeal was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, immediately aſſembled, in arms, to conſider the ſentence of the ſeven perſons condemned; and though, under pretence of purifying the Aſſembly, the leaders of the Revolution had carefully excluded from it, all whom they ſuſpected, either of integrity, or humanity, there was ſtill a decided majority for ſparing the lives of <hi>Cayla, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt,</hi> and <hi>de Rochemont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This third deciſion, ſo different from what they expected, increaſed the rage of the brutal Janiſaries of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. They reviled it as the conſequence of Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical influence, and Ariſtocratical principles, and refuſed to abide by it.—They vented their execrations and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces indiſcriminately, and actually attempted to deſtroy two or three of their own party, who called upon the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders to ſupport the ſovereignty of the people, and not ſuffer it to be inſulted with impunity. Nor was this all: they ſent armed Deputies to the Tribunal, to complain that falſe patriots had artfully mixed themſelves, on this occaſion, with the real lovers of their country, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed their hopes; to inſiſt that the ſentence of the three Ariſtocrats, who had been acquitted, ſhould be annulled, and to declare, that, if this requeſt was refuſed or delayed, they would repair to the priſon, and do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſtice.</p>
            <p>The number of thoſe who held this language was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and their menaces frightful. They were all provided with arms and ammunition; it was night; and thoſe who diſapproved of their meaſures, were either too much terrified to oppoſe them, or too diſunited and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful of each other to attempt it. Theſe circumſtances
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033927_0018_0FF9FB6501ED31D0"/>were abundantly ſufficient in the opinion of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary Tribunal, to juſtify it in aſſuming a new Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reverſing the ſentence paſſed by the people at large;<note n="*" place="bottom">On the next day, they publiſhed an apology for this part of their conduct, for which they acknowledged themſelves reſponſible; yet, with impudent inconſiſtency, imputed what had happened to the machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe they called the enemies of the Revolution. This apology may be conſidered as a formal declaration of war againſt the reſt of the Ariſtocrats, that is to ſay, of the people of property. It accuſes them of <hi>ſtill perſevering in their claims to ſuperiority; of having refuſed to frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize with the Revolutioniſts in the Civic Feaſts; of anxiouſly wiſhing for a Counter-Revolution in France, as the prelude to a ſimilar event in Geneva; of having expreſſed the warmeſt wiſhes for the ſucceſs of the Rebels in Lyons; and of having concerted meaſures, to have the law, which was to make new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>Theſe illuſtrious victims died in a manner, worthy of the cauſe, in which they ſuffered, and with all the dignity which religion, innocence and virtue can give. They refuſed to have their eyes covered; and their murderers, inſtead of diſpatching them all at the ſame ſhot, were careful to make a ſecond neceſſary. <hi>Cayla</hi> was the only one who ſpoke; <hi>I ſhould die with pleaſure,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>could I hope that my death would reſtore peace and liberty to my unhappy country.</hi> The executioners tore in pieces a written paper, which <hi>De Rochement,</hi> a young Advocate of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing hopes, entreated them to deliver, after his death; to his family.—But <hi>Prevoſt</hi> contrived to drop a letter
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033927_0018_0FF9FB6501ED31D0"/>which he had written with a pencil, and which exhibits a ſtriking picture of the calm heroiſin, and amiable tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his diſpoſition.—<hi>No man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>loſes ſo much in dying, as I do. I return my moſt grateful thanks to my dear Wife, for all the happineſs, for which I have been indebted to her; and I intreat her never to forget, that her huſhand dies in the moſt honourable of cauſes; and, in ſpite of the deluſion which occaſions his untimely end, will be eſteemed and regretted by all good Men.—My dear Mother: how little is the ſatisfaction You ever received from me, compared with the ſorrow which has overtaken your vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old age! Weep for your Son; but let it comfort you to recollect, that he always walked in the paths of honour-Honour has always guided him, and will guide him, to the laſt moment of his life.—And let not my unhappy fate, my dear Son, deter you from following my example. Let ſtrict integrity, and an invincible attachment to your Country, be the rules of your life, though your father's adherence to them has ſhortened his days. But let me conjure You never to engage in public affairs,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">It may perhaps be neceſſary to inform the Reader, that this reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man was one of the moſt able and intrepid oppoſers of the attempts, made by the Count de Vergennes, on the eſtabliſhed Conſtitution of Geneva; and was the Magiſtrate, who, as Attorney General, propoſed and carried the abolition of the form of Government, introduced by that arbitrary Miniſter.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Though one crime naturally leads to another; and though the experience of all Hiſtory ſhews, that the blood which has been already ſpilt, is, with the ſavage multitude, a reaſon for ſpilling more; yet ſome people hoped, that its fury was ſatiated, or at leaſt, that the <hi>Swiſs</hi> would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and prevent further horrors. But the bloody tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy had been acted with too much expedition, and too much fury to give them time to interfere, even if their interference could have been effectual. This however did not prevent the <hi>Bailiff</hi> (or Chief Magiſtrate) of that part of the territory of the Canton of <hi>Berne,</hi> which hes neareſt to <hi>Geneva,</hi> from writing a letter to one of the <hi>Syndics,</hi> to aſſure him that <hi>the whole Helvetic Union ſaw with horror, and deteſtation, the preparations that were

            </p>
            <p>The Syndic to whom the letter was addreſſed, took care not to communicate it to the People; and, in his anſwer to the <hi>Bailiff,</hi> excuſed himſelf, by aſſuring him, <hi>that it would have been dangerous to do ſo, as the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the majority had already, in one inſtance, been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled; and you will eaſily underſtand,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the delicate nature of our ſituation, and your heart is formed, to ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with us, when you recollect the dangers and difficulties to which the Conſtitutional Government is expoſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This anſwer, artful as it was, did not impoſe upon the ſagacious <hi>Swiſs.</hi> They ſaw clearly, that this pretended <hi>Conſtitutional Government,</hi> if it was not the author, was at leaſt an accomplice, in the enormities it affected to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn:<note n="*" place="bottom">What muſt thoſe <hi>Cantons</hi> think, when they hear, that one of the Syadies, who, as a Chief Magiſtrate of the Republic, had juſt before aſſured them, that the Revolution of 1792, <hi>was completed,</hi> and that there would be no repetition of it, was not aſhamed, in a letter written to a Correſpondent in London, to pride himſelf on having foreſeen the ſecond Revolution, <hi>of which,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>a man muſt have been blind not to ſee the abſolute neceſſity?</hi> In the Letter alluded to, he completely lays aſide the maſk; and though he admits, that <hi>the people had obtained all the liberty they could wiſh for,</hi> he goes on to remind his Correſpondent, <hi>that they were poor, and that the Rich had had their turn in the injoyment of opulence,</hi> &amp;c.</note> and while they generouſly afforded an hoſpitable aſylum to thoſe who had the good fortune to make their eſcape from its fury, they, at the ſame time, took advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the impreſſions of horror, which the tranſactions at <hi>Geneva</hi> had made upon the minds of their ſubjects, to publiſh the following Proclamation, which, as it gives a very correct, and at the ſame time, a very conciſe picture of the ſcenes I have attempted to deſcribe, is the only State Paper I ſhall give You the trouble of reading at length.</p>

                        <p>You cannot be ignorant of the melancholy events, which have lately taken place in <hi>Geneva.</hi> That Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033927_0019_0FF9FB79F5872FA0"/>in whoſe welfare, both as allies, and as neighbours, we have taken ſo long the ſtrongeſt, and moſt affectionate intereſt, is overwhelmed by calamities, perfectly new in their kind, and in extent, duration, and conſequences, beyond the eye of Man to trace.</p>
                        <p>At the very moment when We, and our Neighbours, the Canton of <hi>Zurich,</hi> were told in form by the new Government of <hi>Geneva,</hi> that the Revolution was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted; that peace and tranquillity would be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conſequence of the new Syſtem, and that all former differences were at an end; We learn that a band of lawleſs Men has attacked, and, by main force, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely overthrown, in that Republic, all public Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and all private ſecurity. Houſes have been forcibly entered, without lawful authority; the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of them, violently dragged out of them, arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratily detained, and illegally impriſoned. The Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion have been attacked in a City, which called itſelf one of the <hi>bulwarks of the Reformation,</hi> in a manner, that threatens Religion itſelf.—In the midſt of this general confuſion, ſome individuals have been put to death, againſt the wiſhes of a decided Majority of their Judges. Plots are laid againſt the lives, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the property of others, without regard to the ſanctity of oaths, or the eſtabliſhed forms and ſetled maxims of Law; and the Inhabitants in general are at the mercy of Uſurpers, who diſpoſe of the lives and fortunes of their Countrymen, with no other rule of conduct, than their own tyrannical caprice.</p>
                        <p>We ſee with the livelieſt ſorrow, the wretched ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a State, which has ever been an object of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to us, and from its local poſition, muſt ever engage the attention of the Helvetic Body. But our ſorrow is loſt in indignation, when We hear, that ſome of our own ſubjects have taken a part in tranſactions ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal. Our anxiety for the ſafety, and honour of our country, will not permit us to ſuffer ſuch men to return to, or remain in it. We therefore order, that ſuch of them as are not at preſent within our territories, do not preſume to enter them; and that thoſe who have engaged
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033927_0020_0FF9FB8F608AD368"/>in ſuch enormities, and are within our juriſdiction, be immediately apprehended, in order to receive the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment their crimes deſerve.</p>
                        <p>We have no doubt but that our Dear and Faithful Fellow-citizens will participate theſe ſentiments with us, and will exert themſelves, to give effect to this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Above all, We indulge a confident hope, that the ſight of the diſaſters which have overwhelmed <hi>Geneva</hi> will teach them to ſet a juſt value on thoſe impartial laws, which, with a mild and beneficent Religion, have ſo long ſecured to us the enjoyment of public peace, of private ſecurity, and of all the bleſſings which Almighty God ſo liberally beſtows on thoſe He loves, and which, We truſt, He will continue to ſhed on us, as He ſhed them on our forefathers, if, like them, We confide in his goodneſs, and endeavour to deſerve the continuance of it, by our obedience to his Laws, and our unſhaken love of our Country.</p>

            <p>This truly paternal admonition had the effect it deſerved, on that part of the territory of <hi>Berne,</hi> which lies the neareſt to us; for thoſe of the inhabitants, on whom the artifices which had ſucceeded ſo fatally in <hi>Geneva,</hi> had been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed with ſome degree of effect, have ſince candidly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the fate of the <hi>Geneveſe</hi> brought them back to a ſenſe of their intereſt, and duty.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, under pretence of <hi>Economy,</hi> but in truth, to conceal the extent of the horrors that had been, and ſtill were to be perpetrated; the <hi>Revolutionary Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> iſſued an order forbidding the uſe of mourning, for a year to come. This was ſoon followed by another, for lowering the intereſt of money, and for annulling all leaſes; by the laſt of which regulations, they not only relieved the lower claſſes, from the payment of rents, which, from the depreciated value of property, were become too high, but in fact levied a heavy fine upon thoſe people of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033927_0020_0FF9FB8F608AD368"/>whom they had hitherto had no pretence for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking.</p>
            <p>They alſo renewed their <hi>domiciliary viſits,</hi> leaving no more than twelve ounces of plate to any individual; and becauſe the <hi>French</hi> had conſiſcated the property of ſuch of their own Emigrants, as had borne arms againſt the new Republic, theſe faithful imitators ſummoned moſt of the <hi>Geneveſe</hi> who happened to be abſent, when the late tragic ſcenes were acted, to return immediately, under the ſame penalty, and ordered all perſons whoſe fortunes exceeded 800 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, to give in an account of them within a week, in order that they might be aſſeſſed in proportion to their property and to their patriotiſm: and, to crown the whole, they aſſigned ſeveral churches as places of meeting for the different Clubs; they reduced the uſual divine Service to a very ſmall number of Offices, and permitted the ceremony of Marriage, and the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of Baptiſm, to be performed by the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Revolutionary Tribunal</hi> having thus prepared the way for new enterpriſes, and made a ſatisfactory trial of the obedience of its ſubjects, by threatening all, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to expreſs the ſlighteſt diſapprobation of its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, with what it called a <hi>Revolutionary puniſhment,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the proceedings, which it had ſuſpended only until it could ſatisfy itſelf, whether the Nation was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently accuſtomed to the ſight of blood, to bear the further effuſion of it. After baniſhing ſome ſoldiers of the Garriſon, who had generouſly refuſed to act as execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners on the late occaſion, it ſelected four other victims; three of whom had been Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>One of them, named <hi>Naville Gallatin,</hi> was a man of great talents, and defended himſelf with ſuch eloquence and ſtrength of argument, that one of his Judges, in giving ſentence againſt him, ſaid,—<hi>I have two conſciences; one of which tells me You are innocent; but the other tells me, You muſt die, that the State may be ſaved.—When I die,</hi> anſwered the intrepid Magiſtrate, <hi>the State will loſe a great Citizen.</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:033927_0021_0FF9FBA0161FA2A0"/>The expreſſion is bold, but perfectly characteriſes his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and undaunted ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now,</hi> continued he, when ſentence of death was paſſed on him, <hi>now mark the fate which awaits You and Your accomplices; for You muſt not hope that guilt like yours, can go unpuniſhed. You will find that all the ties of Social Order, which you have broken to attain your ends, will again be broken by thoſe, who ſucceed You in your crimes, and in Your power: new factions will be formed againſt you, out of your own; and as You have united, like wild beaſts, in purſuing your prey, ſo, like wild beaſts, You will tear each other to pieces, in dividing it. Thus will you avenge the cauſe of thoſe, who have fallen, and are yet to fall ſacrifices, to your avarice and ambition. To them, as well as to me, the proſpect of approaching Immortalit, robs Death of all its terrors; but to You the laſt moments of life will be embittered by reflections, more poignant than any tortures You can inflict. The innocent blood you have ſhed will be heard againſt You, and You will die without daring to implore the pardon of Heaven.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſpeech he made to the Judges, when he was firſt brought before them, has been ſince publiſhed in <hi>Swizzerland.</hi> The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſage ſtrongly marks the character of this intrepid Magiſtrate. "And who are you," (addreſſing himſelf to the Tribunal) <q>who are You, who now preſume to ſit in judgement on me? I ſee none on that Bench, but Uſurpers.—After the deſtruction of the legal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy in 1792, You made new Laws, and erected new Authorities; both of which You have ſince ſuperſeded, and, in their ſtead, have eſtabliſhed a mercileſs Proſcription.... Will you dare to ſay, that you act under the Authority of the Sovereign People? If the People be your Sovereign, why have you not aſſembled it, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of party, or opinion? and why is this place filled with every object, that can influence the fears, and over-rule the conſciences, of thoſe who are to decide on our lives?</q>

I know that my death is already determined on; and you know that I am too decided a ſoe to injuſtice, to hope to eſcape the ſad, but honourable fate of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates You have murdered. But yet, to prove to all Europe, the atrocious injuſtice of your proceedings, I declare in the preſence of Almighty God, that, ever ſince the Revolution in 1792, I have lived in the cloſeſt retirement. Unable to reſtore the true laws of my Country, I ſubmitted to yours; and while I carefully nouriſhed in my boſom a ſpark of Liberty, which even your tyranny cannot extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, I conſented to wear your chains, and to ſtifle the murmurs, which the fight of ſucceſsful wickedneſs, excited in my boſom. To be relieved from that fight, in ſome degree, alleviates the miſery of leaving my Wife and my Children; who, whatever be their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fate, will never have reaſon to be aſhamed of my memory,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

So great was the reputation of this Magiſtrate, and ſo highly was he reverenced by the <hi>Revolutioniſts</hi> themſelves, that though they had given up their right to review the ſentences of the <hi>Revolutionary</hi> Tribunal, yet, on this occaſion, they ſhewed an earneſt wiſh to reſume it, in order to ſave his life; and they actually affembled for that purpoſe. But before they could take the neceſſary ſteps, the Tribunal had an intimation of their intention; and to diſappoint it, they promiſed, in the moſt ſolemn manner, that no execution ſhould take place that night. In breach, however of the promiſe, they contrived that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners ſhould come and demand him; and he, in the middle of the night, was ſhot, with the ex-ſyndic <hi>Fatio,</hi> on a remote part of the Ramparts.<note n="†" place="bottom">The two others, <hi>Andeoud</hi> and <hi>Delorme,</hi> were executed at nearly the ſame time; ſo that, in the whole, eleven perſons ſuffered on this occaſion, viz. <hi>Cayla, Prevoſt, De Rochement, De Combe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Many others would probably have ſuffered the ſame fate, but ſaved themſelves, by well-applied pecuniary ſacrifices<note n="‡" place="bottom">By this means, many individuals, who ſeemed the principal objects of the popular fury, eſcaped, while others, apparently much leſs obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, were ſacrificed. One of the Judges, who, <hi>for good reaſons,</hi> had ſuddenly become favourable to <hi>Bellami,</hi> one of the priſoners, againſt whom the Populace ſeemed particularly irritated, ſaid, <hi>If God had told me this morning, Thou wilt ſpare that Ariſtocrat, I ſhould have anſwered, God, thou lieft; and yet, conſidering the defence he has made, I find myſelf bound to acquit him.</hi> Another more ſevere, or leſs venal, concluded his opinion by ſaying, <hi>We are told that the Priſoner at the Bar has many private virtues; but ſo had Naville. I condemned him, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his virtues: I ſee no reaſon why this man ſhould be better treated.</hi> His ſentence was mitigated into conſiſcation and exile. Such is the extreme uncertainty neceſſarily attending upon every Revolution of this kind, that <hi>Naville,</hi> a few moments before he appeared in Court, took a very affectionate leave of <hi>Bellami,</hi> whoſe fate was generally expected to be more ſevere than his own, and promiſed to take care of his wife and children. <hi>Naville</hi> was executed, and <hi>Bellami</hi> eſcaped.</note>; and the power of the Tribunal having at

When language like this, is heard from ſuch men, on ſuch an occaſion; when to other crimes, is added the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical affection of conſcience and principle, what hope is there of remorſe? What expectation of a return to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and humanity? Alas! the unfortunate <hi>Geneveſe</hi> have no hope, no expectation, but that feeble one, that the fate of <hi>Roberſpierre</hi> may be a warning to his imitators, and that, ſince compunction cannot, fear may produce ſome mitigation of their cruelty.</p>
            <p>But however this may be, <hi>Geneva</hi> is no longer what it was, a very few months ago: it is a new city ſtanding on the ruins of the old one; inſtead of peace, ſecurity, induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, content, and all the hapineſs which attends the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of virtue, nothing is to be ſeen but pillage, murder, and all the crimes, and all the miſery, which the diſſolution of ſocial ties, lets it upon the human ſpecies. Such is the train of evils, which the adoption of the <hi>Jacobinical</hi> philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, has introduced into <hi>Geneva:</hi> what muſt the effects of that Syſtem be, upon other countries, when we ſee thoſe it has produced upon a nation, which, in the midſt of its former inteſtine commotions, conſtantly revered the rights of property, and ſhuddered at the ſight of blood!</p>
            <p>That a people ſo wiſe, ſo temperate, ſo much accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to Liberty, and ſo well acquainted with the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which the enjoyment of it too often occaſions, ſhould ſo ſuddenly have abandoned its native character and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a new one, cannot but be matter of ſurpriſe to every attentive reader, and certainly calls for ſome explanation. The limits of a letter do not permit me to go into a long detail, though the ſubject is worthy of the minuteſt inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. I ſhall therefore briefly ſtate, that I do not heſitate to impute the whole of that ſtrange depravation of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of my Countrymen, to the effect of a combination borrowed by them of the <hi>French,</hi> from whence <hi>La Fayette,</hi> too late, and in vain, predicted that anarchy and diſorder which has ſince ſo univerſally prevailed in every depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Country: I mean that combination, which, by gradually imparting power to thoſe who were not reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the uſe of it, at laſt left thoſe reſponſible for the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033927_0023_0FF9FBCCF68A3FF0"/>uſe of it, from whoſe hands it had been wreſted.—As the attention of your Countrymen will, no doubt, be much engaged in diſcuſſing the probable conſequences of the new <hi>ſelf-created popular ſocieties, or Clubs,</hi> and particularly the dangers reſulting from any <hi>aſſociation</hi> amongſt them, I ſhall be more particular in explaining my meaning.</p>
            <p>Cicero aſcribes the duration of the Republican form of Government in Rome, to the inſtitution of the office of <hi>Tribune;</hi> the very office which ſeems ſo often to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered the exiſtence of the Government, but which, though eſtabliſhed for the purpoſe of reſiſting the uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Senate, in its operation effectually reſtrained the extravagancies of the people, by making the Plebeian Magiſtrates reſponſible for them.—The hiſtory of Geneva abounds with illuſtrations of the truth of Cicero's obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. During the ſtruggle of Parties, which ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſtracted that little Republic, we conſtantly ſee that the rights of property and of perſons, were preſerved with religious care, and that the bleſſings of ſocial order, were equally the objects of reverence with both. This can be aſcribed to no other cauſe than the union of power and reſponſibility in thoſe who were appointed the Chiefs of both Parties, and remained ſo during the whole conteſt. Even the moderation which was obſerved for the firſt ſix months after the Revolution, or rather Uſurpation of 1792, is to be referred to no other cauſe. But from that period, when the inferior Demagogues, who were of too little conſequence to be members of either the Government or the Convention, began, in imitation of the Jacobins at Paris, to collect all their Democratical Clubs, and unite them into one great <hi>Central Club,</hi> under the direction of a weekly Preſident, the whole fabric of Government and of ſocial order was ſhaken to its baſe, becauſe the whole power of the State thereby fell into the hands of a capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mob, which either had no chiefs at all, or had ſuch as were not permanent, and conſequently not ſubject to the ſmalleſt degree of reſponſibility.</p>
            <p>The new Magiſtrates had undoubtedly no ſuſpicion of the ſhock, which the erection of this great <hi>Central Club,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:033927_0023_0FF9FBCCF68A3FF0"/>would finally give to their authority; nor were they ſenſible of it, until the General Aſſembly, which, under the old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Geneva, ſeldom met, and had merely a power of adopting or rejecting, by a ſimple affirmative or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the new Laws propoſed to it, was ſuperſeded by another Body partially conſtituted, daily aſſembled, and aſſuming the power of deliberating and propoſing new meaſures, as well as of cenſuring thoſe adopted by Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. The reſolves of this new Body ſoon became orders which the Government did not dare to diſobey, and for which nevertheleſs, it was ſtill conſidered as reſponſible, though the individuals at whoſe ſuggeſtions thoſe reſolves had been taken were never inquired after.—When the Magiſtrates diſcovered the inſignificancy to which they were thus reduced, they tried to reſtore themſelves to ſome ſhare of their former importance, by endeavouring to put themſelves at the head of the <hi>Central</hi> Club, which was now in fact the head of the Republic: But it was now too late; the chief power and influence of that Body was in a continual ſtate of fluctuation, and the public mind ſo entirely alienated and perverted, that they had no means of obtaining even a hearing, but by declaiming againſt the moderation of the Government, or of the Convention. From invectives of this ſort, they ſoon proceeded to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of the moſt extravagant nature; they openly circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated alarming reports of the machinations of the Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical party, and recommended alterations, which, they ſaid, would not fail to reſtore the Golden Age.</p>
            <p>The conſequences of thus intermixing the deſpotiſm of the rabble, with the dominion of the people, were ſuch as might naturally be expected: habits of indolence, the diſtreſs occaſioned by thoſe habits, a ſort of perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication of the public mind, and the moſt alarming inſtability both of political and moral principle.—Theſe miſchieſs were the more extenſive, as, for the firſt time in Geneva, young men under age procured an admiſſion into that Club, and after emancipating themſelves there from the reſtraints of paternal authority, (which might perhaps have ſupplied for ſome time the decline of public authority) acquired a decided ſuperiority over thoſe of a more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033927_0024_0FF9FBDC49CC8F68"/>age and more ſober judgment. Nay, ſo powerful was the delirium which then pervaded the public mind, that, ſince the inſtitution of Trial by Jury took place, not one of them dared to convict any member of the Club, of any infringement of the public peace, however flagrant and atrocious it might be, and however ſolicitous Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be for their puniſhment. It was the more impoſſible not to foreſee that the impunity attending leſſer crimes, would inevitably encourage the perpetration of greater ones, as on each of theſe acquittals, it was eaſy to obſerve the triumphs of the Central Club, which now gradually fell under the influence of a new ſet of leaders of deſperate fortunes, who only ſurpaſſed each other by the violence of their reſpective motions, and who were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether irreſponſible.</p>
            <p>Such was the degenerated ſtate of the Central Club, when <hi>Bouſquet</hi> was informed that it was ripe for the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and execution of his great and extenſive plans of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and revolution, the daring wickedneſs of which, was the circumſtance the moſt likely to enſure their ſucceſs. The manner in which the event juſtified his expectations, has been already related; and from the exact ſimilarity between his meaſures, reſulting from ſuch dangerous aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and thoſe of the Jacobins at Paris, as well as between the conſequences of each, is irrefutably proved, the wiſdom of that Axiom in Politics, that <hi>Liberty can only be ſecure where power and reſponſibility are united.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such have been for Geneva the conſequences of the violation of that ſalutary principle, that in one point only do we ſtill diſcover the true <hi>Geneveſe</hi> character; I mean in the jealous vigilance, with which both the oppreſſors and the oppreſſed, watch over their political independence, and have hitherto protected it from the treachery of France. Doubtleſs, the leaders of the Revolution find it more convenient to inſult, and plunder their defenceleſs Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen at home, than to be put in Requiſition, and draughted into the armies of the Ocean, the Rhine, and the Pyrenees: but plunder muſt have an end; and when the booty is ſpent, what will then remain for them, but to ſell their unhappy country to the higheſt bidder?</p>

            <p>THE Revolution of <hi>Geneva</hi> ſeems to take a milder turn, than might have been expected; owing, perhaps, to a change in the temper and diſpoſition of the <hi>French,</hi> who appear to be relaxing from their ſyſtem of ſeverity, or, more probably, to the return of the <hi>Geneveſe</hi> to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character. Whatever be the cauſe, it is certain, that the latter begin to feel ſome remorſe for what they have done; and openly avow their regret for having ſo long imitated, and (to ſay the truth) in every point but one, ſurpaſſed the former.</p>
            <p>In one point indeed, and in one point only, the <hi>French</hi> are ſtill without a rival; for out of no leſs than 508 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, on whom different ſentences were paſſed, on the late occaſion, there was but <hi>one</hi> Woman, who was condemned to be impriſoned for life, for having given aſſiſtance, and forwarded letters, to ſome <hi>French</hi> Emigrants; and it is more than probable, that even this ſentence was obtained by the influence and intrigues of the <hi>French</hi> Reſident. In every other reſpect, the <hi>Geneveſe</hi> have gone far beyond their model. One of the Judges, for inſtance, of the <hi>Revolutionary Tribunal,</hi> is ſaid to have left the bench, in order to aſſiſt in executing the unfortunate Magiſtrates, whom he had juſt condemned. In the ſame manner, thoſe who ſentenced the Syndic <hi>Cayla</hi> to death, had the audacity to reckon, among his crimes, the large ſums, which he had long been in the habit of diſtributing among the Poor, with a view (as was alledged) of corrupting them. His bounty was, indeed, improperly applied, ſince the very objects of it were thoſe, who clamoured the loudeſt for his death, and actually obtained it. They are now ſorry that they did ſo: their ſorrow, however, does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from remorſe only, but is the conſequence of an event,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033927_0025_0FF9FBEE85F87140"/>which they little expected, and for which they were wholly unprepared.</p>
            <p>You recollect, Sir, that the ſecond Revolution, which took place on the 18th of July, 1794, was, in a great meaſure, effected by the two Clubs of the <hi>Marſeilleſe</hi> and <hi>Mountaineers.</hi> Thoſe Clubs were compoſed of the very dregs of the populace, and conſequently, could only be tools in the hands of others. But no ſooner was the ſecond Revolution completely effected, than they who had conducted the former, adopted it, and with a view, either of ſecuring their own ſafety, or perhaps of ſharing the plunder, immediately endeavoured to put themſelves at the head of it.</p>
            <p>Of courſe, their firſt object was, to ſtrip the <hi>French</hi> Reſident of his influence. And in truth it was time to do ſo; for there was now no doubt, that the only object of that Miniſter, in forming the intereſt he had acquired among the Mountaineers, was to govern and guide them himſelf, and, by their means, ultimately to incorporate <hi>Geneva</hi> with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Coalition, however unexpected, was not brought about ſo expeditiouſly, as to eſcape the penetration of <hi>Soulavie;</hi> who no ſooner diſcovered it, than he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined immediately to haſten to the execution of his plan.</p>
            <p>At this critical moment, happened the fall, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately afterwards, the death of Roberſpierre, whoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was; an event which ſeemed completely to blaſt his hopes; for his rivals were inſtantly joined by all the Geneveſe, who ſtill wiſhed to preſerve the independence of their Country. The firſt conſequence of that event, was a formal complaint lodged againſt him, with the French Miniſtry, by the Syndics and Council.<note n="*" place="bottom">The very day after they heard of Roberſpierre's defeat, the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional Government wrote an anſwer to a very violent note, preſented by <hi>Soulavie,</hi> in which he expreſsly calls them <hi>the Enemies of France,</hi> and threatens them with no leſs, than <hi>arming the neighbouring Diſtricts</hi> againſt them. This anſwer contains a very ſpirited recapitulation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Soulavie,</hi> and is the more curious, as it is a ſtriking ſpecimen of the new Dyplomatic ſtyle, which the Revolutionary Syſtem has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.

We ſhall ſoon have an opportunity of ſtating them fully, to Thoſe who want neither power nor inclination to do us juſtice. We will confine ourſelves, at preſent, to ſome obſervations on your official Note, of the 13th of <hi>Thermidor,</hi> and on the ſpirit which ſeems to have dictated it. That Note exhibits, in our opinion, a ſatisfactory proof, with how little delicacy You chooſe the means of effecting your purpoſe. Some facts it has wholly ſuppreſſed; others it ſtates imperfectly; and by artfully miſrepreſenting the reſt, gives room to ſuſpect, that things of greater importance than thoſe it ſtates, are behind. Nor is this all: at the very inſtant, when all the Friends of Liberty and Equality in <hi>Geneva,</hi> are united to cruſh Ariſtocracy, You impute to us views of hoſtility towards <hi>France.</hi> But what Genevan can ſee any advantage, (unleſs he is a traitor to his Country) in <hi>exciting,</hi> in <hi>driving</hi> (as you term it) the neighbouring Diſtricts, to take arms againſt us? Give us leave to tell You, Sir, that it is your baſe and inſidious conduct alone, which will induce them to take ſuch a ſtep, or to form a bad opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of us? Was it for this purpoſe that You were ſent to us? The Nation You repreſent, has made Juſtice and Integrity, the Order of the day: but its Miniſter has wilfully and deliberately falſified the moſt important facts, in order to criminate us: The Nation You repreſent, wiſhes to fraterniſe with all other free Nations: but You, Sir, have abuſed the authority of your ſituation, to commit your Country, with the only Nation, which has adopted its principles. We know, however, that the Committee of Public Safety will not condemn a whole people unheard: to it, we ſhall addreſs our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and we know that we ſhall be heard; the important truths we ſhall diſcloſe, will have their effect. Your menaces do not terrify us: We even hear them with pleaſure, as they afford us a hope, that the intrigues and cabals You have been ſo long forming againſt us, will ſoon be at an end. This undiſguiſed declaration of our ſentiments, theſe bold truths, are the language of Freemen: If it offends You, the conduct which has occaſioned it, will juſtify it, and we ſhall ſtand acquitted by all who love ſincerity and truth. We therefore give You notice, Sir, that we ſhall tranſmit both your Note, and our Anſwer, to the Committee of Public Safety," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

Deſperate, however, as his ſituation was, he reſolved to make one more effort, to ſave himſelf, and he ſoon found the opportunity he wanted.</p>
            <p>

The daily allowance, which had been diſtributed for about three weeks, among the Clubs, and which had coſt the State 300 louis-d'ors a day, had been lately withdrawn, to the great diſſatisfaction of the Marſeilleſe and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineers, but particularly of the latter, who were thereby deprived of a reſource which, while it laſted, had made it unneceſſary for them to return to their former employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To reſume them now, was a meaſure they were not at all inclined to; and their ill-humour increaſed, as they began to feel the preſſure of diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>They complained of having been amuſed with the hope, that, as ſoon as the new diviſion of Property was made, every Patriot would have a comfortable ſubſiſtence. They ſaw with indignation, that their plunder was either waſted, or put out of their reach, as ſoon as it was collected; and as it was impoſſible either to ſell, or to let the ſplendid houſes, which had been confiſcated, both within the walls of the City, and in the neighbourhood, they inſiſted on having them divided, and diſtributed in ſhares. Far, alſo, from joining the majority of the Friends of the Revolution, in blaming the conduct and deſigns of the French Reſident, the Mountaineers flocked in great numbers to his houſe; ſupported him againſt the moſt popular Members of the <hi>Government;</hi> and inſiſted upon knowing the reaſons <hi>of the miſunderſtanding between him and them, which,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>was too prejudicial to the intereſts of the Republic, to be kept a ſecret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however they might regret, in private, that the Revolution had not had the effect of making <hi>Geneva,</hi> a part of the <hi>French</hi> Republic, they were not yet bold enough, openly to aſſign that as the reaſon of their diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. They made no ſcruple, however, of declaring loudly, that the vengeance of the nation was not yet ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and inſiſted, that the <hi>Revolutionary Tribunal</hi> ſhould reſume its functions, and bring to juſtice, between five and ſix hundred more perſons, who, they ſaid, had been hitherto ſpared, though clearly guilty, and in which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they at laſt expreſsly, and by name, included thoſe <hi>Revolutioniſts,</hi> who were known to be the moſt attached to the preſervation of the National independence, as well as
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033927_0027_0FF9FC166509FEA0"/>ſome, whom <hi>Soulavie</hi> pointed out to them, as his own <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal enemies,</hi> and who were, in fact, the principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Government, but whom he choſe to call by the name of Temporiſers and Moderates. Theſe laſt were particularly obnoxious to the Mountaineers, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred their moſt violent hatred, by conſtantly checking them, whenever, after the completion of the firſt Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that undiſciplined and ſavage mob wanted to horry on to a ſecond, before <hi>Bouſquet</hi> arrived to point out the proper time for beginning it.</p>
            <p>Theſe threats of perſonal danger rouſed the Members of the <hi>Conſtitutional Government,</hi> and induced them, though ſtill to a certain degree under ſuſpenſion, to reſume the authority they had affected to want on the 18th of July. The reſt of the <hi>Revolutionary Clubs</hi> were immediately called together, and in one of them, the feelings of the Members excited by a ſpeech, in which the maſk was ſo completely laid aſide, that it would be unpardonable not to lay ſome paſſages of it before you.</p>
            <p>"I maintain," ſaid the Revolutioniſt who delivered it, <q>that the ſcheme of erecting a new <hi>Revolutionary Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,</hi> can have originated only in an enemy to the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of our Country: nor can it meet with ſupport, but from the moſt deluded, or from thoſe who are too indolent to return to their former employments, and who know, that until the tranquillity of the State is reſtored, they muſt be continued in arms, and conſequently, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at the public expence. For what but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleteſt ignorance, or the moſt wicked malice, can ſuggeſt any apprehenſions now, from what was once the Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical party in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and which the loſs of its wealth, and the fall of Monarchy in <hi>France,</hi> have completely reduced to inſignificance, without power at home, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence abroad? &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>France has made Juſtice the Order of the day: yet in <hi>Geneva,</hi> which ſhould be a City of Brothers, there are men to be found, who ſtill thirſt for blood, and call for the eſtabliſhment of another <hi>Revolutionary Tribunal,</hi> with no limit to its authority, but its own capricious will. Is there no reaſon to fear, that the reſpectable Powers, on
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033927_0027_0FF9FC166509FEA0"/>whom we depend for our ſubſiſtence, and for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of our trade, and who have already ſo ſtrongly marked their diſapprobation of our conduct, will no longer ſuppreſs their indignation? And ſhould that be the caſe, is there no reaſon to fear that <hi>Geneva,</hi> the native Country of <hi>Rouſſeau,—Geneva,</hi> whoſe Citizens had, by their calm and temperate behaviour, even in the midſt of inteſtine diſcords, by the purity of their morals, by their piety, by the brilliancy of their talents, and the extent of their knowledge, obtained the eſteem and reſpect of all <hi>Europe,</hi>—that <hi>Geneva</hi> may loſe its independence, and no longer be permitted to call herſelf free? Let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reject a propoſal ſo dangerous,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This harangue was very much applauded, and when printed, revived the courage of all thoſe who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in effecting the firſt Revolution, as well as of thoſe who, though equally averſe to the firſt and ſecond, had, from motives of fear or prudence, ſubmitted to both. They immediately reſolved to arm themſelves, but to receive no pay; to revive the <hi>Revolutionary Tribunal,</hi> but at the ſame time, to direct its ſeverity, not againſt thoſe who were falſely called and treated as Ariſtocrates, but towards thoſe, who were endeavouring, under the maſk of Patriotiſm, to involve their Country in farther confuſion, and to give up its independence.</p>
            <p>Having, by theſe meaſures, obtained a decided ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, they ſtill proceeded with great caution, and were particularly careful not to alarm the Marſeilleſe, who were more numerous, and, if poſſible, more eager for blood than the Mountaineers; but at the ſame time, more under the controul of their Leaders, leſs in the habit of looking up to the <hi>French</hi> Reſident, and more attached to the idea of National independence. By this conduct, they detached them by degrees from their former Aſſociates, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineers; who, being thus abandoned, were ſurrounded, diſarmed, and thrown into priſon, without offering to make the ſlighteſt reſiſtance; though, when they clamoured for the death of the acquitted Magiſtrates, the very men, who now maſtered them ſo eaſily, affected to conſider them as invincible.</p>

               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:033927_0028_0FF9FC29D3F4D360"/>
The new Tribunal, which conſiſted of the ſame Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as before, was very careful, however, in the exerciſe of its authority, to ſpare ſuch of the Mountaineers, as had diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their zeal on the former occaſion; and endeavoured to divert the public indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them, by calling for accuſations againſt ſuch of the more wealthy Citizens, as had hitherto eſcaped, and were ſtill <hi>incorrigible Enemies</hi> of the Revolution. But the whole body of <hi>Revolutioniſts</hi> ſaw through the artifice, and on the 25th of Auguſt, being the very day after that, on which the Tribunal was erected, preſented the following addreſs to it.</p>

            <p>When the books and papers of the Mountaineers were ſeized, the plan of an Addreſs to the People, was found among them, the object of which was, to bring about a <hi>third</hi> Revolution. It eſpouſed the quarrel of the French Reſident, in the openeſt manner, and aſked in plain terms, <hi>how long the Enemies of the French Nation were to inſult it with impunity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This addreſs (which was evidently drawn up by <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavie</hi>)<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Among other paſſages, is the following very curious one:</hi> The good will of the Mountaineers towards France, expoſes them to all the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Enemies of that Nation, who impriſon them, calumniate them, oppreſs them by unjuſt proſecutions, and do all in their power to diſunite them, by dividing them into new Clubs, exactly in the ſame manner as <hi>PITT</hi> perſecutes the Oppoſition in England, for favouring the cauſe of France.</note> was directly calculated to put the <hi>Revolutioniſts</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:033927_0028_0FF9FC29D3F4D360"/>themſelves into confuſion, and force them to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the arms of France; though it affected to treat the imputation of any ſuch deſign, as a groſs and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous falſehood. It has been ſaid, that by means of a chemical proceſs, ſome of the names which had been ſigned to this paper and afterwards eraſed, were reſtored; and that, among others, was that of <hi>Soulavie.</hi> However this may have been, the confeſſions of ſuch of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineers, as were taken into cuſtody, left no doubt of the nature of that Miniſter's views and conduct.</p>
            <p>During theſe tranſactions, Mr. <hi>Reybaz,</hi> the Geneveſe Miniſter in <hi>France,</hi> a man of real merit, and very highly eſteemed in <hi>Paris,</hi> (whom no one ſuſpects of approving the conduct of his new Conſtituents, though all were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed that he continued to fill his ſituation under them) being perfectly appriſed of the ſcheme, that was formed againſt the independence of his Country, took advantage of the fall of <hi>Roberſpierre,</hi> to defeat it.—He not only prevailed upon thoſe, who ſucceeded <hi>Roberſpierre,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow the conduct of <hi>Soulavie,</hi> and to recall him with marks of diſpleaſure; but he alſo obtained from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, a new and ſolemn acknowledgement of the Independence of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and an allowance of the ſame honours to himſelf, as its repreſentative, as had lately been granted to the Miniſter of the <hi>United States of America.</hi> In his official correſpondence, he took particular care to let his Conſtituents know, that the account of the late Revolution, which they had intended, no doubt, for the peruſal of <hi>Roberſpierre,</hi> had reached his ſucceſſors, at the very moment, when they had determined to adopt a line of conduct, the very reverſe of his: that the principles on which they meant to act, were thoſe of Juſtice, Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Moderation; and that their intention was to ſhew themſelves, not more the foes of Ariſtocracy, than of Anarchy and Inſubordination.</p>

               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:033927_0029_0FF9FC427AB17B70"/>
The ſtate of affairs being thus ſo eſſentially altered, the <hi>Revolutionary Tribunal</hi> could no longer refuſe to proceed to the trial of the <hi>Mountaineers.</hi> And although no poſitive evidence was adduced, of a plot to deliver up the City into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> and though the individuals accuſed, made the moſt public and ſolemn declaration, that every ſtep, for which they were now called to anſwer, was taken by the inſtigation, and under the immediate direction, of the very men, who were then ſitting in judgment on them, yet four of that party received ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death. The Populace, who but ſix weeks before, had been the accomplices, and inſtruments of their crimes, heard the ſentence with tranſport; and the Criminals met their fate in a manner as daſtardly, as the behaviour of the Magiſtrates, whom they had murdered, was courageous and dignified. Thus has ſo ſmall a State as <hi>Geneva,</hi> already proved, at the expence of the very men, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly called the Revolution, <hi>an abortive one,</hi> the juſtneſs of the remark of a great Revolutionary Leader in France,<note n="*" place="bottom">Danton.</note> a few moments before he ſubmitted to the Guillotine.—<hi>Every Revolution,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>of the nature of ours, is like Saturn: it devours its own offspring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bouſquet,</hi> the real head of the <hi>Mountaineer</hi> party, is ſtill alive: but he lives in hourly apprehenſions of ſharing the fate of his accomplices. That <hi>Roberſpierre</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> who poſſeſſes all the vices, and none of the talents of his model, and who like him, ruled his country for a ſhort time, with unlimited ſway, has not been able to retain his uſurped Authority.—That he might have a plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, for no longer continuing a member of a Tribunal, whoſe cruelties he affected to condemn, he has, with equal dexterity and baſeneſs, contrived to withdraw his name from the number of thoſe who were to decide on the lives of their Countrymen, and to have it inſerted in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to which the taſk of confiſcating their property, was allotted: and now, equally dreading the vengeance of thoſe he has ruined, and the contempt of thoſe who ſhared his crimes, he is rapidly ſinking into his original
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033927_0029_0FF9FC427AB17B70"/>obſcurity, and already verifies the prediction of one of his Countrymen (Mr. <hi>Chauvet</hi>), who, in a Letter from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, of the 15th of Auguſt, told him, <hi>that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve only the ſhadow of authority, by ſubmitting to acts of the baſeſt compliance.</hi> "Thoſe who overturn the Laws," continued he, <q>are Tyrants to-day, only to be Slaves to-morrow; and are ſuffered to exiſt, amidſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their aſſociates, and the hatred of their rivals, only until they have ſatiated the avidity of the one, and prepared the way for the triumph of the other</q> The Letter ended with theſe prophetic words: <q>I do not ſay, that political Crimes have always led to the ruin of thoſe, who commit them; I do not ſay, that the popularity which is obtained by ſuch means, is as unſtable as it is contemptible: nor do I ſay, that a thouſand accidents may change that Order of things, which now ſeems ſo favourable to You. But I ſay, that the hour is at hand, when you will envy the fate of thoſe, who have fallen ſacrifices to the Revolution you have effected,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The puniſhment, which the inferior Agents of the late Revolution have already ſuffered, has encouraged the <hi>Geneveſe</hi> to hope, that the vengeance of Providence will ſoon overtake the principal Criminals, and afford the unhappy victims of their ambition, ſome alleviation of their miſery, and perhaps, an opportunity of eſcaping from a City which is become the harbour of every crime. Some, indeed, have already obtained, by means of money, a commutation of their ſentence of confinement to their own houſes, into perpetual exile. And who can wonder, that they ſhould conſider it as an indulgence, that can hardly be bought too dearly, to be baniſhed from a City, whoſe ſtreets are reeking with the blood of innocent and virtuous men; where the hopes of plunder are the only bonds of an union, which the diviſion of it muſt ſoon diſſolve; where the populace was encouraged to pillage, in order to be taken into pay; and was kept in pay, in order to pillage; where property is loſt to its owners, without enriching or ſatiating the robbers: a City, whoſe
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033927_0030_0FF9FC53CD53BA58"/>Inhabitants have ſuffered a handful of Foreigners<note n="*" place="bottom">I am ſenſible, this is but a weak Apology for the <hi>Geneveſe.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more true however, than that they received their firſt impulſe towards the late Revolution, from <hi>France;</hi> and that the greateſt part of the enormities perpetrated in the courſe of them, were committed by Foreigners, and particularly by <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who, in the firſt Revolution, had acquired the right of Citizenſhip in <hi>Geneva,</hi> which from its local ſituation with reſpect to <hi>France, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the refuge of all ſuch as, from various circumſtances, were obliged to abandon their own country.
<p>A deciſive proof that the ſecond Revolution was not the work of the <hi>Geneveſe,</hi> is, that the Authors of it, never ventured to aſſemble the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> and took the earlieſt opportunity of ſuſpending it, and transferring its functions to <hi>proviſional Committees</hi> compoſed of very few Members. Doubtleſs, the <hi>Geneveſe</hi> have been much to blame: yet, what other Country will venture to ſay, that had it been as weak, as unprotected, as <hi>Geneva</hi> was, as completely ſurrounded by the territory, and as much expoſed to the violence, and, when violence was laid aſide, to the intrigues and artifices of <hi>France,</hi> it would have eſcaped the cruel fate which Deſpotiſm, Injuſtice, and Perfidy, have brought upon that unfortunate State?</p>
               </note> to govern them, to inſult them, and even to infuſe a portion of their own ferocity into them; where the blackeſt crimes appear without diſguiſe, and the pure religion of the Country, with its venerable Miniſters, is delivered over to an inſolent and mercileſs perſecution; where thoſe who have already ſuffered, are perhaps leſs to be pitied than the ſurvivors, who live in dreadful expectation of following their fate; where ſoon, nothing will be ſeen, but the miſeries of the oppreſſed, and the tyranny of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; where the Rich are plundered, to feed the indolence, and inflame the avidity of the indigent; where Famine, Diſcord, Hatred, and Revenge, muſt ſoon appear, with all the horrors that uſually accompany them; where the ſacred name of Liberty has been for ever polluted, and where thoſe, who are moſt afflicted at the calamities, of which they have ſuffered themſelves to be made the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſee no means to eſcape, but by plunging into others, ſtill more diſaſtrous; and where, even if they were able, by an effort of virtuous Deſpair, to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the yoke that galls them, the troops of France which ſurround them, would aſſuredly avenge the cauſe of their Tyrants, and inflict upon them a puniſhment,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033927_0030_0FF9FC53CD53BA58"/>of which the World has already ſeen with horror an inſtance, in the fate of <hi>Lyons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, Sir, <hi>Geneva,</hi> that was once ſo diſtinguiſhed among the Cities of the Earth—<hi>Geneva,</hi> the ſeat of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of Morality, of Science, of Art and of Commerce, but above all, of Sacred Liberty—<hi>Geneva</hi> is irrecoverably loſt: peace, ſecurity, and happineſs, have for ever aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned her, and her miſeries can only terminate with thoſe of <hi>France.</hi> Happy, if like her wiſer Neighbours, the <hi>Swiſs,</hi> ſhe had remained a ſilent ſpectator of the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which have ſo long diſtracted that unfortunate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try! But, as ſhe has been ſeduced to imitate her conduct, ſhe muſt participate her fate. The fall of <hi>Roberſpierre</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> was immediately followed by the ruin of the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineers</hi> at <hi>Geneva;</hi> and every future ſtruggle of faction in the former of thoſe cities, will be equally felt in the latter. <hi>France</hi> is now her only Ally; and even the friendſhip of <hi>France</hi> would be loſt, if the citizens of <hi>Geneva,</hi> impelled by remorſe for what they have done, and remembering their former happineſs, ſhould make any efforts to recover that ſober freedom, thoſe wiſe and temperate Laws, which they have been ſacrificing, during the laſt two years, on the altars of Revolutionary Anarchy.</p>

            <p>THE appearance of moderation, which things ſeemed to wear at Geneva, when I laſt had the honour to addreſs You, was ſoon laid aſide; and we are now to ſee the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, in its genuine and original character, as a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of anarchy, devaſtation and plunder.</p>
            <p>You may recollect, that at the date of my laſt letter, the Mountaineers were completely humbled; <hi>Soulavie</hi> was recalled, and the Convention had made declarations, which, if ſincere, rendered all apprehenſions of danger from the French, groundleſs. Under circumſtances ſo favourable, the Revolutionary Tribunal thought it unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to wear the maſk any longer. It declared it to be unjuſt, that its ſeverity ſhould be exerciſed on deluded patriots only; and thought it high time to take the caſes of ſuch of the <hi>Enemies of Liberty and Equality,</hi> as had been lately ordered not to leave their own houſes, into conſideration.</p>
            <p>The number of perſons of that deſcription amounted to 343. They were principally of the claſs of Merchants, or, as the Revolutioniſts affected to call them, <hi>trading Ariſtocrats,</hi> and had attracted their notice, as being in their opinion, as rich, and more avaricious, than thoſe they had already attacked.</p>
            <p>It would ſeem, that for theſe two years paſt, the more virtuous and enlightened part of the <hi>Geneveſe</hi> have laboured under a ſort of infatuation, which by an ill-timed ſpirit of moderation and forbearance, have drawn upon them the very dangers, they moſt wiſhed to avoid. Theſe very men, for inſtance, whoſe turn of perſecution was now come, had been weak enough to believe, that the late military preparations were made with no other view than to provide for their ſafety, and the ſecurity of the National independence. They therefore had waited the event of the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:033927_0031_0FF9FC679F911DA0"/>conteſt with anxiety, and had continued their prayers for thoſe who were in the end ſucceſsful, until they were informed, by the victors themſelves, that they and their property were to be the fruits of the victory.</p>
            <p>Although the Tribunal had declared in its firſt Report that the <hi>Nation was at laſt ſufficiently avenged,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſecond, it aſſerted that the ſeverities which had been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on the former occaſion, had proved <hi>inſufficient to repreſs all the enemies of public happineſs</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The hypocritical impudence of this ſecond Report, which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed on the 6th of September, ſurpaſſes, if poſſible, that of the firſt. The terms of <hi>Libert, Juſtice, and Virtue,</hi> are uſed with the ſame ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous effrontery; and it concludes with the ſame exhortation to the <hi>Geneveſe,</hi> to be <hi>virtuous, to be induſtrious, and to keep it conſtantly in their remembrance, that the practice of domeſtic virtue is the beſt, the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of public; the only reward, which the Members of the Tribunal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> for all their labours.</hi>
                  <p>The members of this Tribunal were (as has been already obſerved) almoſt entirely taken from the lower Claſſes of the People, and were wholly unknown, before the late convulſions. On this account, the deſcription they give of their rivals, the Mountaineer leaders, is equally curious and inſtructive. "Every revolution," ſay they, <q>brings into notice, individuals, who, till then, were either unknown, or known only to their diſadvantage. To the former ſuch periods are uſeful, as they afford them an opportunity of emerging from obſcurity; to the latter, as they enable them to efface the remembrance of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate infamy, by the affectation of public virtues. <hi>Both are equally active, both equally influenced by their own ſelfiſh views; both conſider all means as allowable, which tend to the attainment of thoſe views; and under the maſk of patriotiſm, both turn the holy duty of inſurrections againſt the real intereſts of the inſurgents.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Twelve months ago, a popular Society was formed, called the Club of the <hi>Mountaineers,</hi> who undertook to act as <hi>ſentinels of liberty.</hi> Under this name, which, to the minds of Frenchmen, imported every thing reſpectable, they endeavoured to depoſe the popular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of <hi>Geneva,</hi> to deſtroy what the Revolution had raiſed, and to plunge their Country into that ſtate of confuſion, which was moſt favourable to the views of thoſe who had long been planning its ruin. One circumſtance alone protected theſe Conſpirators from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their crime deſerved. The houſe of the <hi>French</hi> Reſident was their place of rendezvous, and the ſcene of their ſecret and nocturnal cabals. That Miniſter, who was ſent hither for the purpoſe of preſerving harmony and friendſhip between the two Nations, took advantage of his ſituation to impoſe upon his Conſtituents, to injure us in their eſteem, to ſow diſſenſions among our patriots; in ſhort, to eſtabliſh Anarchy in <hi>Geneva..</hi>..It was impoſſible however, that ſuch conduct ſhould be permitted for any length of time. The reſpect to which he was entitled, while he bore a public character, was neceſſarily withdrawn, when he engaged in intrigues, in falſehoods, in calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. His behaviour could not long remain unknown; and it was impoſſible that the French Republic, which generouſly offers us <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will</hi> and <hi>fraternity,</hi> would ſuffer a Man who was guilty of ſuch crimes, to continue to repreſent her! and ſhe will undoubtedly puniſh him as he deſerves, for daring to expoſe his country, by his baſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious conduct, to the danger of ſeeing the Helvetic Body added to the number of its enemies.</q>
                  </p>
               </note>. It therefore
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033927_0032_0FF9FC79D530FCE0"/>recommmenced its operations, by committing the ſame enormities which it had accuſed the Mountaineers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to commit;<note n="*" place="bottom">A diſcovery has lately been made, which fixes a double charge of treachery on the Tribunal in their conduct towards the Mountaineers. One of the reaſons aſſigned for the condemnation of <hi>Wittel,</hi> their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal leader, was the prevention of freſh crimes, of which it was ſaid he had laid the plan. It is now ſaid, with great probability of truth, that <hi>Wittel,</hi> who was a man of much ſuperior talents to moſt of the other leaders of the Revolution, and had conſequently excited their jealouſy, had begun to feel the moſt pungent remorſe for what had been done, and to think of employing his influence to make amends for it, by alleviating ſome of the miſeries which the Revolution had occaſioned; it is even aſſerted, that in ſpeaking of the Syndic <hi>Cayla,</hi> of whom he openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his admiration, he was imprudent enough to ſay publicly to ſome of the Mountaineers, <hi>Friends, it will belong to us to revenge innocent blood.</hi> A premature diſcovery of ſuch intentions was the real cauſe of the ſentence pronounced againſt him.—Care indeed was taken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and execute, at the ſame time, ſome of the Mountaineers, whoſe other crimes had juſtly expoſed them to that fate, had it been pronounced by any other Tribunal: But it ſeems more than probable, that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences for which they were ſaid to ſuffer, were really meditated, not by them, but by the Marſeilleſe, in conjunction with the Tribunal who tried them, and by whom, after the fall of the Mountaineers, theſe violences were completely carried into execution.</note> and though the pretence, under which ſo many perſons were put into confinement, was to protect them, during the ſtruggle which was likely to enſue, yet it is now well known, that the real reaſon of that meaſure was to prevent their taking part in that ſtruggle, and to ſecure them and their property, as a reward of the victors; and it is more than probable, that the object of publiſhing the conciliatory ſpeech, (quoted p. 46) which ſo vehemently inveighs againſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeverities, was to divert their attention from the new dangers, that hung over their heads.</p>

In this third ſcene of the Tragedy, however, no lives were loſt, though ſix pretended Ariſtocrats were ſentenced to death; but being abſent, they did not ſuffer: eighteen were baniſhed for life, and the reſt either confined, or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their political rights,</hi> for periods of different lengths.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſecond Report of the Tribunal, gives the following ſtatement.

               </note> The reaſon of the latter part of their ſentence is obvious. The ſuffrages are given in the Aſſembly of the People, not openly, but by ballot; and as the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal is perfectly aware of the real ſentiments of the greater part of the Members of that Aſſembly, it takes great care not to call it together, until it has excluded from it, the greater part of thoſe, of whoſe integrity it is afraid.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The Tribunal took no pains to conceal their reaſon.</hi> This meaſure, <hi>ſay they in their Report,</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary under our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and may be uſeful in future. To ſay the truth, the object of the Revolution, is gradually to introduce Regenerating Laws; and in order to ſecure that object, it is indiſpenſably neceſſary that they, who have on all occaſions ſhewn themſelves Enemies of the People, ſhould, on this, be deprived of their right of ſuffrage; and our Fellow-citizens will eaſily ſee the juſtice, as well as propriety, of extending that precaution to thoſe, who were tried by the firſt Tribunal.
<p>
                     <hi>This retroſpective meaſure will of courſe affect near a thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. It is an inconſiſtency almoſt too groſs for belief, that a Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, whoſe profeſſed object was to eſtabliſh the right of</hi> Univerſal Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, <hi>has already deprived of that privilege, nearly one half of thoſe, who formerly enjoyed it.</hi>

In the mean time, the powers of the General Aſſembly are intruſted to twenty-three Clubs, or Revolutionary Sections, in which, the Members give their votes <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> and in which none dare open their lips but thoſe, to whom a ſtate of tranquillity is a ſtate of violence; and whoſe audacity increaſes with the timidity, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe twenty-three deliberative Republics, as they may be called, meet twice a day, and ſometimes collectively, ſometimes ſeparately, form reſolutions the moſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent and contradictory: ſometimes, they permit the workmen, who are under ſentence of confinement to their own houſes, to go to their ſhops three times a day; and immediately after they retract this permiſſion. Sometimes they ſeem determined to ſap the very foundation of the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>by revolutionizing</hi> the principles of the riſing generation; but when they obſerve, that not a ſingle perſon of thoſe engaged in the public education of youth, has adopted, or will adopt their ſyſtem, they purpoſe to put them all into a <hi>proviſional ſtate of requiſition,</hi> until they can ſupply their places, or do without them; for they already begin to clamour againſt the Arts and Sciences, as <hi>branches of Ariſtocracy.</hi> Sometimes, they openly avow their intention to unpeople their Country, and, in purſuance of that plan, permit all who wiſh to leave it, to retire with their effects; but the next day, they are alarmed at the number of Emigrants, and the quantity of property they take with them, and prohibit the departure or removal of either.</p>

The queſtion, which has hitherto moſt embarraſſed the Revolutioniſts, is to determine, whether they ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the adminiſtration of affairs in the hands of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary Tribunal, or reſtore it to the Conſtitutional Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which, though ſuſpended, is not diſſolved, nor without hopes of being able to reſume its authority. For the preſent, it is agreed, that the Tribunal ſhall remain another month in office, under the title of <hi>National Liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory Commiſſion;</hi> with expreſs orders to collect all the confiſcated property, and apply it to the ſupport of Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments <hi>for the encouragement of induſtry, the prevention of poverty, and the promotion of general happineſs,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Beſides this, I am informed, that the new Commiſſion has it in contemplation to lay ſuch taxes, as, eventually, will tend to equalize all private fortunes, and reſtore <hi>the Golden Age,</hi> which, the People is told, will be the <hi>beginning of the reign of Equality, and the completion of the Revolution.</hi>
               </note> which, notwithſtanding ſuch effectual means to introduce it, is ſtill, to the great aſtoniſhment of the lower claſſes of the People, as diſtant as ever.</p>
            <p>But though the minds of the public are thus buoyed up with hopes of future happineſs, they are not the leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to preſent remorſe and anxiety. It is not in the power of their Leaders to conceal from them, that they are conſidered as a worthleſs and degenerate People, by every part of Europe. Holland, the ancient Ally of Geneva, looks upon the preſent Magiſtrates, as a ſet of Banditti, and in order to preſerve the property of thoſe, who are trembling under their tyranny, has put it into ſequeſtration. Some of the principal trading Towns of Germany have prohibited all commercial intercourſe with them. The Swiſs have placed guards along their frontiers, to prevent the entrance of all perſons concerned in the Revolution, or who were in arms while it was carrying on; and refuſe them admittance with as much care, as if they were infected with the plague.<note n="†" place="bottom">Since the date of this letter, I have heard that the ſeverity of theſe meaſures had been conſiderably relaxed; but they clearly ſhew what the Powers who adopted them, think of the Revolution.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But though theſe are facts too notorious to be concealed, the preſent Government endeavours to perſuade the deluded
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:033927_0034_0FF9CD1C893CA3A8"/>People, that, however they are abhorred by their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate neighbours and connexions, they are not without friends and admirers, at a diſtance. For this purpoſe, on the firſt of laſt month, they gave orders for a Civic Feaſt, in which, in alluſion to the compliment lately paid them by the <hi>French,</hi> and to ſhew themſelves not unworthy of a compariſon with the great Republic of the new World, they pompouſly diſplayed the <hi>American</hi> flag, and with great effrontery placed it next to their own. It was eaſy indeed, to ſee ſhame and remorſe, painted on the countenance of every perſon preſent at the ceremony. But what are we to think of a People, which retains no quality of virtue, but the conſciouſneſs of guilt, nor any mark of courage, but the obſtinacy of perſeverance?</p>
            <p>There is now hardly one <hi>Genevan</hi> of property, or educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who has not ſeverely felt the effects of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In fact, if to the former 508 victims, we add the laſt 343, we ſhall find, that it has ſwept away nearly one half of thoſe who compoſed the General aſſembly, before the late introduction of about 1000 Natives, and nearly the ſame number of Foreigners.</p>
            <p>To complete the ſhocking picture, the <hi>French</hi> ſoldiers themſelves, who were in ſome degree the inſtruments of the Revolution, could not refrain from tears, at the bare recital of ſome of the ſcenes, which took place in the courſe of it.

            <p>We have now a complete diſtinct view, of every part of the inundation which has overwhelmed the unfortunate <hi>Geneva.</hi> Beginning with the ſlight, and apparently unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant alteration made in the Conſtitution, by the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the right of <hi>Univerſal Suffrage,</hi> in 1792, we may trace it through all the ſtages of gradually increaſing violence, till it attained its full height of fury and devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in 1794, and had completely ſwept away every rule of ſocial order, and every veſtige of ſocial happineſs.</p>
            <p>The firſt intimation we had of its approach, was the adoption of the modeſt and benevolent term of <hi>Citizen,</hi> which the Authors of our ruin uſed in their intercourſe with each other, and under colour of which, they ſucceeded in eſtabliſhing an equality of political rights: but the pupils of the Jacobins, ſoon ſhewed themſelves worthy of their maſters, and, from the <hi>equalization of rights,</hi> proceeded with ſyſtematic regularity, through all the intermediate ſtages of plunder, proſcription, and murder, to their great object, the <hi>Equalization of property.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">It is worthy of remark, that in the language, and familiar idiom of the European Nation, which is moſt diſtinguiſhed in modern times, for the vigilance with which it watches over its political rights, the terms of <hi>Liberty and Property</hi> are, on almoſt all occaſions, found united. In truth, it muſt be obvious to every obſerver, that the <hi>Jacobinical</hi> Leaders and Teachers of this, as well as of former ages, have never been able completely to attach the lower claſſes of Society to their cauſe, till they have held out <hi>a more equal diſtribution of property,</hi> as one of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate objects, and neceſſary conſequences, of their plan.—Unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the ſtructure of that vaſt and complicated fabric, of which they are, in fact, the moſt important part, though treated in the forms of language, as the moſt inconſiderable, thoſe claſſes liſten with very little intereſt, to refined metaphyſical diſcuſſions of <hi>abſtract Right,</hi> and are hardly thankful for any addition to their political importance, which does not, in ſome form or other, tend to the acquiſition or increaſe of property, and conſequently of thoſe enjoyments, which in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the greater part of them, are the only purpoſes, for which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty can rationally be collected. But when they are told, that under the new Syſtem, the ſuperfluities, now waſted by the unfeeling extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of the Rich, <hi>will be reſtored to the Poor,</hi> and applied, with ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fidelity, to their relief and ſupport; that thoſe who are now obliged to earn their daily ſubſiſtence by their daily toil, will, under the auſpicious influence of that Syſtem, be enabled to live in comfort, with little exertion of their own, they greedily catch at the bait; each of them is bribed by his own ſelfiſhneſs, and they throw their whole weight into the ſcale of thoſe, whoſe language is ſo alluring to their avidity, and ſo conſoling to their diſtreſſes.
<p>Their Seducers, however, are careful to conceal from them the extent, to which they mean to apply their doctrines. They are careful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from them, that, by a law anterior to all human inſtitutions, the natural ſtate of the human race, is a ſtate of labour: that property is nothing but the fruit of that labour: that to ſecure to each individual, the enjoyment of that fruit, it is eſſentially neceſſary, that, by the fundamental Laws of every human community, <hi>Property be abſolutely inviolable;</hi> that thoſe Laws are perfect, and the Community which lives under them, free and happy, in proportion only as Property is ſecured from the lawleſs attack of the Freebooter on the one hand, or the capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious rapacity of Deſpotiſm on the other; that the inviolability of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is the great incitement to Induſtry, as the different degrees of Induſtry, are, originally, the ſole cauſes of the unequal diſtribution of Property; that this inequality of diſtribution is both cauſe and effect; and as it owes its being to Property, ſo, in its turn, it gives birth to ten thouſand new modes of employment, by which new Property is created, and new induſtry excited, until by an apparently infinite ſeries of reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal action and mutual reproduction, the great Syſtem of Social Life, with all its harmonious relations and beautiful dependencies, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely formed; that conſequently, to attack the unequal diſtribution, is to attack the inviolability of Property; it is to unravel the web, and ſend us back to the times of the Freebooter and the Deſpot, when Men are few, becauſe Induſtry is unrewarded, and are miſerable, becauſe Property is unſafe.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch are neceſſarily the <hi>ultimate conſequences</hi> of their principles, the Jacobins of every age know perfectly well; but in no inſtance, has it been their object to puſh their principles to their <hi>ultimate conſequences;</hi> ſuch a ſlight and temporary ſuſpenſion of the laws of Society, ſuch a partial <hi>diſorganization,</hi> (to uſe the jargon of the modern School) as will put them into the ſeats of thoſe in whoſe hands power or property are now lodged, is all they wiſh for, or aim at: more would defeat their purpoſe; and he muſt be, not only a negligent reader of Hiſtory, but an inattentive obſerver of what paſſes in our own times; and in our own neighbourhood, who does not know, that thoſe who raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to greatneſs by violating the great principles of Social Order, are as anxious, when they feel themſelves firm in their ſeats, to reſtore and maintain thoſe principles, and puniſh every imitation of their own conduct, or application of their own doctrines, as ſeverely, as if they were the legitimate poſſeſſors of the ſituations they have uſurped.</p>
                  <p>In truth, no Revolution, effected upon <hi>Jacobinical</hi> principles, has ever had, or ever can have, any other effect, than that of transferring property and power into new hands, at the expence of juſtice, humanity, private happineſs, and public tranquillity. On all ſuch occaſions, the great Maſs of the People, whoſe intereſt is the pretext, as its credulity is the inſtrument of the Revolution, has ever found, and ever will find, that <q>
                        <hi>the holy duty of Inſurrection</hi> (to uſe the words of the Genevan Tribunal) <hi>is turned againſt the Inſurgents:</hi>

In Geneva, where the people of property have all been either plundered or driven away, the induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious poor already compare their ſituation to that of a Town on the Banks of a River, the inhabitants of which have, in a fit of madneſs, turned the ſtream into another bed.</p>

It is extremely probable, that the Leaders of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution were not, at firſt, aware of the conſequences of what they were doing in 1792, or of the dangers to which the introduction of the French doctrines expoſed them; and that, if it had been poſſible at that time to ſhew them the ſeries of horrors, and crimes, into which they would be progreſſively led, they would have ſhuddered at the thought of what it is now their boaſt to have effected. But however this may be, it is at leaſt certain, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy was at that period only in the bud; and it is eaſy
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:033927_0035_0FF9FCAA44979150"/>to conceive, that under a Government ſo feeble as ours then was, it would have been difficult to eſtabliſh the exiſtence of it, by ſuch evidence, as a Court of Juſtice requires. Not that this difficulty would, under any other circumſtances than thoſe, under which the old Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then ſtood, have juſtified it in not making the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; but the Reader will recollect, that we were then entirely ſurrounded by the territory of France, that her troops were at our gates, and waited only for ſuch an opportunity as that meaſure would have afforded, to enter them, and violently annex our Republic to their own.</p>

It is diſtreſſing to humanity to reflect, that a fate ſo melancholy ſhould have been reſerved for a city ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed as Geneva was, for the generous and benevolent ſpirit of its inhabitants, and the alacrity with which thoſe in eaſy circumſtances always ſtepped forward to relieve the wants, and alleviate the diſtreſſes of their fellow-citizens; where, in ſhort, the Syndic <hi>Cayla</hi> was not the only perſon, who devoted a large proportion of his income to the poor, and, in the adminiſtration of it, conſidered himſelf as only their Steward. Nor was the manner in which this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent ſpirit diſtributed its bounty, leſs amiable than the ſpirit itſelf. Pains were taken to anticipate the calls of Poverty, and its diſtreſſes were relieved, with the moſt attentive delicacy. It is a certain fact, that the Annual Fund, which was voluntarily provided at Geneva for the relief of the Poor, including public and private ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, endowments, and donations of every kind, was ſeldom leſs, and not unfrequently, more than the whole revenue of the State; and that nearly a fifth part of the population of the Republic, was ſupported by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of the reſt;—of thoſe, in ſhort, who have ſince fallen ſacrifices to the blind and brutal fury of the objects of their bounty.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the midſt of the confuſion and diſtreſs, which the late Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion occaſioned, the native benevolence of the Ceneveſe character was ſtill conſpicuous. A ſubſcription being opened for the relief of the poor, thoſe who had been already ſtripped of a conſiderable part of their property, contributed to it a portion of what they had ſaved, from pillage or confiſcation; and the ſubſcription amounted to ſeveral thouſand louis-d'ors, in a very ſew days.</note> Beſides this, there was nothing in Geneva upon which the ſpirit of reform could operate; there was no rich and indolent Clergy to be plundered, no deep-rooted abuſes to be removed, no feudal tenures to be aboliſhed, no Baſtille to be deſtroyed, no proud Nobility to be humbled: the wealthieſt and moſt ancient families had no ſuperiority of rank over the neweſt or pooreſt; the diſtinction of <hi>Patrician</hi> and <hi>Plebeian</hi> was unknown, and, by our fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, <hi>no Genevan could claim any pre-eminence over his fellow-citizens, except what he might derive from a temporary elevation to office by their free choice.</hi>

With reſpect to the application of the public Revenue; the ſcrupulous economy of the Magiſtrates who managed it, if inferior to any thing, was only inferior to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs, of which there needs no other proof, than the firſt ſtep taken by their ſucceſſors, was to double, and, in ſome inſtances, to treble the ſalaries of their offices; ſo that the ſalaries of the Councils and Magiſtrates, which had hitherto amounted to about 7000 Crowns only, were ſuddenly raiſed to 50000, that is to ſay, to a moiety of the whole annual revenue of the Republic: And yet theſe ſalaries, thus doubled and trebled, were inſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their extravagance, or ſatiate their rapacity.<note n="†" place="bottom">During the whole courſe of the Revolution, the chiefs were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly giving, and receiving entertainments, of the moſt expenſive kind, which were paid for out of the public purſe, and uſually ended in the groſſeſt, and moſt diſguſting debauchery; while the ſubalterns quartered themſelves upon the more opulent Citizens, whoſe cellars, as well as every other part of their houſes, they uſed at their diſcretion.</note> They have even confeſſed, that, in the courſe of the firſt ſeven weeks, they diſburſed, that is to ſay, they diſſipated, 17,000 louis-d'ors, and, conſequently, that out of 37,000 louis-d'ors, which, they ſay, was the ſhare of the public in the ſpecie, goods, and plate, which had been confiſcated, there are now only 20,000 remaining in the Revolutionary Treaſury; though the whole 37,000 is a ſum, very far ſhort of what that ſhare ought to have been. †</p>

            <p>It cannot fail, therefore, to engage the attention of every man, who, like You, Sir, views with a philoſophical eye, the wonderful changes with which the Revolutionary ſpirit threatens the Chriſtian world, and in order to diſcover, if<note n="*" place="bottom">The Accounts were publiſhed on the 10th of September; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain articles which are almoſt incredible.

            <p>Among the many ſalutary truths, which may be collected from the Revolution, of which I have given an imperfect, but, I hope, not an unintereſting ſketch, the following appear to me to be entitled to the ſerious conſideration of your Countrymen.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a ſingle Revolution, if conducted with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and not carried too far, may ſometimes prove the foundation of Liberty; but that a ſecond, and all ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Revolutions, are the certain bane and deſtruction of it; for the inevitable conſequence of all ſuch events, is to make the people indifferent to liberty; and indifference, we know, is ſoon ſucceeded by diſguſt, as diſguſt is eaſily increaſed into averſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That however a Nation may be accuſtomed to civil commotions, a Revolution, in the modern ſenſe of the term, is certainly the greateſt evil that can befall it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the firſt Authors of every ſuch Revolution, are uniformly the ſecond victims to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the moral character of the moſt virtuous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, affords no ſecurity whatever, that Revolutionary Doctrines, if ſuffered to be propagated in it, will have a leſs pernicious influence upon its manners, than upon thoſe of any other Nation. It is impoſſible that thoſe doctrines can take root in any ſuch Nation, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a complete, and radical change in its character. It is barely two months ſince the Geneveſe deſervedly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the reputation of a brave and humane People. One ſingle night of Revolution, by putting the arms which had been wreſted from the people of property, into the hands of thoſe who poſſeſſed nothing, inſtantly changed the former into daſtardly cowards, and the latter into ferocious beaſts of prey.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:033927_0037_0FF9CD37E8D8C1B0"/>
5. That wherever a Revolution upon French Principles makes its appearance, it will infallibly begin, at the very point at which the French ended; viz. by making <hi>terror the order of the day,</hi> by deſtroying religion, and the order of Society; and by expoſing property to promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous pillage, and the owners of it to proſcription and deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the fate of the civilized part of the World, and indeed, of human nature itſelf, depends, at this critical moment, upon the conduct of the People of Property. They cannot now be ignorant of their danger; and they may be aſſured, that timidity and diſunion are more ruinous to their cauſe than any exertions of their Enemies, and that the moment they ſuffer their reſolution to be ſhaken, their ruin is inevitable.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the new Revolutionary Doctrines are more deſtructive in free States than elſewhere; becauſe free States have nothing to add to Liberty but the abuſe of it, and conſequently, nothing to adopt from ſuch doctrines, but the exceſſes to which they lead.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That it is plain from the example of Geneva, that free States are the moſt expoſed to the introduction of thoſe principles; becauſe it is in free States only, that the forms of Government, give an opportunity of turning liberty into licentiouſneſs, and licentiouſneſs into crimes of the deepeſt dye.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That every Nation which has the happineſs to enjoy a temperate and well-regulated Liberty, may be aſſured, that the only means to preſerve it, is to riſe in a maſs, and repreſs the firſt attempt to abuſe it, with as much vigour as they would oppoſe the firſt encroachments of Power.</p>
            <p>With theſe reflexions I ſhall cloſe this melancholy narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and I am ſure, Sir, it is unneceſſary for me to deſcribe to You, the feelings that riſe in the boſom of a Genevan, who once fondly loved his country, when he feels himſelf bound by his duty as an Hiſtorian, and by the ſacred regard he owes to truth, to hold up the conduct of that country, and the calamities that have followed from it, as a
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033927_0038_0FF9FCE8A3C800F0"/>warning to the reſt of mankind. That duty I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged to the beſt of my power, and my painful taſk is over. The Revolution is now complete; it has already aſſumed the general hue of all ſuch events; and the hiſtory of Geneva will hereafter be the hiſtory of the great Planet to which ſhe is become a ſatellite. Her boaſted independence is now an empty ſound; and her ſons have nothing left, but to lament her fate in ſilence.</p>

            <p>BY the laſt accounts from Geneva, it appears, that ſince the fall of the Mountaineers and their pation <hi>Soulavic,</hi> all fears of an invaſion from France are laid aſide: that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion entered on the 7th of laſt September into a new ſolemn engagement, to take no ſtep that ſhall, in the ſmalleſt degree, affect the independence of its neighbour. For this engagement, however, we are not ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to any new principle of Juſtice operating on the minds of the French, as to their perſuaſion, that Geneva is in reality, though not in name, their own; and that their tools, the Revolutioniſts, have gone ſuch lengths, and committed themſelves ſo completely, as to be a much better garriſon for them, than any number of their own troops could be.</p>
            <p>The tyrants of that unfortunate city have therefore ſheathed the ſword, and now turn their whole attention to the proſecution of the ſyſtem of quiet plunder, which their ſucceſs has enabled them to eſtabliſh. For this purpoſe, and either to introduce the equalizing principle more effectually, or perhaps to ſhew the world, how far they can go beyond their maſters, they paſſed a Decree on the 28th of September, by which they laid the ſame enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly unjuſt tax, upon the Capital of every man's fortune, which the French financiers had been ſatisfied with levying upon one <hi>annual income</hi> only.</p>
            <p>With this view, after dividing all the people of property into three Claſſes, which they diſtinguiſhed by the names of <hi>Ariſtocrates, Indifferents,</hi> and <hi>Patriots,</hi> they applied to each of thoſe claſſes, a ſcale of Aſſeſſment, proceeding in geometrical progreſſion, by means of which each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:033927_0039_0FF9CC334339A730"/>was rated, not according to the value of his Eſtate, but alſo according to an arbitrary eſtimate of his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical opinions.—With reſpect to the firſt Claſs, the Aſſeſſment is made on all fortunes amounting to £. 300 ſterling or upwards, and increaſes as they increaſe, till it reaches 40 per cent. on the Capital. Upon the Eſtates of the Indifferents, it begins at £. 300, but does not extend to more than 30 per cent. on the Capital.—The Eſtates of the Patriots are wholly exempted under the value of £. 300 ſterling, and are liable only to the amount of £. 25 per cent. on capitals above that ſum.</p>
            <p>The projectors of this extraordinary meaſure, have not failed to repreſent it as ſuggeſted by neceſſity, and from its ſeverity, not likely to be repeated. But it is affirmed that they have already in ſeveral inſtances violated their own rule; and even though they ſhould adhere to it more ſtrictly in future, it is eaſy to ſee that under this ſpecies of Agrarian Law, (the only one which a State poſſeſſed of ſo ſmall a territory could adopt) the ruin of every Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van in eaſy circumſtances is inevitable; and if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, every incitement to induſtry and honeſt exertion, muſt be removed; though the authors of it are not aſhamed to aſſert, that in order to realize the good effects of it, it is abſolutely neceſſary to ſupport it by a general diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>induſtry. In a Republic,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that is well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, or deſires to be ſo, indolence is a crime againſt the State, and is not too ſeverely puniſhed by infamy and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the conſequence of the meaſure has been to reduce the little property that was left in land or houſes, to half its value. The unhappy Proprietors pay what is demanded of them, without oppoſition or remonſtrance, and are glad to purchaſe with what remains, leave to quit the abode of ſuch jealous and rapacious Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.<note n="*" place="bottom">One Gentleman was taxed to the amount of £, 16,000 ſterling: among others Mr. <hi>J. Tronchin,</hi> though poſſeſſed of a landed eſtate of the value of upwards of £. 20,000 ſterling, rather choſe to abandon it, than to be plundered of his ready money, and by ſtaying, hold his other property expoſed to ſubſequent depredations. It is confidently ſaid, that the Aſſeſſment has produced about £. 600,000 ſterling, amounting to nearly a third of the whole property in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and levied in a Town, the greater part of whoſe inhabitants had already loſt four-fifths of their fortunes, by the depreciation of the aſſignats, in which the French pay the intereſt of their public debt, to thoſe of their foreign creditors, whoſe payments they have not ſuſpended.</note>

On one account indeed, this increaſing depopulation is deſirable; but on another it is to be regretted, as it coincides with, and is indeed a part of, the plan of the Leaders of the Revolution, who rejoice at it, and conſider it as the only means of confirming their triumph, and making their ſyſtem permanent. <hi>Ubi ſolitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.</hi>—</p>

                  <p>After ſhewing from ancient Hiſtory, and even from the hiſtory of <hi>Geneva,</hi> that baniſhment for political offences has, at all times, been highly injurious to the State that adopted it, "It remains," ſays the author, <q>for me to give my opinion on the propriety of recalling thoſe, whom we have driven into exile, and which I ſhall do with all the freedom of a known friend of Liberty and Equality. In my opinion, juſtice, prudence, and humanity, unite in favour of the meaſure. The ſtate of the Arts among us, our Trade, our Manufactures loudly call for it. Nothing elſe can put a period to our miſery. There is not now a ſingle perſon in <hi>Geneva,</hi> who can look with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tears at the long liſt of Citizens, whom the frenzy of the moment has forced to take ſhelter in foreign Countries. What crime had they been guilty of? They had, ſay You, formed a deſign to overturn the very Conſtitution, which they had lately accepted: But what proof is there of any ſuch deſign? None. Not a tittle of any was ſuggeſted, in the examinations which ſome of them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went. This pretended plot therefore, has vaniſhed like that of 1770. The diſcovery of it was announced with boldneſs, and held out to the public with confident aſſurance: But in vain does a candid and impartial Man endeavour to purſue the traces of it; they elude the ſearch even of thoſe whoſe buſineſs it was to detect and expoſe them. It was fortunate for the Tribunal, that, as they ſay themſelves, They <hi>followed no general rules, and were guided by no legal principles.</hi> This acknowledgement is perfectly new in the annals of juſtice, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders every other defence of their conduct ſuperfluous.—It is alſo ſaid, that the baniſhed Citizens were attached to Ariſtocracy; but Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy no longer exiſts, and if it did, opinions are not cognizable by human Tribunals, and, under the reign of Liberty and Equality, ought not to be the ſubjects of legal proſecution. Beſides, if an attachment to Ariſtocracy be a crime, it is a crime of which <hi>Rouſſeau</hi> himſelf is guilty; for, in one of his letters, he expreſsly ſays, <hi>I give a moſt decided preference to Ariſtocracy, over every other form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When I look over the liſt of Citizens expelled and baniſhed their native country, I cannot but think, that the real object of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to expel and baniſh our trade with them, and to remove Geneva itſelf to ſome foreign country. We have in fact thrown our City into our own lake, from whence ſome wiſer people than ourſelves will raiſe it. The artiſt will naturaliſe his talents wherever he ſettles himſelf; new manufactures will compleat the ruin of ours, and the ſpirit of commercial enterpriſe, before which all difficulties vaniſh, will turn the channels, which have hitherto brought wealth and plenty to Geneva, into the adopted Countries of our unfortunate Exiles.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since this pamphlet, ſeveral publications, of a ſtill holder nature, have appeared; from one of which, called <hi>Open your Eyes,</hi> an extract will not be unacceptable to the reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Tell us, ye creatures of Roberſpierre, you who viſited him in Paris, and correſponded with his accomplices—thoſe ſeven of you in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, who ſecretly plotted the inſurrection of the 18th of July—tell me—by what authority did you preſume to decide on the fate of your Country? Where are the conſpiracies, the plots, to which I lent a credulous ear, and which you ſolemnly promiſed to bring immediately to light? The People is impatient to have ſome account of them,—that People whom you have led from error to error, and crime to crime, and now leave, a prey to the conſequences of their folly, and the agonies of their remorſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And you, Bouſquet, &amp;c. &amp;c. do you not ſee the avenging Furies, waving their horrid torches around you?—Do you not ſee the rivers of blood you have ſhed? In vain would you waſh out the deep ſtains of innocent blood, in which you have imbrued your hands. In ſpite of all your endeavours, they ſtill appear on them. In vain do you hope to eſcape the puniſhment due to your crimes; your ſentence is already pronounced, and you may read it in the eyes of all around you,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The effect of theſe pamphlets has already been to procure either the reverſal, or the ſuſpenſion of ſeveral of the ſentences paſſed by the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary Tribunal. This change of circumſtances has not eſcaped the obſervation of the Conſtitutional Government, and has induced them to make an effort, though perhaps an ineffectual one, to ſupport a ſyſtem, which on a former occaſion they diſavowed.</p>
                  <p>By a proclamation iſſued on the 5th of December, the <hi>Syndies and Council peremptorily forbid the Citizens called Ariſtocrats and Indifferents, as well as thoſe called Mountaineers, to form themſelves again into Clubs or Societies, and inſiſt that, in order to preſerve public tranquillity and ſecurity, ſuch citizens as are deſirous of giving their ſentiments to the public, will not abuſe the liberty of the preſs, to ſpread diſcontent, and inflame the ſpirit of diſcord, by declaiming on the neceſſity of reſtoring harmony, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and union, under pain of ſuch puniſhment, as ſuch offences deſerve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is plain from theſe circumſtances that the ſpirit of the Revolution is nearly extinct. But how ſhall we remove what it has introduced, or reſtore what it has deſtroyed?</p>
               </note> and
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:033927_0040_0FF9CD4A91ECD630"/>avow their diſcontent and diſappointment in the moſt open manner. To appeaſe them, and to divert their attention, an
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:033927_0040_0FF9CD4A91ECD630"/>Extraordinary Commiſſion was iſſued, to enquire into and puniſh all applications of any part of the public plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the uſe of particular individuals. But though this meaſure profeſſed to fall on petty delinquents only; yet every man of reflexion ſaw at once that it was a farce; nor have the Commiſſioners yet dared to enter upon their offices, the principal criminals being afraid of ſetting ſo dangerous a precedent; and, on that account, determined to let ſmaller crimes go unpuniſhed, however notorious.</p>
            <p>Neither this partiality, nor the cauſe of it, have eſcaped the obſervation of the Revolutioniſts. They complain of it in terms of the ſtrongeſt indignation. But an event has taken place much more alarming to the leaders, who, thinking that they had excluded all perſons not of their party from the General Aſſembly, ventured, at laſt, to call it together for the purpoſe of electing a public Treaſurer. The members, ſhocked at the enormous waſte made in the finances, ſince the Revolution, rechoſe the former Treaſurer, who was one of the Magiſtrates depoſed in 1792. To the great mortification as well as aſtoniſhment of the Demagogues, he had at leaſt 500 votes more than any other candidate; but he thought it prudent to decline ſo dangerous a preference. The Election of this Gentleman was the effect of an apprehenſion generally entertained by the Revolutioniſts, and expreſsly ſtated in a pamphlet publiſhed by one of them, that the leaders meant to make their retreat with the whole of the plunder. <hi>Let us take care,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>not to entruſt the management of our finances, of our laſt, our only reſource, to ſuch impure and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty men. Let us, as we tender the very exiſtence of our
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033927_0041_0FF9FD17F265AC20"/>Country, watch with unremitted vigilance, over theſe men of blood, theſe bankrupts in character, as well as in fortune, and to prevent them, if poſſible, from adding the worſt of ſacrileges to the lift of their other enormities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this manner of treating their chiefs, it is plain that a very conſiderable number of the Revolutioniſts would gladly ſacrifice the more violent of their accomplices, and lay upon their heads the puniſhment due to their own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. The demagogues of courſe are alarmed to find that the Members of the General Aſſembly, whom they thought prepared to go any lengths with them, ſhould take advantage of the mode of voting by ballot, to deſert the principles they avow in the Clubs, and to give ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing though indirect a proof, of their averſion to the Revolution.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of this ſcene of tyranny and devaſtation, the unfortunate victims flattered themſelves that the new French Reſident, when he preſented his credentials, would take that opportunity of recommending to the imitation of Geneva, the ſyſtem of moderation, at preſent adopted by the Convention; and that the influence of France, which had been ſo often and ſo fatally exerted againſt them, would for once be employed in their favour: but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with coldly cenſuring the conduct of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, and aſſuring them, that "as France will never permit other nations to interfere in its domeſtic concerns, ſo would it ſcrupulouſly abſtain from intermeddling in thoſe of other nations, particularly in thoſe of an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ally."</p>
            <p>What an abominable mixture of cruelty, hypocriſy, and irony, on the part of a Nation, which, after openly violating every law, divine and human, and exerting all her ſtrength to plunge us into an abyſs of miſery, of which modern Hiſtory affords no other example, has waited for the laſt ſtruggles of the expiring victim, to tell it with contemptuous cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſhe can only be aſpectator of its diſtreſs, and is reſtrained by the <hi>law of Nations</hi> from interfering with more than her wiſhes; though, at the ſame time, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to give us ſo ſlight a proof of the exiſtence of even
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033927_0041_0FF9FD17F265AC20"/>thoſe wiſhes, a recommendation of her own boaſted mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would afford?</p>
            <p>To make the cruelty of ſuch conduct ſtill more poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and perhaps to diminiſh the abhorrence which their own barbarities have excited, by giving the imitation of them an air of ridicule, the <hi>French</hi> have lately thrown the Revolution of Geneva into the ſhape of a Farce, and exhibited it on one of the Paris Theatres! The Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary Tribunal was repreſented exactly in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſcribed in page 26—with every additional circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that the ingenuity of malignant ſcorn could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, to heighten the effect.</p>
            <p>Such is the manner in which <hi>France</hi> has completed her deteſtable work, in the ſmall, but once moſt intereſting Republic of <hi>Geneva!</hi> and ſuch is the return of applauſe, of gratitude, and of <hi>fraternization,</hi> which ſhe reſerves for future converts to her ſyſtem! May the dreadful leſſon produce its due effect! and for the ſake of human happineſs, may the fate of one victim be ſufficient to atone for the offence of thoſe who ſtill liſten to her doctrines, and in ſpite of experience wiſh to adopt her principles, and imitate her conduct!</p>

            <p>The laſt letters from Geneva, written about the middle of February, announce, that this unhappy City is ſtill at the diſcretion of its oppreſſors, who, however, from ſeveral circumſtances, now ſeem to be more and more apprehenſive of the puniſhment juſtly due to their crimes. It is ſaid, that Bouſquet and his accomplices have already proceeded to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to each other the perpetration of them; and that, not daring to ſhew themſelves in the day-time for fear of being publicly inſulted, they try, however, to keep up the ſpirits of ſuch of their adherents, as they find to be fluctuating, by aſſuring them, that in France the ſyſtem of terror, and the Jacobins, will ſoon be reſtored, as the only means by which that Republic can be maintained.</p>
            <p>Mean time, the Revolutioniſts of Geneva who are the leaſt corrupted in their principles, appear by degrees to attach themſelves to the few honeſt men, who ſtill have the courage not to deſpair entirely, although they want the ſpirit and vigour of mind, neceſſary for ſhaking off the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:033927_0042_0FF9FD288B2C4290"/>yoke under which they groan: but hitherto, nothing has taken place, except a mixture of half-ſtifled remorſe, laudable but ineffectual good wiſhes, and weak and ill-directed efforts, the care of carrying which into effect, they leave to Providence. In a word, the laſt Revolution of France has put a ſtop to that of Geneva, but hitherto has by no means given it any retrograde motion.</p>
            <p>Thus the cenſure which the ſucceſſors of Roberſpierre ſeemed to throw upon the laſt Revolution of Geneva, appears, at preſent, to have been only an additional ſnare laid for the credulity of thoſe who have been, and ſtill are, the victims of it. They flattered themſelves that the new Committees of Paris, fully appriſed of the many and great evils, which their Republic had occaſioned to ours, would readily have addreſſed ſome remonſtrance on the ſubject to the Geneveſe Jacobins, which could not have failed to produce an inſtantaneous effect; the more ſo, as it was certainly expected by the Geneveſe, and, until now, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to keep them in a ſtate of inaction. But far from ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance having ever been ſent by the Committees of Paris, as ſoon as they heard that the Reſident <hi>Adet,</hi> ſucceſſor of <hi>Soulavie,</hi> appeared moſt deeply to deplore the work of his predeceſſor, and that his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he took no pains to hide, had begun to inſpire the oppreſſed ſufferers with a glimpſe of hope, they recalled him to Paris, under the pretence of ſending him Ambaſſador to America.</p>
            <p>From thence one might conclude that the French Miſſion to Geneva is now calculated as a preliminary ſtep to that of the United States. May the ſtrength of their Government, our experience, and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their people, preſerve them from reaping the bitter fruits that we have!...</p>
