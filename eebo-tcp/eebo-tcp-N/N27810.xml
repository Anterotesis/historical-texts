            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>And it was a cuſtom in Iſrael, that the daughters of Iſrael went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ANNIVERSARY commemorations of intereſting and affecting events are, probably, as ancient as ſociety on earth. They are, however, of early obſervance. If they did not originate in divine direction and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they receive countenance from the inſtitutions of heaven, for GOD ſtrictly enjoined that the annually returning night, which was ſo fatal to the firſt born of Egypt, and ſo propitious to the firſt born of Iſrael, ſhould be obſerved as a ſolemn, religious, and joyful feſtival, by the Iſraelites, throughout all their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Our text records a mournful anniverſary, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the daughters of Iſrael, in commemoration of the untimely death of one of their ſex, who nobly conſented to die in obedience to the ſacred, and ſolemn, though raſh vow of her father, when he returned in triumph from conquering his countries enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037061_0004_100C3F512FD2BCA0"/>
The particulars of this ſtrange event, as related in ſcripture, are ſimply theſe.—The children of Iſrael, thrown into great conſternation, by a threatened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the children of Ammon, apply to Jephthah, whom they had before exiled, to return, take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their armies, and lead them forth againſt the Ammonites. Jephthah upbraids them with the injury they had done him but yields to their requeſt, upon condition, that at his victorious return, they would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him as their Judge and Ruler; to this they unanimouſly agree.</p>
            <p>Jephthah, placed at the head of his forces, addreſſes a rational and manly remonſtrance to the Ammonites, admoniſhing them to deſiſt from their hoſtile intentions and array. The king of the children of Ammon would not hearken to the words that were ſent him. "And the ſpirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah," and he paſſed through the coaſts of Iſrael to meet the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites. But before he gave them battle, "Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and ſaid, if thou wilt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands, then it ſhall be, that whatſoever cometh forth of the doors of my houſe to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, ſhall ſurely be the LORD's, <hi> and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</hi>" God gave him victory over his enemies. The children of Ammon were ſubdued under him; and in all the pride of conqueſt, Jephthah was now returning to his houſe in Mizpeh. But, what tranſitions are there often
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037061_0005_100C3F52B999E920"/>
in human hopes and expectations! While he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the ſeat, which he, doubtleſs, fondly imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would be the abode of honor and happineſs, behold, his daughter, with timbrels and dances, came out to meet her revered Parent, to welcome his return, and celebrate his victory. She was his only child: beſide her, he had not ſon or daughter. In recollection of his vow, what muſt have been the feelings of a parent's heart! He rent his clothes, to expreſs his anguiſh, and cries, "Alas! my daughter, thou haſt brought me very low; for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back." With filial deference and affection—with an ardor of heroic patriotiſm, perhaps without a parallel, ſhe meets the anguiſh of her father, and ſays, "My Father, if thou haſt opened thy mouth to the LORD, do to me, according to that which hath proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of thy mouth: <hi>Foraſmuch as the</hi> LORD <hi>hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Ammon.</hi>" After the indulgence of one ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that her life might be ſpared for two months, her father did unto her according to his vow! "And it was a cuſtom in Iſrael, that the daughters of Iſrael went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite," or, they went to celebrate the praiſes of the daughter of Jephthah, and to mourn for her.</p>
            <p>There might be much curios inquiry, as there has been much warm contention, reſpecting the obligation of this vow, or the lawfulneſs of the action conſequent upon it; but after all, how could any accurate deciſion be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037061_0006_100C3F544A762190"/>
formed without a more thorough knowledge of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Jephthah's mind, or of the means he had enjoyed of acquiring juſt ideas, or of riſing ſuperior to the power of ſuperſtition, from the idolatrous practices of the neighboring nations, among whom, probably, he had been an exile? It was at this time the cuſtom of nations to ſacrifice their children to their idols. The power of ſuperſtition, over minds unenlightened, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond conception. There can be no ſcruple that Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah thought himſelf bound in conſcience to fulfil his vow; nothing but this could have influenced him to ſuch a ſacrifice. And it is equally evident that his daughter was fired with a noble ſpirit of patriotiſm, and filial deference, to yield, with ſuch a grace, to ſuch a diſpoſal of herſelf, and become a voluntary ſacrifice on the altar of her country, for its happy deliverance from threatened invaſion, in the intire overthrow of its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But though, upon this ſubject, cenſure or pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric may be miſtakingly applied, yet admiration is a juſt tribute; and we certainly muſt applaud the annual teſtimony of reſpect paid by the daughters of Iſrael to the memory of this female patriot. Will then a diſtant and partial imitation of their example awaken cenſure, or provoke reprehenſion, when the ſeaſon returns, that, to us, was marked with the moſt intereſting and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing event?</p>
            <p>This is the anniverſary of the death of GEORGE WASHINGTON, that firſt of Pariots—the friend of man—the father of his country—and, under GOD, its
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037061_0007_100C3F5610B2D760"/>
protector and deliverer. On this day, the laſt year, death obtained one of his greateſt conqueſts, in triumphing over one, who had before riſon above his enemies, above his cotemporaries; had obtained an intire conqueſt over himſelf, and ſtood unconquerable by all, but death. And though the incenſe of his praiſe then perfumed the whole country, and nations beſide his own eulogized his memory, yet, as this firſt anniverſary ſince his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe occurs upon the day in which we are called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to worſhip GOD, and to notice his providences as well as his word, would it not wear the guiſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ingratitude, and criminal forgetfulneſs or omiſſion, to let it paſs without ſome public notice.</p>
            <p>I hope, and believe, we are all above paying undue honors to man, or raiſing any mortal above the ſtile of humanity. We are all formed of the duſt, and moulded out of the clay; and perfection is a claim that no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal can ſupport. Though there are that are <hi>called</hi> Gods, many, and Lords, many, yet to us, let there be but one GOD, even the father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, the father of mercies and the GOD of all grace; and him only let us honor with divine honors. Yet there is a ſecondary and ſubordinate honor due to thoſe whom GOD has dignified in the adminiſtration of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and whom he has made the inſtruments of public and extenſive bleſſings. Honor is due to ſuch characters while they live, their memories ſhould be dear when they are gone, their virtues and exploits ought to be held in grateful remembrance, and their counſels and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037061_0008_100C3F59C5A87898"/>
admonitions treated with deference and reſpect. It is mentioned in the ſacred volume, much to the reproach of the cotemporary generation, that, when a poor wiſe man, by his wiſdom, delivered a city, that was beſieged by a great and powerful enemy, no man remembered that ſame poor man, but forgat him. And it is a charge of Apoſtolic authority, "Remember them that have the rule over you." Can we then be cenſured in devoting a few moments to the melancholly and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful recollection of the virtues that adorned—of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits that ſignalized—and of the counſels that crowned the life, of that firſt of men, and moſt illuſtrious of Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, who was once all our own, and who may ſtill be ours, if we will liſten to his counſels, and imitate his example.</p>
            <p>GEORGE WASHINGTON ſeemed originally deſigned of heaven as an eminent public benefactor. He was born for others, and not for himſelf. And, in coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with this deſign, he was denied thoſe objects of paternal affection which are ſo apt to divide and diſtract the heart; and introduce rival intereſts to the public good. In perſonal qualifications, which, though of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior moment, are not without their uſe, he was diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. His ſize, air, attitude, deportment, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expreſſion were ſuch as to command reſpect, and prepoſſeſs the beholder with favorable ſentiments: but theſe were far exceeded by the talents and virtues of the immortal inhabitant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037061_0009_100C3F5C40A3ECD8"/>
It is not to be diſputed, that there have been indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals who have rivalled the great and good WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON in ſome individual talent, or human excellence; but they have been uſually balanced by great defects in other talents neceſſary to form the eminent <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. General WASHINGTON was endowed with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common portion of all the virtues and talents that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify and adorn the human character, and render men uſeful to their fellow men: and it would be hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide in which he excelled.</p>
            <p>Many there have been who have had minds more cultivated and improved by a regular attention to a ſyſtematic education; and more thoroughly verſed in the abſtruſer parts of ſcience: but where will you find a man poſſeſſed of a greater fund of uſeful knowledge, or who knew how to make a better uſe of it upon all proper occaſions. His correſpondencies and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, whether in his public or private capacities, would do honor to the firſt of ſcholars, and moſt pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed of men; no man ever knew better the <hi>how</hi> and the <hi>when;</hi> no man ever diſcovered greater addreſs in rendering them ſubſervient to his governing object, <hi>the public good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there was a talent that was preeminent in General WASHINGTON, and in which he excelled all others, was it not a talent of conciliating claſhing intereſts, of meeting and directing public opinion, without any zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous interference with the courſe of things? His native, inviolable, integrity and fidelity; his ſteady, uniform,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037061_0010_100C3F5DCC0C80D0"/>
and unperverted patriotiſm ſeconded the influence of this talent; and his firm belief of the overruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD, and of his own accountableneſs to the Judge of quick and dead, ſecured to his country all the good that could be derived from ſuch a talent, and guarded it from all the evil to which it would expoſe, in the breaſt of unprincipled, or aſpiring ambition. By this, more than by any thing elſe, was that uncommon man formed and qualified to act the great and novel part aſſigned him on the theatre of time; to harmonize and concentrate the ſentiments of diſtant and diverſified ſtates, to create and form defenſive armies collected from theſe ſeveral ſtates, to ſoften their jealouſies, amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamate their manners, and render them bands of breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, animated by one common ſpirit, and directing their energies to one common object. By this was he alſo admirably qualified to preſide in Council, and lead the intrigues of deſigning ſubtilty, and the errors of miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgment, to the ſame eventual happy iſſue. But time will permit only to mention a few of the more prominent features in the character of this excellent man, whoſe days were numbered and finiſhed, the laſt fourteenth of December.</p>
            <p>The deeds and exploits of the illuſtrious WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON were numerous and various as his virtues; and he might be many times hailed the inſtrumental Saviour of his country: early called into her ſervice, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf with honor and dignity: for though his military career commenced with leſs happy auſpices,

and ſavage ambuſh and dexterity put to ſlight the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with which he was connected, yet the ſcattered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains were principally indebted to his valor and addreſs that any of them eſcaped the fate of their brethren.</p>
            <p>When our revolutionary ſtruggle became of ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a nature, that we muſt either repel our exactors, or be under tribute; the preſence of General WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON at the head of our armies, while it gave order, life, and dignity to them, raiſed the drooping ſpirits of the country, and like an electric ſhock, vivified the whole continent. And not only in his whole military career, and its happy iſſue, in our peace and independence, muſt he be acknowledged our firſt Benefactor: But in a variety of inſtances he ſeems to have been our <hi>only</hi> ſheild and deliverer. On that memorable Chriſtmas eve, when his diminiſhed, diſbanding, and deſerted ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, were retreating before a fluſhed, an indignant, and exulting foe—when every face gathered paleneſs, and almoſt every heart failed with fear, how did his unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, heroic, and ſucceſsful attack at Trenton change the face of things, and ſpread gleams of light upon our national horizon? He might then be called the Saviour of his country. But, not to multiply inſtances from his military career; his riſing ſuperior to the attacks of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and intrigue; his remaining unmoved and ſteady to his purpoſe, notwithſtanding the ungenerous and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating deſertions and returns he experienced, which would have ſoured, if not deſtroyed, almoſt any patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm but his, are ſo many inſtances, in which he may be called the Saviour of his country.</p>

When the revolutionary army was about diſbanding, having defended their country, vindicated her rights, and ſecured to her the enjoyment of peace and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the influence and addreſs of their illuſtrious commander diſconcerted and ſuppreſſed an inſidious and artful deſign, formed and ripened by ſome of the aſpiring officery, of turning their arms againſt the country, unleſs Congreſs complied with conditions, that were at that time, abſolutely impracticable; here, again he was the ſaviour of his country.</p>
            <p>Retiring from the field, ſurrounded with glory, that few conquerors have acquired, he is ſoon called to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in that illuſtrious aſſemblage of Patriots, who were delegated to form a new conſtitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for confederate America. And the name of WASHINGTON ſtands firſt on the reſplendant roll to that Conſtitution of government, which was the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſaving the country from imbecillity, confuſion and contempt.</p>
            <p>Being ſummoned to the chief magiſtracy, by the unanimous ſuffrage of his country, at a period moſt eventful, when a political foreign tempeſt was juſt burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, which has ſhaken and affected almoſt every nation; in which ſtate of things, he could find no aid to his judgment but in his inviolable integrity, and enlightened patriotiſm, which were aſſailed by every artifice: He choſe for his country, that neutral ſtation which has hitherto repelled the force of the tempeſt, and raiſed her in wealth, reputation, and happineſs. Here again WASHINGTON may be hailed the ſaviour,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037061_0013_100C3F64B4E9E600"/>
of his country. And, would the time permit, inſtances might be multiplied, in which his ſignature, no leſs than his ſword, has been the mean of averting porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous evils, of procuring to his country momentous bleſſings; for which the juſtice of poſterity will fully accredit him.</p>
            <p>Theſe are few of the virtues and exploits, that formed the character, and dignified the life of that firſt of men, of heroes, and of patriots, whom GOD raiſed up to be the champion of Liberty, the defender of his country, and the benefactor of mankind. In what human character was there ever combined a greater aſſemblage of uſeful and ornamental virtues? What hand was ever the inſtrument of more eminent or various political and civil bleſſings? What channel was ever more replete with providential benedictions? But they, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods, muſt die like men. This fourteenth of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember ſaw the great and good WASHINGTON fall like one of the people: his memory and his virtues are juſtly dear to grateful country, and ought to be frequently recollected with a mournful pleaſure. But he can now be of no farther uſe to us, than as we imbibe his ſpirit, and cover ourſelves with his mantle, by liſtening to his counſels and imitating his example.</p>
            <p>"Sayeſt thou, America, thou mourneſt great WASHINGTON?"</p>
            <p>"Says life the ſame?"</p>
            <p>"He mourns the dead, who lives <hi>as they</hi> deſire."</p>

Peculiarly fortunate for us, we are not left to conjecture or collect the wiſhes and deſires of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed father and benefactor, from his general character, or diverſified communications at different periods of life; he has furniſhed us with them, at a time, and in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, when they could flow from nothing but a ſpirit of diſintereſted patriotiſm: when no hopes, or fears could influence him to keep back any thing that he thought could be profitable to us: and when the love of his country, a parental ſolicitude, for its honor and welfare, were, not only profeſſedly, but moſt manifeſtly, the predominant paſſions of his heart. The wiſhes and deſires of parental ſolicitude, the counſels and cautions of enlightened patriotiſm, he has left us in an addreſs, which is juſtly ſtiled a political legacy, of greater value to this country than a mountain of Gold, or a mine of Diamonds; ſo long as juſtice and wiſdom are eſteemed virtues on earth, or liberty and order have any votaries, it cannot fail to be eſteemed and eulogized. And would to GOD, that, being annually read, it might regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ſentiments, and influence the practice of the enlightened citizens of America to the lateſt generations. The experience we have had, in the few years that have elapſed ſince it was delivered, muſt have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed our ideas of its importance to us, and exalted our admiration of the enlightened and diſcerning pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm of its author, if it does not lead us to imagine that, raiſed to the ſtile of a prophet, he was favored with a viſion of the impending dangers of his country.</p>

Preſuming that the love of liberty was ſo "interwov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with the ligaments of our hearts," that it could not be loſt but with the diſſolution of our frame, our deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Counſellor begins by aſſuring us "it is of infinite moment that we ſhould properly eſtimate the immenſe value of our national union, to our collective and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual happineſs," and that we ſhould indignantly frown upon the firſt dawning of every attempt to ſhake or enfeeble it; or to diſturb that unity of government, which is the palladium of our political ſafety and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</p>
            <p>In contemplating the cauſes that might diſturb our union, he cautions againſt thoſe that may ariſe from characterizing parties by geographical diſcriminations, which may convey the idea, that there is a real differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of local intereſts and views; and ſays, "The name of <hi>American,</hi> which belongs to you, in your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional capacity, muſt always exalt the juſt pride of pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm, more than any appellation derived from local diſcriminations." He admoniſhes us to cheriſh an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened confidence in the government we have eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; and to give it our decided ſupport; aſſerting that "reſpect for its authourity, compliance with its laws, and acquieſcence in its meaſures, are duties enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fundamental maxims of true liberty," and that all "obſtructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and aſſociations, under whatever plauſible character, with the real deſign to direct, control, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037061_0016_100C3F6B2C598BD0"/>
conſtituted authorities, are deſtructive of this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principle, and of fatal tendency." All real evils ſhould be redreſſed in a conſtitutional way, and all inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and changes effected in the way that is preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the conſtitution itſelf.</p>
            <p>He deſcribes in frightful colors the evils, both foreign and domeſtic, that ariſe from parties in a State; and, with parental ſolicitude, exhorts us to watch againſt them; for when they prevail, there is confuſion and every evil work; and the public good is made but a tennis ball toſſed from the mouth of party to party, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a view of ſecuring them the victory. And a greater than WASHINGTON has ſaid, "that a kingdom or houſe divided againſt itſelf, cannot ſtand, but comes to deſolation."</p>
            <p>He cautions thoſe intruſted with the adminiſtration of government, to confine themſelves within their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional ſpheres, avoiding in the exerciſe of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of one department, to encroach upon another.</p>
            <p>He admoniſhes of the evils that will ariſe from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate national attachments, or national antipathies, and exhorts us, with a ſpirit of impartiality, to treat all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with dignified reſpect, national integrity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial hoſpitality; avoiding permanent alliances with any nation.</p>
            <p>

"Againſt the inſidious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to believe me, fellow citizens) ſays he, the jealouſy of a free people ought to be conſtantly awake;" "But that jealouſy, to be uſeful, muſt be impartial; elſe it becomes the inſtrument of the very influence to be avoided."</p>
            <p>He admoniſhes us to cheriſh public credit; to avoid occaſions of expence; but cheerfully and ſeaſonably meet them, as they neceſſarily ariſe; that we may not load poſterity with an encumbered patrimony, or render it a bequeſt ſcarcely worth their receiving. After all,</p>
            <p>This great and good man was fully ſenſible, that all his counſel and advice, his cautions and admonitions, would be of no avail, without a reſpectful and national regard to the duties and obligations of religion and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. This, therefore, he enjoins upon us as of moſt momentous conſequence; aſſerting, that no citizen can claim the tribute of patriotiſm, or be juſtly intitled to the confidence of man, who endeavors to ſubvert, or does not uſe his influence to ſupport "theſe great pillars of human happineſs; theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens," and he unites the voice of reaſon and experience againſt the deluſive, though faſhionable idea "that national morality can prevail in excluſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principle."</p>
            <p>Thus, as with his dying breath, admoniſhed and warned, counſelled and adviſed, that wife, enlightened,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037061_0018_100C3F6FC1723958"/>
tried and approved patriot, who being all his country's, and having done all that mortal could do, to ſecure and perpetuate her independence and proſperity, laid down the burden of mortality, the laſt fourteenth of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and joined his kindred ſpirits. His memory will ever be deſervedly moſt dear, and the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of America may yearly mourn for him, and celebrate his praiſes. But in vain do we pretend to revere his memory, or pour the grateful incenſe on his name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we reſpect his counſels and imitate his virtues.</p>
            <p>O that GOD would cauſe a double portion of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to deſcend and reſt upon all the officers of our gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, in their reſpective grades, and ſucceſſive eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that he would animate the breaſt of every citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of America, with a principle of as pure and diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted patriotiſm, as that which glowed and triumphed in the breaſt of WASHINGTON: then might we adopt the exclamation of the Pſalmiſt, "Happy is the people that is in ſuch a caſe, happy the people whoſe GOD is the LORD."</p>
            <p>As the death of this great man moſt loudly proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vanity of all human glory, and forced a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the impropriety of placing confidence in any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blow GOD, or of leaning upon any arm but the arm of the Almighty; ſo the return of the anniverſary ſhould renew the conviction, and influence us to "ceaſe from man whoſe breath is in his noſtril, for wherein is he to be accounted of." Happy is that individual, happy that people, who, taught by the diſcipline of

Providence, and the counſels of wiſdom, have all their expectations from him, who rules in the kingdoms of men, and gives them to whomſoever he pleaſes. He plants, and he plucks up; he builds, and pulls down. Amidſt all the wild confuſion that has marked the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of his providence over this apoſtate world, GOD is carrying on his own purpoſes, and accompliſhing his own deſigns; and will bring them to an eventful iſſue, in the intire change and diſſolution of this viſible frame of things. But there ſhall be a new heavens, and a new earth wherein righteouſneſs ſhall dwell. GOD has founded a kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, a dominion that ſhall laſt forever. Let us be concerned to become ſubjects of this kingdom, and heirs of the glory that ſhall be there diſplayed. This honor and happineſs is ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, only by believing in CHRIST, by obeying his goſpel, and keeping his commandments, who is not the ſaviour of a country merely, but, of the whole world. To him with the Father and Holy Ghoſt be glory and honor, praiſe and dominion, forever and ever,</p>
