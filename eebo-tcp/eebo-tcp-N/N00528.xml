      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>[1 Tim. 4. 7.] <hi>Exercise thy self unto Godliness.</hi> Now that is done by a frequent practice of those Duties, which have a Tendency to the promoting of the Power of <hi>Godliness,</hi> in our selves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and which through the Blessing of God, will not fail to attain that End: amongst which there are none more useful than <hi>Meditation, self-Examinations</hi> and <hi>

            <p>The Object of <hi>Meditation [God revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his Work and Works</hi>] is of a large Extent; the particularizing of some of the <hi>Works</hi> of God in <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> considered

               <hi>Day unto Day uttereth Speech, and Night unto Night sheweth Knowledge,</hi> Psal. 19. 2. implying the various passages of Providence in every day and night of all the Seasons of the Year, are such as give Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to us in the Knowledg of that God who Made all, and Rules all, and will Judge us all at the Last Day, when all the Works of Creation &amp; Providence shall come to an end, &amp; when <hi>Time</hi> (that was Concreated with them) <hi>shall be no more:</hi> then God himself shall be <hi>all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 28. World without End.</p>
            <p>Now in all the forementioned respects, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent pious and ingenious Treatise doth recommend it self to every Intelligent Reader, as a singular &amp; seasonable help to Improve the time of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Season in such an Exercise of <hi>Godliness,</hi> as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth us how to observe the <hi>Works</hi> of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, &amp; to acknowledge God in them, &amp; by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of God together to have suitable (either sett or occasional) <hi>Meditations</hi> on the Wisdom &amp; Power, the Greatness &amp; Goodness of God, and this with Application to our selves, and our own Duties, so as to raise our hearts and affections to the Fear and Love &amp; Service of that God, who is God <hi>over all blessed for evermore.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Ground I cannot forbear wishing that the Reverend <hi>Author</hi> of this, would do the like in relation to the other three Seasons of the Year; being assured that the Holy Scriptures are as rich in furnishing Materials for Spiritual Meditations on the W<hi>orks of God</hi> proper to the <hi>Spring,</hi> the <hi>Summer</hi> and the <hi>Autumn,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</hi>

               <hi>A</hi>nd truly, I cannot but give thanks to God, and Congratulate our <hi>New-England,</hi> that He hath Raised up such a Learned, Pious, and Ingenuous Person amongst the Ministers of our Third Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and hath poured out his Spirit upon him, and hath Enabled him not only to an Exemplary Diligence in the Work of the Ministry both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and privately amongst his <hi>Own People</hi> with great Success; but also to Write so many Useful <hi>Treatises</hi> on several Subjects, relating to the great Concernments of the Souls of all men, and of the State of Religion amongst us at this day; which I doubt not but they have been, are and will be acceptable and profitable to the good people of this Generation, and those that shall succeed.</p>
            <p>Finally, my hearts desire and Prayer to God is; that he would graciously preserve the Life and Health of this his Laborious and Faithful Servant, and give him to be <hi>Strong in the Grace that is in Christ Jesus,</hi> and Enable him to Write many more such Useful Treatises as he hath done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for the Glory of God and good of the Souls of men, and that the Blessing of Heaven may go along with this present Work, and make it Effectual to attain the good Ends thereof.</p>

            <p>Well; There is an Important CASE, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I would hence take occasion to give you some WINTER-ENTERTAINMENTS. It is The CASE.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What Special</hi> Works <hi>for the Glory of God, may and should be Attended by the Children of Men, when by the hard weather of the</hi> Winter, <hi>He shuts them up, or Hinders them from their Ordinary Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are not only <hi>Commoda,</hi> or Profitable Things, but also <hi>Accommoda,</hi> or Seasonable Things which are to be Preached among you. Our W<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is our <hi>Liesure,</hi> and as it will be a <hi>Profitable,</hi> so 'tis but a <hi>Seasonable</hi> Undertaking, to Lay before you, <hi>How the Liesure of the</hi> W<hi>inter may be most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, without any further Preface, First, that we may speak more <hi>Negatively,</hi> it is to be assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the <hi>Liesure</hi> of the W<hi>inter</hi> must not be <hi>Abused,</hi> as if it were a <hi>Liesure to work Abominations,</hi> or as if it were a <hi>Liesure</hi> for any Superstitious or Prohibited <hi>Sensualities.</hi> 'Tis not in the Slothful and

Frothy Diversions of B<hi>ad</hi> C<hi>ompany,</hi> nor in things which will <hi>wrong our Souls,</hi> that our W<hi>inter</hi> is to be Sweeled away. I am sure, The <hi>Abominable</hi> W<hi>orks</hi> of Sin, are none of those <hi>works,</hi> which we are to mind, when God <hi>shuts</hi> up our <hi>Hands;</hi> No, we should keep our own <hi>Hands</hi> for ever <hi>shut</hi> up from such <hi>works</hi> as those. Indeed, we spend the Nights of our W<hi>inter as a Tale that is told;</hi> but we should not spend them in such Idle Things, as the <hi>Telling of Tales;</hi> nor should we give cause for a poor <hi>Tale</hi> to be told, about our way of spending them. Tho' our W<hi>inter-Days</hi> have not so much <hi>Light</hi> as <hi>Darkness</hi> in them, yet we should all the W<hi>inter</hi> long behave our selves as <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light,</hi> and have <hi>no Fellowship with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful</hi> W<hi>orks of Darkness.</hi> 'Tis the Advice of the Apostle, in Rom. 13. 12,13,14. <hi>The Night is far spent, the Day is at Hand; Let us walk Honestly, as in the Day; not in Dancing and Drunkenness; not in Chambering and</hi> W<hi>antonness; not in Strife and Envying. But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not Provision for the Flesh.</hi> Even <hi>t</hi>hus, when the <hi>Nights</hi> come to be Longer than the <hi>Days;</hi> we should still do nothing but what the <hi>Day Light</hi> of the Gospel Justifies; 'tis not the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>Lust,</hi> or of W<hi>rath,</hi> where with we are then to keep our selves in an H<hi>ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There was one W<hi>inter Month</hi> in the Year which was call'd <hi>Mensis Genialis,</hi> or the Frolick some and Voluptuous <hi>Month,</hi> among the Ancient Pagans; it was the Month of DECEMBER wherein the Heathen had their <hi>Saturnalian</hi> Jolli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

None of them will observe the Lords-Day, Lest they should be Christians; and shall not we then, by observing their Festivalls, fear lest we be made Ethnicks!</hi> Nor will I enter into any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, Whether the Birth of Our Lord were in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember;</hi> tho' they that are versed in Antiquity, do understand how divided the Ancients were about it; and how late, yea, how many Hundreds of Years, it was e're the <hi>December Festival</hi> could obtain: and how much more probability there is, that it rather fell out, about the time of the <hi>Feast of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,</hi> about the conclusion of <hi>September,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>October.</hi> But I will venture to say thus much, That it is well if the World be mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, since the famous and pious <hi>Bishop</hi> made his Complaint <hi>That men dishonour the Lord Jesus Christ more in the Twelve Days of</hi> CHRISTMAS, <hi>than in all the Twelve Months of the Year beside.</hi> And I will venture to say this more, That when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> pray'd the Apostle, to answer that Question, <hi>Whether they might so be with, as to do like, the</hi> P<hi>agans in those Idolatrous Festivities:</hi> He plainly told them, <hi>No!</hi> Deterring of them, with the Example of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness, who would keep a <hi>Feast</hi> in Honour of the true God, but yet follow'd the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who in Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of <hi>Joseph,</hi> saving them from Death by Expounding a Dream of <hi>Kine,</hi> had a sort of <hi>Ox-Worship</hi> among them: It is said, <hi>The</hi> P<hi>eople sat down to Eat and Drink, and Rose up to play;</hi> and all the World has heard, what the <hi>Reckening</hi> was!</p>

            <p>All that I shall add, is, That when the Rules of <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Godliness</hi> are Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, Men instead of <hi>Knowing</hi> the W<hi>orks</hi> of God, are <hi>Doing</hi> the <hi>Works</hi> of Gods Great Enemy; And I am sure, The <hi>Winter</hi> is not a <hi>Liesure,</hi> for such Odious <hi>Works.</hi>

We never have a <hi>Liesure-Day</hi> befalling us, but we should Eye the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of God, in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a Day; and think with our selves; <hi>Why did my God send me this Day? What would He have one to do this Day?</hi> We are not <hi>Wise,</hi> if on our <hi>Winter-Days,</hi> all such Thoughts as these Ly Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in our Minds.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>How it Winter-Time to be Redeemed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will particularize.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Winter</hi> we have <hi>Liesure,</hi> to <hi>Reflect</hi> upon OUR OWN WORKS; and the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven does then Expect that we should so <hi>Reflect.</hi> There are some, who take my Text in that sense; <hi>He Seals up the Hand of every man, that every man may know his own work.</hi> We have Liesure in the <hi>Winter</hi> to settle our <hi>Temporal Affairs,</hi> and we may then see whereabout our <hi>Work</hi> Lies; what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, what success, we have success, we have had in our <hi>Work;</hi> and what further steps we are to take about our <hi>works</hi> The <hi>Winter time</hi> should accordingly be a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000656_0029_0FA9A3D7B38C8498"/>
Time of much <hi>Contrivance</hi> with us, and a Time to State our whole Business, for all the Year a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. But more than so; our <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Affairs are those which the <hi>Winter</hi> gives us the best Liesure for; and we should now settle those by Reflecting upon our <hi>work.</hi> It was complained in Jer. 8. 6. <hi>No man Repented him, saying, what have I done?</hi> In the <hi>Winter</hi> we have Little to Do; well but now 'tis a Time, for us to Reflect, <hi>What have I been doing ever since I came into the World?</hi> The great work of <hi>Self-Examination</hi> is Gods <hi>Work;</hi> 'tis the <hi>Work</hi> whereto our God has called us. We have a Precept for it, in Hag. 1. 5. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, consider your Ways.</hi> We have a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for it, in Psal. 119. 59. <hi>I thought on my Ways, and I turned my Feet unto thy Testimonies.</hi> We do the <hi>Work</hi> of God, when we thus <hi>Try</hi> what our own <hi>Works</hi> have been. When the <hi>Winter</hi> then has driven us into Retirements, Let us take Time for this <hi>Work;</hi> even to <hi>See,</hi> and <hi>Know,</hi> what <hi>Work</hi> we have been doing since our God first set us to <hi>work</hi> among the Living on the Earth. 'Tis now a Time for us to Enquire, <hi>How have I answered the End, which I came into the World upon?</hi> God has Required us, to <hi>work out our own Salvation;</hi> well, but what strokes, have we struck at that <hi>work</hi> all this while? Ask our selves, <hi>How have I done the works Agreeable to Repentance?</hi> and, <hi>How have I done the works of Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ?</hi> And herewithal bring we all our <hi>works</hi> to such an <hi>Examination,</hi> as may discover
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000656_0030_0FA9A3D983A78C00"/>
the <hi>Errors,</hi> and F<hi>ollies</hi> of our <hi>Works,</hi> in order to our thorough Humiliation for them.</p>
            <p>Why should not a <hi>Winter day</hi> be sometimes made a PRAYING-DAY, yea, and a FASTING-DAY, before the Lord? No man will arrive to very high Attainments in the Grace of God, who does not sometimes, devote whole <hi>days</hi> unto a secret <hi>Communion</hi> with him. Now, let us have many such Dayes every Winter, to <hi>Pray,</hi> and <hi>Fast,</hi> and Humble our Souls, before the God of Heaven. But on such a Day, one very proper exercise would be for us, to call over the W<hi>orks</hi> of our lives, and finding the Obliquity of our W<hi>orks</hi> by Comparing them with the <hi>Holy, &amp; Just, &amp; Good</hi> Commanements of our God, Let us then, <hi>

            <p n="2">II. The Great God requires our <hi>Contemplation</hi> to observe ALL HIS WORKS, and the <hi>Liesure</hi> of the <hi>Winter</hi> should very much go to that <hi>Contemplation.</hi> We should now <hi>Know the Work of God,</hi> and Study as far as we can, every one of <hi>His Works.</hi> There has been that Invitation unto us, in Psal. 46. 8. <hi>Come, Behold the Works of the Lord, what Desolasions He hath made in the Earth.</hi> Truly, there are in every <hi>Winter,</hi> many <hi>Desolations</hi> made upon the product of the <hi>Earth;</hi> but we should then B<hi>ehold All,</hi> as well as <hi>Those works of God.</hi> We

            <p>First, There is an Humble Acknowledgment of God, wherewith we are to <hi>behold</hi> his works of CREATION, and the <hi>winter</hi> may be our liesure for it. The Psalmist having mentioned the <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> when men lay by their labour, he presently adds, in <hi>Psal</hi> 104. 24. <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy Works! in wisdom hast Then made them all.</hi> As if <hi>then</hi> were a liesure for such a meditation! Truly thus in the <hi>winter,</hi> when we throw up our other Labour; we should then, <hi>Behold these manifold works of God.</hi> We should not in the <hi>winter</hi> become such Recluses as to forget that we are, <hi>The Citizens of the world;</hi> but then take a Range about the <hi>works</hi> of our God in the World. The very name of <hi>The World,</hi> in the Language of the Bible signifies <hi>Beautiful,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in the <hi>winter</hi> it looses much of is <hi>Beauty,</hi> yet we are then more at <hi>Liesure</hi> to behold its <hi>Beauty.</hi> It was the Demand of the Psalmist, in Psal. 148. 7.8. <hi>Praise the Lord, ye Hall, Snous, and Vapour, and Stormy wind: fulfilling his word.</hi> Why, <hi>The Snow, and Vapour and stormy wind,</hi> and the rest of the Winter, do demand of us, to <hi>Praise the Lord,</hi> for what of, <hi>The Lord,</hi> is to be seen in them, and not in them alone, but in all other Creatures. It is a most Glorious Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Objects, which we have to <hi>behold</hi> on this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Terraqueous Globe,</hi> We are at present <hi>sojourners.</hi>

There, to pass over the Numberless <hi>Fossils</hi> in the Bowels of the Globe, which probably contains above Ten Thousand Millions of Cubic German Leagues, with how many <hi>Animate Bodies</hi> are we Entertained? Of <hi>Beasts,</hi> including <hi>Serpents,</hi> we may reckon about an Hundred and Fifty <hi>Species.</hi> The <hi>Volatils,</hi> of Birds, have been reckoned about Five Hundred; The <hi>Aquatils,</hi> or Fish, have also been reckoned about Five Hundred. The <hi>Shells Fish</hi> more than as many more. The <hi>Vegetables</hi> or Plants, of our Universe have been counted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Six Thousand; and the <hi>Insects,</hi> both Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial and Aquatil, more than Ten Thousand. But there are many other <hi>Animals</hi> to be also Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by us, which never could have been Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, until fit Instruments were Invented for the doing of it. The <hi>Whales,</hi> those moving Islands of more than an Hundred Foot in Length, are not of a Structure so Exquisite, so Stupendous, as those <hi>Animals,</hi> whereof our Microscopes infallibly assure us, that many Thousands together would not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual the least Grain of our common Sand. But yet our <hi>Erect Figure,</hi> instructs us to <hi>Raise</hi> our Looks, unto the <hi>Stars,</hi> among which, if we were Lodged we should quite Loose our Sight of this <hi>Globe;</hi> tho' it be above Twenty Six Thousand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Jews have a Fancy among them, That when the Almighty first bespangled the <hi>Heavens</hi> which <hi>Stars,</hi> He left a Spot near the <hi>North Pole</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finished, and unfurnished, that so, if in after Ages any other should be set up for a GOD, he might have this Trial made of them, <hi>Go, fill up if you can that part of Heaven which is yet left Imperfect!</hi> But indeed, Without any such Suppositions, we may

see enough in the Heavens, to proclaim this unto us, <hi>Lift up your Eyes on High, and Behold, who has Created these things? None but an Infinitely Glorious God, could be the Creator of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. There is a profound <hi>Adoration</hi> of God, wherewith we are to <hi>Behold</hi> His Works of REDEMPTION; and for this likewise we have the <hi>Liesure</hi> of the <hi>Winter.</hi> When our Lord was undergoing some of His Last <hi>Agonies,</hi> for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> of Lost Man, 'tis said in Joh. 19. 18. <hi>They made a Fire of Coals, for it was Cold, and they warmed themselves.</hi> Accordingly, when we have a <hi>cold Winter</hi> upon us, Let us <hi>Warm</hi> our Souls, by thinking on what our Lord Endured in the latter end of the <hi>Winter</hi> for us. When we are in our <hi>Warm Houses,</hi> O Behold, that <hi>Hot Love</hi> of our Lord unto our Souls, which tho' He Lay in a <hi>Winter night</hi> groveling on the <hi>cold</hi> Ground, yet made Him <hi>Sweat,</hi> yea, to Sweat Clotters or Globules of <hi>Blood,</hi> more terrible to Behold, than those <hi>Bloody Sweats,</hi> which <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> tells us, besel the people of the East, when their <hi>Serpents</hi> had bitten them. When we are in our <hi>Warm Garments,</hi> O then Behold the <hi>Heat</hi> of our Lords <hi>Love,</hi> wherein He Hung <hi>Naked</hi> on the Cross, in the <hi>Cold Air,</hi> for Six Hours together of a <hi>Winter-Day.</hi> The Unfathomable Mysteries of <hi>Redemption</hi> are the <hi>Raptures</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi> all the Year about; it is said of those <hi>Cherubims</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant about the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> in 1 pet. 1. 12. <hi>These Things they Desire to Look into.</hi> Let us make the same Things our Study, especially in that part of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000656_0037_0FA9A3DE72F38C70"/>
the Year, the <hi>Winter,</hi> when we have most of Liesure for the Study. We find in Eccl. 11. 7. <hi>Truly the Light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the Eyes to behold the Sun.</hi> Tho in our Winter we have less <hi>Light</hi> than at other Times, yet we may then have more Time to <hi>Behold the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;</hi> and How <hi>pleasant</hi> a Task should we E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem it! Let us now take a Time to Behold the Matchless <hi>Glories</hi> of our Lord Redeemer; and hear that Call of God, <hi>Behold, the Lamb of God!</hi> There is a bright Constellation of <hi>Miracles</hi> that Unite in our Blessed Mediator, and glitter won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully; Let us now, Behold those Miracles of <hi>God manifest in the Flesh,</hi> and of that <hi>Child Born to us, that Son given to us,</hi> who is the <hi>Everlasting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that <hi>Man</hi> who is the <hi>Mighty God,</hi> and whose Name is therefore <hi>Wonderful.</hi> But now also let us take a Time to Behold the Glorious <hi>Methods</hi> of our Salvation by this Lord Redeemer. Behold the most admirable Contrivance of our Salvation, in the <hi>New-Covenant!</hi> It is <hi>wonderful,</hi> that God should <hi>so Love the World as to give His only Begotten Son, that whosoever Believeth in Him should not perish, but have Everlasting Life.</hi> It is <hi>wonderful,</hi> that the <hi>Only Begotten Son of God should ever take on Him the Form of a Servant, that we might become the Children of God.</hi> It is <hi>wonderful,</hi> that <hi>He who knew no Sin, should be made Sin for us, that we might be made the the Righteousness of God in Him.</hi> The Wayes of the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> in <hi>Applying</hi> the <hi>Redemption</hi> thus obtained for us, are yet further WONDERFUL. The MYSTICAL BODY of our Lord Jesus
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000656_0038_0FA9A3DF32E4E288"/>
Christ, with regard unto the manner and effect, of our being brought into an <hi>Union</hi> with Him we are told, <hi>It is fearfully and wonderfully made.</hi> Well, we should now, Behold these <hi>Winders,</hi> and continue to do so, till we have no more <hi>Winter,</hi> yea, till we have no more <hi>Spirit</hi> Left.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is an Hearty Admiration of God, wherewith we are to <hi>behold</hi> this works of PROVIDENCE; and for this also we have the <hi>Liesure</hi> of the <hi>winter.</hi> It is noted concerning the <hi>Wheels of Providence,</hi> in Ezek. 10. 12. <hi>The wheels were full of Eyes.</hi> When the <hi>winter comes about,</hi> in the <hi>wheel</hi> on the year, we should have our <hi>eyes open,</hi> and be <hi>full of eyes,</hi> to behold the motion of those wondrous <hi>wheels.</hi> The Governed of the World is maintained in the <hi>winter,</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It is said in Psal. 107.43. <hi>Who so is wise, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these things, even they shall understand the Loving kindness of the Lord.</hi> There are Illustrious Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, wherein the Almighty God acts as a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder</hi> unto the children of men; and we shall be <hi>very well Rewarded</hi> for all the Confinements of the <hi>Winter,</hi> if we take our Liesure now to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint

our selves with such Dispensations: Our <hi>Confinement</hi> will become our <hi>Liberty!</hi> There are the Dispensations, of the Most High towards His <hi>People;</hi> His Protecting them, His Directing them, His Increasing them. When the Church of God, was Represented unto <hi>Moses,</hi> as a <hi>Burning Bush,</hi> it is said, <hi>He drew near to Behold the Sight.</hi> And when we are by our <hi>Fire-side</hi> in the Winter, we may have Liberty to Behold that <hi>Burning Bush.</hi> There are also the Dispensations of the Most High, towards His <hi>Enemies;</hi> His Confounding of them, His Destroying of them. The Winter was hardly out, when <hi>Israel Beheld the Great Work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians:</hi> And we may <hi>then</hi> also Behold, how terribly <hi>Egyptians</hi> are punished by the Hand of God. When our Lord had been Talking with His Disciples, about those performances of <hi>Providence,</hi> wherein the Scriptures had Received their Accomplishment, they could say, in Luk. 24.32. <hi>Did not our Hearts then Burn within us?</hi> Why, when we are e'en ready to <hi>Freeze</hi> with the Vapours of the Winter, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Lord should then be Talking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, about His Doings in the World; The <hi>News</hi> of Great Occurrents are then to be Enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not as by <hi>Athenians,</hi> having only an Itch of Novelty to prompt those Enquiries, but as by <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> inquisitive after the <hi>Fulfilments of the Scriptures.</hi> and after the Illustrations of the Divine <hi>Attributes,</hi> in those <hi>Fulfilments.</hi> Thus are we to Talk till our <hi>Hearts Burn</hi> within us. And hence also, <hi>Church-History</hi> is a very suitable Study for the <hi>Winter;</hi>

            <p>Finally. As it was said, in Job 37. 14. <hi>Stand still, and Consider the Wondrous works of God:</hi> When the <hi>Winter</hi> comes, we can't <hi>Go out</hi> as at other times; Well, since we must <hi>Sit still,</hi> now let us more than ever, <hi>Consider the Wondrous Works of God.</hi>

            <p n="3">III. In the very CONSTITUTION OF THE WINTER it self. There are very sensible <hi>Works</hi> of God, and our God requires <hi>us</hi> to be very sensible of those Notable <hi>Works.</hi> Almighty God now <hi>Seals</hi> up our <hi>Hands,</hi> that we may <hi>Know His Work.</hi> What <hi>Work?</hi> Why, that very <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Sealing</hi> up our <hi>Hands;</hi> and that <hi>Work</hi> of sending <hi>Snow,</hi> and <hi>Rain,</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> upon the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, when the <hi>Winter</hi> comes, we must Acknowledge that it is from <hi>God.</hi> It is as we read, Psal. 147.17. <hi>Gods Cold,</hi> and for that cause we may not call it <hi>Cruel Cold;</hi> at least it must be a cruel <hi>Catechresis,</hi> by which we call it so? nothing done by God, should be Esteemed <hi>Cruel.</hi> Even so, 'tis <hi>Gods Winter,</hi> the Almighty God is to be Reverenced as the Orderer of it all.</p>
            <p>Is the <hi>Winter</hi> now Rolled about? Then <hi>Know,</hi> That God is the MAKER of the <hi>Winter.</hi> 'Tis Enqulred, in Job. 38.28,29. <hi>Hath the Rain a Father? Out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

Hoary Frost of Heaven, who hath Gendred it?</hi> So, when the <hi>Winter</hi> is upon us, we may Enquire, whence <hi>comes this Cold,</hi> and <hi>snow, and Rain, and all the rest?</hi> But we see them all fall from <hi>Heaven;</hi> &amp; unto the God of Heaven should we ascribe the making of all. As the Winter is of Gods <hi>Promise;</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> World had any proper <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> or no, yet the Lord presently after the Flood, engaged concerning our present World, <hi>Summer &amp; Winter shall not cease:</hi> Thus, the <hi>Winter</hi> is of Gods <hi>Making</hi> too. The Numberless Number of <hi>Saline Particles,</hi> from whence at least some circumstances of the <hi>Winter</hi> do arise, do all of them say, <hi>Tis the Lord that has made us, and not we ourselves.</hi> There seems to be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> store of <hi>Corpuscles</hi> a little akin to <hi>Nitre,</hi> exhaled from the Terrestrial Globe, and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving about in sundry parts of the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> (of the Figure which <hi>Philoponus</hi> tells us, <hi>Democritus</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd unto Frigorific Atoms) and these may not a little contribute unto many things that we feel in our cold. But still, who made them all? And thus, not only those mighty Rands of <hi>Ice</hi> (that <hi>Magnum Duramen Aquarum,</hi> as <hi>Lucretius</hi> Calleth it,) Encountred by such, Navigators as <hi>Janus Munckius,</hi> who saw these Icy-Islands floating Twenty Fathom above Water; or as <hi>Baffin,</hi> who round some above Water, between two &amp; three Hundred foot High; or those that sometimes occur in the River of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> where Icy-Islands have been seen, computed Fourscore Leagues in Length; but every little Ice-Cycle is the Workmanship of God.</p>

Again, <hi>Know,</hi> That God is the SENDER of the <hi>Winter.</hi> 'Tis affirmed, in Job 37.9.10. <hi>Cold comes out of the North; by the Breath of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rest is given, and the Breadth of the Waters is straitned.</hi> When a <hi>Northern Winter</hi> is nipping of us, 'tis from an Edict of God, giving order for such a Season. It is <hi>God that sends Rain</hi> (and the Rest) <hi>upon the Earth.</hi> The <hi>Winterish Winds</hi> blow our <hi>Winter</hi> about our Ears; yea, but it is the <hi>Breath</hi> of God, that is the <hi>First Mover</hi> of all. There is much Dispute, what is the <hi>Primum Frigidum;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Air,</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> or <hi>Nitre,</hi> or what? And some will Dispute whether there be any such <hi>Thing</hi> at all, or no. For if the <hi>Coldness</hi> of any thing signifie no more, than its not having its Insensible Parts agitated so much as those of our <hi>Sensories</hi> by which we judge of <hi>Tactile Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> then to make a thing become <hi>cold,</hi> there needs no more than that the Sun or Fire, or some other Agent, that more vehemently Agitated its parts before, do now cease to do it. But he Cold a <hi>positive</hi> Quality, (which I encline to think) or a <hi>privative,</hi> still 'tis the Breath of God that gives Rise unto it. What the <hi>Centurion</hi> said about the Servants under His Command, <hi>I say to one, Come, and he comes;</hi> thus the <hi>Winter;</hi> 'tis our Great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign who says to it, <hi>Come;</hi> and so the <hi>Winter comes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more, <hi>Knew,</hi> That God is the RULER of the <hi>Winter.</hi> This is intimated in Psal. 74.17. <hi>Thou hast set all the Borders of the Earth, thou hast made Summer and Winter.</hi> So, It is God, Who sets

               <hi>Borders</hi> to the <hi>Winter</hi> upon the <hi>Earth.</hi> It is <hi>God</hi> who says to the <hi>Winter, Keep off till such a Month.</hi> It is <hi>God,</hi> who says to the <hi>Winter, Go off at such a Month.</hi> The <hi>Unlimitable Holy One of Israel,</hi> is He that <hi>Limits our Winter</hi> for us.

            </p>
            <p>Let me add, The Obedience of the <hi>winter</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our God, should be considered by us, to shame our <hi>Disobedience.</hi> If God say to the <hi>Snow,</hi> and the <hi>Rain,</hi> and the Like, <hi>Be thou upon the Earth,</hi> straightway they are so. What Wretches then are we, that when this God shall say to us, <hi>Be thou upon thy Knees, or, Let thy Heart be in Heaven,</hi> we slight what He faith! We read in Psal. 147.15. <hi>He sendeth forth his Commandment upon Earth, His Word Runneth very swiftly:</hi> and then comes, the <hi>Snow,</hi> the <hi>Frost,</hi> the <hi>Ice,</hi> and the <hi>Cold.</hi> Well, but it follows, <hi>He showed His Word unto Jacob.</hi> And now, does <hi>Jacob</hi> yield as much Obedience unto the <hi>Word</hi> of God, as the <hi>winter</hi> does? Alas, How Disobedient are we! In the <hi>winter,</hi> the <hi>Work of God</hi> is done by the <hi>winter</hi> it self; but the <hi>Word</hi> of God then prescribes a further <hi>work</hi> unto us; and can it be said, We <hi>run very swiftly about that work?</hi> No truly; our <hi>will</hi> to our <hi>work,</hi> seems Congeled as it were by an <hi>Eternal winter.</hi> Said the Psalmist, in Psal. 119.91. <hi>All are thy Servants.</hi> What a sad world is this!

MAN, and the DEVIL? methinks we should be ashamed of our Company in our <hi>Disobedience!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that our <hi>Obedience</hi> unto God may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, by the very <hi>Constitution of the winter,</hi> we should do well, upon the several Things therein occurring, to make our <hi>Occasional Reflections.</hi> We may <hi>Spiritualize</hi> the <hi>winter,</hi> and we may have such Thoughts thereby Raised in our Minds, and such <hi>Lessons,</hi> and such <hi>Wishes,</hi> as may bring unto us the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> which the <hi>Spiritually minded</hi> have in their being to. We will Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie a few of those innumerable <hi>Devout Thoughts,</hi> wherein the <hi>winter</hi> sometimes hath provoked a serious Man, to address the God that made the <hi>winter:</hi> and I will confine my self to the <hi>Scripture</hi> in them all.</p>

It seems, they that have <hi>much,</hi> of the <hi>Hail, the Snow,</hi> the <hi>Vapour,</hi> may find <hi>something</hi> in them, for which they should <hi>Praise the Lord.</hi> The Psalmist says, <hi>God giveth Snow like Wool;</hi> the <hi>Snow,</hi> is as a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly white Robe on the body of the Earth, where by his cherished, with a <hi>Nitrous</hi> Impregnation, for Fruitfulness in the Year Ensuing. <hi>Thaa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It was Miraculous, when God after a sort <hi>Rained</hi> first <hi>Bread</hi> and then <hi>Flesh,</hi> for <hi>Israel</hi> of old; He does it in Effect for <hi>us</hi> continually.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Winter</hi> brings much of MERCY to us, it brings much of <hi>Hardship</hi> too? <hi>Pliny</hi> calls the <hi>Snow,</hi> and the <hi>Ice,</hi> the <hi>Punishments of the Mountains.</hi> We who dwell in a <hi>plain</hi> Region, as well as they who dwell upon the Rigid and Ragged Edges of such <hi>Mountains,</hi> would be sorely <hi>Punished,</hi> by the Hardship of the Winter, if the Mercy of our God should not Relieve us. It was said, in Job 38.22,23. <hi>Hast thou Entred into the Treasures of the Snow? Or, hast thou seen the Treasures of the Hail? which I have Reserved against the Time of Trouble.</hi> Truly, the Time of <hi>Snow,</hi> and the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000656_0056_0FA9A3ED74117BA8"/>
Time of <hi>Hail,</hi> would be a sore <hi>Time of Trouble</hi> unto us, if God should not from the other <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of his Bounty, therein make a Comfortable <hi>Provision</hi> for us. This I would say; The <hi>Common Mercies</hi> of God are a Ground, and call for more than <hi>Common Praises</hi> to God. May we from <hi>this Time,</hi> Resolve to be more than <hi>ordinarily</hi> Thankful for our <hi>Common Mercies,</hi> and we have to Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Good Purpose now Spent the Time of this present Exercise.</p>
            <p>We may be Thankful, that the <hi>Winter</hi> it self is not so <hi>Hard,</hi> either as it might be, if God should make it so, or as it is now in some other Lands, yea, or as it has been heretofore among our selves. The Psalmist saw cause to say, in Psal.147.17. Who <hi>can stand before His Cold?</hi> If God should carry on the <hi>Cold</hi> unto a little further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity upon us, there could be no <hi>Standing</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it. Or, if the <hi>Cold</hi> which in its Extremity carries usually but <hi>Three Days</hi> among us, were Extended for <hi>Three Months,</hi> instead of any <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> there could be no <hi>Living</hi> for us.

            <p>Let us also be Thankful for our FUEL.

Instead of so Rude a Fancy, it beseems <hi>us</hi> to-say, <hi>There is much of God in the Fire:</hi> His Greatness, and His Bounty may be seen <hi>Sparkling</hi> in it. Be Thankful; and at the same time, Let us En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of our God, That we may be <hi>Baptised</hi> with the <hi>Fire</hi> of His Holy Spirit, which will make us, <hi>Fervent in Spirit Serving the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us be thankful for Our HOUSES too. We are not left now to lodge abroad in the Cold, with none but the <hi>Ground</hi> for our Bed, the <hi>Snow</hi> for our Coverlid, and the <hi>Sky</hi> for our Canopy: nor are we obliged unto such Wretched <hi>Wigwams</hi> as were the best Habitations of the Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives

The Keenest <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in the world, have been made very tolerable by peoples making some Rooms of their Houses under the <hi>Earth,</hi> and keeping themselves in such subterraneous <hi>Rooms.</hi> But let the <hi>Winters</hi> which call us to give thanks, for our warm <hi>Houses</hi> on the <hi>Earth,</hi> cause us to be Concerned for, <hi>An house Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Heavens.</hi>

But shall not we be willing to do as much for our own Souls? O patiently undergo a Little <hi>Frost,</hi> for the sake of their Deliverance, from the <hi>Outer Darkness,</hi> where there is <hi>Gnashing of Teeth;</hi> for ever! Ecclesiastical History, has Embalmed the Memory of several <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who chose the <hi>Fiery</hi> Anguish of being <hi>Frozen unto Death,</hi> rather than they would S<hi>in</hi> against God, and incur the <hi>Fire</hi> of Damnation. Methinks, 'twould <hi>Fire</hi> the <hi>Coldest</hi> Heart imaginable, to read the Elegant Orations of the Eloquent Ancients, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of those Renowned <hi>Martyrs!</hi> And
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000656_0084_0FA9A40330C7EE28"/>
shall <hi>we</hi> then think much sometimes to feel our selves a little W<hi>interish,</hi> while we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Things that must be done, for our Getting out of our <hi>Sins,</hi> and for our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with that Lord who S<hi>aves His People from their</hi> S<hi>ins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, Let us Get into our Hearts, an <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> to God, that will carry us easily thro' all the C<hi>old</hi> of the W<hi>inter</hi> in the Serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God. Of <hi>Love,</hi> 'tis said, in Cant. 8. 7. <hi>Many waters cannot quench</hi> L<hi>ove, neither can the floods drown it.</hi> Of this <hi>Love,</hi> I may say, <hi>Many Winters cannot starve it, neither can the</hi> F<hi>rost Nip it.</hi> Said the Apostle, <hi>The Love of</hi> C<hi>hrist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth us.</hi> Altho' they that would suitably Serve God in the <hi>winter,</hi> must meet with many Difficulties; yet if we had this <hi>Love</hi> in us, that would C<hi>onstrain</hi> us, to Go F<hi>reely</hi> through them all.</p>
