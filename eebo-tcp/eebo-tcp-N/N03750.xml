            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> aroſe from his Throne, and laid his Robe from him, and cover'd him with Sackcloth, and ſat in Aſhes, v. 6. Thus did he practically confeſs, that he had behav'd unworthy his royal Dignity, and deſerv'd to have it taken from him. And the Proclamation requir'd the ſtricteſt Abſtinence, <hi>Let neither Man nor Beaſt taſte any Thing</hi> Not as if the Beaſts were capable of moral Good or Evil; but as theſe had been abus'd by them, they would have their Moans and Cries under the Want of Food, further to excite penitential Sorrow in themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And all are commanded to <hi>cry mightily to God,</hi> v. 8. Yea, all are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to <hi>turn every one from his evil Way,</hi> and from the <hi>Violence</hi> that is in their Hands. The <hi>Ninevites</hi> were ſenſible, that to outward Signs and Means of Humiliation, they muſt add Repentance and Reformation. 3. <hi>We have their Encouragement to attend this Duty,</hi> in a Time of impending Judgment, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Who can tell if God will turn and repent</hi> —. We may ſuppoſe that <hi>Jonah</hi> declar'd to them the Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the GOD of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſhew'd them the Way of Salvation thro' the then promiſed <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> that tho' their Bodies ſhould be deſtroy'd, their Souls might be ſav'd in the Day of the Lord. And they might well infer ſome Ground of Hope as to their temporal Deliverance from this, that the Judgment was not preſently executed; but the Space of forty Days was given them for Repentance. However, as it doth not appear they had any particular Promiſe reſpecting this
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004597_0009_100DA8D2CCA69620"/>
Matter, ſo their Faith and Hope are here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd as attended with Doubt and Fear <hi>Who can tell?</hi> A like Expreſſion we have, even reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD's covenant People <hi>Who knows if he will return and repent</hi> —? Joel 2.14 4. <hi>We have an Account of Nineveh's Repentance, and GOD's gracious Deliverance,</hi> v 10. <hi>GOD ſaw their Works, i. e</hi> with Approbation and gracious Acceptance. Their Works "whereby they teſtified the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their Faith and Repentance." <note n="†" place="bottom">Dutch Annotations.</note> Our Saviour ſays, <hi>they repented at the preaching of Jonas,</hi> Luke 11.32. We may conclude therefore that his Preaching was accompanied with the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Influences of the Spirit of GOD convincing them of their many hainous Tranſgreſſions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening them with Fears of GOD's Judgments, and prevailing upon them to turn from their Sins to the Lord. Had it not been for this wonderful Work of Grace upon them, they had been like to the Sinners of the old World, who went on ſecurely, tho' <hi>Noah</hi> was a <hi>Preacher of Righteouſneſs to them, 'till the Flood came, and took them all away.</hi> Here were ſome, I hope, and that not a few, who had ſaving Repentance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them; and others were ſo terrified and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, that they engaged at leaſt in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and publick Reformation. And may we not ſuppoſe that in this wonderful Work GOD gave his ancient People a Specimen and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the Call of the Gentiles? Now, upon this their Repentance it is ſaid, <hi>GOD repented of the Evil, and he did it not.</hi> Which Words muſt be underſtood in ſuch a Senſe as is conſiſtent with the divine Perfections. It is not ſpoken
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004597_0010_100DA8D45A026E98"/>
of GOD, as if he could in a proper Senſe be griev'd for what he had done in threatning the <hi>Ninevites;</hi> no, this was right, and he had a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſign in it: Nor, as if he had alter'd his Counſels concerning them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He is of one Mind, and who can turn him? Nor, as if he acted contrary to Truth and Faithfulneſs; no, the Threatning was conditional. And accordingly when they repented GOD turned from his fierce Anger, and gave them Deliverance; which is agreable to that Rule of his Government which we have declar'd, Jer. 18.7.8. <hi>At what Inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it: If that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Words thus explained to you, I would obſerve the following Doctrines,</p>
            <p>[1.] If we would ſeek the Lord in a right manner, we muſt believe Him; the Threatnings and Promiſes of His Word. [2.] It is the Duty of a People to cry to GOD in Prayer with Faſting, when He threatens to bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Judgments upon them; and their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſhould be ready to lead in the right Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this Duty. [3.] Our ſeeking to GOD by Prayer with Faſting muſt be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with true Repentance, and ſincere Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after Reformation. [4.] When a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do thus attend their Duty, GOD will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the Evil, and not bring Deſtruction upon them.</p>

               <head>I. <hi>If we would ſeek the Lord in a right Manner under his threatned Judgments, we must believe Him; the Threatnings and Promiſes of his Word.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The People of <hi>Nineveh</hi> believed GOD, and proclaimed a Faſt—. We are not told what particular Credentials <hi>Jonah</hi> produc'd to prove that he was a true Prophet ſent from GOD. His Preaching might be more full and particular than is here recorded; and GOD ſet it home, ſo that they were made ſenſible they had to do with the true and faithful One, whoſe Name is <hi>Jehovah;</hi> and accordingly they ſet themſelves to entreat his Favour with great Seriouſneſs. And thus we muſt believe, that the Lord is that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, holy, faithful, and merciful GOD, which he declareth himſelf to be in his Word. We muſt realiſe it, that his Word is ſure and moſt worthy of Credit, whether he threatens Evil to the Impenitent, or promiſeth Mercy to ſuch as confeſs and forſake their Sins; or we ſhall never be concern'd to ſeek his Face in a right Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> in our Approaches to him: For he that cometh to GOD, <hi>muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Heb. 11.6. Agreably, in a Time of Danger, that pious King <hi>Jehoſhaphet,</hi> ſaid to GOD's ancient People, <hi>Hear me, O Judah, and ye the Inhabitants of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall you be eſtabliſhed; believe his Prophets, ſo ſhall ye proſper.</hi> 2 Chron. 20.20. Certainly then, we who are born under the clear Light of the Goſpel Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, muſt believe the Lord our GOD ſpeaking to us in his Word, if we would attend the Duties of this Day, ſo as to obtain Mercy for ourſelves, and this diſtreſſed People. We muſt believe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004597_0012_100DA8DA5C465F70"/>
that if we go on obſtinately in our Sins, and deſpiſe the Warnings GOD has given us in his Word and by his Providences, we ſhall after our hardneſs and impenitent Heart treaſure up unto our ſelves Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath; But if we forſake the Way of Sin, and return unto the Lord, He will have Mercy and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Pardon. We muſt believe our Lord Jeſus when he ſays to us, <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> And we muſt alſo receive it as <hi>a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners,</hi> and will caſt out none that come to Him in the Exerciſe of Faith and Repentance. <hi>O</hi> that there was ſuch a Faith in us! Then we ſhould fly to GOD's Name, as to our ſtrong Tower this Day, and find Him our Defence and Refuge in the Day of Trouble. <hi>By Faith Noah being warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God of Things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his Houſe; by the which he condemned the World, and became Heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith,</hi> Heb. 11.7.</p>

               <head>II. <hi>IT is the Duty of a People to cry to GOD in Prayer with Faſting, when He threatens to bring deſtroying Judgments upon them; and their Rulers ſhould be ready to lead in the right Diſcharge of this Duty.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Thus did the Men of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> nor did their King refuſe to humble himſelf and lie in the Duſt before that Almighty GOD who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to deſtroy them. The Order given was, <q>Let Man and Beaſt be covered with Sackcloth, and cry mightily to GOD</q> This then is a moral Duty incumbent on all as GOD ſhall call.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004597_0013_100DA8DBE6A88F88"/>
GOD's ancient People practiſed it. Thus when the Children of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> came againſt <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> to Battel, he feared, <hi>and ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord, and proclaimed a Faſt,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.1,—3. And we have an Account in Scripture of more private Faſting, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.18, 20. Where we are informed that the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> and of the Phariſees uſed to Faſt. And our Lord declares that after his departure, <hi>His Diſciples ſhould alſo Faſt.</hi> And we have particular Direction about religious Faſting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. Here then, I would be a little more particular in deſcribing the Duty of Faſting and Prayer, in which we are this Day engaged.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>IN religious Faſting we muſt chaſten our Bodies, by abſtaining from Meat and Drink, and other Pleaſures which gratify the outward Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus muſt we acknowledge that we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed GOD's good Creatures, and are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the leaſt Drop and Crumb even of the Bleſſings of his common Providence. And in this Way we ought to afflict and keep under our Bodies, that our animal Appetites may be bro't into Subjection, and that our Souls may be the more deeply humbled before GOD. Indeed the Neceſſity of Perſons, reſpecting the Weakneſs of ſome Conſtitutions, is here to be regarded. However, When Perſons want only indulge their Appetites, and find their own Pleaſures when GOD calls to weeping and mourning, is ſinful and ſhameful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And GOD declares in his Word, that this is a provoking Evil, Iſai. 22.12, — 14. <hi>In that Day did the Lord God of hoſts call to weeping and to mourning, and to girding with Sackcloth: And behold Joy and Gladneſs, ſlaying Oxen, and killing Sheep, eating Fleſh, and drinking Wine; let us eat
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004597_0014_100DA8DE468AF128"/>
and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die. And it was revealed in mine Ears by the Lord of hoſts, Surely this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you till ye die, ſaith the Lord God of hoſts.</hi> And ſurely the Men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> will riſe up in Judgment againſt ſuch, and condemn them; for we find they were very ſtrict in attending theſe outward Signs and Means of Humiliation. But then, it muſt be granted that this bodily Abſtinence will Profit little, unleſs our Hearts are broken for Sin, and broken off from the Pleaſures of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IN religious Faſting we muſt <hi>afflict our Souls; have the Heart inwardly pierced, and the Spirits bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon the Account of our Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That GOD who is a Spirit, and forms the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Man within Him, looks on the Heart, and requireth us to Worſhip Him in Spirit and Truth. <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit: a broken and contrite Heart, O God thou wilt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe,</hi> Pſal. 51.17. The Call of GOD to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on a Day of ſolemn Faſting, was that, <hi>Rent your Heart,</hi> Joel 2.13. There muſt then be a deep and thorow Conviction of Sin, and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Account of it. We muſt <hi>look to Jeſus</hi> whom our Sins have pierced, and <hi>mourn as one mourneth for his only Son, and be in bitterneſs, as one that is in bitterneſs for his Firſt-born,</hi> Zech. 12.10. There muſt be Hatred of Sin, and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at it, as the accurſed Thing which ſtirs up GOD's holy Diſpleaſure againſt us. There muſt be inward Grief, becauſe GOD has been diſhonour'd and his Law broken by our Sins: <hi>That godly Sorrow which worketh Repentance,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.10. There muſt be holy Fear of GOD's Judgments. We muſt take Shame and Blame to our ſelves, and make that Confeſſion, Dan. 9.8. <hi>O Lord to us
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004597_0015_100DA8E03587EF08"/>
confuſion of Face, to our Kings, to our Princes, and to our Fathers, becauſe we have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> We muſt abhor our ſelves, lie down before GOD in deep Abaſement, and humble ourſelves under his mighty Hand: Thus muſt we go to GOD ſelf-condemned, and willing to be reconcil'd to Him upon his own Terms; looking to <hi>Jeſus</hi> as our <hi>Advocate</hi> with the Father, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Him as the <hi>Propitiation</hi> for our Sins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>WE muſt cry mightily to GOD in Prayer.</hi> Earneſt Prayer, in this and other Places of Scripture, is expreſs'd by crying to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.1. Out of the depths have <hi>I cried unto thee O Lord.</hi> Prayer is a great part of the Duty of the Day; and we muſt take Care, that it be that <hi>effectual fervent Prayer that availeth much,</hi> Jam. 5.16. In-wrought Prayer, that Prayer which is wrought in the Heart by the Holy Ghoſt. For this end, we muſt ask the Spirit of Grace and Supplication to help our Infirmities, and ſtir up the Gift of GOD in us. Thus muſt we pour out our Hearts before GOD and ſay, in moſt humble Importunity as <hi>Jacob, I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me.</hi> For GOD ſaid not to the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſeek ye me in vain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.15. And therefore, if we approve our ſelves the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Sons of that <hi>Patriarch,</hi> we ſhall alſo have Power with GOD, and prevail thro' the Merits and Interceſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: we ſhall either obtain the Bleſſing for GOD's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>Elias</hi> did, tho' a Man ſubject to like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions; or at leaſt ſhall deliver our own Souls. I might further ſet before you the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> who has given Rulers a bright Example of a publick Spirit, greatly concern'd for the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> How earneſt was he when he ſet
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004597_0016_100DA8E36D2C4520"/>
his Face to ſeek the Lord by Prayer with Faſting! Hear his repeated Cries, Ch. 9.19. <hi>O Lord hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord, hearken and do, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not, for thine own ſake, O my God.</hi> And when GOD call'd his People to ſanctify a Faſt, the divine Command is, Joel 2.17. <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them ſay, Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not thy Heritage to Reproach; that the Heathen ſhould rule over them: wherefore ſhould they ſay among the People. Where is their God?</hi> May <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> lift up their Hands with their Hearts to GOD in Prayer this Day, and receive the Bleſſing from the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>WE muſt turn, each One from his evil Way.</hi> Thus when the Exhortation given was to cry mightily to GOD, it follows; Yea, let them <hi>turn</hi> every one from his <hi>evil Way,</hi> and <hi>from the Violence that is in their Hands.</hi> And indeed, unleſs this be our Care, our Sins will cry louder than our Prayers, and provoke GOD to cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as with a Cloud, Iſa. 59.1, 2. <hi>Behold, the Lord's Hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ear heavy that he cannot hear. But your Iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your Sins have hid his Face from you, that he will not hear.</hi> And when GOD had declared to his People that he rejected their Aſſemblies and ſolemn Meetings, He gives them that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your Doings from before mine Eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, ſeek Judgment, relieve the Oppreſſed, judge the Fatherleſs, plead for the Widow,</hi> Iſa. 1.16, 17.</p>

               <p>GOD ſaw their Works, that they <hi>turned from the evil Way.</hi> — Here we may conſider,

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>What is implied in this Work of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reformation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">A. 1. It implieth, <hi>An holy and prevailing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to turn from thoſe Sins which we confeſs on the Day of Faſting.</hi> When we appear before GOD to confeſs our Sins and ask Pardon for them; if we attend this Duty in Sincerity, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that it is an evil and bitter thing that we have forſaken GOD by tranſgreſſing his Law; and we ſhall accordingly reſolve to put away this accurſed thing which ſeparates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween GOD and us, and engage to return to GOD and our Duty. Thus did GOD's People on a ſolemn Faſt. <hi>They entred into an Oath to walk in God's Law,</hi> and <hi>ſolemnly promis'd,</hi> that they would <hi>reform the Evils</hi> which had crept in among them; in taking ſtrange Wives, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning the Sabbath, in their cruel exacting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their poor Brethren, <hi>&amp;c. Neh.</hi> 9.38. 10.29,—31. And it is certainly ſeaſonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Perſons on ſuch a Day to reſolve, relying on GOD for Grace, to put away ſuch and ſuch Sins as have more eaſily beſet them, to take more Care to keep themſelves from their own Iniquity, and to reform whatever hath been contrary to GOD's Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:004597_0018_100DA8E763B13118"/>Which leads me to ſay,</p>
               <p n="2">2, It intends, <hi>That this Reſolution be put in Practice in ſincere Endeavours to put away thoſe Sins and reform thoſe Evils, which have been confeſs'd and bewail'd before God.</hi> This GOD requires of us. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, Repent and turn your ſelves from all your Idols, and turn away your Faces from all your Abominations,</hi> Ezek. 14.6. And after this manner did the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> teſtify their Repentance, when they cried to the Lord under the Oppreſſion of their Enemies. <hi>And they put away the ſtrange gods from among them, and ſerved the Lord: and his ſoul was grieved for the miſery of Iſrael,</hi> Judg. 10.16. Agreeably, When we have faſted and prayed, we muſt bring forth <hi>Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> by engaging in a thorow Reformation of all Sins of Omiſſion or Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If we have omitted religious Duties, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret or Family Prayer, Self-Examination, the Ordinances of GOD's Houſe; we muſt now conſcienciouſly attend upon them. If we have neglected the Duties of thoſe Relations which we ſuſtain towards Men, in publick or private Life; we muſt now with Care and Diligence diſcharge them. If we have committed Sins contrary to the Laws of Sobriety, Righteouſneſs and Godlineſs; we muſt labour by the Spirit to mortify them In a Word, We ſhould cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of GOD. And in order to theſe Things, we ought earneſtly ſeek to GOD to put his Laws into our Minds, and write them in our Hearts; for it is He alone that can work in us to will and to do, in beginning and carrying on this neceſſary Work of Reformation.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004597_0019_100DA8E9B8572820"/>3. <hi>That We return to God by Jeſus Chriſt; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in, love and obey Him.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Hoſeae</hi> complains, <hi>They return but not to the moſt High,</hi> 7.16. Whereas, when a Reformation is ſincere and general, we ſhall have a Regard to the Lord our GOD in it, as to our chief Good and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt End. We ſhall not be principally concern'd to ſerve a turn, and Eſcape this or the other threatned Judgment. As they, <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. And they remembred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, they did flatter him with their Mouth, and they lied unto him with their Tongues,</hi> Pſal. 7 8 34,—36. But ſhall make it our great Buſineſs to obtain Peace with GOD thro' Jeſus Chriſt the only Mediator, who has made Peace thro' the Blood of his Croſs. And then ſhall we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be ſtedfaſt in his Covenant. The Language of our Hearts muſt be as Hoſ. 6 1. <hi>Come and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up 14.3. Asſhur ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon Horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the Fatherleſs findeth mercy.</hi> We muſt return to GOD as to our Lord and Lawgiver, to obey and ſerve him; as to the Object of our Deſire and Choice, to take our full Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Him: Thus it is ſaid of GOD's People — <hi>All Judah rejoiced at the Oath: for they had ſworn with all their Heart, and ſought him with their whole deſire, and he was found of them,</hi> 2 Chr. 15.15. As to particular Perſons, It is neceſſary that they thus give up themſelves to the Lord, and then keep the Covenant of their GOD. And as to a People, conſidering them collectively,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004597_0020_100DA8EBDD930B80"/>
this muſt be their prevailing Deſire and Practice: If they are generally falſe &amp; hypocritical, they will give GOD reaſon to complain of them, as of his ancient People, <hi>O Ephraim, what ſhall I do unto thee: O Judah, what ſhall I do unto thee: for your goodneſs is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</hi> Hoſ. 6.4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Why ſhould our Days of Faſting be thus attended with ſincere Endeavours after Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">A. 1. <hi>GOD demands this of us.</hi> When that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was made, Wherewith ſhall I come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high GOD? Shall I come before him with Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?—Will the Lord be pleaſed with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rams or with Ten Thouſands of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Oyl? The Anſwer is, <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> Micah 6.8 And therefore, when GOD's People faſted in a formal cuſtomary manner, without engaging in the neceſſary Work of Reformation, GOD ſaid to them, <hi>Did ye at all Faſt unto me, even to me?</hi> And then it follows, <hi>Execute true Judgment, and ſhew Mercy and Compaſſions every Man to his Brother. And oppreſs not the Widow, nor the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the Stranger, nor the Poor, and let none of you imagine Evil againſt his Brother in your Heart,</hi> Zech. 7.8, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>GOD makes precious Promiſes to encourage and excite us to this Duty.</hi> Thus when GOD had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his People to put away the Evil of their Doings, he adds for their Encouragement, <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord: though
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004597_0021_100DA8EE68BEE498"/>
your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be white as Snow, though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land.</hi> And in the 55th Chapter we have that Exhortation enforc'd with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of full and free Pardon, V. 6, 7. <hi>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Ver. 6, 7. Surely then, we muſt be baſely ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if we are not drawn with theſe Cords of a a Man, and Bands of Love. While we refuſe to attend this great Duty, we practically deſpiſe the Riches of GOD's <hi>Goodneſs</hi> whereby He <hi>leads Sinners to Repentance.</hi> And this is another Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we ſhould engage in the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Reformation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we refuſe to repent and reform, <hi>we ſhall be condemned out of our own Mouths, and fall under the threatned Judgments of GOD.</hi> One conſiderable Part of the Duty of a Day of religious Faſting is to make an humble and penitent Confeſſion of our Sins whereby we have provoked a holy GOD to come out in Judgment againſt us, and to cry to Him for Grace that we may turn from them. Thus 'tis ſaid of GOD's People on the Day of ſolemn Faſting recorded Neh. 9. <hi>The Seed of Iſrael ſtood and confeſſed their Sins, and the Iniquities of their Fathers:</hi> 2d v. But if there be no Care to put away the Sins which we have confeſs'd, we ſhall give our Lord and Judge reaſon to ſay to us as to the wicked Servant, <hi>Out of thine own Mouth will I judge thee.</hi> Now this will be dreadful indeed, and muſt aggravate
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004597_0022_100DA8EFF5600C18"/>
our Condemnation, to be thus Self-condemned; and ſo to fall under the righteous Judgment of GOD. We have the Proof of this written for our Warning in the doleful Account which the Scripture gives of the Sin and Puniſhment of GOD's ancient Covenant People. Tho' they had their Days of <hi>Faſting,</hi> particularly on the <hi>ſeventh Month,</hi> when the High Prieſt was to make an Atonement for himſelf and the People, and enter into the holy Place within the Vail, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. Notwithſtanding this, GOD ſaid to his People, If ye will not be reformed, but will walk contrary to me, then will I alſo walk contrary to you, and will puniſh you ſeven Times for your Sins. And GOD fulfilled his Word. <hi>They mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his Words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the Wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his People, till there was no Remedy,</hi> 2 Chron 36 16. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> were deſtroyed by Fire, and GOD's People led into Captivity to <hi>Babylon.</hi> And after their merciful Reſtoration, when they had filled up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Sins by diſobeying and crucifying the <hi>Lord of Glory,</hi> and then by rejecting the Offers of the Goſpel made to them by His <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> the Wrath of GOD came upon them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and they are made an Execration and a Curſe unto this Day.</p>

and Favour to the Penitent. <hi>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen &amp; repent, and do the firſt Works; or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candleſtick out of his Place, except thou repent.</hi> Rev. 2.5. Thus GOD ſaid to the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, Take thee a Roll of a Book, and write therein all the Words that I have ſpoken unto Thee againſt Iſrael, and againſt all the Nations, from the Day I ſpake unto thee, from the Days of Joſiah, even unto this Day. It may be the Houſe of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpoſe to do unto them; that they may return every Man from his evil Way, that I may forgive their Iniquity and their Sin,</hi> Jer. 36 2, 3. GOD knew perfectly well what they would do; but then he here lets his People know how ready he was to forgive the Penitent and receive them into Favour: It's true, Such as repent may be afflicted in this Life; but then it is with the tender Compaſſion of a Father, not with the deadly wound of an Enemy. The firſt and pureſt Times of Chriſtianity were Times of Perſecution; however, while the holy <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> overcame by the Blood of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> not loving their Lives unto the Death; the Church was preſerv'd, yea increaſed and multiplied. And as to a People, conſidering them collectively, I ſuppoſe no one Inſtance can be produc'd in which GOD pour'd out his Fury to deſtroy them, while a Spirit of Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation prevail'd. And even in Times of aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Iniquity, when the Glory of GOD was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from his People, and deſtroying Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments breaking in like a Flood; GOD was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make a remarkable Diſtinction between the Penitent, and ſuch as were hardned in Sin. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Go through the midſt of the City, through the midſt of Jeruſalem, and ſet a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004597_0024_100DA8F4BA100F38"/>
Mark upon the Foreheads of the Men that ſigh and that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midſt thereof. And to the others he ſaid in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the City and ſmite: let not your Eye ſpare, neither have ye Pity,</hi> Ezek 9.4, 5.</p>
               <p>But the Time would fail me, ſhould I attempt to ſpeak particularly to this <hi>Head;</hi> and I have in part prevented my ſelf by what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid. I ſhall therefore only give a few Hints further to confirm &amp; illuſtrate the Truth before us. The faithful and true GOD <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this in His Word. When I ſay unto the Wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die: If he turn from his ſin, and do that which is lawful and right; If the Wicked reſtore the Pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the Statutes of Life, without committing Iniquity; he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die,</hi> Ezek 33.14, 15. When <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoan'd himſelf and repented, GOD manifeſted his fatherly Compaſſions to him. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf thus, Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the Yoke: Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh: I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my Youth. Is Ephraim my dear Son? Is he a pleaſant Child? For ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill: Therefore my Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are troubled for him; I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Jer. 31.18,—20. Again, When a People do thus turn from their evil Way to the Lord, <hi>They are prepar'd to receive and improve GOD's merciful Deliverance after a ſuitable manner.</hi> While a degenerate People are impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004597_0025_100DA8F6CDAC0FA0"/>
they will be ready to deſpiſe the Riches of GOD's Goodneſs and Forbearance, and to wax Wanton under ſparing Mercy. <hi>Jeſhurun waxed fat and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatneſs; then he forſook God which made him, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed the Rock of his Salvation,</hi> Deut. 32.15. But when Sin is embitter'd by the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sorrow which worketh Repentance we ſhall obſerve that Caution after GOD has ſpoken Peace, Pſal. 84.8.—<hi>Let them not turn again to Folly.</hi> Such a People will be jealous over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and for the Lord of hoſts, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to improve all His gracious Appearances for them to the Honour of his great Name. Accordingly, GOD ſays of his People, How ſhall I put thee among the Children, and give thee a pleaſant Land? And then returns this Anſwer, <hi>Thou ſhalt call me, My Father, and ſhalt not turn away from me,</hi> Jer. 3.19. Again, This Truth is evident <hi>from the happy Experience of the Penitent.</hi> We have a remarkable Inſtance before us. Now, did GOD ſpare repenting <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and will he not ſpare his repenting Covenant-People? Yes ſurely, — <hi>If their uncircumciſed Hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Iniquity: Then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob, and alſo my Covenant with Iſaac, and alſo my Covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the Land.</hi> And GOD was pleas'd to fulfill his Promiſe to his People, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. and in other Inſtances upon Record in Scripture. In a Word, The Lord JESUS our great High Prieſt, has offered a Sacrifice of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Value to make Atonement for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of his People, whether Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; and He lives in Heaven to interceed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004597_0026_100DA8F89D9545D0"/>

Let the moſt effectual Means alſo be uſed that the great Abuſe of <hi>Taverns</hi> may be reformed, that theſe be not converted into tipling and gaming Houſes for Town-Dwellers, to the Diſhonour of GOD and Hurt of the Common-Wealth. Let the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Juſtice</hi> be kept open and pure, that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may run down as Waters; and that ſuch as thirſt after Righteouſneſs may come freely, and be refreſhed. And whereas the preſent Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which embarraſs our Affairs, do very much ariſe from the Want of a ſuitable Medium of Trade, and different Apprehenſions in the Legiſlature about ſupplying the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> whereby the publick Debts are, in part at leaſt, left unpaid,

and the Country naked and defenceleſs, in this Day of Calamity and War: I can't but humbly apprehend, that this awful Frown of Providence calls aloud to you further to conſider, whether there has not been great Injuſtice and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with relation to the <hi>Bills of publick Credit</hi> which have paſs'd among us, from their ſinking and uncertain Value; and to uſe your beſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that whatever <hi>Bills</hi> ſhall paſs for Time to come in lieu of Money, may be a juſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of Exchange; for a <hi>falſe Ballance is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord; but a juſt Weight is his Delight,</hi> Prov. 11.1. Whatever Methods may be propos'd to extricate us out of our preſent Diſtreſs, Juſtice and Equity muſt be laid in the Foundation; or we may expect that the Lord who loves Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and hates Wickedneſs, will confound our Devices, and bring them to nought. But then, I preſume not in the leaſt meaſure to determine whether this or that way is right. May that GOD before whom all things are open and naked, direct <hi>Your Excellency</hi> and the <hi>whole Court,</hi> into ſuch Paths of Righteouſneſs as ſhall lead to our Deliverance and Safety; that we may neither oppreſs one another, nor become a Prey to an inſulting Enemy! May you be filled with the moſt tender and fatherly Compaſſion for your People under the preſent Diſtreſs and Danger, and do all you can to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them! And if there ſhould be a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in your Opinion about the Way, may you be enabled to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, that the GOD of Peace may be with you, who has promis'd to guide the Meek in Judgment!</p>

                  <q>O GOD! We know not what to do; but our Eyes are unto Thee. We wait upon Thee O Lord, who hideſt thy ſelf from the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> confeſſing that we thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and thy People have ſinn'd. Thy Ways are equal, our Ways have been very unequal. O Lord, Righteouſneſs belongeth unto Thee, but unto us Confuſion of Faces, as at this Day, becauſe we have ſinned againſt Thee. To the Lord our GOD alſo belongeth Mercies and Forgiveneſſes, tho' we have rebell'd againſt Him. O Lord, hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord, hearken and do, defer not, for thine own ſake, O GOD! for thy City, and thy People are called by thy Name. Look to the Face of thine Anointed, O merciful Father! Behold thy SON in our Nature, who on Earth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd a Sacrifice of infinite Merit to atone for the Sins of thy People; and now appears in Heaven, as a Lamb that had been ſlain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeding for us. We are unworthy; but the Name in which we now ask thy divine Help, is moſt worthy. O hear us, for thy Son's ſake, and ſpeak Peace to thy People. Give ear, O Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thou that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt <hi>Joſeph</hi> like a Flock, thou that dwelleſt between the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> ſhine forth. Before <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> ſtir up thy Strength, and come and ſave us. Turn us again O GOD; and cauſe thy Face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved. O remember not againſt us former Iniquities: let thy tender Mercies ſpeedily prevent us; for we are

bro't very low. Help us, O GOD of our Salvation, for the Glory of thy Name; and deliver us, and purge away our Sins for thy Name's ſake: So we thy People and Sheep of thy Paſture, will give Thee Thanks for ever; we will ſhew forth thy Praiſe to all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And would you, Our <hi>honoured Rulers,</hi> to whom I again addreſs my ſelf, have the all-wiſe-GOD preſent to ſhew you what his People ought to do in this very critical Conjuncture, and to make you the joyful Inſtruments of our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; then abide with GOD, by taking his Word for your Rule, by making His Glory your higheſt End, and by ſeeking the public-Weal in all Things. Ask of GOD a public Spirit, and by all Means labour to ſubdue a vicious Self-Love, remembring the Warning given us, 2 Tim. 3.1, 2. <hi>In the laſt Days perilous Times ſhall come. For Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous.</hi> May you have the Love of GOD and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhed abroad in your Hearts by his Spirit; and be ready to ſacrifice private Views and perſonal Intereſts to the publick Good! <hi>Shake</hi> your Hands, front <hi>Bribes</hi> of every kind, and when call'd to give your <hi>Vote,</hi> conſider ſeriouſly what is Right in the Sight of GOD, with whom is <hi>no reſpect of Perſons, or taking of Gifts;</hi> and act accordingly. And if at any Time you ſhould be tempted to this great Evil, as the beſt of Men may; ſet that Word of GOD in oppoſition to the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>He that walketh righteouſly, and ſpeaketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, he that deſpiſeth the Gain of Oppreſſion, that ſhaketh his Hands from holding of Bribes, that ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his Ears from hearing of Blood, and ſhutteth his Eyes from ſeeing Evil: He ſhall dwell on high, his

Place of Defence ſhall be the Munition of Rocks; Bread ſhall be given him, his Waters ſhall be ſure.</hi> Iſa. 33.15, 16. In this Way you ſhall obtain the gracious Preſence of GOD with you. <hi>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. And if GOD be with you and for you, who can be againſt you? What can harm you? What can be too hard for you, if the Almighty is pleas'd to own you as his Servants, and command Deliverance for his People by you? Surely the Mountains ſhall become a Plain, crooked Things ſtraight, and the Night ſhine as the Day. Let me ſay to you therefore as 2 Chron. 15.7. <hi>Be ye ſtrong, and let not your Hands be weak: for your Work ſhall be rewarded.</hi> GOD will be your Shield, and exceeding great Reward. You ſhall ſee the Good of GOD's choſen, rejoice with the Gladneſs of His Nation, and glory with his Inheritance. And when the Son of Man ſhall come in his Glory, and all the holy Angels with Him, then ſhall He ſay unto you, <hi>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me: Come ye Bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherit the Kingdom.</hi>
