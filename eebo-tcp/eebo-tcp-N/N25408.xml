         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE nature and purpoſe of this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation will be ſufficiently explained by the following extract of a letter from DR GRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GORY, in Scotland, to the Editor.</p>
            <p>"I HAVE now peruſed, with great attention and much pleaſure, the tranſlation of DR. FAUST's Catechiſm of Health, which you put into my hands a few days ago. I adhere to the favourable opinion of it which I expreſſed to you after
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:033718_0004_0FF91442BA062810"/>reading only two or three pages of it when you firſt ſhewed it me; and as in reading it over carefully, I put my marks either of aſſent and approbation, or of diſſent, or of doubt, to almoſt every propoſition in it; I can ſay, with confidence, that I think it a work of very extraordinary merit, and one that, if it were generally known in this country, might be of infinite uſe. It is, indeed, the beſt popular medical work I ever read: nor do I in the leaſt wonder at the extenſive diſtribution, and the high eſtimation of it in Germany.</p>
            <p>To the beſt of my judgment it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more ſolid good ſenſe, and more uſeful information, in leſs bulk, than any medical book I ever ſaw, from the Aphoriſms of Hippocrates to your laſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Family Phyſician incluſive;
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:033718_0005_0FF91445728B1640"/>and, what I reckon of very great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, there is leſs mixture of nonſenſe in it, which might either confound or miſlead thoſe for whoſe uſe it is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>I highly approve your benevolent purpoſe of reprinting it here, and diffuſing it as generally as poſſible.</p>
            <p>I think you ſhould print a great many copies on the cheapeſt paper, that the poor people may afford to purchaſe it, or, that thoſe in more affluent circumſtances may be encouraged to purchaſe great numbers of them, and to diſtribute them among their poor neighbours. By all means print a good number in the handſomeſt manner on the fineſt paper, to tempt fine people to buy and to read it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:033718_0006_0FF8C435CA8A5958"/>If you think my name and recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be of any uſe in promoting the diſtribution of ſuch a work, you are heartily welcome to uſe them in the moſt public manner, or even to print this letter at the beginning of it. Nay more, if you pleaſe, I will reviſe it, and ſuperintend the printing of it, and correct the preſs.</p>
            <p>If you approve of this, you muſt publiſh it under the title of "<hi>Selection</hi> from the Catechiſm of Health of DR. FAUST, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from the German, and now publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the uſe of the Inhabitants of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:" you may ſay reviſed by me if you pleaſe. I ſhould in that caſe abridge it conſiderably, by omitting ſome things which appear to me erroneous, or doubtful, or uſeleſs, or whimſical; or not ſuited to the
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:033718_0007_0FF9144CECC91E50"/>ſtate and manners of the people of this country.</p>
            <p>DR. FAUST you will obſerve has ſome whims: for example, about the very free uſe of potatoes hurting the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: Sulphur ointment being dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to health, &amp;c. (I even ſuſpect an error in the tranſlation there, of <hi>ſulphur</hi> for <hi>mercurial</hi>; which raſhly uſed is very dangerous, and may even have thoſe very bad effects which are imputed to the ſulphur, and which I never knew ſulphur produce.)</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral errors, and ſome very obſcure paſſages in the tranſlation; evidently proceeding from the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:033718_0008_0FF9144FD26945A8"/>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">It was tranſlated into Engliſh by MR. DASSE, himſelf, a German.</note> imperfect knowledge of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh language, (<hi>luxes,</hi> for <hi>luxuries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes,</hi> for <hi>repels, heavy,</hi> for <hi>ſevere,</hi> and ſo forth.) Theſe I ſhould, of courſe, correct in reprinting it.</p>
            <p>The plan for extirpating the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, &amp;c. I ſhould omit as impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, at leaſt in this country, at this time. I doubt whether it ever can ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: But ſuppoſing the Author to be perfectly right, this is not a time for ſuch a plan: And people ſhould be told, not always what is abſolutely beſt in itſelf, but what is the beſt that they <hi>can</hi> or <hi>will</hi> do: For example, as to the ſmall-pox, univerſal inoculation, and the
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:033718_0009_0FF9145250460018"/>cool regimen: And as to ſtrong liquor, not abſtaining from it altogether, (as certainly would be beſt,) but only getting drunk with ale or porter, inſtead of whiſky and gin, which are abſolute ruin to them in mind, body, and eſtate.</p>
            <p>The form of Catechiſm by no means does juſtice to the ſtrong good ſenſe, the found morality, and the rational piety of DR. FAUST: Nor can it make that ſtrong and pleaſing impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which claſſical compoſition would do, on readers of a cultivated taſte: But his ſentiments need not the aid of ornament: And the form of Catechiſm, and his frequent, and ſeemingly needleſs, repetitions are probably well ſuited to the ſtate and habits of thoſe for whoſe uſe chiefly his work is deſigned. They will
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:033718_0010_0FF914574A34FDC8"/>tend to aſſiſt the memory, and to make the impreſſion ſtronger; as well as to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the people to apply the precepts eaſily and readily. Therefore, as he made it at firſt a Catechiſm, ſo let it remain."</p>
            <p>The Editor has only to add, that the ſelection propoſed has been made, and the printing of it reviſed, by DR. GRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GORY, according to his promiſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes. To live is to enjoy happineſs and pleaſure; for life is a precious gift of the Almighty.</p>

               <p>Pſ. cxxxvi. 1, 8, 9, 25. O give thank unto the Lord, for he is good. To him that made the ſun to rule by the day; the moon and ſtars to rule by night; who gives food to all fleſh: For his mercy endureth for ever.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No. God has ſo intimately united ſoul and body, that by a rational care taken of the body, the happineſs and purity of the ſoul is increaſed.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> 8. And what are the ſenſations of the ſick? Are they like thoſe we have deſcribed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By no means; the ſick man feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf weak and languid; he has no appetite; he cannot work, nor brave wind and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They operate more or leſs powerfully to expel from the body all that is unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or to heal it wounds.</p>

                  <p>If a ſplinter ſticks in any part of the body, irritated nature produces matter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it. If the ſtomach be loaded with bile, or putrid matter, nature ſtrives to remove it by vomiting. If a perſon has broken one of his limbs, nature will ſoften the broken ends of the bone, in order that they may knit without plaſter or ſalve: but the previous aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an able ſurgeon is required to bring the broken ends of the bone in contact, and to ſecure them ſo, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which tranquillity and reſt are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>

                  <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the attendance and nurſing, the tender and affectionate treatment which a child ſtands in need of, can only be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 48. How ought infants to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and nurſed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They ought always to breathe freſh and pure air; be kept dry and clean, and plunged in cold water every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 49. Why ſo?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No. Swathing is a very bad cuſtom, and produces in children great anxiety and pains; it is injurious to the growth of the body, and prevents children from being kept clean and dry.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> They are the foundation of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; for the more the mind has ſeen, heard, and felt, and the more diſtinct its ſenſations are, the more ſenſible will man become </p>

                  <p>

                  <head>ADDRESS TO CHILDREN.</head>
                  <p>Children, brandy is a bad liquor. A few hundred years ago brandy was not known among us. About 1000 years ago, the deſtructive art of diſtilling ſpirits of wine from wine was found out; and 300 years ago, brandy was firſt diſtilled from corn. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was conſidered as phyſic. It did not, however, come into gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe till the cloſe of the laſt century, or rather till within the laſt thirty years, that it has become an univerſal beverage, to the great detriment of mankind.</p>
                  <p>Our forefathers in former times, who had no idea of brandy, were quite different people from what we are; they were much more healthy and ſtrong. Brandy, whether drunk by itſelf, or at meals, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into blood, fleſh, or bone;
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:033718_0083_0FF9157691164480"/>conſequently, it cannot give health or ſtrength, nor does it promote digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it only makes one unhealthy, ſtupid, lazy, and weak. It is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a downright falſehood, that brandy, as a common beverage, is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, good, and neceſſary. Our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers lived well without it. And as experience teaches us, that even the moſt moderate, and moſt reaſonable, give way to the baneful cuſtom of drinking every day more and more brandy, it is much better, in order to avoid temptation, to drink none at all; for, believe me, children, brandy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives all who addict themſelves to the immoderate and daily uſe of it—of health, reaſon, and virtue. It impels us to quit our houſe and home, to abandon our wives and children, and entails on its wretched votaries, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and diſeaſe, which may deſcend to the third and fourth generation.</p>
                  <p>It has been obſerved in all countries, in England, Scotland, Sweden, North America, and Germany, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the quantity of brandy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, were the evils which health,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:033718_0084_0FF9157C154A7C38"/>ſtrength, reaſon, virtue, induſtry, proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, domeſtic and matrimonial felicity, the education of children, humanity, and the life of man had to encounter.</p>
                  <p>It was this that induced an Indian in North America, of the name of Lackawanna, to ſay, that the brandy which had been introduced amongſt the Indians by the Engliſh, tended to corrupt mankind and deſtroy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> He muſt know the nature and the cauſe of the diſeaſe; it is therefore indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to acquaint him with all the circumſtances and ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, and to lay before him the whole ſtate of the patient from the beginning of it, with the greateſt exactneſs; he muſt know the conſtitution, and the manner of living, of the patient, and likewiſe every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which might have operated in produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iug the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 302. What is therefore proper?</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> That the phyſician ſee and ſpeak to the patient himſelf, and inveſtigate the nature and cauſe of the diſeaſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 303. Suppoſe certain circumſtances prevent this, what muſt then be done?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> An exact and circumſtantial ſtatement of the caſe of the patient muſt be drawn by ſome intelligent perſon and ſent to the doctor.</p>

                  <p>In order to do this properly, every houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, or, at leaſt, every pariſh, in the country, in or near which there is no phyſician, ought to be in poſſeſſion of certain rules, according to which, ſuch a ſtatement may be drawn proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That he take the medicines which

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No. As well may we expect a large tree to be cut down by one ſtroke of an axe, as a diſeaſe of any conſequence to be cured by the firſt preſcribed phyſic.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 306. If, then, the firſt preſcribed medicine does not give relief, muſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient perſevere in the uſe of it, or employ another doctor?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 308. A rich perſon is a poor, helpleſs creature, oppreſſed by anxiety and pains;— how, then, ought he to be treated?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> With the greateſt tenderneſs, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and affection; he ought to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and nurſed with great and judicious care.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="unknown:033718_0131_0FF9162C8EA55038"/>ſuffering under grievous diſeaſes, or to make great noiſe and confuſion about them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No. Sick people ought as little as poſſible to be diſturbed by talking; and every thing about them ought to be quiet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 310. Is it proper to admit viſitors, or many perſons, into the room where a ſick perſon lies?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; becauſe the air becomes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the breath and exhalations from ſo many viſitors, who generally come through curioſity, and therefore ought not to be admitted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 311. What ought to be the ſtate of the air in the rooms or chambers of the ſick?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> All ſick perſons, particularly thoſe that labour under fever, ought to breathe freſh, pure, and dry air.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 312. Is freſh air ſo neceſſary for them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes. It is indiſpenſably neceſſary for them, for it is moſt effectual in cooling and compoſing them, and diminiſhes anxiety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 313. What is further neceſſary?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the room where the ſick perſon lies be aired by keeping the window open al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole day; that the windows and
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:033718_0132_0FF91631B8211848"/>doors be thrown open occaſionally, and that all ſuperfluous, eſpecially all ſoft fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture be removed from the chamber of one ill of a fever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 314. What kind of room is beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted for a ſick perſon?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A dry, lofty and large room; not a low, narrow, damp, and muſty room: it muſt be kept clean and orderly, all duſt and naſtineſs removed, and nothing ſuffered in it that can corrupt or infect the air.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 315. Should the room of a ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be lightſome or dark?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It ſhould not be very lightſome, but rather darkiſh, as the light diſturbs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the patient.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 316. What kind of bed doth a ſick perſon require?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> An orderly and clean bed, not too warm, with covering not too heavy, bed not too ſoft, and clean linen. If ſtraw be uſed inſtead of mattraſſes, it muſt be freſh and dry, and free from all offenſive ſmell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 317. Is it good or bad for perſons ill of fevers to lie on feather beds?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is hurtful; for ſuch beds make the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:033718_0133_0FF916338741A2B0"/>fever worſe. They ſhould lie on matraſſes ſtuffed with horſe hair, or on ſtraw, covered with a light quilt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 318. May two ſick perſons, or one ſick perſon and a perſon in good health, lie together in one bed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; every ſick perſon ought to have a bed to himſelf, and, if particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances do not intervene, a room alſo—with reſpect to healthy perſons, they ought not to ſleep in the bed, or in the room, of one that is ſick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 319. May the curtains of the bed be drawn in which a ſick perſon lies?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; becauſe it deprives him of the freſh air.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 320. Ought not the bed of a ſick perſon to be ſhaken and made daily?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; a ſick perſon ought to be taken every day out of bed, when he can bear it, that the bed may be made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 321. How ought a ſick perſon to be dreſſed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> His dreſs ought to be clean and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 322. Ought not the ſheets of the bed,

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; they ought to be often changed —but the clean linen ſubſtituted ought to be well aired?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 323. How ought the bed of a ſick perſon to be placed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Not near a cold, damp wall, but in an open, free ſituation, that the perſon may be approached and aſſiſted on either ſide without inconvenience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 324. Is it proper to keep the heads of perſons ill of fevers, who are commonly very much affected with head-achs, warm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; their heads are to be kept cool and uncovered, that the head-ach and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium may not increaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 325. What are ſick perſons to drink, particularly thoſe who are afflicted with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which induce thirſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Cold, pure water, which in fevers ought to be mixed with vinegar or lemon-juice. A piece of toaſted bread may alſo, be added, being a good ingredient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 326. Is it good to warm or boil the water?</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> No; it ſhould neither be warmed nor boiled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 327. Is it proper for ſick, perſons to drink much tea?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; it is commonly hurtful to them.</p>

                  <head>OBSERVATION.</head>
                  <p>The drinking of much warm tea is alſo very hurtful to women in childbed; cold tea is preferable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 328. Do perſons ill of fever like to drink cold water?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes; cold water and freſh air are the beſt ſtrengtheners for ſuch perſons; they refreſh, and diminiſh the anxiety and pains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 329. Muſt a perſon in a fever drink much water?</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 330. Doth cold water chill a perſon afflicted with fever?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; a perſon after drinking cold water falls often into a gentle perſpiration; and warm liquids frequently produce heat without any perſpiration.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Perſons afflicted with violent fever, or who labour under any other dangerous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, loſe all appetite, and therefore are not to be preſſed to eat.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe they do not digeſt; and food remaining undigeſted in the ſtomach, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates all diſeaſes, particularly fevers.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; it is better for him to faſt; for the eating of any thing readily increaſes the diſeaſe; faſting diminiſhes it; and there is no danger of ſtarving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 334. What kind of nouriſhment is

                  <p>

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Such patients ought to be kept cool, avoiding all heat; and for that reaſon fires muſt not be made in the room where the patient lies, for his ſituation requires him to be kept more cool than warm.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; it would be acting very injudiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for by ſuch means we ſhould increaſe the number of puſtules, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the danger.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The cure muſt be left to nature, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving only, during the period of the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fever, which laſts two, three, or four days, to keep the patient cool and in freſh air, allowing him but little nouriſhment, and cold water only for drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 376. When at laſt the puſtules come out, what muſt be done in the courſe of the diſeaſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We ſhould keep the patient in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the air is pure, cool, and dry; give for drink cold water, and enjoin tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and moderation in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; it is not good in the day-time: the patient, if poſſible, ſhould keep out of bed, and at night lie in a bed that is not too warm, nor fuſty; feather-beds are therefore very hurtful to this claſs of patients.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 378. When the eye-lids are inflamed and cloſed. is it right to force them open, and apply to, or blow into, them ſpices, or other hot things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; the eye-lids muſt not be forced open, or meddled with, nor ought inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory things, which induce blindneſs, to be applied to them; but when at laſt they open of themſelves care muſt be taken that the eyes be not irritated by too much light in the room, which ſhould be kept dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, both before and after they open.

                  <p>Children, the natural ſmall-pox is a bad diſtemper—as bad as the plague? But God has, in his goodneſs, enabled man to find out a remedy for the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation of the great miſeries occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. He has led us to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant diſcovery of inoculation, which deſtroys in a great degree the virulence of this baneful diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>When children are inoculated they have only a few puſtules of the beſt kind; they are ſeldom confined to bed; ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom loſe their health; and of a hundred inoculated hardly one dies; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one out of ten of thoſe afflicted with the natural ſmall-pox generally dies.</p>

                  <head>INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO INOCULATE.</head>
                  <p>In order to inoculate a child in a good ſtate of health, a needle is dipped in a little freſh thin matter of true ſmall-pox, with few puſtules. With this needle an inciſion is made of the breadth of a ſtraw under the ſcarf ſkin of the arm above the elbow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing any blood, ſo that the matter ſhall be lodged under the upper ſkin; and this is called inoculation for the ſmall-pox.</p>
                  <p>The effect produced, and the conduct to be obſerved by the patients, are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: Having the great advantage of knowing to a certainty that the perſon inoculated will have the ſmall-pox within ten or fourteen days, the ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt regularity and temperance with regard to diet is to be enjoined.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, fifth, or ſixth day the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions become inflamed, red, thick, and hard; and from this time till the complete reſtoration of the patient to perfect health; the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="141" facs="unknown:033718_0155_0FF916891C3C0AE8"/>ought to be repeatedly waſhed every day with cold water.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh, eighth, or ninth day after the inoculation, the patient feels pains under the arm, and is attacked by head-ach, and fever; and ſometimes vomits.</p>
                  <p>This fever laſs two, three or four days, during which period the patient ſhould not remain in bed, but, though it may be very inconvenient in the beginning, walk, or be carried about, where there is freſh, pure, cool air, which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>In free and cool air, the fever and head-ach go off; and if the forehead and arms be frequently waſhed in cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, almoſt all illneſs will go off.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, third, and fourth day of the fever, or the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth day after inoculation, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times later, the ſmall-pox come forth of their own accord: they ought not to be forced to make their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>In moſt caſes there are few puſtules, which, being good, the diſeaſe is ſoon
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:033718_0156_0FF8C4D0A4EC50F8"/>at an end. The puſtules in this caſe contain little matter, and dry ſoon; and it is only neceſſary to keep the patient regular and in freſh air, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the diſeaſe from becoming dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 381. Can a perſon be infected twice by the ſmall-pox?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No; the true ſmall-pox cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the ſame perſon more than once: all ſtories of getting the infection twice are erroneous.</p>
