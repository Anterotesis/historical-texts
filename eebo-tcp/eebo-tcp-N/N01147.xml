            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>THERE are in Mr. <hi>Stoddards</hi> Preface to his <hi>Sermon,</hi> several Passages very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable. One is, his Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That those Holy men who first Planted this Land, did not acknowledge a Publick Government in the Church.</hi> Which is a mistake. For they did declare in the most Publick man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that can be, That there is a Form of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Government, which is of Divine Institution, and also what that Form is. Not only has Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> done it, in his Book of the Keys of the Kingdom, and of the Way of the Churches in <hi>New-England;</hi> And Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> in his <hi>Survey.</hi> And my Father, in his Answer to Thirty Two <hi>Questions;</hi> which goeth under the Name of the Elders of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> in his Answer to the <hi>Queries,</hi> Proposed by <hi>Apollonij,</hi> (a Famous <hi>Dutch</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Minister of the Presbyterian perswasion) a very Learned Book, and the First that ever was Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>New-England,</hi> or I suppose in <hi>America,</hi> in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. But moreover, a <hi>Synod</hi> of the Elders and Messengers of the Churches, Meeting at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> 1648. has Published a <hi>Platform of Church Discipline,</hi> Gathered out of the Word of God. Blessed Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> in his Dying Sermon, Expressed himself thus, <q>Remember that we have the Pattern in the Mount, I mean we have the Scripture as a Rule, &amp; you have <hi>the Platform of Church-Discipline,</hi> given to you in way of
<pb facs="unknown:001366_0004_0FB2927B096EA088"/>
Counsel, as the Confession of our Faith, in <hi>this way of Church-Government;</hi> that which for the Substance of it owns the <hi>Cause Congregational,</hi> if any are departed from it, let them look to it; I know none of the Elders that are receded from it. It was given many Years ago as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our Faith to this Countrey, and to the World. It is distinct from the <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> &amp; from the <hi>Presbyterian Way;</hi> from the <hi>Morellian</hi> Way, and from that of <hi>Separatism;</hi> and is for the Substance of it, precisely the <hi>Way Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional:</hi> We have the Pattern: only this is complained of, that it is not practised, tho' we had it many Years ago. Now Practice is the end of Doctrine;—Let the Churches look to it, we are all concerned herein. Our Fidelity in this cause is our Crown. See that it be not taken from us.</q> Thus spoke that Learned &amp; Holy man, who was in his time <hi>the Glory</hi> of <hi>Boston,</hi> in the <hi>Last Sermon</hi> that ever he Preached; and therefore his Words ought to have the more Weight with us. Were the <hi>Platform of Discipline,</hi> together with what was Unanimously agreed unto concerning the <hi>Conscociation of Churches,</hi> in the <hi>Synod</hi> which met in <hi>Boston,</hi> 1662, duely attended, we need no other, nor better Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than what our <hi>Blessed Predecessors</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us. It is true, That they never did acknowlege such a <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Church-Government</hi> as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and perhaps no man besides himself, would have. But there is no reason that therefore they should be Charged with <hi>Failure in not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Publick Government in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Particular in his <hi>Preface,</hi> which has given Offence, is, The Conclusion of it, desiring
<pb facs="unknown:001366_0005_0FB2927EB81C70E0"/>
the Reader, <hi>Not to act like those, who told the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, As for the Word which thou hast spoken to us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee.</hi> But is he a Prophet Divinely Inspired? Is the not hearkening to his New, and Singular Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are Contradictory not only to the Doctrine taught by the <hi>Former Ministers</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> (Prophets if ever there were any among us) but also by the whole Body of <hi>Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> in the most Reformed Churches, a Sin like that of the <hi>Jew,</hi> who regarded not what the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired Prophet delivered to them in the Name of the Lord. When we are satisfyed that his New Doctrine is according to <hi>the Word of the Lord,</hi> we will readily hearken to it, and say as a great Man among the <hi>Reformers</hi> did, <hi>Veniat, Veniat verbum Dei, et si nobis Essent Sexcenta colla, Subijceremus.</hi> In the mean time, we shall endeavour to Examine all things, <hi>and hold fast that which is good.</hi> There have been some who by reading the Books of their <hi>Antagonists,</hi> have been brought over to their Perswasion. <hi>Vergerius</hi> took <hi>Calvins</hi> Institutions into his hands purposing a Confutation of it, but was himself confuted by it. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed an Answer to Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> Book of the Keys, but upon a serious consideration of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself to be of the same judgment. Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> (a Worthy Divine) by a Book which Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> Wrote against some of his Opinions, was brought off from his <hi>Rigidity</hi> in divers Points, Lately in <hi>Holland,</hi> a Learned man whose Name was <hi>Christopher Christopher,</hi> Published a Book in which he ascribes to Angels things Peculiar to the Holy and Eternal Spirit. Dr. <hi>Witsius,</hi> now Professor of Divinity in the University of <hi>London,</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:001366_0006_0FB2928037941E70"/>
Wrote against him, and he was thereby Reduced from his Errors. I Expect no such thing from Mr. <hi>S.</hi> He that has slighted Mr. <hi>Gillespies</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will doubtless do so by mine. Yet would it be no Dishonour for him to change his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>Nullus pudor ad mepiora transire.</hi> However, I hope that by this <hi>Collision</hi> the Truth will gain, and the Churches be more Established, in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the Doctrine which they have accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>to the Word of the Lord,</hi> been Taught by those Blessed men, who now rest from their Labours. And it is a rejoycing to me, in that I know I shall by what is here done, obtain the Blessing of the Prayers of many Godly Souls in these Churches, which I value above all the Gold in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding his <hi>Errors</hi> (for so I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them) in the <hi>Controverted Questions,</hi> I esteem him a Pious Brother, and an Able Minister of the New Testament, a Serious Practical Preacher, in his Ministry designing the Conversion and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Souls of men; and as such, I do, &amp; shall Love and Honour him: and hope that we shall in the Lords time, meet where <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zwinglius</hi> differ not in their Opinions.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> Published a Discourse, in which he maintains, that a <hi>Doctrinal Faith</hi> without a <hi>Justifying Faith,</hi> gives right to the Sacrament; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> said of him, <hi>If he be angry at my speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things, I cannot help it; I am bound to tell him as a Faithful Brother, that I doubt God is angry at his Doctrine, &amp; the great Wrong he does the Church of God thereby.</hi> So say I to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> I believe that by his <hi>Sermon,</hi> he has grieved the Holy Spirit of God in the Hearts of many of his Children; and that he has pleased and gratified the Spirit of the
<pb facs="unknown:001366_0007_0FB29281D24FC650"/>
World. If Blessed <hi>Cotton, Eliot, Mitchel</hi> &amp; other Servants of the Lord, once among us, but now among <hi>the Spirits of Just men made Perfect,</hi> were still Living on the Earth, how would they be grieved to see such a <hi>Sermon</hi> Printed in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land!</hi> But God for Wise and Holy Ends, has left this Brother to unhappy Mistakes. And there have been men of Eminent Piety, and in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much beyond him and me, and that in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableness to the Interest of Christianity in the world, have far Excelled us both, who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less have been left to greater Errors, than any thing Published in Mr. <hi>S. his Sermon,</hi> or in his <hi>Discourse of Instituted Churches;</hi> or in his <hi>Plea for Tithes.</hi> I might Instance in <hi>Tatian</hi> (who was <hi>Justin Martyrs</hi> Scholar) and in <hi>Origen Bardasenes,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Nor are any of the Fathers (as they use to be called) who have written much, free from mistakes; and some of them great ones. <hi>Austin</hi> (then whom there was not a greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them) Published a Book of <hi>Retractions.</hi> So did Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> not long before he went unto his <hi>Everlasting Rest.</hi> In which Book, I perceived by Discourse with him a few Weeks before his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease, he took great satisfaction. It would be no Dishonour to the Name of that great Man, if he had written more <hi>Retractions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us <hi>abide in the Truth.</hi> The Lord help us all, especially those of us who are (as I am) hastning out of the World, <hi>To hold fast that we have, that no Man take our Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Quotations,</hi> in the subsequent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, they are not mentioned as tho' the Cause did at all depend on Humane <hi>Authorities. To the Law and to the Testimony, if they speak not according
<pb facs="unknown:001366_0008_0FB292845247F650"/>
to that, there is no light in them.</hi> But for two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I have thought it necessary to produce them. One is, That so the Churches may see, that <hi>the impleaded Doctrine</hi> is <hi>a New, Up-start, Singular O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</hi> And the other is, Because several of the <hi>Authors</hi> cited, Confirm what they Assert with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and Irrefutable Arguments. In the mean time, they who have given out, That there is <hi>nothing but the Judgment of Authors,</hi> can be brought to Confute the Novel Doctrine, will here see that, and themselves too, Confuted from clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and plain Reasons.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his <hi>Sermon</hi> is a <hi>Melancholy Subject,</hi> since it tends to the <hi>Deformation</hi> of these Churches. I was the rather willing to Conclude my <hi>Disserta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> with a Comfortable <hi>Appendix,</hi> relating to the Great <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> now (I hope) at the Door. It will (I doubt not) shortly appear, whether the design of Providence in Planting Churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> was not (according to Mr. <hi>Brightmans</hi> Prophesy, and as other Eminent men have Conjectured) to shew unto the World a <hi>Specimen,</hi> of what shall more Generally obtain <hi>in the Glorious Times Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

            <p>There is a late Writer, who has made some Attempts on the <hi>Revelation.</hi> He would perswade the World, that <hi>Anti-christ</hi> shall Reign yet these Three Hundred Years. If he had said Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, he might have produced as good Reasons for it, as he has done when he tells us of 2018. He quarrels with Mr. <hi>Medes Apocalyptical Scheme:</hi> which farmore Learned and Judicious men than himself, yea, &amp; Forreign Divines too, have not only approved but applauded &amp; admired. In his own
<pb facs="unknown:001366_0009_0FB294EB112D4EF0"/>
Opinion, he has out-done all the Men in the World, who have been before him. <hi>Old Joseph Mede,</hi> (as he speaks) and Mr. <hi>Whiston,</hi> &amp; the Bishop of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> too,(<hi>Quanta Nomina!</hi>) are but Dwarffs in the Eyes of this Giant. He would have us think, that the Notion of <hi>the Saints of the First Resurrection,</hi> their Reigning with Christ a Thousand Years, <hi>not on Earth but in Heaven,</hi> was his <hi>

B. <hi>Peganius,</hi> in his <hi>Explication</hi> of the Apostle <hi>Johns Visions,</hi> p. 242, 243, 259. as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted it long before him. And <hi>Piscator</hi> also in his <hi>Commentary</hi> on the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> who brings strong Reasons for a Liternal Interpretation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection spoken of, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. In which another singularly Learned man, (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Alstedius de mille Annis,</hi> p. 228, 229.) concurs with him, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless has endeavoured a Refutation of his Notion, that that Reign will be in Heaven only, but not on Earth. This new Writer <hi>Wonders</hi> that no body in the World but himself, should know that Popery began in the Year 758. And if it had been true, I should have wondred at it also. In the mean time, it is to be wondred at, that any one should think, that <hi>the Man of Sin</hi> was not Born into the world, until he was become a strong stout Man, able to supplant Kings, &amp; overset Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. I shall say nothing of this Authors Extolling several Corrupt <hi>Arminian Annotators, as the best Expositors;</hi> nor of his mis-interpreting clear Texts of Scripture, that prove Justification by the <hi>Imputed Righteousness of Christ only;</hi> which Doctrine Protestants generally have asserted &amp; maintained against the Papists: nor of the <hi>Nestorianisme,</hi> which I understand is in another of his Books, that I have not seen; but I cannot but take notice of

Until he brought them to Light. <hi>P.</hi> 37. There is such a Nauseous tang of Vain-glory, scattered up and down in his Writings, as I must confess has made me quite Sick of him. And his <hi>Scheme</hi> on the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> is the most Fanciful and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious of any that I have met with.</p>
            <p>He thinks, that the <hi>Tenth part of the City,</hi> spoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13. is fallen, and that it fell when <hi>Constantinople</hi> was taken, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1453. That the Seven Thousand Names of men, were the <hi>Eastern</hi> Nominal Christians: That the Dead Bodies of the Slain Witnesses, were the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtines</hi> in <hi>Bobemia,</hi> who complied with the Papists. He says, that the Witnesses are Risen long ago; that they Rose <hi>A. D.</hi> 1516. A World of such Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies he has; the <hi>Recitation</hi> whereof is a sufficient <hi>Refutation</hi> of them. If the Resurrection of the Witnesses was past so long agô, how is it that there have been since that, such General Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Witnesses? <hi>Alstaedius</hi> observes, that in the Space of Forty Years, from the Year 1540. the Papists Slew and Martyred, no less than Nine Hundred Thousand Protestants. Have not the Witnesses in these late Years been Slain in <hi>France, Piedmont, Hungary</hi> and in some Provinces in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many?</hi> Not to speak of other Lands.</p>

It is not good to be Over-positive in the Computation of Times, since altho' the Scripture cannot Deceive us, Historians may. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in Discourse with Mr. <hi>Beverly</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> about his 1697.

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <head>The Assertions in Mr. Stoddards Sermon which are Offensive. The Question rightly Stated. The Negative to his New Notions maintained. The first Argument against them Produced. That his Sentiments are contrary to many Scriptures in both Testaments. Such as were Ceremonially Unclean might not meddle with Holy Things. The Gentiles would not Permit those whom they Esteemed Unholy to be concerned in their Sacred Mysteries.</head>
            <p>IN Mr. <hi>Stoddards</hi> Sermon on <hi>Exodus</hi> xii. 47, 48. lately Published, there are many Passages which have given Offence to the Churches in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England,</hi> as being contrary to the Doctrine which they have learned from the Scriptures, and from those blessed Servants of the Lord, who were the Instruments in the hand of Christ in building Sanctuaries
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001366_0014_0FB294F9F6533230"/>
for His Name, in this part of the Earth. But there are Especially two Heterodox As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions therein; One is, <hi>That Sanctification is not a necessary qualification to Partaking in the Lords Supper.</hi> The other is, <hi>That the Lords Supper is a Converting Ordinance;</hi> Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That Persons who know themselves to be in an Unregenerate Estate, may &amp; ought to approach unto the Holy Table of the Lord, whilest they remain in their Sins. For the right Stating of the controversy, we must remember that the Question is not (as some of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Arguings do insinuate) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church must certainly know that those whom they admit to their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are Sincere in their Profession of Faith, and Repentance; for God only knows the hearts of all men. Nor is the Question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Christian must have Assurance of his being in a good Estate before his Partaking; for that Ordinance is appointed for true tho' weak Believers, that so their Faith may be Strengthened. And there are many weak but true Believers, who have not Assurance, and for them with due Preparation to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Lord in this holy Institution, is the way to obtain Assurance. Nor is the Question, Whether Persons Orthodox in Judgment, and not Scandalous in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, are not to be Esteemed as true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001366_0015_0FB294FB98B7D9B0"/>
To Affirm that would not be an Error comparable to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Positions. I conceive more than that, or then a meer Negative Righteousness, is requisite as a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for Rational Charity, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is a Work of Saving Grace wrought in the Soul: The Scripture acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth none to be Righteous, but such as <hi>Positively</hi> do Righteousness, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 7. And Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himself complains of those who judge men to be <hi>Converted because <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Civilly &amp; Religiously.</hi> But the Question is, <hi>Whether God requires Unsanctified Persons while such, to come to his Table;</hi> and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Whether the Church may admit into their Holy Communion in Special Ordinances, such as are not in the judgment of rational Charity, true Believers?</hi> This being the Question, I maintain the Negative.</p>
            <p>My first Argument shall be that which being Cleared, may be <hi>Instar Omnium;</hi> it is this, <hi>Assertions which are contrary to many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ought not to be received by the Churches.</hi> But the impleaded Assertions are contrary to many Scriptures. I begin with a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is like a flaming Sword to keep all Unregenerate Persons from daring to approach unto the Holy Table of the Lord: It is in, Mat. 22. 11, 12. <hi>And when the King came in to see the Guests, he saw there a man
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001366_0016_0FB294FDE21AB298"/>
which had not on a Wedding Garment; and he faith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a Wedding Garment? And he was speechless.</hi> When it is said, <hi>How camest thou in hither?</hi> It is as much to say, Thou art a bold Intruder, thou oughtest not to be here. It is then Evident, that they who come to the Lords Table without a Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are Guests more bold than welcome. The Church is the House where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Feast is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. 'Tis true, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> added to <hi>Invite all;</hi> but (as our Great <hi>Cotton</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Holiness of Church Members.</hi> p. 64.</note> observes) they were not commanded, <hi>to bring all into the House;</hi> but such as in <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> put on the Wedding Garment. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the Servants themselves would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the Lord by bringing in such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet Guests to his Holy Table. As he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the Guest that presumed to come without the Wedding Garment, so he must needs be offended with the Servants for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting him with such a Guest, had not they who are not able to discern as their Lord can, thought him to be adorned with that Garment. Could the Guest have said, The Servants found me in my Rags, and commanded me in their Lords Name to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001366_0017_0FB294FF55227238"/>
come; if they had not also required him to put on the Wedding Garment in order to his coming to their Lords Table, he would not have been speechless. For he might have said, I was commanded to come; and therefore why am I taxed for coming? The scope of the Parable is (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Disputation of Right to Sacraments.</hi> p. 129, 144.</note> observes) to show, that he who Invited them to come, did intend that they should come with that Preparation as is suitable to the Nature, &amp; for the Honour of the Master of the Feast: otherwise they would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to a greater Punishment than those that never came. Now by the Wedding Garment, Faith in the Righteousness of Christ, and Inherent Sanctification also, is doubtless intended. To <hi>Come in hither,</hi> is to come into the Church. It remains then, that the Lord will Condemn those men who come into his Church, and so to his Holy Table without true Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Learned Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Aarons Rod.</hi> p. 570.</note> replies to Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> who maintained (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> does) that the Lords Supper is a Converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; that if it were so, the intruding Guest needed not to have stood speechless, when the King said to him, how camest
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001366_0018_0FB29500BB75B5D0"/>
thou in hither? Mr. <hi>Prin's</hi> Divinity (Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Divinity say I) might have put the answer into his mouth, I thought it to be a Converting Ordinance, and that thou wouldest not have Condemned those that came without a Wedding Garment, since here at the Marriage Feast they may get one. Another Scripture, (and a terrible one it is) which is very contrary to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his impleaded Assertions, is that, 1 Cor. II. 27, 29. <hi>Whosoever shall Eat this Bread, &amp; Drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the Body &amp; Blood of the Lord. He that Eats &amp; Drinks unworthily, Eats &amp; Drinks Damnation</hi> (or Judgment) <hi>to himself.</hi> The last mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Judicious and Learned Authors argues very rationally; that if the unworthiness of a particular Act in respect of the manner of doing it, may make a man Guilty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to Judgment, how much more the unworthiness of his Person? He that in respect of his state is an unworthy person, will not eat &amp; drink worthily, or with a due meetness &amp; preparedness for such an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: But this is true of every Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man. He that is yet in his Sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true Repentance for them, and that has not an interest in Christ by Faith is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and therefore will Eat and Drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily at the Lords Table, if he shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001366_0019_0FB295034805C1B8"/>
to come thither. A particular act of Ungodliness may render a man unworthy; that is to say, unmeet to partake at the Lords Table. A Church-Member falling into a scandalous Sin is justly kept from the Sacrament, until he has manifested sincere Repentance: Then surely they that are in a state of Ungodliness, and that never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of any Sin, are not worthy or meet Communicants. If impenitence for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sin makes a man unfit for the Lords Supper, certainly impenitence under a state or course of sin does so much more. As long ago as the famous Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> it was given as a Rule, that they who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Communion, should as to <hi>their inward State be true Penitents,</hi> which therefore should be Enquired into. And it is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that men who have not true Faith, do at the Lords Table Eat and Drink Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to themselves. The Words of the Twenty-ninth Article are these, <hi>The Wicked and such as are void of a lively Faith, altho' they do carnally and visibly press with their Teeth,</hi> (as S. <hi>Austin</hi> sayes) <hi>the Sacrament of the Body &amp; Blood of Christ, yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ, but rather to their Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do Eat and Drink, the Sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.</hi> In the Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001366_0020_0FB2950C2482F450"/>
in <hi>Ireland, Anno</hi> 1615, are the same words. And is it not strange, that when Protestants in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Ireland</hi> insert among the Articles of their Religion, that if men who have not a lively Faith partake of the Sacrament, they Eat and Drink Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to themselves, a Minister in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England,</hi> shall say to those who have not a lively Faith, you need not fear any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for your coming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in your state of Unbelief? Moreover, the Apostles Words, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> II. 28. are contrary to the New Doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being a Converting Ordinance, and that Unsanctified Men, notwithstanding they know their Unregeneracy, should ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to partake of it; <hi>Let a man Examine himself, and so let him Eat of that Bread, and Drink of that Cup.</hi> What must he Examine himself about? Is it not whether he has Grace in his Soul? And whether he is a person duely Qualified for so Sacred an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? If then upon Examination he finds that he has not any Gracious Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, ought he to Eat of that Bread, &amp; Drink of that Cup? Yea, (says Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) <hi>For 'tis not said, let him Examine whether he should eat or forbear; but the meaning is, That be should Examine what need he has of it.</hi> But does not the Apostle himself plainly enough tell
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001366_0021_0FB2950D8591BC48"/>
us, what he means by this Self-Examination? 2 Cor. 13. 5. <hi>Examine your self whether you be in the Faith: Prove your own selves, know you not your own Selves: how that Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?</hi> That is to say, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not approved of. In the continuation of Mr. <hi>Pools</hi> Annotations, the Judicious Dr. <hi>Collings,</hi> (for I am well assured that he Wrote the Annotations on the Epistles to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> as well as on a very great part of the New-Testament besides) has a solid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Scripture now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. His Words are these: <q>He is to Examine himself about his Knowledge, whether he rightly understands what Christ is, what the Nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, what he doth in that Sacred Action; about his Faith, Love, Repentance, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Obedience, whether he be Such an One, as God hath Prepared that holy Table for, it is the Childrens bread, &amp; not for Dogs, a Table Christ hath Spread for His Friends, not for His Enemies. And so let him eat, having so Examined himself, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Whence it appears, that neither Children in Age, nor Understanding, nor Persons nor in the use of their Reason, nor Unbelievers, nor Persons under the guilt of Sins not repented of, have any Right to the Lords Supper accordingly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001366_0022_0FB2950F12838850"/>
was the Practice of all the Primitive Churches, and all Rightly Reformed Churches.</q> This is sound Divinity, but not like Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Sermon. The Name of Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Burroughs</hi> (who when a Student in <hi>Immanuel Colledge,</hi> in the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was our famous Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil) is and ought to be Precious among the Churches in <hi>New-England.</hi> Because it is my design to endeavour the Establishment of the Churches <hi>in the Present Truth;</hi> I am willing to cause some Passages in an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Book of that Gospel Preacher to be Transcribed. Thus he speaks: <note n="(d)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gospel Worship,</hi> p. 233, 234.</note> 
               <q>This Ordinance, it is the Ordinance of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Nourishment, of eating the Flesh of Christ, &amp; drinking his Blood in a Spiritual way. Now it must needs Suppose that first there must be Life, before there can be any Nourishment received in. If it be appointed to nourish and increase Grace, then surely there must be Grace before; What nourishment can a dead Child take? The very first thing that is to be done is nourishment here: The Word hath power to convey Life, and then to nourish, but we Read of no such thing here, but that which is to be done here, is presently to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001366_0023_0FB295108CCD63B8"/>
feed, to Eat and to Drink, that is the End of the Sacrament; therefore it must be supposed, that thou must have Spiritual Life, there must come no Dead Soul to this Ordinance, but those who are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, they must come for nourishment. The act here required doth Note, That only those that are Holy &amp; Godly can receive this Sacrament; we are required by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle to <hi>Examine our Selves:</hi> To Examine our Selves of what? It must be of our Godliness, Examine what Work of God hath been upon the Soul, how God hath brought the Soul to Himself, and what Graces of the Spirit of God are there, &amp; how we have been brought into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. Now if only those can receive Worthily, and are to come that first Examine themselves, then certainly Such only as are Godly are to come, for they only can perform those acts that are required. It is a Sacrament of Communion with God, &amp; Communion with the Saints, <hi>Now what Communion hath Light with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?

but your Children and Friends: So they must be the Children of God, and the Friends of God; those that are reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God in the Blood of his Son, and those that are his Children, that must sit at his Table: therefore they must be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q> Thus blessed Mr. <hi>Burroughs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scriptures which have been already mentioned, are a sufficient Confirmation of the Truth, in opposition to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions. In another Discourse of his, he supposeth (as did Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> the famous Separatist in <hi>Amsterdam</hi>) that we must fetch our <hi>Schemes</hi> of Church Discipline out of the Old Testament, and not out of the New only. By the way, if it be so, why does he in that other Discourse, maintain that there is no Scripture for a <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant,</hi> when the Old Testament speaks so much of it, as has rendred it needless to be expresly required in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But let us consider, whether there are not Scriptures in the Old Testament, which his Notions do not at all comport with. What else shall we say to that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 12. Where Christ compares his Church to a <hi>Garden inclosed, a Spring shut up, a fountain sealed?</hi> But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Doctrine has a tendency to break down the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and lay it open to the Wide World,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001366_0025_0FB295139534C988"/>
for almost all comers to enter into it. Our Saviour Christ invites his <hi>Friends</hi> to Feast with him at his Table, Cant. 5. 7. <hi>Eat O Friends, Drink O Beloved.</hi> Unregenerate persons are not his Friends, nor does he take Complacency in them, so as to invite them to sit down with him at his Table. Christ would have the Gates of his Church <hi>set open that the Righteous Nation who keeps the Truth may enter in,</hi> Isa. 26. 2. How contrary is this to those that would open the Doors of the Church to a Nation of Unconverted men, and who invite those who they think have no Sincerity, or truth of Grace in their Hearts to enter in? There is another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Old Testament, which relates to New Testament times, tho' expressed in Old Testament Phrases. It is that, in Ezek. 44. 7, 9. <hi>You have brought into my Sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in Heart, and uncircumcised in Flesh, to be in my Sanctuary, to pollute it, even my House, when you offer my Bread, the Fat, and the Blood, and they have broken my Covenant;—Thus faith the Lord God, No stranger uncircumised in Heart, shall enter into my Sanctuary.</hi> The Jewish <hi>Masters</hi> inform us, that their Fathers were very strict in their admitting Proselytes: <note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>v. Ainsworth</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</note> they say they admitted no Proselytes in <hi>Davids</hi> time,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001366_0026_0FB29515028D07C8"/>
left they should joyn themselves to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of Fear: Nor in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, lest they should come because of the great Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity which <hi>Israel</hi> then had. They say, He that comes for any of the Vanities of the World, is no <hi>Righteous Proselyte.</hi> It seems by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Jews were grown remiss in their admitting Proselytes, and for this the Lord was offended with them. If the Lord was displeased with those Ministers, who brought into his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary men uncircumcised in Flesh, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised in Heart, most certainly, He is not pleased with those Ministers under the New Testament, who would admit either Unbaptised or Unregenerate persons to his Holy Table. The Church is Gods Sanctuary. Unregenerate persons are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised in Heart: The Holy God is offended with those Ministers that would fill his Church and his Table with persons which they themselves think are Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in Heart. Moreover, We read in the Old Testament, That <hi>Porters were set at the Gates of the House of the Lord, that none who were Unclean in any thing should enter in,</hi> 2 Chron. 23. 19. Was not the Temple a Type of the Visible, as well as of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Church? Did not this signify, that Officers in the Churches should be careful
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001366_0027_0FB2951679BCAB90"/>
that those who are Morally Unclean, <hi>either as to their Conversations,</hi> as Scandalous persons are, <hi>or as to their State,</hi> as Unregenerate men are, ought not to have the Church Doors set open to them? There are other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Old Testament inhibiting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der severe Penalties, such as were Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially Unclean from partaking of Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Lev. 7. 20. <hi>The Soul that eats of the Flesh of the Sacrifice of Peace Offerings that pertain unto the Lord, having his Uncleanness upon him, that Soul shall be cut off from his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Have not all Unregenerate persons their Uncleanness upon them? Is not the Lords Supper a Commemoration of a Blessed Sacrifice? Then this awful Commination concerns them, if they shall presume to Eat of that Sacrifice! We read particularly that such as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean might not Eat the Passover, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 28. Does not this Typifie that they who are Unclean either in course of Life or in State, should not come to the Lord's Supper? To this Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Answers, <hi>That the Ordinance, of the Old Testament, were not Types of the Ordinances of the New-Testament.</hi> Surely, He knows that all Divines who have Written on the <hi>Types</hi> affirm what he denies, he had need to bring some solid reason, for the Refutation

By nothing but <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> his usual way of <hi>Demonstration</hi> is a meer Dogmatical <hi>Affirmation</hi> without any Proof at all. <hi>Fateor vetera Sacramento fuisse figuras non modo Christi sed et nostrarum Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum,</hi> saith the incomparable <note n="(f)" place="bottom">

And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> does expressly declare it, notwithstanding Mr. <hi>S.</hi> has made bold to contradict him.

If the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Old-Testament were not Types, then the Passover was not a Type of the Lords Supper: But it was so in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. The Israelites Eating the Paschal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lamb, Typified our feeding upon Christ by Faith in the Lords Supper; they were to Eat it with bitter herbs, signifying that we should come to the Lords Supper peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently mourning bitterly for our Sins: The Jews might not have any Leaven in their Houses at the time of the Passover, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that those who eat the Lords Supper should come without the Leaven of Malice or Hypocrisy in their Hearts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.

received to that Holy Ordinance. It has by great Divines been thought a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, if the Jews were kept from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in the Sacrifices, and from entering into the Temple, and from Eating the Passover on the account of Ceremonial Impurities, then men now may be kept from the Sacrament in case of moral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities. A good Argument this must needs be, since the Apostle himself does Argue after that manner, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16, 17. compared with <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 11, 12. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Pretends, <hi>That this appointment that unclean Persons might not come to the Passover, did signify that those who are Spiritually Unclean shall be Excluded out of Heaven.</hi> Thus did <hi>Erastus</hi> (the most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Writer on the subject of Church Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline that ever appeared in the World) say long before him. Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> replies to him, that if the shutting one out of Heaven were the only thing signified thereby, there would not be a fit analogy between the Type and the thing Typified; for a Jew might be excluded out of the Temple and from holy Things, and yet be admitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: but we cannot say so of Exclusion out of Heaven. To Conclude this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the light of Nature dictates unto men, that unholy Persons should not meddle with Holy Things. Hence even the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles

would not suffer those whom they esteemed Unholy to be concerned in their <hi>Sacred Mysteries:</hi> They would say, <hi>Procul O Procul este Profani;</hi> the <hi>Eleusinian</hi> Mysteries (tho' most abominable) were by them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted most sacred, and <note n="(i)" place="bottom">

            <head>The Second Argument Propounded. They who are not fit to be admitted Members in Particular Churches, are not qualified for Admission to the Lords Table. Unsanctifyed Persons are not fit Materials for a Gospel Church; Proved by several Scripture Arguments.

               <hi>Strange Doctrine,</hi> the Confutation whereof I have (by the help of Christ) undertaken, that were sufficient, how much more when there are so many? Nevertheless, I hope some Readers will <hi>remember what they have received and heard,</hi> and be Confirmed in the Old Truths, if we proceed to some further Arguments, which are built on a Scripture Foundation.</p>
            <p>I then in the second Place argue thus, <hi>They that are not duly Qualified to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Particular Gospel Churches, are not fit to be admitted to the Lords Supper.</hi> This will be readily yielded, so that it is needless to spend time in the Proof of it. I will not deny but that persons may be admitted to Baptism on the account of their being of the Visible Church, which many are, tho' not in Fellowship with any Particular Church. This was the Judgment of our Famous Dr. <hi>Owen;</hi> as himself assured me, in Letters I had from him Forty Years ago, and I remember that in one of his Printed Books he affirms it. <q>And that he is so far from confining Baptism to a particular Church, as that he does believe that no Member of a particular Church was ever regularly Baptised, because Baptism pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes Admission into a particular Church. Professing Believers and their Seed

have right to Baptism, whether they are of any particular Church or no, on the account of their Relation to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Visible Church.</q> Certain it is, that the Apostles Baptised many who were not joyned to any particular Church, as I have <note n="(k)" place="bottom">

But the Lords Supper may not be Administred to any, who are not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of some particular Instituted Church: Nor indeed to them, except in a Church Assembly, 1 Cor. 11. 20. <hi>Papists</hi> allow the Dispensation of this Ordinance unlimited. They approve of <hi>Private Masses,</hi> supposing the Priest and one more to be enough for Administring the Eucharist. Episcopal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines also allow of Private Communion.

I proceed to <hi>Assume, Unsanctified Persons are not fit to be Admitted Members in Particular Churches.</hi> None but such as are (so far as men exercising a due Charity are able to judge) Sincere Converts, or True Believers on Christ, ought to be received into tho Churches. Rough Stones were not laid in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, but such as were hewen,

Every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Evangelical Church is a Temple of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16, 17. The Church in <hi>Ephesus</hi> was the House of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. To admit Unholy Persons into his House, cannot but offend him, who has said, That <hi>Holiness becomes his House for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> Psal. 93. 5. Unsanctified Persons are unbecoming his House, and unmeet to be there. Churches ought to receive into their Communion <hi>all and only</hi> such as they may reasonably hope that the Lord has received them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. It is said concerning the Primitive Christian Church at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, that the Lord added to <hi>the Church such as should be Saved, Acts</hi> 2. 47. Ought not the Lords Stewards to be faithful in his House, and to do nothing therein but as they see the Lord going before them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving whom He receiveth, and refusing whom He refuseth? But this they do not if they add to their Churches, such as they themselves Judge not to be in a State of Salvation. If (says that venerable man of God Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>

Church Ignorant, or Profane, or Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Men, we might venture to do so too. But there is no such Word in all the Bible: Altho' His Holy Providence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits many such to get into Churches, it is not with His good liking but the contrary. Were not the Servants guilty of a culpable and Sinful sleepiness, when Tares were manifestly appearing in the Lords Field: It pleaseth Christ to see good Seed in His Field, but it is pleasing to His Enemies to see Tares there, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 24, 25. They then that care not how many Tares spring up in the Lords Field offend him, and gratify his great Enemy who delights to see it so, and rejoyceth when he hears men pleading to have it so: Which truly is a sad Thought, and I wish men of such Principles would lay it to heart, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom it is that such Unsanctifyed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples Please, &amp; who is displeased with them. But to go on: Were not those who were the Members constituent of Particular Churches in the Apostolical Times, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and in the judgment of rational Charity, Godly Converted Persons?

(says he) <hi>They unto whom the Gospel came Embraced the Word Sincerely, or else to see to, as far as Paul, and others could Judge then they were a true Church. There must be a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of People that do profess the Pure Religion and make it appear, at least in the Judgment of man, that they are Godly in Christ Jesus: This is an inseparable mark of a true Church as we see,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33.

When there was a Particular Church first Gathered at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Members Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent of it, Were <hi>Saints and Faithful in Christ Jesus,</hi> Ephes. 1. 1. These things cannot be denied. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> has the strangest No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ever was heard of in the World.

Had he said, Visible Saints, and Seemingly Called, but not Really and Inwardly such in the sight of God, may be accepted by the Church, he would have affirmed, that which no body will contradict; but as he express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, his Notion is <hi>Contradictio in adjecto,</hi> ae notorious Contradiction of it self.

It is true, that Hypocrites were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Churches in the Apostles days: But that was because they were not known to be such; for if they had they would not have received them.

Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> in his excellent Treatise of the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Church Members,</hi> argues thus; Such as are destructive to the state of the Church, are not fit Materials for the building of the Church: But this is true of Hypocrites. They are dead Members in the Body, like dead Branches in a vine, whom the Lord will cast off, and destroy the Church with them, when they grow numerous, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 17.

faithful Brethren; therefore such Members and such only are we to admit into our Churches: Thus Mr. <hi>Cotton.</hi> Now if we may not admit any others into our Churches, than we may not administer the Sacrament unto them.

            <head>The Third Argument Produced. God allows of none to come to the Lords Supper, but such as have a right unto it, Unsanctified Persons have no right to that Ordinance, Coram deo, they are not really in Covenant with God; Therefore have no right to the Seal of the Covenant: The Grace Exhibited and Sealed in the Lords Supper they have no Title unto, therefore they have no Right to the Sign.</head>
            <p>WE have done with the Second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which refutes Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001366_0040_0FB2953185823F70"/>
Assertions, and proveth the contrary. We proceed to a third Argument, which is this;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If men meddle with that which they have no right unto, they have not a Divine allowance for their doing so.</hi> We cannot suppose that the Presumption of men in laying a claim unto that which they have no right unto, has a Divine Approbation. But Unsanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have no true right to the Lords Supper. They that have a right to the outward Sign, have also a right to the inward Grace sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby. The Lord has joyned the Exhibiting Sign, and the Grace Exhibited thereby, together. But Unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have no right to the Grace signified in the Lords Supper. It does Seal to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy partaker, all the Blessings promised in the New Covenant, and in particular the Remission of Sins. When our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted this Holy Supper, he said to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the Remission of Sins,</hi> Mat. 26. 28. The Sacrament ought not to be Administred unto those, to whom we cannot in charitable Judgment say, You are in Covenant with God, and the Blood of Christ has obtained for you, the Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of your Sins. But an Unconverted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son his no real interest in the Covenant, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. As long as he's to be Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001366_0041_0FB2953309F4DFB8"/>
he has nothing to do with Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. He has no right to any of the saving Blessings promised in the Covenant. It is Faith in Christ which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a right thereunto. They then who are in a state of Unbelief, have no right to the Salvation of the Covenant; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no right to the Seal of that Salvation. The Question is not, (as in the stating of it has been declared) Whether some Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men have not a visible right to the Sacrament <hi>Coram <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> so as that the Churches charitably judging them to be Sanctified persons, cannot refuse them; but whether they have a right <hi>Coram Deo;</hi> or whether God bids them come to his Table, before they have repented and turned from their Sins? The Old Protestant Doctrine, was, That it is <hi>only a Justifying Faith,</hi> that gives right to the Sacrament in the sight of God: It is the Visibility of that Faith, which giveth a right before men. The reason why some Unregenerate persons have a right to Sacraments before men, is because they seem to be Regenerate, &amp; to have that Faith, which giveth them a right unto the Grace Exhibited therein. Men look on the Outward appearance, but cannot look on the Heart, as the Lord does, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 7. To give the Sacrament to those who are not,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001366_0042_0FB29534F55273A0"/>
so far as men can Judge, in a Regenerate Estate, is to set the Lords Seal to a Blank: It is to Seal a Pardon to those whom the Lord has not Pardoned, and whom we are not by any rule of Charity bound to believe that he has Pardoned.</p>

         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
            <head>The Fourth Argument mentioned. There is in Scripture no Promise of Conversion by the Sacrament, nor Example of any One Person Converted thereby. The Pretences which some have made about this matter are Mistakes. A man may Possibly be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at the Administration of the Lords Supper, and yet not Converted by it. That may be an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of Conversion, which is not appointed to be a Converting Ordinance.</head>
            <p>JUdicious Divines have reasoned thus, <hi>If the Sacrament were a Converting Ordinance, and that therefore Unregenerate Persons should come to it in order to their being Converted, there would doubtless be some Promise, or some Example recorded in the Scripture of Person, so Converted, for the Encouragement of others.</hi> But this there is not: There are Promises that the Word of God shall be blessed for the Conversion of his Elect, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 2. <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 55. 12. But there is no promise of Conversion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Sacrament, which supposeth
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001366_0043_0FB29535F3833D98"/>
Conversion. Another Ordinance is spoken of as the Ordinary means appointed for Conversion, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> The Preaching of the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> If Faith should come by partaking at the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, would rather come by <hi>Seeing</hi> then by <hi>Hearing,</hi> which the Scripture says not. Nor is there any example there, of Faith inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the Sacrament. Mr. <hi>Prin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirms</hi> that many have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the Sacrament, and that they had never been Converted, <hi>if for their scandalous Lives they had been debarred from that Ordinance.</hi> Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> 
               <note n="(o)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ubi supra.</hi> P. 936.</note> replies to him, that he does <hi>confidently deny it,</hi> and withal adds, that if any man should come to him, and affirm that his very receiving the Sacrament did effectually Convert him, he Durst not give Credit to him. But suppose There have been some Persons in the World, whose Conversion has been occasioned by their coming to the Sacrament; that does not at all prove that it was their Duty to come in their Unconverted Estate. A mans doing a Sinful Act may by the Providence &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Mercy of God be an occasion of his Conversion. An Eminent <hi>Divine</hi> speaks judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001366_0044_0FB29537742CA0E0"/>
in affirming that it is one thing to Prove that the Sacrament may be a means of Conversion, and that eventually it has so come to pass; and another thing to prove that it is Commanded to the Unconverted, or allowed them to be used for that end. Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> 
               <note n="(p)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Second disput.</hi> P. 138, 139.</note> says that he never knew of any Converted by Receiving the Sacrament, but he knew some who having been instructed concerning the danger of coming to the Lords supper in an Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted estate (other kind of Doctrine then that taught by Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) were so awakened in their Preparations for the Sacrament, as that their Conversion was occasioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And some that by the serious Speeches and Prayers, of the Minister at the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration have been Converted, but none that were so by receiving it self. Thus that great Man. It may further be added, that some who have come to the Sacrament in their Unregeneracy, the thought of their great sin and guilt contracted on their Souls thereby, has been such a Terror to them, as has occasioned their true Repentance &amp; Conversion to God. But this does not Prove the Lords Supper to be a Converting Ordinance, but the contrary rather.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V.</head>
            <head>The Fifth Argument Produced. That if the Lords Supper were appointed to be a Converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, it ought not to be with-held from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanest Men in the World. The oddness of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Sacrament is appointed to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance to Church Members, and to no body else but a Church Member. Mr. Gillespy, Judgeth this to be an Irrational conceit. Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censure is appointed for the recovery of a fallen Brother, rather then for the Conversion of an Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Person.</head>
            <p>ANother Argument which is a clear Confutation of what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> affirms, is this, <hi>If the Lords Supper is a Converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, then Profane Persons ought to be admited to partake of it.</hi> For we may not withold from the Profanest Person in the World that which is appointed to be the means of his Conversion. Nay, the more Wicked any are, the greater reason there is that the means of Conversion should be applied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Therefore it is that the Gospel is to be Preached unto the worst of Sinners, yea, to Publicans the worst of men, and to Harlots the worst of Women, because that is an Ordinance appointed for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 31. But such are not to be admitted to the Lords Supper. Mr. <hi>S.</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:001366_0046_0FB2953A755F9300"/>
himself confesseth that. But then how do's he Answer this Unanswerable Argument? He has Excogitated a new notion and an odd one; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That <hi>the Sacrment is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance for Church Members only, &amp; not for other men.</hi> P. 27, 28. I think the honour of this Invention belongs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone. For in my small reading, I have not met with it in any other Author. His alledging that it is an Ordinance appointed for the Conversion of Non-Scandalous Church Members and none others, is that which <hi>Logicians</hi> call <hi>Petitio Principij,</hi> or a begging of the Question. I should rather think as Learned <hi>Gillespy</hi> does, whose Words are these: <hi>If the Sacrament is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance for known Impenitent Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Profane Persons within the Church,</hi> (to make it a Converting Ordinance for Non-Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Persons only, is a Phansy peculiar to Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) <hi>What reason is there imaginable why it is not also a Converting Ordinance for Heathen, Pagans, Turks, Jews, or have we the least hint in the Scripture that an Ordinance which may convert the Profanest Un-excomunicated Person within the Church, cannot Convert both Heathen and Excommunicated Christians?</hi> What rational Reply Mr. <hi>S.</hi> can make to this I know not, unless he will Pretend that a Church-censure, and why not a Sacrament,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001366_0047_0FB2953C2B06F038"/>
is an Ordinance appointed for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of one within the Church; but not for any other: But then <hi>Disputat ex non concessis,</hi> he takes it for granted that the Person un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der censure is Unconverted; whenas that Ordinance is appointed for the Recovery of a fallen converted Brother, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 15. It is charitably supposed, that the Subject of it has Spirit in him as well as Flesh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. That the Spirit may be saved. <hi>Pareus</hi> his Interpretation of that Scripture is, <hi>Ut mortificetur vetus, et vivificetur novus home, ut spiritus sit salvus,</hi> h. e. <hi>ut miser Peccator tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem fiat salvus spiritu, vel juxta spiritum,</hi> h. e. <hi>juxta novum et spiritualem bominum.</hi> He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, that the <hi>Corinthian</hi> notwithstanding the scandalous &amp; hainous Sin, he was fallen into, had a principle of Regenerating Grace in his Soul, which needed reviving, as well as the Old Man in him, to be further mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. He giveth a solid Reason for his so Expounding the Apostles Words. Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> faith concerning the Incestuous <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> 
               <q>Tho' the Apostle commanded him to be cast out of the Church, yet neither his crime nor his censure does convince him to be an Hypocrite: he might be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless a Saint by calling, and sincere in heart too, tho' in that act wicked &amp; scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous in Life. In the Second Epidle, when
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001366_0048_0FB2953D78A2E2D8"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> Exhorts the Church to restore him to former communion, he does not speak of his censure as the means of his first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to Christ; but only as the means of his Humiliation and Repentance. The Incest which <hi>Lot</hi> committed was as odious and foul a Sin as that of the Incestuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> yet the Scripture does not brand him for an Hypocrite; but acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him for a Righteous Soul.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Cotten.</hi> It remains that the new devised Distinction, of the Lords Supper being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be a Converting Ordinance for Church-Members; but not a Converting Ordinance for Non-Members, is not Solid nor Scriptural.</p>

         <div n="6" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
            <head>A Sixth Argument Produced. That Opinion which a Contrary to the Profession and Practice of the Churches in the Primitive, and Purest Times of Christianity, and to the Judgment of the most E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Reformers in these Latter Ages, especially Presbyterians, &amp; which agrees with the Doctrine of Papists, and a Looser sort of Protestants, ought not to be received among the Churches in New-England. But all this is true of Mr. S. his Opinion. Evinced by an Induction of Particulars. President Oakes his Judicious Assertions.</head>
            <p>ALtho' there may be, and often is a New Discovery of Old Truths, on
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001366_0049_0FB2954082826CF0"/>
which account every Doctrine which may to some seem <hi>New,</hi> is not to be rejected as Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. Nevertheless, such Notions as are really <hi>Novel,</hi> and Singular, should be Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before they be received. I proceed therefore to a sixth Argument, which shall be this;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Opinion which is contrary to the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion &amp; Practice of the Churches in the Primitive &amp; Purest Times of Christianity; and to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the most Eminent Reformers in these Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages, and which agrees with Papists, and a Looser sort of Protestants, ought not to be received among the Churches in New England.</hi> It would be an hainous Apostasy should it be so. But all this is true of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Opinion now impleaded. An <hi>Induction</hi> of Particulars will clear the Argument before us. We have already Evinced from the Scripture, that the Holy Apostles Admitted none into the Churches by them Gathered, but such as they in judgment of Charity supposed to be true Penitents &amp; Believers on Christ. And very many of the Church-members in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christian Church, were real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. Altho' there were Three Thousand Members added to the Church in one day, such a character is given of them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as giveth sufficient ground to believe, that they were truely Converted and real
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001366_0050_0FB29541FAF27440"/>
Christians. For they were pricked at the Heart with a sense of their Sins, they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Word gladly. They are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for their singleness of heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 46. They willingly parted with their Estates to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Propagation of the Gospel and of Christianity; they submitted to Baptism, and owned themselves to be Christians, when their doing so, brought not only their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, but their Lives into Peril. What greater Evidences of a real Conversion could there be desired? And it is wonderful that in so many Thousands in the first Christian Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> not above two persons were discovered to be Hypocrites. How it was with Christians in the next Ages to the Apostles, the Holy Writings do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, the Apostle <hi>John</hi> having Written the Two last Books of the Sacred <hi>Canon.</hi> But from the Ancient Fathers (as they use to be called) we know, that there was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strict Discipline Exercised in the Admission of Members into Church Fellowship, &amp; to the Lords Supper. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> who lived in the very next Age to the Apostles, and not Fifty years after <hi>John's</hi> Death, <note n="(r)" place="bottom">Apol. 2.</note> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that in those Days, such as were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the Sacred Communion, were

               <hi>Examined whether they could or would in all things conform themselves, to the Word &amp; Will of God?</hi> This is what none but Regenerate Persons, or real Converts do.

Nor are there any Men in the World who have Written more Strenuously against that Error of the <hi>Sacraments being a Converting Ordinance,</hi> then <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have done. Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Presbyterian in <hi>Scotland,</hi> has by twenty Arguments Proved that the Sacrament is not by Divine Institutions a Converting, but a Confirming Ordinance. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> has been heard saying that those Arguments were <hi>weak Childish things.</hi> A greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to so Learned and holy a Man would better have become him. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (whom the World must acknowledge to be a Man of a great <hi>Acumen</hi>) was as able to Judge of the strength of an Argument as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Yet he has defended Mr. <hi>Gillespies</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:001366_0056_0FB2954E009907C8"/>
Twenty Arguments against Mr. <hi>Prins</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> a most Learned Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian has proved (and confirmed his Assertion by a Cloud of Witnesses among the Ancients) the Sacraments are not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinances. Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> was also a Learned Presbyterian, who in his Treatise of the Lords Supper demonstrates, that it is not a Converting Ordinance. For thus he reasoneth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>No effects can be ascribed to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which fall not under the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, they do not Exhibit any grace, but what they signifie or figure out the sign and the Thing signified are not such Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as that one thing be signified, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother wrought: But the Conversion of a Sinner is not signified in the Sacrament, or Sealed. There is no outward Element that sets it forth to us. Bread, and Wine speak Nourishment, but not the giving Life. Does Bread and Wine give life to one that is Dead; Meat is not set before Dead Folks.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>This Sacrament by the Institution of it, Presupposeth those that reap the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of it to be Converts, and in Grace, to have Faith in Christ, and to be living Members, And if this is presupposed by this Ordinance, then it is not first wrought
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001366_0057_0FB2954F8EF7B5F8"/>
by it. They are Children whose Bread this is: Living Members, and not Wooden Legs that are capable of this benefit.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <q>The Word is the only Instrument to beget Faith. And therefore men without Faith may be invited to Hear the Word. If they come not <hi>With</hi> Faith, they may come <hi>Far</hi> Faith. If they come Unclean, they may yet come to be Cleansed: But the Lords Supper is not of that Nature. It supposeth some Foundation laid by the Word, that it may have Effect. The Converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance must go before the Confirming.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Vines.</hi> To that Objection, that a man may possibly be Converted at the Lords Supper, he answers; <q>That it is possible that a man may be Converted by some words uttered at the Ordination of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister; but will any one thence infer, that Ordination is a Converting Ordinance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to go on. The Reverend Mr <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Baxter,</hi> a Man Famous throughout both <hi>'Englands,</hi> was an Eminent Presbyterian.' He declares his concurrence with Mr. <hi>Vines.</hi> And he further argues thus; <q>It is one and the same Covenant by which God bestows Christ, and right to the Sacrament, and on the same condition. But the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant bestows Christ only on the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of saving Faith; therefore it bestows
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001366_0058_0FB295510299DCF0"/>
right to Sacraments only on the condition of Saving Faith.</q> Again, he Argues; <q>God giveth a right to Sacraments to none, but to those to whom, he giveth right to Remission of Sins. But he gives right to remission of sins, to none but true Believers, therefore he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a right to Sacraments to none others. He proceeds further to maintain this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See right to Sacram, Disput.</hi> 4. P. 350, 359, 370.</note> 
                  <hi>God has not commanded or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any that have not Saving Faith to claim, receive the Sacrament in that condition, but has made it the necessary order of their Duty, first to repent and believe, and then to claim, and receive the Sacrament. Argu.</hi> 1. If no man is commanded or warrented to receive the Sacrament, without a Profession of true Faith, then not without that Faith it self. But the Antecedent is true, therefore the Consequent. The Consequence is plain, because no man is commanded or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to make a False Profession. But to Profess that Faith which they have not, is to Lye or make a False Profession. <hi>Argument</hi> 2. No Commandments are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Scripture which will Warrant a man to receive the Sacrament, without a saving Faith. <hi>Object.</hi> Every Jew and his Children were commanded to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001366_0059_0FB2955276E1C630"/>
though they had not Faith? <hi>Answ.</hi> They were not commanded to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, whether they consented to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or not. For circumcision was a Token of the Covenant, and it was a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. The Parent professed an hearty consent to the Covenant: An hearty sincere consent to the Covenant, is Saving Faith. He that does really chuse the Lord to be his God, is a true Believer.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have cited these Testimonies, to shew that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his New Doctrine, is not only contrary to what Divines of the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Perswasion,</hi> (such as the Pastors of the Churches throughout <hi>New England</hi> have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been) but also most opposite to what has been Taught by our Presbyterian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. I shall from among them produce but one Witness more against him, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that super Eminent Preacher of the Gospel, Mr. <hi>Stephen Charnock.</hi> In his Excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Lords Supper, <note n="(d)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See his Works,</hi> vol. 2 P 781, 791, 792.</note> he lays down this Proposition: <hi>Only Regenerate Men are fit to come to the Lords Supper.</hi> This Proposition he Demonstrates. <q>It is Evident, <hi>For,</hi> 1. A man in his Natural Estate retains his Enmity against God. This Bread belongs
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001366_0060_0FB29554023F0AF0"/>
to Children: Unregenerate men are not in a state of Son-ship. 2. For such to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Lords Table is a mocking of God. For to come to God and Seal the Remission of Sin, when they have no mind to come up to the condition on which the Pardon is proposed, is to mock him. 3. An Unregenerate man is not in Covenant with God; because he has no Faith, the condition of the Covenant, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. Therefore he has no right to the Seal of the Covenant. 4. An Unregenerate man is Dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. What has a Dead man to do with a Feast? The very end of the Sacrament is perverted, when the Richest viands are taken by a man spiritually Dead. 5. The Sacrament is an Ordinance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Communion with Christ. Christ must be let into the Heart, before he Sup in it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. The Door must be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Conversion, before Christ will Feast with the Soul. 6. This Ordinance is to be received by true Christians only. But Renewed men only are such. Free men only have a right to the Priviledges of the City; and true Christians to the Priviledges of the Church. <hi>The Lords Supper is not a Converting Ordinance, neither in the Intention of God, nor the Ordination of Christ in the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi> No man can reasonably expect
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001366_0061_0FB29555E709BA88"/>
his Conversion, by coming in such a posture whereby contracting more than ordinary Guilt of the Blood of Christ, he incurs a greater Damnation. It is not likely to be a Converting Ordinance. <hi>For,</hi> 1. Baptism is not a Converting Ordinance, much less this of the Supper. That sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. It is appropriated for the Covenant, it supposeth that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the Receiver which the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant requires. 2. This Ordinance is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Nourishment, and that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Life. Bread and Wine are not to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven a Dead man, but to nourish &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Life in a Living man. Christ in this Ordinance is offered as Spiritual Food; and Spiritual Food supposeth a New Birth. 3. Pre-examination implies it to be no Converting Ordinance. If it were so, what need this Bar, <hi>So let him come,</hi> not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? He must Examine, whether he has true Repentance and Faith. That which is Pre-required in the Lords Supper, it is not properly instituted to Effect. 4. The nature of Excommunication speaks as much. Had it been a Converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, should not the Incestuous person rather have been kept in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church for his Reformation, than thrown out? Converting Ordinances may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001366_0062_0FB2955AC00D88D8"/>
to known Impenitent sinners. <hi>Christ</hi> Preached the Word to the Pharisees; but he Administred the Supper only to his Disciples. Christ Washed the Disciples feet before the Supper; thereby signifying that only Sanctified persons are meet Guests for his Holy Table.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Charnock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are Plain &amp; Weighty Arguments. They may be Cavilled at, but not easily Answered. I omit to say that Mr. <hi>Doolittle,</hi> another Worthy Presbyterian Divine, in his Treatise of the Lords Supper; which has been lately Reprinted at <hi>Boston,</hi> holds forth a Doctrine before the Churches, very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his <hi>Sermon.</hi> The Churches in <hi>Scotland</hi> are Presbyterian: But they are wont to Examine their Communicants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Interior Spiritual State, before they admit them to participate in the Lords Supper. Several of their Ministers in <hi>London,</hi> have assured me that they do so. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>the Present State of Scotland,</hi> Printed the Last Year, speaking of the Kirk-Session, which is their lowest Ecclesiastical Court, informs us, that this Court is Judge of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to the Lords Table, or Debarring from it, in their respective Parishes. <note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See the Present State of</hi> Scotland. <hi>Printed</hi> 1707.</note> 
               <hi>The
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001366_0063_0FB2955D0AA1F838"/>
Communicants are Examined by them as to their Knowledge and Conversation, and their Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Renew and Perform their Baptismal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> They that are really resolved to perform their Baptismal Covenar have a Work of Grace wrought in their hearts. For such a Resolution, if sincere, is Grace; and argues Regeneration. Let me further add, that several Pious Divines of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> have Taught their People sounder Doctrine than this in Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Sermon. For <note n="(f)" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Tozer <hi>of Communicating.</hi> P. 56, 57.</note> 
               <hi>We must Examine our selves, whether we be in the Number of the Faithful or not. For as our Bodies can receive no strengthning from the Food we receive, unless they have some Life in them before, so neither can our Souls, if they be void of the Life of Grace, receive any comfort by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Food in the Lords Supper; which does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease Life where it finds it, but works none where there is none before.</hi> To say no more, Mr.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001366_0064_0FB2955E8667D0F8"/>
               <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Disputations of Right to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has produced above Three-score Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Divines, all who assert, that it is a Justifying Saving Faith which giveth right to Sacraments; and that therefore they who are judged not to have that Faith, may not be admitted unto that which they have no right to lay a claim unto. These things being so, the Godly &amp; Learned Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> might well say, That the Opinion of the Sacraments being a Converting Ordinance, is <hi>a new up-start Opinion;</hi> &amp; that he wondred any one will stand up for it, since there is among Orthodox Divines an Army to a Man against them. And as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are against the stream of the most E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, and Orthodox Divines, so they agree with those who are in other Points very Heterodox in their Judgments. Popish Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters say as he does. They are mighty stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for the Sacraments being Converting Ordinances. <hi>Bullinger</hi> 
               <note n="(h)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dread, Serm.</hi> 7.</note> (that great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former) his account of them is this, <hi>Docuit vulgus Sacerdotum et Monachorum Sacramenta, non tantum esse signa Gratioe sed Gratioe causas,</hi> h. e. <hi>quoe habent virtutem Conferendi Gratiam: Their Priests teach that the Sacraments are not only Signs, but Causes of Grace.</hi> Which he
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001366_0065_0FB29560C43028A8"/>
confutes, by shewing that men ought first to have the thing Signified, before they have the Sign, <hi>Greg. de valentia. Estius</hi> &amp; other Papists, mention this as one difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Calvinists</hi> and them, that the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists</hi> held that Sacraments are only a sign of Grace, and not a cause of it: Whenas Catholicks maintain, that the Sacraments work Grace in those that do not <hi>obicem po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi> withstand their operation. Some <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> also, who are a looser sort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and in the Doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come nearer to the Papists than the <hi>Reformed</hi> do, make the same complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Calvinists. Brockmond</hi> (a bitter <hi>Lutheran</hi>) mentions it as a <hi>Calvinian Error,</hi> that Sacraments are not Instituted to be means of conferring Grace: he chargeth <hi>Zuinglius, Beza, Daneus, Musculus,</hi> and <hi>Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> as Guilty of this supposed Error. If some <hi>Prelatick Writers</hi> in our own Nation say as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> does, shall Christians in <hi>New-England</hi> conform to such Principles, when their Fathers came into this Land whilest it was a Wilderness, that so they might Enjoy a more Pure Discipline? And yet in the beginning of the English Reformation, there were Principles avowed by those Reformers contrary to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Doctrine. They would have a visible Church to be <hi>a Congregation of
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001366_0066_0FB29563035C61D0"/>
Faithful Men;</hi> whenas Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Doctrine allows them to be a Congregation of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful or Unsanctifyed men. The <hi>English Liturgy requires the Minister to give Warning to the Congregation before the Sacrament is to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, and that be should say to them, that it will be dangerous for them, if they presume to come unworthily. My Duty is to Exhort you to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dignity of that holy Mystery, &amp; the great Peril of Unwortby receiving; and so to search, and examine your own Consciences, and that not lightly, after the manner of Dissemblers with God, but so that you come holy, and clean to such an heavenly Feast, in the Marriage Garment requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God in the holy Scripture, and be received as worthy Partakers of that holy Table: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the receiving of that holy Communion does nothing else but increase your Damnation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you of your Sins, else come not to that holy Table, lest after the holy Supper the Devil enter into you, as he did into Judas, and fill you full of all iniquity, and bring you to Destruction both of Body &amp; Soul.</hi> Verily, this is holy &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Doctrine which those Pious Reformers taught the Nation. Just such Doctrine as this used to be Preached in <hi>New-England</hi> by those blessed Souls, who are now among the Spirits of Just men made Perfect; nor did any man dare to Preach it down, except one of late. Did those Reformers in <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:001366_0067_0FB29564794558B0"/>
teach, That men should not presume to come to the Lords Table without a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment; and does a Minister in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England</hi> teach, That they may come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Garment, &amp; that it is no Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them to do so? Do the Reformers say, You that truly Repent of Sin take the Holy Sacrament; and is there a Minister ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen up in <hi>New-England,</hi> who says to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, yea, to all the Congregations throughout the Land, You that do not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repent of your Sins, come take this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, you may lawfully do it, nay God commands you to do it, as much as he commanded the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> to Eat the Passover? Did the Reformers teach, That if Persons did come to the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Wedding Garment, they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their Damnation; and does a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in <hi>New-England</hi> say, it will probably be their Conversion, and not their Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Did the Reformers instruct those that came to the Lords Table, first to Examine their Consciences, and that not lightly after the manner of Dissemblers with God; and is there a Minister in <hi>New-England</hi> that has both Preached and Printed, that no man need to Examine himself whether he should eat or forbear, only Examine what need he has of the Sacrament? What will become
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001366_0068_0FB29566C2755560"/>
of the Churches in <hi>New England,</hi> if such Doctrine should take with them?</p>
            <p>I shall conclude this Chapter, with the Testimony of an Eminent and now Blessed man of the <hi>Congregational Perswasion,</hi> Famous in these Churches. I mean Mr. <hi>Urian Oakes,</hi> my intimate and most dear Friend &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor in the <hi>Presidentship</hi> of the Colledge in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> There has lately been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me a Sermon of his, on <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 8. Preached <hi>August</hi> 2. 1674. wherein I find these words following, written with his own Hand; <q>Hereby you may judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right for your own meetness for Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fellowship and Full Communion in the Ordinances of Christ. Examination of the Application of Redemption will be of great use in this case. I make it out unto you thus: The Church (that is the Church Mystical) is, both the Subject and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Application. Now none have a real right in the sight of God to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fellowship and Ordinances, but such as are real Saints, real Members of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mystical, and so the real Subjects of the Application of Redemption. Indeed Churches have Right &amp; Warrant to admit to Church Fellowship &amp; Ordinances, such as are but Visible Saints, and have Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion applied to them in appearance only,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001366_0069_0FB2956851292488"/>
because they are not Heart-searchers, have no judgment of Certainty concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; but must proceed by Rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgment of Charity. But such as are only Visible Saints, unto whom Redemption is applied in Appearance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have no real right in the sight of God to demand Church-Fellowship and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. A meer out-side Visible Saint, that has a goodly appearance of a work of Application and no more, sinneth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Church Fellowship and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but the Church does not sin in granting his desire in that respect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before you demand Fellowship with this or that Church, Examine the work of Application; what Experience you have had thereof. And tho' you can not get ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Assurance, yet endeavour to get some comfortable Perswasion, &amp; grounded Hope of it; that Redemption is in part applied unto you: And then get within the Gates of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as soon as you can. It will be worse for your own Souls, than for the Church, if you rush upon Ordinances when you are unfit for them.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Oakes</hi> has Rightly and Judiciously stated the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy.</p>
            <p>There has likewise been brought to me, several very Judicious Sermons on <hi>

122. 2. Written by the same Hand, which I heartily wish the Publick had the benefit of them. That Excellent Preacher Wrote Largely, I think all that he delivered in the Pulpit, altho' being blessed with a strong Memory, he there made no use of his <hi>Notes.</hi> In one of those Sermons, I find these words Written with his own Hand; (they are in a Lecture Sermon, Preached <hi>Sept.</hi> 4. 1672.) <q>Be sure of your fitness in some measure for Church Fellowship; that you are compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently Qualified for the Communion of Saints in an instituted Church before you desire &amp; sue for it. It is the Certain Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty indeed of all under the Gospel-Call, to joyn themselves to Churches, and get into Church-communion. But their first Duty is to get Gospel-qualifications, for such Fellowship. Oh <hi>I</hi> therefore make sure of this in the first place. Consider se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, and you will find it to be a clear Truth; that as it is commonly said, to be fit for a mercy is better than meerly to have and enjoy the mercy; so to be fit for this Priviledge of Church-communion, is in some respects, yea absolutely a greater mercy, and more desirable than to enjoy it. And let me deal faithfully with you, &amp; tell you plainly, Unless you <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> duly Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, it's much better for the Church &amp; for
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001366_0071_0FB2956BF52875A0"/>
your selves too, that you forbear. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for your selves in that case to be <hi>Out</hi> than <hi>In;</hi> for you would but aggravate your sin and misery by abusing Church-Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, &amp; profaning Gods Glorious Name, by a careless formal Use of Holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that you have no right unto; and God will certainly call to a sad Account for such things one Day. You go the next way to undo your selves, if you press into Church Fellowship when God and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science tell you, that you are unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. And it is much better for the Church of God, that Un-qualified persons be kept out. For they are good for nothing, but to pester Churches and create Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and be a burden and grief of Heart to the Godly in such Societies. Therefore it is promised to the Church of God as a singular mercy, in the Day of the best &amp; most glorious Reformation &amp; Condition of it in this World, that there shall <hi>be no Canaanite in the House of the Lord,</hi> Zec. 14. 21.

Converted and Regenerated in Truth. He that has indeed an Interest in Christ, has Married the Son of God, has his Sins Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, his Person Accepted, and Adopted, Sanctified, made a New Creature. Such an one as he is a Member of the Invisible Church, so he is <hi>inforo Dei,</hi> truly Qualified for Communion with any Church Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I do not press the absolute necessity of full Assurance: But, Oh! get a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Perswasion of your fitness in this respect. What good would it do you, if all the Saints and Churches in the World should Admit and Embrace you as duly Qualified, and God himself should judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise?

In <hi>foro Ecclefioe,</hi> such are Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for Admission, as are Visible Saints, or Saints in Appearance, or to the judgment of Charity.

Such a measure of Knowledge as may let Christ into the Soul, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> speaks. 2. A credible Profession, or Assent to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Doctrine of Religion.

            <head>The Seventh Argument against the impleaded New Doctrine.

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001366_0075_0FB2957A51233118"/>
Truth under Consideration. Before we proceed to Answer Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Allegations, one Argument more against the Impleaded new Doctrine shall be briefly touched upon. It is this, <hi>If it is impossible for Unregenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whilest such to be worthy Communicants at the Lords Table, then they have no Command or allowance from God to be there whilest in their Sins.</hi> For God approves of worthy and not of unworthy Partakers at his Table, but it is impossible for Unregenerate Persons whilest in their Natural Unconverted Estate to be worthy Receivers. They that cannot Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise Grace cannot be worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants at the Lords Table. One reason why Children and Distracted Persons may not come to the Lords Table, is because; they are not capable of Exercising Grace: Altho' it may be there is the habit of saving Grace in their Hearts. Such Communicants as are acceptable to Christ, Exercise Grace when at his Table. <hi>The Spices in his Garden Flow out there.</hi> Cant. 4. 16. But this Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Persons are not capable of. How should they Exercise Grace who have none? The worthy Communicant does Exercise the Grace of Thankfulness to God, for His Infinite Mercy in sending his Son to be our Saviour, and for all the Benefits of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Lords Supper is therefore usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

called the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> The Graces of Faith, and Repentance, and of love to Christ, and to his Saints, and the Grace of an hearty forgiveness of Injuries (which Unregenerate Persons are Strangers unto) ought to be Exercised by those who approach to the Holy Table. And Christians should come from the Lords Table with confirmed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions to walk with God, and to keep all his Commandments, and with holy longings for Heaven, and to be with Christ. These are things which Unregenerate Souls are Strangers unto, and therefore are not such Communicants at the Lords Table as Christ approves of, or that can receive with Profit and Spiritual advantage to their own Souls.</p>

            <head>Mr. S. his Arguments brought under Examination. Most of them do as strongly Prove, That Scandalous Unregenerate Persons may be admitted to the Lords Supper, as that Non-Scandalous ones may. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Johns Baptism considered. Baptismal Regeneration an Error. A Minister that knows himself to be Unregenerate ought not to Administer the Lords Supper, whilest in his present State. The Example of Judas no Demonstration. It cannot be Proved that he was admitted to the Lords Supper.</head>

the Question before us, it remains that we take into consideration what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> does alledge for his new <hi>Tenet,</hi> he confesseth that <hi>Scandalous Unregenerates</hi> ought not to be admitted to the Lords Supper, which is a good confession so far as it goeth. Yet most of his objections against the Doctrine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received in the Churches, do as much enforce the admission of Scandalous as of <hi>Non-Scandalous</hi> Unregenerates to the Sacred Table, as in the Sequel of our Discourse will appear. He pretends (<hi>page</hi> 10) <hi>that it is not to be imagined that all Baptised by John were Regenerate, or judged by him to be so.</hi> But with what reason does he confirm his Assertion? With none at all. Why might not <hi>John</hi> judge all the Persons by him Baptised as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate? I doubt not but <hi>John</hi> had more Charity for his <hi>Disciples</hi> then Mr. <hi>S.</hi> seems to have, considering that those Baptised by him confessed their Sins, and Professed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and brought forth fruits meet for Repentance: He would have been unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in not judging them to be Regenerate, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 6, 8. There is a difference between judging a Multitude to be Regenerate as considered <hi>Collectively,</hi> &amp; as considered <hi>Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively.</hi> A Minister that has a great Flock may fear that there are some <hi>Hypocrites</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, nevertheless if he should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001366_0078_0FB2957ECC15A890"/>
of concerning any particular person among them, do you not judge that person to be a true Believer? His charity would make him say, I do so. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> adds further, <hi>If Unregenerate Persons might not be Baptised, the Pharisees would not have been bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for Neglecting Baptism.</hi> But in this I take him to be under a Mistake: For the thing that the Pharisees are blamed for, is, <hi>Their rejecting the Counsel of God, <abbr>viz,</abbr>
               </hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel which God gave them in <hi>Johns</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry to repent &amp; bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, but they are not blamed because they did not offer themselves to Baptism, notwithstanding their rejecting the Counsel of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 30. What Mr. <hi>S.</hi> sayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that <hi>John</hi> would have Baptised them, but that they refused to be Baptised by him, when as the truth is otherwise; that they would have been Baptised, but <hi>John</hi> refused to Baptise them. Thus say the <hi>Centuriators, Pareus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gillespy,</hi> and among our <hi>New-England</hi> Divines, Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi>

Scribes &amp; Pharisees. For this was a great part of their Temple Pollution, that they made the House of God a Den of Thieves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 17. But if <hi>John Baptist</hi> received them to his Baptism, he then made the Church (or house of God) not only a Den of Thieves, but which is worse, a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Vipers.

may Preach the Word is not denied. An Hypocrite may have great Gifts, which Talents he ought to improve to the Glory of God, and the Good of Men.

It is true that he ought to attend the duties of his Office, but it is no less true, that he ought to be qualified for his Office, before he undertakes it, which he is not, if he knows himself destitute of Saving Grace. He cannot have a Divine approbation to meddle with that which he is not qualified for; the Lord says to the Pastor of a Church, seed the Flock with the Word, &amp; with Sacraments, but he says with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, do it in Sincerity and not in Hypocrisy.

that <hi>Judas</hi> was admitted to Partake: That proveth not that unregenerate persons should come to the Lords Table.

            <head>The Argument taken from the Jews being all Admitted to the Passover, Examined and Refuted. Those Allegations that it is Lawful for Unregenerate men to give a Testimony to the Death of Christ; and that they need the Blessings Exhibited in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do as much Prove that Scandalous, as that Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Seandalous Unregenerates should come to the Lords Table. We must distinguish between a Right to Sacraments in foro Dei, in the sight of God; and in foro Ecclesiae, in the sight of Men. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction in according to Scripture, and improved by Learned Divines.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Cardinal Argument</hi> which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Discourse mainly turns upon, is taken from the Law of the Passover. <hi>Such Persons,</hi> (he says) <hi>as might Lawfully come to the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, may also if they have Knowledge to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Lords body:</hi> (he intends no more than a doctrinal discerning, or he says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) <hi>come to the Lords Supper.</hi> But Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Persons might come to the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, therefore to the Lords Supper. <hi>Answ. Negatur Major omnino.</hi> The first Proposition is denied. The Passover was appointed for the National Church of Israel. A Learned <note n="(p)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Goodwin <hi>of Church Government.</hi> P. 161.</note> Doctor in Subjects of this Nature, has
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:001366_0086_0FB29594871B6988"/>
Evinced, That the Church under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is <hi>Congregational,</hi> and not <hi>National.</hi> When there was a National Church, there was a Worship for the whole Nation, <hi>as a Nation</hi> to come unto. If a National Church is of Divine Institution under the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then there must be National Officers. This will bring us to an High Priest. A late <note n="(q)" place="bottom">Lamb, <hi>in his Suit against Dr</hi> Owen, <hi>and Independency.</hi> P. 127, 128.</note> Apostate Independent Anabaptist, who is turned a Zealous Conformist, &amp; become <hi>Osor sui Ordinis,</hi> as Apostates use to be, thinks that the Christian Church should <hi>for Orders sake be under an High Priest.</hi> This will infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly bring us to the <hi>Pontiff</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> So then this Argument from the Passover, which was Proper to the Israelitish Nation, does not demonstrate what it has been produced for. Altho' Gospel Mysteries were Typifyed by the Passover, Nevertheless, it was Instituted in Special to be a Commemoration of a wonderful <hi>Deliverance to that Nation,</hi> on which account the whole Nation were to observe it. But to reason from thence, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all who are called Christians, should come to the Lords Supper, is inconsequent Argumentation. But if Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thus, the whole Nation of Israel being
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:001366_0087_0FB295965FAF01F8"/>
the Subjects of a Redemption out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they and they only might eat the Passover, which was Instituted as a Commemoration of that Redemption. In like manner, the holy Nation of true Believers, being the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, who are the Subjects of the Redemption of Christ, all &amp; only they have a right to Partake of the Lords Supper, which was Instituted to be a Commemoration of that blessed Redemption; his Argument would have been Sound &amp; Solid, and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Truth: But what does his arguing Prove, as by him Propounded! If it Proves any thing, it Proves that Scandalous, as well as Non-Scandalous Unregenerates, should be admitted to the Lords Table, which he is not arrived to that Latitude, as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. I do not believe, that he is of that extensive Charity, as to think, that none of the Males belonging to the Jewish Nation, were Scandalous Persons. It is past doubt, that very many of them were Adulterers, Thieves, Liars, Slanderers, and Perjured Persons: <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 9, 10. Now if a man should argue thus, All the Males of the Jewish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were to come to the Passover, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 16. But many of those Males were of very Scandalous Lives, therefore men of very Scandalous Lives ought to come to the Lords Supper. How would Mr. <hi>S.</hi> answer him?

If he will say (as Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and from him our famous Mr. <note n="(r)" place="bottom">

Why does not Mr. <hi>S.</hi> argue, That all Children of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old should come to the Lords Supper, for the Jewish Writers tell us they did to the Passover. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> goes on, (<hi>P.</hi> 11, 12.) in Saying, <hi>It is Lawful for an Unregenerate man to Celebrate the Memorial of Christs Death, and to give a Testimony to the Death of Christ; and that which God Teacheth us in this Ordinance is very needful for Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men to Learn; that which we Profess in this Ordinance is very needful for Unregenerate men to Profess, Namely, their need of Christ, and the Saving Vertue of His Blood.</hi> Therefore Unregenerate men have right to come to the Lords Supper. Now is not all this weak arguing? Can a Superstructure of Truth stand upon such Feeble reasoning? It is answer enough to say, That these things may be applyed unto very Scandalous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, yet they have no right to the Lords

Supper, by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his own confession. But he Proceeds, <hi>If it is Lawful for all the Adult Members of the Church to Partake of the Lords Supper, then it is lawful for some Unregenerate men to do it.</hi> But Ergo: But he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that, <hi>Qui bene distinguit bene docet.</hi> There is a fallacy in the Argument for want of a Distinction often mentioned, between a right to Sacraments in the sight of God, and a right before men, or as to the Churches Approbation. If this is not remembred, the true State of the Question is forgotten: The Argument ought to be formed thus, <hi>All the Adult Members in the Church have in the sight of God, a right to the Sacrament: But some Adult Members in the Church are Unregenerates and Hypocrites, therefore some Unregenerate men, and Hypocrites have in the sight of God, a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sacrament.</hi> Now the Proposition, or <hi>Major</hi> of his <hi>Syllogism</hi> is denyed. Nor has Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in all his Sermon said any thing to Prove it: His confounding a right to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, <hi>in foro Poli,</hi> as Divines express it, in the sight of Heaven, with a right <hi>in foro Solt,</hi> in the sight of men, has led him into Mistakes. Hence he argues, <hi>It is Lawful for Unregenerate men to keep Covenant with God.</hi> Who can deny that? But they must really be in Covenant with God, before they can Keep His Covenant. If men come to the

Lords Supper in their Sins, they will not thereby keep Gods Covenant, but Profane and Pollute it. Men may be visible Saints, and Pollute it. Men may be visible Saints, and externally in Covenant with God, and often renew their Covenant by coming to His Table, and yet God not approve of their medling with his holy <hi>Institutions,</hi> but says of them, That <hi>they have nothing to do, to take His Covenant into their Mouths,</hi> because they hate Conversion &amp; Godliness, in the Power of it.

            <head>Another of Mr. S. his Arguments Examined, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That there is no certain Knowledge who be true Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace.

His Objection, That our Doctrine hardens men in their Unregeneracy justly retorted on his own Doctrine.

the ballance of the Sanctuary. He objects, <hi>That there is no certain Knowledge who has San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Grace; and that if only Godly men were to be admitted to Communion, there is not Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enough on the Earth in order to the Practice of it. If the Church were only to receive those that are Converted, God would have given a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule, whereby Converted Men might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from those that are Unconverted:</hi> To this purpose he speaks, <hi>p.</hi> 14, 15, 23. A Solution to this Objection may be given, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by Proposing another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection for himself to answer. He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, That none but such as have a Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Historical Faith, may come to the Sacrament. Heterodox or Heretical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons erring in any Fundamental Article of the Christian Religion, may not come: Then according to his Notion, there must be a certain Rule whereby it may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned what mens inward Sentiments, and the belief of their Hearts is, Whether they do not speak falsely, when they say, That they believe such Articles of the Christian Faith, as they pretend to believe. <hi>Julian</hi> before his open Apostasy Professed, that he believed all the Doctrines of Christianity, because he thought he should not obtain the Empire without such a Profession. But afterwards he declared, That he never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:001366_0094_0FB295A1F4473D60"/>
any of them. <hi>Arius</hi> Pretended, and by an Oath made others think, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Deity of our Saviour, that so he might have Communion with the Churches. And yet all was a deceit, he believed it not. If then only Orthodox Christians must be admitted to the Lords Supper, <hi>There is not</hi> (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Speaks) <hi>Knowledge enough on Earth to order our Practice in this matter.</hi> Let him answer this, and he will answer his own Objection concerning our Ignorance, of the Spiritual Estate of men, whether they have true Saving Grace or no. No doubt he will say, If men are Knowing, and Profess they believe the Principles of true Religion, and do not Profess any Error that is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent therewith; the Rule requires that Churches who cannot Know the hearts, and inward Perswasions of men, should accept of their outward Profession. And why then should we not believe, That men that give us an account of their Conversion, &amp; whose Conversations are outwardly blameless and holy, are really according to what they seem to be? If Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Argument is put into form, it will run thus, <hi>If it is true that None but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Persons have in the fight of God a right to the Sacrament, then it is necessary that the Church before they admit them into their Communion, should infallibly know that they are Regenerate:</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:001366_0095_0FB295A3D22B0BF8"/>
But it is not necessary that the Church should before they admit them into their Communion, infallibly know that they are Regenerate; therefore it is not true, That none but Regenerate Persons have in the sight of God a right unto the Sacrament. Now the consequence is denyed. The Church may and ought to admit those into Communion, of whom they have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible knowledge, of their being in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Estate. Because, as we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they may have right before the Church, and yet not before God. The Hypocrisy of a mans Profession, is a sufficient bar in the sight of God, but it is not so in the sight of Men, if there is no evidence of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> has another objection, page 21. <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>That they who maintain that only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Persons, should come to the Sacrament, by that Doctrine harden Men in their Natural Estate, and hinder their Conversion, by making them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are Converted already.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Doctrine has no such tendency, but rather the contrary, that men should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make sure of their Conversion, that so they may Eat and Drink Salvation, and not Damnation to themselves, when they approach to the Holy Table. But the other Doctrine does rather tend to harden

Unregenerate men in their Sins, by not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promising but Sealing Life unto them, and thereby hindring them from turning from their Evil way, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 22. In the next Page he objects, <hi>That if only Saints are allowed to come to the Sacrament, then a man must know himself to be a Saint, before he can know that he is allowed to come. Answ.</hi> Altho' it is true that if a man does know that he is not a Saint, but in a State of Sin, he ought not to come; it does not follow that a real Saint should neglect coming, because, he wants Assurance. There is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a mans <hi>knowing</hi> that he is Unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and having <hi>some doubts</hi> about it. If af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter serious Self-Examination, he cannot but hope that there is a Good Work begun in his Soul, he ought to come altho' his Hopes are not Assurance. The <hi>Jews</hi> if after they had searched for Leaven within their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, could find none, they were to Eat the Passover. So if Christians upon Self-Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, cannot find that they are in a State of Hypocrisy, which is Leaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. they ought to come to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Every man ought to judge of himself according to what he is really. If he is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate he ought to judge so of himself: If he judgeth otherwise, he sins &amp; wrongs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. This will not Justifie his forbearing the

Providence has smiled on the Pious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of that Prince, to Unite the <hi>Lutherans</hi> &amp; the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> which has obtained among those in his Dominions; and other Forreign Churches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press a greater desire of Union, than ever was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the former Age.

Day, that the Popish Religion was banished from that Country 177 Years before. And the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> has caused 800 Churches of Protestans in <hi>Silosia,</hi> to be restored notwithstanding the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Resistence of the <hi>Popish Clergy</hi> against it. That K. also being thereunto advised, by (the Best of Queens) the QUEEN of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> insists upon it, That <hi>Calvinists,</hi> as well as <hi>Lutherans</hi> shall have Liberty of Conscience, and that if any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists being convinced of the Falsity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, shall embrace the Protestant (which is the only true) Religion, they shall not on that account be Persecuted. These hopeful Beginnings are a Sign that Anti-christ is falling, and the Kingdom of Christ on the rising Hand. The truth is, the Popes Kingdom has been falling for these several Ages. And notwithstanding his regaining some Countries which had rejected him, the <hi>Pope</hi> is a <hi>Little thing</hi> at this day, compared to what he was in some former Ages; when all the Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> stood in awe of him.

Moreover, Some Letters inform us, that very lately a considerable Number of People within the <hi>Venitian</hi> Territories, are grown sick of <hi>Popery;</hi> and incline to the Protestant Religion: And a misunderstanding there is, between that <hi>Republick</hi> and the Court at <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Pharisees</hi> of Old would compass Sea and Land to make Proselytes for Hell.

long since, a number of Students in the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Lipsick,</hi> gathered into a <hi>Private College</hi> for the Promoting of Scripture Knowledge, by means whereof real &amp; practical Christianity was much advanced.

This Famous <hi>Academy</hi> is under the Inspection of Three Learned Doctors in Divinity, who make it their business to promote Religion, as well as Learning; and Enquire into the Spiritual State of the Young Scholars, especially of such as are designed for the Ministry; Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing them, that they are <hi>not to take up the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry as a Trade,</hi> or to get a Living thereby, but to Promote the Glory of God in the World, &amp; the Salvation of the Souls of men.

            </p>
            <p>There are some Learned men, who begin the Rise and Reign of Anti-christ (and consequently his Ruine) Later than I have done.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Name, and glorious Attributes of the Blessed God.</hi> When God doth fulfil His Promises He doth make it known that He is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and in as much as His Name is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> it is Impossible that any Word, that He hath spoken should fail as to the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.

                  </gap>h,</hi> therefore the meaning is, That God was not known to the Fathers, by <hi>Fulfilling</hi> the Promises He had made, to the Patriarchs, &amp; which were to be performed to their Children after them, but to <hi>Israel,</hi> He would make known, that He was <hi>Jehovah,</hi> by giving <hi>a Being,</hi> and Actual <hi>Existence</hi> to those Promises. God is a God of Infinite Power, &amp; a God that keepeth Truth for ever. When Men fail in the Performing of what they have Promised, the reason is because they want <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> to do, as they have said they would do. Men that have no truth in them will promise what they never intended to do, like the <hi>Devil</hi> who promised the Lord Jesus Christ, that if He would Worship him, he would give Him all the Kingdoms in the World to be his. The <hi>Devil</hi> never intended to do any such thing, nor was it in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do it; but now as to the blessed God, <hi>It is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that He should Lye,</hi> He <hi>is God that cannot Lye,</hi> Rom. 3. 4. <hi>Let God be True, and every Man a Lyar, i. e.</hi> Every

Man that doth call the Truth of God into Question, let that man be called a <hi>Lyar,</hi> for so he is and a <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer</hi> too. So then, that Attribute of Divine <hi>Truth</hi> proves this. And as for the <hi>Power</hi> of God, that is Infinite, He is the Omnipotent God, He is (as some have observed) above Seventy Times, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture stiled <hi>the Almighty,</hi> he has <hi>Power</hi> to do, whatever He will do, Job 42. 2. <hi>I know that Thou canst do every Thing, and that no Thought can be withheld from the<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> God can do Things that are above the Power of Nature when he pleaseth; and will do so, rather than <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Word, His Promise shall not be made good. When God Promised that <hi>Sarah</hi> should have a Son, because it was above the ordinary Course of Nature, she could not believe it, the Angel does therefore Rebuke her saying, Gen. 18 14. <hi>Is any thing <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hard for the Lord,</hi> tho' this be above what is usual, yet if the Lord hath spoken it, is it too hard for him to cause it to be so? It was a Thing very unlikely, that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> should be brought out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> considering that they were a poor unarmed People, &amp; were dispirited by the Slavery and Cruel Bondage which they had, for a long time, been in, &amp; their Enemies were more in Number than they, nevertheless, since God had made such a Promise, He did bring it about to shew His <hi>Power,</hi> He saved them for His Name sake, that He might make His mighty <hi>Power</hi> known. That the <hi>Jews</hi> should be brought out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was more Improbable than their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> because the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> was a far more potent Prince, than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> nevertheless, in as much as God Promised it, His <hi>Power</hi> did effect it, Jer. 50. 34. <hi>Their Redeemer is Strong, the Lord of Hosts is his Name.</hi> Gods Strength &amp; Power is such, as He could do that Wondrous Thing. So, that the <hi>Jews</hi> who at this Day, are the most forlorn Nation in the World, should again be called &amp; become the People of God, is Incredible to many, but the <hi>Apostle</hi> proves that it shall be so, from the Infinite
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:001366_0128_0FB2949F35560998"/>
               <hi>Power</hi> of God, Rom. 11. 13. <hi>God is able to Graft them in again,</hi> because He is able, and hath so Promised, it shall surely be done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is evident from, <hi>The Stability, and Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Divine Decrees.</hi> Psal. 33. 11. <hi>The Counsel of the Lord shall stand for ever, &amp; the Thoughts of his Heart unto all Generations.</hi> What God hath <hi>Promised,</hi> He hath certainly <hi>Purposed</hi> to perform, His <hi>Promise</hi> is the effect and declarative of his <hi>Decree.</hi> The Purpose of God shall stand, yea, and it shall stand forever. Men do oftentimes purpose &amp; change their mind, but God doth not so. Therefore the Apostle speaks of <hi>the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of his Counsel,</hi> Heb. 6. 17. When men <hi>'purpose,</hi> &amp; do not accomplish what they intended, the reason of their not doing of it, is either for want of <hi>Wisdom</hi> or of <hi>Power;</hi> many times for want of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> because they did not at first see the inconveniency of such a Resolution, which they have taken up, therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on second thoughts that are wiser they change their minds, but God is Infinitely Wise, and therefore, He doth not change His Mind. The <hi>Decrees</hi> of God are so wise, as that wiser cannot possibly be, and thence they are Immutable. And as for the <hi>Power</hi> of God you heard, that was Infinite, and therefore His Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and consequently His Promises must needs hold good. Hence <hi>Samuel</hi> said to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 29. <hi>The Strength of Israel, is not as a man that He should repent,</hi> as for what God hath spoken of Ruine to come on the House of <hi>Saul,</hi> He will not Repent of it, and as for what God hath promised concerning <hi>David,</hi> and his House, He will not change His mind, for if He should, that would Argue <hi>Weakness</hi> in Him, whenas He is <hi>the Strength of Israel,</hi> the Strength of Israel will not change His mind. The <hi>Decrees</hi> of God are in <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. compared to <hi>mountains of Brass,</hi> the Prophet there sees Four <hi>Chariots</hi> which came from between two Mountains of Brass, signifying the Judgments of God coming upon His Enemies, in order unto the deliverance of His People,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:001366_0129_0FB294A182A4E910"/>
and these Judgments are but the effects of the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God, compar'd to Mountains of Brass, for that they cannot be removed, or Frustrated.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The experience of all Ages confirms this to be so.</hi> Psal. 119. 160. <hi>Thy Word is True from the Beginning,</hi> ever since the World began, in all Ages of it, God hath made Good His Word, &amp; truly performed what He hath promised. Particular Saints have always found it so. There were peculiar Promises made to <hi>David</hi> that God would give him the Kingdom, and after that, God promised that a Son of his should succeed him in the Throne, &amp; particularly that <hi>Solomon</hi> was the Son, that should be his successor, now <hi>Solomon</hi> doth with great affection take notice how God had performed His Word, 1 King. 8. 24. <hi>Thou hast kept with my Father,</hi> (saith he.) <hi>that thou promised'st him, and what thou hast spooken with thy mouth, thou hast fulfilled with thy hand, as at this Day.</hi> Thou didst tell my Father <hi>David</hi> that I should succeed in the Throne, and Build this <hi>Temple,</hi> and so it is this Day. So the Promises God hath made Concerning His Church, we have seen them fulfilled in all Preceding Ages, God hath verified His Word, as when He did Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his Posterity should be brot' out of <hi>Egypt</hi> after a long time of affliction there; this Promise that God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Four Hundred &amp; Thirty Years before, it was, at last fulfilled, and God kept His Word to a day. And therefore 'tis an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable Scripture which you have to this purpose in, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 40, 41. It is said, <hi>It came to pass at the end of the Four Hundred and Thirty Years, in the self same day it came to pass.</hi> You see, that God kept His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to a day, in bringing His Posterity out of the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> So the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which all the Fathers lived upon, concerning the coming of Christ, and his Dying to save His People, it was Declared unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> that within Seventy Prophetical Weeks, that is Four Hundred and Ninty
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:001366_0130_0FB294A2F54709C0"/>
Years, this should be accomplished, and we know that it was so. The Promises made concerning the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the enlargement of the Church, the pouring out of the Spirit in the Days of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> we know how these Things are fulfilled, and therefore what Glorious Things are yet remaining to be done in the World, God will certainly do them in the Time thereof. That's the first Proposition.</p>
            <p>PROP. II <hi>That the Works of God, especially some of his Works, are very Wonderful!</hi> Thy Wondrous Works! Saith the <hi>Psalmist</hi> here, in the Hebrew it is <hi>Nipbleothecs, Mirabilia tua,</hi> thy Marvels. The work of Creation is indeed, a wonderful work, 'tis Wonderful, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what variety of Creatures, the great &amp; glorious God hath given a Being to. If we look here, on the Earth, what variety of Creatures are there? That (as some have observed,) among the Beasts of the Field, there are no less, than an Hundred and Fifty Beasts of several kinds, that God hath made; and of the Fowls of the Air, no less than Five Hundred sorts of them; and as for Insects, Creeping and Flying Things. No less than Ten Thousand of them have Naturalists taken notice of. And as for Plants, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, some Writers say, more than Eighteen Thousand differing in kind. If we look into the wide Sea, what Innumerable Creatures are there! And if we look up to Heaven among the Stars of God, we Ignorant Mortals do not know what Creatures may be there; so that the Works of <hi>Creation,</hi> are wondrous Works. But the Works that my Text refers to, are the Works of Divine <hi>Providence,</hi> these are Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful! <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 8. And several times in that Psalm it is said, <hi>Oh! that men would praise the Lord, for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and for his Wonderful Works unto the Children of men.</hi> The Works of Gods <hi>Providence,</hi> towards the Children of Men are exceeding Wonderful! In His Preserving and Providing for them. But most of all the Works
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:001366_0131_0FB294A774938C88"/>
of Providence with respect to the Church of God, as in Psal. 87. 3. <hi>Glorious things are spoken, concerning thee, O thou City of God!</hi> And God doth Wondrous Things, in order to the Accomplishment of those Glorious Things. The Churches preservation is one of those Wonders. He hath promised that He will uphold His Church in the World; even to the end of it: That the Gates of Hell shall not prevail to destroy His Church on Earth; and His Providence in that respect is Wonderful! The Churches Preservation is a continual Miracle, considering how small they are, and the number of their Enemies, how many &amp; Mighty their Enemies are! And how few the Lords People are if we look all the World over; Yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they have so many Enemies, that do hate them, and that would be glad, that there might not be one Godly man upon the Face of the Earth; still God keeps a number in the World, that do fear Him, and serve Him, and a Wonderful Thing it is. Gods Wonderful Dealings with <hi>David,</hi> in carrying him safe, through so many Enemies and dangers was an Example, <hi>a Type</hi> of His Providence towards His Church in all Ages of the World. I have formerly shewed you how the Church of God is like the <hi>Bush</hi> that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> beheld, that was Burned and yet not Consumed. It is said Act 7. 31. <hi>That Moses did Wonder <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>!</hi> he wondred to see a dry shrub, all on a flame and yet not Consumed. The Church of God is that <hi>Bush</hi> that hath been all on a flame, for these Five Thousand Years, and not Consumed! No, nor shall it be while the World stands. This is a Wonderful Work of God! And the Work of God in delivering His Church, is also very Wonderful. He uses to beliver His people in such a way as they never dreamed of in such a way as men never thought of, Isa 64. 3, 4. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:001366_0132_0FB294AA38CA3540"/>
against their Enemies, which the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> never thought of: They did not look for such Things; they little thought that God would deliver them. First by bringing Ten Plagues on the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and, when that would not do, by destroying the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and all his Nobles in one day, that so His People might besaved. These were terrible Things, that were not looked for, till God did them. So doth the Lord deliver His people by such Instruments (many times) as were very unlikely to be Saviours, His Works are Wondrous in that respect. When the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were oppressed by the <hi>Midianites,</hi> God wrought Salvation for them by <hi>Gideen,</hi> an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Man, of a poor Family in <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and he the least of his Fathers Family, this <hi>Gideen,</hi> with Three Hundred Men must deliver the Lords People from more then an Hundred Thousand Enemies that came in Arms against them, this was a Wondrous Work. So that <hi>David</hi> must be a Deliverer was Wonderful, <hi>David</hi> (the Son of <hi>Jesse</hi>) a poor Shepherd must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Lords people from the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> and other Nations. And I am perswaded, that there is, at this Day, some <hi>David</hi> keeping the Sheep, whom God will raise up to do Great Things for His Name: Remember, that I told you so, for some of you may live to see it. And the Work of God in Reforming and Refining His Church, is not less Wonderful, than that of Delivering them. When the Church is exceedingly Degenerate, when there is a general and deep Apostacy, that, <hi>Now,</hi> there must be a Recovery, is a Marvellous thing. The Antichristian Apostasie was a General Apostasie, <hi>The whole World Wondred after the Beast,</hi> and the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that was begun near two Hundred Years ago, was a most Wonderful Work of God. Hence <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2, 3. There was seen a Company <hi>with Harps of God in their Hands, standing on a Sea of Glass mingled with Fire:</hi> A Company that was Washed from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:001366_0133_0FB294AB331A0030"/>
Pollutions; and then it is said, <hi>Great and marvellous are thy Works, O Lord!</hi> It was a Great, and Marvellous Work of God, thus to begin, and carry on the Work of Reformation. That's the Second Proposition.</p>
            <p>PROP. III. <hi>That when God's Time to accomplish the glorious Promises made to His People us near, His Wondrous Works will declare it.</hi> Hence the Scriptures speak of <hi>the signs of the Times,</hi> whereby we may discern that God is about to do Great Things in the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 3. Christ tells the <hi>Jews</hi> that they did not discern the signs of the Times; and what were the signs of those Times? Truly the Wondrous Works that were done by the Lord Jesus Christ. The Blind were made to see, the Lame marvellously made whole; these were the signs of the Times, these were signs that God was now coming to fulfill the Glorious Promises made concerning what should come to pass in the days of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> So with respect to Christs Second Coming, there will be signs of that, <hi>Wondrous Works of God,</hi> which, when we see them, we may conclude, <hi>that the Lords Name is near.</hi> Thus hath Christ, our Lord, instructed us, Luk. 21. 30, 31. <hi>When the Fig-Tree buds forth, you know that Summer is near, so, when you see these Things come to pass, then knew that the Kingdom of God is near, yea, at the Door.</hi> And will hasten on the World er'e Men are aware of what is Coming on them. But then it will be Enquired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By what Wondrous Works dath God declare, that his Name is near?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Answer Briefly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By prodigious Signs.</hi> Thus when the Lord was about to save His <hi>Israel</hi> of old, <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. 9. He shewed <hi>Tokens and Wonders in the Land of Egypt.</hi> Prodigies are called <hi>Wonders,</hi> in that they cause Men to Wonder, &amp; there were many of these when God came down to deliver His People. It is an old Observation, <hi>That when the Lord is about to bring Changes on the World Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:001366_0134_0FB294ADA8C1BB28"/>
Signs precede,</hi> as Indications of the Strange things that must happen. And that Observation is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture, for so Christ Intimated unto His Disciples, that before the Wonderful Changes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>Jewish Nation,</hi> there should be Prodigious Signs, that they might from thence Conjecture what God was about to do. Luk. 21. 11. <hi>There shall be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sights, and great Signs from Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Jewish Historian</hi> doth give us an Account concerning those <hi>fearful sights;</hi> He says, that ever <hi>Jerusalem</hi> there was a <hi>Blazing Star,</hi> in the Form of a <hi>Sword,</hi> impending over the City, an whole Year together. And that, in the Air, there were seen <hi>Armies</hi> Encountring one another. And in the <hi>Temple</hi> there was a Voice heard, saying, <hi>Let us depart from this Place.</hi> The Great God, doth Commission His Angels to do such Things, as these are, that so men may prepare for what is coming, or, if found unprepared, be left the more Inexcusable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When we see, That God is removing these Things out of the way, that would obstruct the Accomplishment of His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises we may then conclude, that His Name is near,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 12. <hi>When I begin, I will also make an end;</hi> saith the Lord. When God doth begin in a way of Judgment towards His Enemies, He is wont to go on in that way, and work, as sure as He begins He will make an End. Hence the Scripture speaks of <hi>the beginning of revenges, on the Enemy,</hi> Deut. 32. 42. So when God does begin in a way of Mercy towards His People, He is wont to go on, in that way. Now God usually begins His Work by removing those Things, that stand in His way, by strange Providences He doth remove them. He doth cause <hi>Earth-Quakes,</hi> which make Mountains to fall down before Him, Zech. 4 7. <hi>What art thou O great Mountain! Thou shalt be made a plain before Zerubbabel.</hi> There was a <hi>Baby lexian Mountain;</hi> God made it a Plain, that His people might be delivered. There was a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Mountain,</hi> that did oppose their going on
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:001366_0135_0FB294AF186FB108"/>
with the Building of the <hi>Temple.</hi> God made that <hi>Mountain</hi> to fall down before Him. There are <hi>Things</hi> that obstruct, &amp; there are <hi>Persons</hi> which obstruct the Work of God, &amp; commonly the greatest in the World are the chief obstructers thereof. But now when Gods time is come to save His People, He takes them out of the way, and thereby shews what He is about to do. When Gods Time was come that <hi>David</hi> must be seated on the Throne, <hi>Saul</hi> must die. &amp; <hi>Abner</hi> die, &amp; <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> also, these were admirable Providences, that so way might be made for God to perform what he had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised unto David. And when the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> were near their Deliverance, God removed their chief Enemies. There was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King of Egypt to oppose, but him did the Lord dethrone. The Prophet <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> takes notice of it, Hab. 3. 13 <hi>When thou wentest out for Salvation to thy People, thou didst wound the Head, in the house of the Wicked.</hi> Was not <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that Head in the House of the Wicked? When we see such Things in the World, when we see God Wounding, &amp; drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Pharaohs</hi> of the World, in the Red-Sea of His Wrath, we may Conclude that <hi>His Name is near.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Strange unaccountable Impressions on the Spirits of men de declare that His Name is near;</hi> for God doth Spirit men according to what he designs to bring to pass in the World. He doth raise up Instruments, &amp; Spirit them for that Work, that He hath designed them unto. So that this or that Instrument, whom God will make use of, shall be strangely Inclined to engage in such a Work, and all the World shall not disswade the Man from being concerned in that Work God Spirits him unto. Thus when God delivered His People of old, by <hi>Othniel</hi> and <hi>Gideon.</hi> It is said, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord came upon them.</hi> He filled them with Courage &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, that venture they would, God &amp; His Angels were with them, &amp; Spirit them, in those great undertaking. <hi>Soul</hi> in the beginning of his Reign
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:001366_0136_0FB294B415B0E310"/>
did well, he was an Instrument to deliver the Nation from <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> which the <hi>Ammonites</hi> did exercise over them, God did wonderfully Spirit Him for that Service. It is said I Sam. 11. 6. <hi>That the Spirit of God came upon Saul,</hi> and then he was full of indignation &amp; Zeal to deliver the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> from those that did oppress them, This now was the <hi>Finger of God.</hi> And the Lord doth not only Spirit a few choice In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments whom He singles out to do His Work by, but He doth Influence the Spirits of Men generally after a strange manner. There are sometimes unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Impressions on the Spirits of the Multitude Inclining to do what God has decreed shall be done, which declare that <hi>His Name is near.</hi> A very strange thing it was that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> should shew kindness to the Children of <hi>Israel;</hi> that they who were their Inveterate Enemies, should furnish them with Gold, &amp; Jewels: but the hand of God was in it, Exod. 11. 3. <hi>God gave them favour in the eyes of the Egyptians.</hi> God shews His Soveraignty most eminently, by His Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Hearts, and over the Spirits of Men, Psal. 29. 10. <hi>God sits upon the Floods, He sits King forever! </hi> He overules the Tumultuous Spirits of men, so that they shall be byassed and inclined to the very Thing, that Heaven hath appointed to bring to pass. When Gods time was come to set <hi>David</hi> in the Throne, the Spirit of the Nation generally was Inclined to make <hi>David</hi> their King. Such Things as these mentioned are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations to us of <hi>the Lords Name being near.</hi> Thus have you heard the Doctrine explained and confirmed, in the Particulars, which have been Insisted on: All I shall say by way of <hi>Application</hi> is only a Word of <hi>EXHORTATION.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What should the <hi>Exhertation</hi> be? Let it be in the Words of Christ to <hi>Thomas,</hi> Joh. 20. 27. <hi>Be not faithless, but believing.</hi> As to Gods Promises, be not faithless but believing. As to Promises made to particular
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:001366_0137_0FB294B50CFB5958"/>
Believers, &amp; as to the Promises made to the Church of God, &amp; the Glorious Times that are hastening on the World, be not faithless but Beliveing. Something by way of <hi>Encouragement</hi> let me speak; and something by way of <hi>Caution</hi> and <hi>Counsel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consi. 1. <hi>It is certain that the Church of God upon Earth shall have a happy Day of it.</hi> Great shall be the Peace and Prosperity of the People of God, throughout the World. Those Things shall come to pass that will make the Times Happy. Good Rulers make happy Times; and God hath Promised that Blessing to His People, Isa. 49. 23. <hi>Kings shall be thy Nursing Fathers, &amp; Queens thy Nursing Mothers,</hi> &amp; that Promise of Judges, as at the First, and Counsellors as at the Beginning, is yet to be fulfilled in a more glorious manner than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has been known upon the Earth. What an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Change have we seen of late, in our own Land &amp; Nation? What sad Times were there a few Years ago, when the vilest Debaucheries were openly Practised. When Prisons were filled with Good men. When faithful Ministers of God were not permitted to Preach the Gospel. Things are much better there, now; &amp; they will be better than they are. The First Christian Emperour that ever was in the World came out of <hi>Britain,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Constantine</hi> the great. I am perswaded God has signal Mercy in store for that Land. Yea, &amp; a Revolution is hastening on the whole World, which will make it look with quite another face than it does at present, For, <hi>The Mountain of the Lords House shall be Established in the Top of the Mountains, and shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above the Hills,</hi> Isa. 2. 2. They, that are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foot shall be above the Hills, &amp; the Nations shall flow to the House of the Lord. It is said, Rev. 9, 10. <hi>We shall reign on Earth.</hi> It is not said we <hi>do</hi> reign, no, but we <hi>shall</hi> reign on Earth; such a Day there <hi>shall</hi> be, when the People of God shall reign, not only in Heaven forever; but upon this very Earth. <hi>

have been Persecuted, &amp; Oppressed, &amp; <hi>Here</hi> they shall Reign. Again, it is Sin and Unrighteousness that makes the Times to be Evil; but there are Holy Times a coming, Zech. 14. 20. <hi>Holiness to the Lord shall be written on the Bells, &amp; Horse Bridles, and on every Pot in Jerusalem;</hi> very Holy Times there shall be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World; &amp; therefore happy Times.</p>
            <p>Consi 2. <hi>This happy Blessed Day is near at hand.</hi> When <hi>the man of Sin</hi> shall be once removed, then the Church of God shall see good Dayes, &amp; that will be er'e long. He hath but Twelve Hundred and Sixty Years allowed him to Reign in, and that Time is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Expired, I doubt not, but that it may be demons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated from Scripture &amp; History, that more than 1200. of those Years are past. We see the beginnings of what the Scripture hath spoken with respect to the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 8. It is said, <hi>That the Lord will consume him with the Breath of His mouth, &amp; Destroy him, with the Brightness of his Coming.</hi> So that there is a Consumption to come upon <hi>Antichrist</hi> by the <hi>Breath</hi> of the Lords Mouth, as a forerunner &amp; certain Symptom of his utter destruction by the Brightness of the Lords Coming. The <hi>Man of Sin</hi> has been in a consumption almost these 200 Years <hi>Bellarmins</hi> complains that ever since <hi>Protestants</hi> have Preached that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> his dominions have been lessened. Thus has he been consuming a long time. We may therefore hope that his final Ruine draws on apace. We are now come to the extremity of Times, and therefore Motions, and Revolutions in the World will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding quick; when things come near to the place where they must center, they move very swiftly. All the great Revolutions in the World shall center at last in the Kingdom of Christ. That and that only is the Kingdom that cannot be shaken. <hi>The Lord will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, overturn, overturn until he comes, whose right it is</hi> to have the Crown on His Head, &amp; the Scepter in His
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:001366_0139_0FB294BBD595DD18"/>
Hand, and to <hi>Him</hi> will He give it. Revolutions will therefore be very quick &amp; amazing to the Nations. By that time the Work of one Revolution is well over, another comes on the back of it. The Lord will make greater Changes in the World, in one Age now, than in many heretofore. The Scripture speaketh of Christs <hi>Davidical Kingdom,</hi> God hath Promised, that He shall <hi>Sit on the Throne of David,</hi> Ezek. 37. 24, 25. There is Reason to believe, that this <hi>Generation</hi> shall not wholly pass away, before that Promise be fulfilled in a more Glorious manner than ever yet. I will mention <hi>one Reason</hi> to you, which is of weight with me, whatever it may be with others. It makes me to rejoyce in Hope that the Glorious Times we look for are not far of. It is this: The Light concerning these Truths is wondrously broke out upon the World in this last Age. In the former Ages, few of the Lords Worthies had their Hearts inclined to study the <hi>Revelation</hi> Great <hi>Calvin</hi> though one of the best, and most Judicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters that ever wrote on the Bible, professed, he could not tell what to make of that obscure Portion of the Sacred Book. But in this Century, in the which God hath cast our Lot, to be, many have been search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into those formerly sealed Mysteries, &amp; have made great discoveries. It is said, Dan. 12. 4. <hi>Seal the Book till the Time of the end, many shall run to and fro, and Knowledge shall be Increased.</hi> In this Last Age, there have been many <hi>Discourses,</hi> &amp; Knowledge is Increased. A Sign that the Time of the End is at hand, Rev. 22. 10. <hi>Seal not the Sayings of the Prophesie of this Book, for the Time is at Hand.</hi> Do we not see, That the <hi>Day Star</hi> is risen. The light begins to prevail, a Blessed Sign, that the Glory of the Lord will shine upon the World er'e long. I might have added, that the expectations which are raised in the minds of men, concerning some great Work of God, near to be accomplished, seem to be Ominous. Travellers say, that the <hi>Turks</hi> &amp; <hi>Jews</hi> have strange Sentiments in their Spirits of
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:001366_0140_0FB294BEA3AA7A58"/>
Great Changes hastening on the World. And which is more, there are many amongst the Fearers of the Lord that have so. When the Time of Christs first coming drew nigh, there was <hi>Waiting</hi> and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 25. There was then a <hi>looking for Redemption</hi> in Israel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 26, 38. That might be the inducing cause, which made many <hi>Jews</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Time come from all parts <hi>to dwell</hi> at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 5. So doubtless there will be in many the like hopes before the great Redemption, when the Lord will appear the second time to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Consi. 3. <hi>The Works of God, at this Day, declare that His Name is near.</hi> That God is about to do some Wonderful Thing, in the Earth. Yea, that our <hi>David</hi> shall now in a little time have the Kingdom which God has promised him. Is not the Lord making way for it? Is not the Lord shaking Heaven &amp; Earth? Is not the Lord shaking all Nations, at this day? Do not our Eyes behold those very things, which Christ Himself has mentioned as the Signs of His Coming, and Kingdom being at the Door? Is there not Distress of Nations with great perplexities, the Sea, and the Waves Roaring? Is there not a Storm amongst the <hi>European Nations,</hi> the Sea and Waves thereof Roaring so Loud, that we in <hi>America,</hi> Three Thousand Miles Distant, are Amazed with the Noise they make? Had such Things as these Happened a Thousand years ago, we could not from thence have argued that the Kingdom of Christ was near: But since they come to pass towards the End of the Fourth Monarchy, under it's last Head, they are a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that <hi>the Lord is Near,</hi> His Works declare it. And you must Give me Leave, (tho' I have done it when discoursing on another Scripture) <hi>again</hi> to put you in mind (once mentioning such Wondrous, and Astonishing Works of God is not enough) let me therefore again remind you of the <hi>Dreadful Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Quakes,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:001366_0141_0FB294BF7917DC28"/>
which these late Times have been attended with. <hi>Earth-Quakes,</hi> are sometimes Prognosticks of <hi>State-Quakes, Kingdom-Quakes, Nation-Quakes;</hi> Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans speak of an Universal <hi>Earth-Quake</hi> perceived in all the Parts of the Known World; the like never sampled in any Age which happned, at the Death of <hi>Julian</hi> the last Heathen Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> after which were great Commotions and Devastations throughout the <hi>Empire.</hi> Judicious Interpreters have thought that this very <hi>Earth-Quake</hi> was Predicted <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 5. That the Prophesie was fulfilled both in a literal and a Mystical sense, the former being an Indicating Sign of the Latter. Our Lord speaks of <hi>Earth-Quakes in diverse Places,</hi> as precedaneous to His Coming, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 11. That is, say some before His Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Coming to destroy the Temple, and Burn the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so hath the Prophesy in part, been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi> speaks of five famous Cities in <hi>Asia,</hi> that perished by Earth-quakes 6 years before the fatal ruine of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Other Historians mention twelve Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which at one time, &amp; thirteen Cities which at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, were swallowed up by fearful Earth-quakes, all in the Reign of <hi>Tiberus Nero.</hi> But the like signs will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again, when <hi>the Name of the Lord is near</hi> as warnings to the world, that the <hi>Great &amp; Notable day of the Lord is near, it is near.</hi> And have not such awful Signs as these been multiplied in our days? Have there not been <hi>Earth-quakes,</hi> &amp; that <hi>in diverse places?</hi> Has <hi>America</hi> been free from them? Has not the Island of <hi>Jamaica</hi> been trembling? Are not many hundreds there, gone down into the grave, in a moment? Was not <hi>Lima in Peru</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd by an <hi>Earth-quake?</hi> And have there not been <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> not long since? Did not 5000. Souls in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> lately perish by an <hi>Earth-quake?</hi> But most of all in <hi>Europe.</hi> Did not the Lord shake <hi>Naples</hi> a few years ago? But what has been done in the garden of <hi>Europe?</hi> What has been in <hi>Sicily!</hi> How many Cities and thousands of Souls, (an hundred and forty

thousand, as some have computed) have the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes swallowed up within these few years? The Lords wondrous works shew that his Name is come near to <hi>Babylon.</hi> He has shaken terribly the Earth, in one of the Territories thereof. And I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is portentous that ere long the Voice of the Angel will be heard, saying, <hi>Babylon is fallen! is fallen!</hi> And what shall I say more? Are there any other wondrous Works of the Lord, for me to Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this Day? Has not God been doing wonders in <hi>England,</hi> in some late Years? I have received it from very good hands, That <hi>Miraculous Cures</hi> have been there, wrought by the Finger of God! And what does the Lord say to us, and to the whole World, that shall hear of his marvellous Doings? Does he not say, that there is some Extraordinary work of God as the very Door? Does He not say, That rather than his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies shall not be Destroyed, or the Promises made to his People not Performed. He will bring them to pass in a Miraculous way. When one was restored to Life, by touching the Dead Boxes of <hi>Elisha,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 21. that Miracle was a Sign that the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> who were in a Dead Estate, should be Revived. The Church of God has been in a Sick Estate a long time. May the late Miraculous Cures be a sign of its speedy Recovery! Several late Writers are of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, That when the Kingdom of God shall appear in its Glory, the Gift of Miracles will return; &amp; that these late <hi>Wondrous Works,</hi> are Drops before a Shower. <hi>Miracles</hi> are called <hi>Powers.</hi> If the Lord is come with Power, we may hope that He will appear in Great Glory.</p>
            <p>Now, then let me proceed to set before you some Cautions and Counsels.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We are to be Cautioned against being Perc<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ptory, and Particular in our Timing of Future Events.</hi> Some Good men have been so, by whose Mistakes, Atheists
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:001366_0143_0FB294C2B2980E90"/>
and Adversaries of the Truth have been Harden'd in their Infidelity. A Jesuit writing on the Revelation does bitterly Insult over Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> because of his Mistaking in some <hi>Apocalyptical Computations.</hi> When men who are disaffected see those who have been mighty Confident in their Timing future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, deceived, they conclude that all that has been Written about Prophesies, to be fulfilled in these last Days, is meer Phansy and Delusion. We may safely upon clear Scripture grounds affirm, that the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Great Day of Judgment is Near, but for any to fix on the Particular year, when that Day shall begin, is too much Boldness and Presumption. What the Holy Angels of Heaven, who will be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently concerned in the Glorious Transactions of that Day, know now concerning it, is not for us to say, but our Lord before his Ascension said, <hi>Of that Day and Hour knoweth no man, No, not the Angels which are in Heaven, neither the Son of Man, but the Father only,</hi> Mark 13. 32. Let not us Sinful Creatures, then take upon us, to Determine <hi>the Hour.</hi> when this shall be. Some who have done so, have Exposed themselves to just Censures, for their arragant Rashness Again, We may boldly Assert, That Anti-christs Time is well nigh Expired. And <hi>Modest Conjectures,</hi> as to the Year of his fatal Overthrow, are to be Encouraged; but Peremptoriness therein, is not Commendable. It is very clear from the Scripture, that the Reign of Anti-christ, from first to last, shall not continue for more than <hi>a Time, Times, and Half a Time:</hi> or Forty Two Months; or Twelve Hundred &amp; Sixty Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Days; which are all the same. And I conceive that it is very clear from the Scripture, That Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs Reign begins from the time, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire being broken, Ten Kings rose up thereon, not Subject to the Power of <hi>Rome;</hi> as before all Princes in the Empire had been. <hi>The Ten Horns receive their Power as Kings, one Hour with the Beast,</hi> Rev 17 12.
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:001366_0144_0FB294C99A28DE70"/>
This notwithstanding, we are in the Dark, as to the Particular Year, when the <hi>Ten Horned Beast</hi> began his Reign. For the Empire was not Dissolved, nor did the Ten Horns all appear, in one Day. There was the space of no less than an Hundred Years, between the appearance of the First and of the Tenth Horn. Anti-christs Reign could not begin with the First Horn; for then it would have been out, above an Hundred Years ago: If it begun with the Last of the Ten Horns, than he has still more than Ten Years to Reign. But it may be, we must not know, till the Event shall be the Interpreter. The <hi>Babylonian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, was to last but Seventy Years; yet the <hi>Jews</hi> were at a loss, as to the Beginning, and consequently as to the Expiration of those Years. For there were three Steps or Degrees of that Captivity the First, in the Dayes of <hi>Jebeiaki<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> when <hi>Daniel</hi> went Captive: the Second, under <hi>Jeronias,</hi> when <hi>Ezekiel</hi> went Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: the Last under <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> when the Temple and City was Burn't. It is to this day Disputed amongst Learned men, at which of these <hi>Three Captivities,</hi> did the Seventy Years Commence. Very Judicious Writers, conceive, that it was not at the First, nor at the Last of them. A little time will now make a more clear Discovery, when the Churches Captivity under the Spiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> began, and consequently when it will end. When the Disciples were very desirous to know, whether <hi>at that Time,</hi> the Kingdom should be Restored to <hi>Israel,</hi> the Lord, willed them to understand, that it was not for them to know <hi>the Article of Time,</hi> which the Father had put in His own Power, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Remember, That a little before the Glorious Times come, there must be Great Troubles in the World.</hi> Just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Death of <hi>Saul,</hi> whereby way was made for <hi>David</hi> to posses the Kingdom, he was in the greatest Distress, that ever in all his Life; namely, when
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:001366_0145_0FB294CB9F225640"/>
               <hi>Ziklag</hi> was burnt, and his own friends begun to speak of Stoning him. A little before break of Day, is the Darkest time of all the Night. That's one of the Mysteries of Providence. The Lord causeth the Light to shine out of the Greatest Darkness. What a miserable, what a forlorn, and hopeless, Estate, were the Children of Israel in, when the Time of their Deliverance out of Egypt, was near. The Christian Church was never in more Imminent Danger of an utter Extirpation, than in the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> the most Cruel Persecutor that ever was, who Resolved to Extirpate Christianity out of the World, and thought he had done so, Erecting Pillars with that Inscription, <hi>Deleta Superstitione Christiana:</hi> Not unlike the <hi>French Dioclosians</hi> Boasting, that he has Extirpated the Protestant Heresy out of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But these things were done by that Emperor, when the Churches Glorious Deliverance and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement under <hi>Constantine</hi> was very near. When the Seventh Day came, and the Trumpet Sounded, the walls of <hi>Jeriche</hi> fell even with the Ground. In like sort, when the Seventh Trumpet Sounds, My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical <hi>Babylon,</hi> typified by <hi>Jericho</hi> utterly ceaseth. But before that, towards the end of the Sixth Trumpet, there is a sad Slaughter of the <hi>Witnesses.</hi> There are that now make it a Question, <hi>Is the Last Slaughter of the Witnesses past, or future?</hi> I will freely Declare my own thoughts to you concerning it. I hope there will be no more a General Slaughter of them. It seems to me, that the Lord by wondrous works, has in diverse Lands, as a first Fruits begun their <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> Is not a Spirit of Life from God, wondrously entred into the <hi>Vaadois</hi> of late? Yea, and into those Protestants in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who have witnessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Remainders of Popery; and this after they had been under a Civil Death, from the Sixth

Month, in the Year One thousand Six hundred and Eighty three, to the First Month, in the Year One Thousand Six Hundred and Eighty Seven; which is three Prophetical Dayes, and an Half. <hi>Liberty</hi> (which is <hi>Life</hi>) was then Restored, and is since Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them; and that by wondrous Providences and Revolutions. So that I hope (especially Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that the <hi>Second Wo</hi> seemeth at the same time to be passing away) we may Conclude, <hi>That the Winter is past, and the Singing of Birds is come.</hi> Nevertheless, Great troubles are to be Expected in the world by Wars, and other tremendous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. There is a Scripture in <hi>Daniel</hi> yet to be fulfilled; Namely, that in, Dan. 12. 1. where it is said, <hi>There shall be such a time of trouble, as never was since there was a Nation, to that same time; and at that time thy People shall be Delivered.</hi> The <hi>Third Wo-Trumpet</hi> is yet to Sound; and it will Sound quickly; and the <hi>Clangor</hi> of it will be terrible o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Earth.</p>
            <p>Lastly. <hi>Oh! Be much in Prayer to God, every soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you that Feareth His Name.</hi> Glorious Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and Promises are come to the Birth: You may hasten them by Fervent Prayers to the Lord, Day and Night continually. When <hi>Daniel</hi> understood by Books, the Number of the Years whereof the Word of the Lord came to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, that He would accomplish Seventy Years, in the Desolation of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
