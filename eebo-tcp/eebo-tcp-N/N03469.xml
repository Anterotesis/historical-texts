            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Three of the principal contending Parties appear before Chriſt, tempting him, purſuant to a determination they had come to, after a deep conſultation among themſelves, Luk 20 20. <hi>And they watched him, and ſent forth ſpies, which ſhould feign themſelves juſt men, that they might take hold of his words; that ſo they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governour.</hi> Feign themſelves Juſt men, Men truly Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, who came to him with caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And to gain his confidence, they begin with Propoſitions moſt true in themſelves, but as deſign'd by them, the vileſt Tie chery &amp; the groſſeſt Flattery; and for this Reaſon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour charges them with Hypocriſie Mat 22.16 <hi>We know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God is truth, and carest not for any man; for thou regardest not the perſon of man.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? —</hi>

back to the firſt, which will bring us to our Text; it being a particular Anſwer to the Queſtion propoſed by the <hi>Herodians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The term <hi>Lawyer</hi> is not to be underſtood as in the preſent uſe and acceptation of the word. In the preſent uſe of the term, we underſtand thoſe that <hi>Study and Practice the Common Law, the Civil or Common Law.</hi> Theſe were ſo called <hi>as being Expoſitors of the Law of God given by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> They rendred the Law void by thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations they put upon it: They preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to great Zeal for the Law, and for the Rights of the People; Aſſerting that <hi>they were of the ſeed of Abraham and were free;</hi> nor ought they to be in Subjection to the <hi>Romans.

            <p>From theſe ſprang thoſe, afterwards called <hi>the Zealots,</hi> who did ſo much miſchief to their own Nation, and brought on ruine upon them. They pretended to <note n="†" place="bottom">See Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>'s Memoirs.</note> great Zeal for Religion and Concern for the Publick Good. A great Writer obſerves, <hi>That when a Religious &amp; Civil Controverſie comes to be twisted and blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it makes a ſtrong Ferment.</hi>

They ask, <hi>Whoſe wife ſhall ſhe be, for all had her?</hi> Ver. 29. <hi>Jeſus anſwered &amp; ſaid, Ye do err, not knowing the ſcriptures, nor the power of God.</hi> Ver. 30. <hi>In the reſurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels of God.</hi> That is, they are immortal, and therefore there is no need of Marriage to continue the Species<note n="‖" place="bottom">See <hi>Whitby</hi> in loc.</note> Not that raiſed Bodies ſhall be like Angels in every reſpect; but in

this is the likeneſs deſigned, and that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Our Saviour proceeds to a Proof of the Doctrine of the Reſurrection and future State, from one of the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe the Sadducees diſown'd at the Scripture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe Five Books And doubtleſs they tho't themſelves ſafe enough: they did not expect any Argument to prove this Point could be drawn from the Books of <hi>Moſes:</hi> but they found themſelves much miſtaken. His Proof is, That God had ſaid, as in ver. 32 <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob: He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> This was an irreſiſtable Argument to the <hi>Jews;</hi> Luk. 20.39 The Scribes reply'd, <hi>Maſter, thou haſt well ſaid.</hi> That is, It is a good Proof, of a ſufficient Argument And the <hi>Sadducees</hi> with a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004241_0007_1004311910089570"/>
               <hi>Jerom, Tertullian,</hi> and others, ſuppoſe that this Party were ſo called by the <hi>Jews,</hi> from <hi>Herod the Great,</hi> whom they believ'd was the Meſſias, becauſe of his Wealth Power &amp; Magnificence. He appeared, as they tho't the Meſſias ſhould do: But this ſeems to be without foundation. For tho' <hi>Herod</hi> did many actions to gain the peoples Favour; As melting down his own Plate to buy Corn for the People in a time of Famine. He Rebuilt the Temple with great Expence. Yet the Nation had ſo ſettled an Averſion to him and his Government that it was not poſſible for him, by any acts of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, to remove it. And farther to ſhew the ungroundedneſs of this Opinion, we are to conſider, That the Meſſiah was to ſpring from the Houſe of <hi>David;</hi> but this <hi>Herod</hi> was not of the Stock of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> or Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> but an <hi>Idumean</hi> or <hi>Edomite;</hi> and moreover before this time he was dead and his Party before this time muſt have been dead too.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Herod</hi> was Supported by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and made his Court to them, acknowledged their Authority; and did not ſo much as make or alter his laſt Will without their conſent. Theſe perſons or this Party called <hi>Herodians,</hi> were ſuch who adhered to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſupported <hi>Herod's</hi> Cauſe, and owned the propriety and juſtice of paying Tribute to <hi>Ceſar:</hi> Being thus in <hi>Herod's</hi> Intereſt, they were called <hi>Herodians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004241_0007_1004311910089570"/>
Theſe were <hi>State Officers, Souldiers, Collectors,</hi> call'd <hi>Publicans;</hi> and on that account ſo very odious to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they ranned <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> together: When they would Expoſe our Saviour to the rage and contempt of the People, they ſay, <hi>He is a friend of Publicans and Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Herodians</hi> propoſed this Queſtion, is was not becauſe of any Scruple they had of the lawfulneſs of paying Tribute; but it was with deſign to inſnare him. If he ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer on the Affirmative, He would be expoſed to the Rage of the fiery Zealots: If on the Negative, He would be expoſed to the Militia and Officers of State. As the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> we called <hi>Free-thinkers;</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the <hi>Country Party;</hi> theſe <hi>Herodians</hi> may be ſtiled the <hi>Court Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Queſtion was asked, <hi>Whether it was lawful to pay Tribute or not?</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Shew me the Tribute Money, Whoſe Image or Superſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this? They ſay, Ceſars. Render therefore,</hi>—That is, for this Reaſon becauſe You are his Subjects, this Tribute Money bearing his Image, is a full Proof of it. Our Saviour from the Reaſon of the thing, and from a Maxim received among other Nations, and by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, <hi>That to ſtrike a Coin, ſet its Value, give it a Currency, and if any do Adulterate, Diminiſh or Counterfeit this Coin, become guilty of the Crime,</hi> Laeſae Majeſtatis, <hi>and are expoſed to

Puniſhment accordingly.</hi> It is an Argument of Sovereignty in the one, and Subjection in the other; That Authority that doth this is the higher Power It ſeems therefore very Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, that ſo Exact a Reaſoner as the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>That our Saviour never Reſolved that Queſtion, whether it was lawful to pay Tribute to Ceſar.</hi>

            <p>There are few that need to be told, that by <hi>Ceſar</hi> is meant the <hi>Roman Emperor;</hi> who took it from <hi>Julius Ceſar,</hi> who firſt Reduced the Common Wealth into a Monarchy, &amp; aſſumd the Government: His Name became a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Tribute is one of thoſe things to be paid to whom it is due.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tribute taken in the ſtrict and proper ſenſe, is that Payment which a Conquered or Subju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated People are required to Advance, by thoſe Powers to whom they are in Subjection. When once a People are thus Reduced, it amounts to much the ſame thing, whether it be by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, or by Covenant, or Contract either Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit or Explicit, it becomes a Legal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This ſeems to be the caſe of the <hi>Roman Government</hi> Exerciſed over the <hi>Jews.</hi> And hence it is that the Apoſtle makes the paying Tribute incumbent upon them; and conſiders
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004241_0009_1004058326CF2670"/>
them Obliged to it in point of Conſcience: Herein they were to <hi>Obey,</hi> not for <hi>Wrath,</hi> but <hi>Conſcience.</hi> That is, Not meerly from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Fear, but from a principle of Obedience. Rom. 13 6. <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (i e, For Conſcience ſake) <hi>pay you tribute alſo: For they are God's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, attending continually upon this very thing.</hi> We may therefore conſider Tribute in the large ſenſe, as the Apoſtle doth, as a Tax raiſed for the Support of Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Another of thoſe Obligations we are under to our Civil Rulers; is the paying of Cuſtom to whom Custom is due.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A wife Government ſometimes gives Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the Encouragement of this or that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture that may be for the good of the whole, tho' a People may ignorantly find fault with it. So they may lay Duties upon certain Branches of Trade; ſuch as Impoſt and Exciſe. Theſe Duties are laid, Either upon that which is Superfluous or not neceſſary to Life, or upon that which by its great Increaſe may become hurtful to the Common Wealth; not deſigned for a private gain but a common good. This is what the Apoſtle lets us know we are bound to Pay, as good Subjects to <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> and as good Subjects to <hi>King GEORGE.</hi> And therefore it ſeems wonderfully ſtranger that many who would be thought honeſt Men and good Chriſtians, will cheat the Publick of this Due, and glory in this their ſhame, Not only

do this Evil themſelves, <hi>but have pleaſure in thoſe that do the ſame.</hi> When the Apoſtle hath ſaid in expreſs terms, <hi>Custom to whom cuſtom</hi> is due.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Another of thoſe Obligations we are under to our Civil Rulers is Fear. Fear to whom fear,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Fear,</hi> as it is uſed in the Scripture is of a very Extentive improvement. As it is uſed with relation to GOD, it is put for the whole of Religion. Hence he that fears the Lord &amp; a goad man are the ſame. As it is uſed with relation to men in Authority, it is uſed for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Mal. 1.6. <hi>If I be a maſter, where is my fear?</hi> We may therefore conſider Fear as uſed &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied is this place to comprehend &amp; to intend, that Obedience that is due from Subjects to the Government under which they live. 1 Pet. 2 13. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's ſake.</hi> The command is Extenſive &amp; Univerſal: Yet all this our <hi>Obedience muſt be in the Lord.</hi> If the whole Head ſhould be ſick and by that means Ordinances and Law ſhould be made inconſiſtent with or contrary to the Laws of God, or ſuch as ſap the Foundations of the Common-Wealth, &amp; ſubvert the Government; which is an abuſe of Power &amp; contrary to the appointment of God, who has ſet up the Ruler <hi>to be a Miniſter to us for good:</hi> In ſuch a caſe we have of right a judgment of Diſcretion; and eaſily conclude as the Apoſtles did, when they received a command to Preach no more in the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004241_0010_1004314576C92580"/>
Name of Jeſus, They ſay, <hi>Whether we ſhall Obey God or man, judge ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Obeying every Ordinance of man, is to ſome <hi>an hard ſaying!</hi> They ſeek to Relieve themſelves two or three ways.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>They pretend to find out the true ſpirit and meaning of the Law,</hi> and take care to give a ſenſe agreeable to their Private Intereſt; and this they will have ſo, tho' they make the Law ſpeak Noneſenſe: They bend &amp; diſtort the Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the plain genuine ſenſe &amp; meaning of it, &amp; contrary to what they themſelves would do in that or in any other caſe, if it agreed with their particular intereſt. One man gives it one meaning, &amp; another a contrary; ſo that it muſt have contrary meanings, or which is the ſame, no meaning at all. Theſe perſons, like the Scribes and Phariſees of old, <hi>make void the Law by their Expoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Another way by which men Excuſe themſelves from a conſciencious Obedience, is to repreſent the Laws as inconvenient &amp; inexpedient.</hi> When they have painted it with theſe colours, they look upon themſelves as free from all Obligations. It is a fundamental principle in Government, <hi>That Sovereign Authority muſt lodge ſomewhere.</hi> The Community have placed this in the Legiſlature. Therefore particular perſons have nothing to do to judge of the Expediency of the Laws. It is out of our Province. Another Maxim of Government is, <hi>That where there is abſolute Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004241_0010_1004314576C92580"/>
               <hi>there is no Government.</hi> Statutes are a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint laid upon the Exerciſe of Natural Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by Sovereign Civil Authority. Not that good Government is deſtructive of any ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as is good for the whole, but abundantly ſupports, ſecures &amp; defends it: For that which is good for the whole Body, is for the good of each particular Member. The Law is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with Civil Liberty, that it is the very Baſis &amp; Foundation of it. Altho' the Laws of Chriſt lay us under many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints for our good, Yet, Jam. 1.25 is called, <hi>The perfect law of Liberty.</hi> It is no Reflection upon Civil Government, that it reſtrains our natural Liberty in ſome things, when it ſo well ſecures us in the whole. It is rather an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its Excellency and Perfection.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Another of thoſe Obligations that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Civil Rulers, is to pay them due Honour. Honour to whom honour is due.</hi> The term <hi>Honour</hi> in this place, is not to be conſidered in ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive a ſenſe, as in <hi>the Fifth Commandment</hi> the whole of that Duty we owe to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and to our Natural Parents. All that we are to <hi>render unto Ceſar,</hi> it ſeems to contain in it,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>That Honour and Eſteem we are to have for their Perſons and perſonal Abilities.</hi> This Debt can never be more juſtly challeng'd as due from any more than from Us; For our Magiſtrates are not Impoſed upon us, or introduced by Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery or Corruption; buy fairly &amp; legally Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen

            <p n="2">(2) <hi>We are to honour them not only for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Merit; but alſo for their Office ſake.</hi> They are Inſtruments in the hand of Providence, by whom the World is Governed: They are God's Vice gerents, and therefore called Gods. Pſal. 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid, Ye are gods, and all of you a children of the moſt high.</hi> If we are to pay <hi>Honour to whom honour is due,</hi> then thoſe who fill the Seats of Government, as being God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, may juſtly challenge it of us.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>We honour them when we think well of their Adminiſtrations in Government.</hi> We are always to make allowance for unforeſeen Accidents, for Crooked things that cannot be made ſtraits, for Caſualties &amp; unavoidable Calamities; But when men civil at every thing, cenſure &amp; find fault with the Adminiſtration in all that is done or left undone; make themſelves &amp; others <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p n="4">(4) <hi>We honour them not only in thinking well, but alſo in ſpeaking well of them too</hi> We are to give them their juſt Commendation, ſupport their Character &amp; their Conduct, Speak to them and of them with Decency &amp; Reſpect.

Joſhua</hi> was often exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>be of good Courage</hi> in the diſcharge of his Truſt, not only as Captain General, but alſo as Chief Magiſtrate.

We may take a ſhort view of it in its Effects and happy Fruits It is what helps to diſcover our advantage and our danger when it is at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſo to improve the beſt Means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the one and avoid the other. <hi>The prudent man foreſeeth the evil &amp; hideth himſelf,</hi> Prov. 22.3 Prudence teacheth when to ſpeak, and when to keep ſilence. <hi>The prudent ſhall keep ſilence, for it is an evil time,</hi> Amos 5.13. It not only teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth when to ſpeak and when to keep ſilence, but alſo how and in what manner to ſpeak: For, <hi>Words fitly ſpoken, are as apples of gold in pictures of ſilver,</hi> Prov 25.11. Prudence directs when to uſe Corroſives, and when Lenitives; when to <hi>Reprove ſharply,</hi> and when to give <hi>ſmooth Words:</hi> For, <hi>as the north wind driveth away rain, ſo doth an angry countenance a back-biting tongue,</hi> Prov. 25.23. <hi>A ſoft word is breaketh the bone.

and in the greateſt Fury imaginable, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but noiſe &amp; nonſence could be heard for <hi>two Hours together,</hi> and altho' <hi>the raging of the Sea</hi> and the <hi>madneſs of the People,</hi> are compared to each other, yet <hi>the Town Clerk,</hi> a prudent perſon, with a few ſoft words turn'd away wrath and made all Quiet. Again, As it teacheth when to ſpeak &amp; how to ſpeak, ſo it has as great an influence upon our Actions. We are inſtructed by it what to do, and what to leave undone. <hi>All things are lawful, but all things are not expedient.</hi> It ſuggeſts to us when to go faſt and when to go ſlow. There is <hi>a time to Plant, and a time to Pluck up; a time to Embrace, and a time to refrain from Embracing.</hi> Doubtleſs by this the Wiſe man deſigns to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in the prudent Timing things, which is attended with great Succeſs. Prudence not only directs to the fit timing our Actions, but preſcribes the uſe of the moſt proper and fit Means for the compaſſing our deſigns. <hi>Great Ships are turned about with a very ſmall Helm.</hi> And our moſt important Affairs are Effected many times by ſmall Means In Prudence are a great many nameleſs Excellencies. That which is a farther Evidence of its worth and uſefulneſs is this, <hi>That if a man have not great Parts nor great Learning, yet if he be Prudent and Diligent, he ſhall ſtand before Princes, and not before mean Men.</hi> Say of a man, <hi>That he is very Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> you at once give him an Exalted Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004241_0015_10040598EA7D8C58"/>
Great Learning without Prudence is Pedantly: He is but <hi>as ſounding Braſs and a tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Cymbal.</hi> If a man hath great Parts and ſtrong Powers, but at the ſame time is Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it renders his Folly but the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious. <hi>Dead flies cauſe the ointment of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour; ſo doth a little folly in him that is in reputation for wiſdom and honour,</hi> Eccl 10 1. If a man have great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Strength, yet if he has no Prudence, he is like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> ſtrong and bold, but blind. In a word, Prudence among Governing Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, is like Charity among Spiritual Gifts, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus, <hi>And though I have the gift of propheſie and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.2. What is Knowledge, what is Courage and Parts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prudence? It is therefore much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. And as a means for the increaſe of this valuable Qualification, there muſt be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintance with Humane Nature, its various Paſſions, Affections, Views, Intereſts &amp; Deſigns. We muſt alſo conſider Things as well as Men, and the great variety of Events that happen.</p>
            <p>Having thus conſidered ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Obligations we are under to our <hi>Civil Ruler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>M. <hi>We come to the Second Particular under the Doctrine, and that is the Reaſons or Foundation of this Obligation.</hi>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004241_0015_10040598EA7D8C58"/>1. <hi>Becauſe it is of God's Ordination &amp; Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it ſhould be ſo.</hi> God hath eſtabliſhed Order and Government, and has Required our Subjection, and Commanded us <hi>to Render unto Ceſar the things which are Ceſars.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 13 1, 2. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher powers, for there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore that reſisteth the power, reſiſteth the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God; and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi> As God hath a right of Dominion over us, and is a moſt Juſt and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Governour, His Ordination &amp; Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a ſufficient Reaſon. When it may be truly ſaid, <hi>That the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it,</hi> that is a ſure Foundation for us to build on. Tho' Government be of God's Ordination, yet he hath not preſcrib'd the particular Forms of Government. For, as of Marriage it may be ſaid, <hi>It is God's Inſtitution,</hi> yet the ſorting the particular Pairs or reſpective Help-meets, is left to Choice, to Prudence, to the guidance of Judgment, Affections and Friends. So though God hath appointed Government in general, yet hath appointed Government in general, yet hath he left to us the erecting of ſuch Forms as are moſt agreeable to Laws of Nature, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, &amp; the differing Circumſtances of People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We ſhould render to Ceſar the things which are Ceſars, or anſwer our Obligations to our Civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, becauſe it is not only our Duty, but it is our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt too.</hi> And this will appear if we conſider
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004241_0016_1004059A72B14B80"/>
the Uſefulneſs, nay the Neceſſity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſupport of Communities. It is as needful to the Body Politick, for its Subſiſtence and Comfort, as Breath is to the Noſtrils of the Natural Body. Without this the weak would become a Prey to the ſtrong, the ignorant &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertent wou'd fall into the ſnare of the crafty. <hi>A girl might be ſold for wine, &amp; the poor for a pair of ſhoes.</hi> Men would become <hi>as the Fiſhes of the Sea,</hi> the leſs would be devoured by the greater. It is owing to good Government, that Liberty &amp; Property are ſecured. It is by this means that a mans Houſe is his Caſtle, &amp; not by the ſtrength of the Walls. It is by this that every one ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth under his Vine and his Fig-tree, and there is none to make him afraid. From hence we may ſee how much thoſe are miſtaken, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being ſenſible of the benefit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; being thankful for it, have ill-thoughts of it. They think it is only the contrivance of artful and deſigning Men, who would make themſelves great at the Expence of their poor Neighbours; who would oppreſs the Poor, and grind the face of the Needy. Whereas Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is deſign'd to prevent Fraud, Violence &amp; Injuſtice; and in the hand of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is the Inſtrument of our Security; is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd <hi>for a Terror to evil-doers, &amp; a Praiſe to them that do well.</hi>

The Head of the Family had the Legiſlative and Executive Power in his hands. He had the Military Power veſted in him; As we may ſee by <hi>Abraham,</hi> who Armed of his Trained Souldiers Three Hundred &amp; Eighteen for a ſudden Expedition.

But to return from this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. Tho' mankind received great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from this Government, yet as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Government was Deſpotical, and the Governour, by Intereſt, Affection &amp; Prejudice, leſs fit to make a juſt Judgment, Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very much to be preferred before it: And Conſequently, As Civil Government has Obtained and Gained ground, Patriarchal

has ſunk, and by degrees dwindled away, to what we now call <hi>Family Government,</hi> which is much limited &amp; reſtrained by the <hi>Civil.</hi> We ſee this by what we find, <hi>Deut</hi> 21 18. Where a <hi>Rebellious Son</hi> was to be brought by <hi>his Parents to the Elders</hi> that is to <hi>the Magiſtrates of the City,</hi> who were to Puniſh him. Yet <hi>Family Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as it is limited by the <hi>Civil Government,</hi> is of mighty Advantage to mankind.
