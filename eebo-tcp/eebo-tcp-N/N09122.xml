            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>Jer. xxviii 16.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>—This year thou ſhalt die.—</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHAT is ſaid of general rules may be applied to general maxims; for hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any one of either holds true in every caſe. What maxims more general than theſe three <hi>—All muſt die— None knoweth the time of his death—Ignorance of the time is better than the knowledge of it</hi>? Yet each of theſe hath many exceptions. The text is an exception to the ſecond maxim, and poſſibly to the third; other texts there are which afford exceptions to the firſt, What I intend to do is, To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on thoſe exceptions; and then to addreſs you in ſuch a manner as may be ſuitable to the time and the text.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt maxim aſſerts that <hi>all muſt die,</hi> —This is a decree of heaven, and is expreſſed in general terms throughout the Bible. The reaſon of the decree comports with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of its terms, for <hi>all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. v. 12; nevertheleſs the execution thereof will not ſeem adequate to either. Enoch and Elijah ſinned but died not, Heb. xi. 5.2 King. ii 11.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011642_0003_0F879E6970CD39A0"/>
The ſaints on Earth at the coming of Chriſt will not be ſinleſs, yet none of them ſhall die; and they perhaps may amount to many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands or millions. 1 Cor. xv. 51. But if theſe exemptions of ſinners from death be real, how can death be the <hi>wages of ſin</hi>? how will the veracity of God appear in ſaying, <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die</hi>? I anſwer, Chriſt died for all the ſinners who die not. And his death was ſubſtituted in the room of theirs, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God and of his law as their own. But did not Chriſt die for others, even for all the elect? Why then are not all exempted from dying? I anſwer, It is not becauſe the death of Chriſt was leſs proxical or leſs ſatisfactory in the caſe of the one party than of the other; but for ſome good reaſons or deſigns unknown to us. The death of ſaints however differs not much from athanacy. It is no penal evil. A ſting it has not. <hi>Falling aſleep</hi> is a juſt repreſentation of it. Some have deſired it as an uſher to glory, and lamented a recovery out of fits which, in their acceſs, they took to be death itſelf. I have met with an inſtance of this laſt, in my own houſe the thirteenth of Auguſt paſt; and that from a perſon who was very near and dear to me; which helped me much in the midſt of my ſorrows.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſecond maxim is <hi>That no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the time of his death.</hi> This, though it be not ſcriptural, obtains in the world as an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal truth. But it has exceptions. And I intend under this head to ſhew—That ſome
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011642_0004_0F879E6A16958650"/>
have known the times of their death; and to mention the ways and means whereby they obtained that knowledge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am to ſhew that ſome have certainly known the time of their death. And what has been may be again. Hananiah knew the year in which he ſhould die, as appears by the text. Hezekiah muſt have known as much. Iſaiah xxxviii. 19. Saul knew the day of his death. 1 Sam. xxviii. 19. Dives, the night in which his Soul ſhould be required of him. Luke xii. 20. Profane hiſtory abounds with names of perſons who have foretold, ſome the year, ſome the month, and ſome the day of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe; ſuch as Juſtin Martyr, Cyprian, and others among the ancients. Hale, Uſher, Jewell, Tyro and Peden, among the moderns. To which I could add ſome inſtances, which have fallen under my own obſervation. All theſe died at the times predicted, and therefore muſt have known the times. Come we</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſpeak of the ways and means by which men have attained to that knowledge. Hananiah and Hezekiah were informed of the fatal time by prophets. Saul by a ſpeaking apparation. Tyro by an audible voice which ſaid 'Thou ſhalt not paſs the thirty fourth year of thy age,' Polycarp, in a viſion, ſaw his martyrdom and the manner of it three days before it came. Cyprian and Uſher diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the preciſe time of their death, by dreams. Hale, Jewell, and Peden by an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:011642_0005_0F879E6D6FC6A6E0"/>
premonition or boding that roſe in their minds, by which the firſt informed his acquaintance 'that on ſuch a day or the ſame day month he ſhould be no more', which laſt brought the event to paſs. The next told ſeveral 'that within forty eight hours he ſhould be in eternity'. The other ſaid 'this day is to be my laſt'; in all which caſes events proved predictions. A gentlewoman in town had ſomething of this premonitive or forebod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impreſſion on her mind for a conſiderable time, and had been heard to ſay 'that ſhe ſhould die with her eighth child'; and in her eighth pregnancy ſhe died Auguſt 16, 1769. I myſelf know a man who, on the ninth day of March, in the year 1755, was ſeized with a perſuaſion, <hi>That at the end of full fifteen years, from that time, he ſhould be dead.</hi> The impreſſion was ſudden and ſtrong; ſo ſtrong as not to leave a doubt reſpecting the iſſue, and has continued the ſame to this day. About four years after he told a friend of it; that friend endeavouring to rally him out of the notion made the thing known abroad, which was preſently ſpoken of in various ways. But the above is the ſtate of the caſe. Whether a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition or a deception time will ſhow, and that time is at hand : if the firſt, the thing will claim no praiſe becauſe involuntary; if the laſt, others have been deceived the ſame way without blame, and that for the ſame reaſon.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The other maxim is, <hi>That perfect igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the time of death is better than a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011642_0006_0F879E6F009E62E0"/>
of it.</hi> And I believe this, becauſe God leaves moſt men in the dark about the matter. Whatever is, is beſt. But as it is certain that God hath ſhewn to ſome their times of diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, We muſt for the ſame reaſon believe the oppoſite of the above maxim in their caſes; otherwiſe neither God's prophets nor God's providence would have diſcloſed the ſecret. The deſigns of providence in concealing from moſt men the number of their days may be ſeen in Drelincourt on death. But his deſigns in making known to ſome the periods of their exiſtence I can only gueſs at.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When God makes the diſcovery to a wicked man it may be to haſten his amendment. The thing has a peculiar aptitude to anſwer the end; elſe why does a phyſician inform a wicked patient, or a judge inform a criminal that he has but ſo many hours to live? Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah, Hananiah, and Saul were wicked men; and who knows but God meant to pluck theſe ſons of Abraham as brands out of the burning by the diſcoveries he made touching the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their deaths. Certain it is that Saul fell to the ground, faſted, and ſorrowed much when he heard the fatal ſentence <hi>to morrow ſhalt thou be among the dead</hi>! Certain alſo, that the ſentence of a judge or a phyſician hath made wretches think ſeriouſly and think ſpeedily of a preparation for death who could not be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereto by any other means.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When God ſhows a good man the time of his death it may be, either for a brighter
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011642_0007_0F879E7037F21908"/>
diſplay of his piety. How gloriouſly pious did the King of Iſrael appear when he was told that he ſhould die and not live. Iſaiah xxxviii. Or, for exciting him to greater diligence. Peter confeſſes that it had this effect upon him. 2. Pet, I. 14. Or elſe to give him an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of knowing his ſtate. Belſhazzer knew not what a wretch he was till he ſaw on the wall how ſoon he ſhould die, Dan. v. But when Paul knew that the time of his departure was at hand he felt more comfortable and happy than before. 2 Tim. iv. 8. But whether the above be the reaſons why God doth diſcover the ſecret to ſome few may be doubted; yet that he hath made ſuch diſcoveries, and that to both wicked and good men, cannot be doubted at all.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I proceed to the ſecond thing I promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed viz. to addreſs you in a manner that may ſuit the text, and the time; and that will, by the bleſſing of God, be of benefit to each of you.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The time, you know, is the firſt day of the new year, and that which connects it with the old; on which account it, like Janus, caſts a double aſpect, the one on the year paſt; and the other on the year begun. It will be ſuitable to the time therefore to ſay ſomething of it both in its retroſpection, and proſpect. If, with the day, we look back to the year it puſhes from us we ſhall ſee cauſe for thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; and ſorrow; thankſgiving for a year's
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011642_0008_0F879E70EE2E9608"/>
bounties; and ſorrow for a year's ſins. Every day and every night of the laſt year yielded us ſome favours. God's mercy was new every morning; and his faithfulneſs repeated every night. He gave us food and raiment, and health, and liberty. He gave us his ſabbaths, his goſpel, and his means of grace. He gave us hope, and ſupported it by tokens of his love. He hath borne with us and ſpared us a year longer. He hath crowned the year with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thanks therefore be to his holy name. But theſe thanks are to be mingled with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. We have a year's ſins to bewail. How many theſe have been God only knows; but we eaſily know the number of them to have been great. Not a day nor a night paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out producing ſome wants of conformity to, or or tranſgreſſions of the law and goſpel. O, Lord we look back with ſhame from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this year; we judge and condemn our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and moſt humbly aſk forgiveneſs of the paſt year's ſins! But if with the day, we look forward to the year commenced we have a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect big with inſtructions. It meets us with calls to reſolve, to pray and to ſtrive. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that in the name and ſtrength of God we will ſpend this year better than the paſt. To pray that God will be bountiful and kind to us as he hath been the laſt year, and to ſtrive to offend him leſs, to pleaſe him better, and to love him more. Such reſolutions, prayers, and ſtrivings ſuit the time well, but ſuit our own character and intereſt much better.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:011642_0009_0F879E7196A77FE0"/>2. Having ſaid ſo much to the time I will add ſomewat that may be ſuitable to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar nature of the text. It is a very alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one to wicked men; but pleaſing, highly pleaſing to the righteous. <hi>This year thou ſhalt die</hi>! What, die? and that, this year? Alarming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! Every ſyllable ſounds like the ticking of a death-watch! Obſerve! Death is in the text! And a ſpecification of <hi>this year</hi> for the time of death to ſome one or other! But who is that one? I anſwer, <hi>poſſibly</hi> every one here— <hi>probably</hi> many a one—and <hi>certainly</hi> ſome one or other! It is poſſible that every one of us may be dead before the end of this year; for the world is grown old. And where is the man or the angel that will inſure its continuance for a month, a week, or a day longer? Or if the end of all things be not at hand who can ſay that neither the ſword, nor famine, nor peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor Indians, nor earthquake ſhall put an end to us all in three hundred and ſixty five days? May I not repeat my text therefore to expreſs a poſſibility of what may befall <hi>every one</hi> of us this year? But poſſibilities are light things. Therefore I add, that the text will <hi>probably</hi> be verified this year in the caſe of <hi>many a one</hi> here. This congregation conſiſts now of an hundred and forty nine communicants; and as many hearers beſides as will augment the number to about four hundred. If we ſuppoſe that five in a hundred will die (and the bills of mortality for years paſt juſtify the ſuppoſition) a ſcore will never ſee another new-year's day. Shall I then repeat the text to expreſs with probality that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011642_0010_0F879E726008C670"/>
this year twenty of us ſhall die? and ſhall not this affect us? I am ſure the thought affects me; for ſome of the twenty may be the beſt friends which the ſociety has! But I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to <hi>certainty</hi> in applying the text. It is <hi>certain,</hi> morally <hi>certain</hi> that <hi>ſome one</hi> of us will die this year. To ſuppoſe the contrary were to ſuppoſe ſuch a thing as never happened in any other ſociety of equal number. There ſtands among you one who firmly believes that he is the man. But let not that draw the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of any other from himſelf, for <hi>probably</hi> ſeveral more will never ſee the end of this year.</p>
            <p>I have juſt now ſaid 'that my text is a word of fear to a wicked man, but a word of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the righteous'. And of one or the other character are all preſent. Shall I ſuppoſe here be ſome of both, and as ſuch addreſs them on the ſubject of dying this year?</p>
            <p n="1">I. Is there a graceleſs perſon in the place, whether young or old or of middle age?— If young, and entering on this new year in a condition unfit for death, muſt I in thy hearing repeat a text which declares that <hi>this year thou ſhalt die?</hi> Canſt thou hear it without emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or be aſſured that thou art not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the prediction? I trow not. Wilt thou not then begin to prepare for dying in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this year of death? Wilt thou go on as heretofore? Forgetting thy creator? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding thy neck from his yoke? Avoiding a profeſſion of his religion? Acting the <hi>child of

diſobedience</hi> towards the duties, the ordinances and calls thereof? Purſuing pleaſure and gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs? Putting off the care of the ſoul with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to eternity, and ſo die? God forbid! Thou comely youth! thou fair damſel it muſt not be! The thought will diſtreſs thy friends and diſtract thy parents! Alas! alas! that ſo much excellency ſhould periſh this year! that ſo much comelineſs and beauty ſhould this year again go to ſin and then to hell? I pray you, my young hearers, I pray you in Chriſt's ſtead that ye be reconciled to God this year. If ye ſeek him early ye ſhall find him. Prov. viii. 17.—If there be a graceleſs man or a graceleſs woman in the aſſembly, and I ſhould addreſs him in the language of the text, how will he bear it, or how gainſay it, <hi>This year thou ſhalt die</hi>! I hope thou wilt not bear ſo awful a denunciation as thou wouldeſt a light thing? nor defer a preparation for the event as if ſure that thou art not the object of the prophecy! God forbid! For if thou die this year, and art not born again this year, thou wilt this year be in torments! O man! let this beginning of the year be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the newneſs of life with thee, and the end of a graceleſs and unconverted ſtate! To be men grown and women grown and that in a ſtate of guilt and irreligion is to have run too great riſques already. Dread to do ſo this year alſo; for it may be the laſt, and you ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined forever!—Or is there an old ſinner in this aſſembly? An ancient man or an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient woman who hath borne the heat and burden of the day in labouring for all things

except the <hi>one thing needful?</hi> If there be, let him hear the word of the Lord, <hi>this year thou ſhalt die</hi>! Surely 'tis the eleventh hour with thee! thy gray hairs, thy feeble and tottering frame and thy broken voice declare it. And wilt thou ſtand idle in the market place till that hour expire with the reſt? God forbid. I have ſomewhere read this epitaph, HERE LIES AN OLD MAN AGED THREE YEARS; for three years before his death he had been converted. But if thou die this year, and art not convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what ſhall we write on thy tomb? Shall we write, 'Here is buried an ancient man or an ancient woman aged nothing? Who had not as much as a being in Chriſt before his gray hairs went down to the grave? Forbid it, merciful God! Ancient of days, forbid it!</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhift the ſcene; for I ſee or believe I ſee in the aſſembly ſome youth, ſome men and ſome women, ſome ancients and matrons who are ripe for glory. I rejoice over you; for to each of you a repetition of the text will be the voice of a charmer and a prophecy of ſmooth things! This year each may be in heaven! How is it proved? Thus—<hi>This year thou ſhalt die!</hi> My good child! If thou die this year thou ſhalt be with him that loveth little children and that was once called, <hi>the child Jeſus</hi>! What if thy tongue could but liſp his name while rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy catechiſm the laſt year? This year may make thee as the babes and ſucklings in the temple, whoſe mouths uttered perfect praiſe, for <hi>this year thou ſhalt die?</hi> Comely youth

and fair damſel! doubly fair and comely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe good! does the text ſay <hi>thou ſhalt die this year?</hi> Thine heart replies, <hi>So be it,</hi> that I may be in heaven this year, and ſo be young and fair and comely and happy forever! Thou man or woman in Chriſt, Harken! <hi>This year thou ſhalt die</hi>! O how good to thee is this word of the Lord; for the deſire of thine heart is to be in heaven. Venerable father or mother in Iſrael! Ripe for glory art thou, and deſirous to enter upon it!
