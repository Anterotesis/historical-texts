            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Alſo, in my pag. 2. I did ſay, <q>I willingly grant, that there is frequently a divine Determination of the Will both of Men and Angels in good Actions, and that the ſaid Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can well conſiſt with the liberty of the Will.</q> But why Mr. <hi>Willard</hi> has taken ſo little notice of this, that he chargeth the Contradictory on me, <hi>I</hi> leave to impartial Readers, whether it be not without all ground, to render me very erroneous and heter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, if Creatures be only by accident and contingently ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to God, then it may happen, that they may act without any dependence on him, and conſequently they may act without any Determination of God, ſo as neceſſarily to produce any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Action.

Again, ſome are Actions proceeding from Subſtances, as their proper Cauſe, ſome whereof are neceſſary Agents, and not free, as the actions of Beaſts, Fowles and Fiſhes; others are free, as the Actions of Men. Now to anſwer directly to his Queſtion, The Futurity of all created Subſtances, is entirely from God, both from his Power and Will, and alſo from his Wiſdom and Goodneſs. And the Futurity of the Actions of neceſſary Agents, is from the Futurity of the Agents themſelves. And the Futurity of the Actions of free-Agents, that are ſinful (or generally indifferent) is from the Futurity of the free Agents themſelves, ſuch as Men and Angels are; for as the Branches, Leaves and Fruit of a Tree lie hidden in the Seed or Root of it, ſo all Actions, whether of neceſſary or of free Agents, lie in the Agents themſelves, as in their Seeds and Roots or Principles, before they be brought forth into act or effect. And as it doth not ſurpaſs Mans knowledge to know what Actions will proceed from neceſſary Agents, and that by certain knowledge, in great part, ſo nor doth it ſurpaſs Gods knowledge, to know moſt certainly and infallibly what Actions will proceed from free Agents, ſuch as Men and Angels, for this far ſurpaſſing knowledge, or fore knowledge of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the actions of free Agents, muſt needs be granted to God,

But to ſay that God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knows the futurity of the ſinful actions of free Agents, becauſe be has decreed them to come to paſs, (after which Decree they become as neceſſary as the actions of any neceſſary Agents) is to give to God Almighty a very imperfect kind of Knowledge, little above that of Men and Angels. Beſide that, ſuch a Notion doth impugne the perfection of Gods Holineſs, as well as of his Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Thus, I think, I have given a more perfect Scheme of the matter, than Mr. <hi>Willard</hi> hath done, and ſo far ſatisfied his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, if he will be reaſonably ſatisfied.</p>

That all humane Wills, his and ours, and each propenſion of our Wills, even during our Deliberation, are as much Neceſſitated as any thing elſe whatſoever, that we have no more Power to forbear thoſe Actions which we do, than the fire hath not power to burn.</q> [Note, <hi>How like this of Mr.</hi> Hobbs <hi>is to that of Mr.</hi> Willard <hi>in his Reply to me, ſee his page</hi> 43.]</p>

                  <q>I confeſs (ſaith Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi>) I hate this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from my heart, and I believe both I have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to do, and all others who ſhall ſeriouſly ponder the Horrible Conſequences which flow from it. It deſtroys Liberty, and dishonours the Nature of Man. It makes the ſecond Cauſes and outward Objects to be the Rackets, and Men to be the Tennis-Balls of Deſtiny. It makes the firſt Cauſe to be the Introducer of all Evil and Sin into the World, as much as Man, yea, more than Man, by as much as the Motion of the Watch is more from the Artificer, who did make it, and wind it up, than either from the Spring, or the Wheels, or the Threed, if God by his <hi>Special Influences</hi> into the ſecond Cauſes, did Neceſſitate them to operate, as they did. And if they, being thus determined, did Neceſſitate <hi>Adam</hi> inevitably, irreſiſtibly, not by an Accidental, but by an Eſſential Subordination of Cauſes to whatſoever he did; then one of theſe two Abſurdities muſt needs follow, either that <hi>Adam</hi> did not ſin, and that there is no ſuch thing as ſin in the World, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001160_0044_0FB091BF2FAB6A38"/>naturally, neceſſarily and eſſentially from God, or that God is more guilty of it, and more the cauſe of Evil than Man, becauſe Man is extrinſically, inevitably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but ſo is not God. And in Cauſes eſſentially ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate [<hi>viz.</hi>
                  </q> as I have above noted, when the ſubordinate Cauſe is determined neceſſarily by the ſuperiour Cauſe] <q>

Excuſe me, [ſaith Bp. <hi>Bramhall</hi>] if I hate this Doctrine with a perfect Hatred, which is ſo diſhonourable both to God and Man, which makes men to Blaſpheme of Neceſſity, to Steal of Neceſſity, to be Hang'd of Neceſſity, and to be Damn'd of Neceſſity; and therefore I muſt ſay, and ſay again, <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
