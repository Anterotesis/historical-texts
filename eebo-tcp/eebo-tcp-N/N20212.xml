            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>OF all the essays with which Dr. Percival has fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the world, no one appears to have met a more candid or indulgent reception, than his famous Essay on Bitters and Astringents.</p>
            <p>THIS work, first published in the year <hi>1769,</hi> has not only undergone four editions, but, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the doctor, large portions of it have been translated into foreign cyclopedias, and into different systems of the materia medica.</p>
            <p>TWO late writers Drs. Skeete and Irwin, in their ingenious dissertations on the Peruvian bark, have attempted to controvert some of the principles, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Dr. Percival's essay.</p>
            <p>THE former of those gentlemen, has not touched upon that part, which is the subject of the following pages; the latter, having made one or two experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was led to doubt the opinion of Dr. Percival,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:026496_0004_0FD05BE0C5196798"/>
although he acknowledges, the doctor's experiments do not prove an union of acids, bitters and astringents, and that his own do not fully prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>BOTH were deceived in the same manner, from using a fallacious test of astringency, and from being ignorant of that change which takes place upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an astringent vegetable, to a solution of green vitriol.</p>
            <p>A MORE notorious instance of self deception perhaps never occurred, than in an experiment related by Dr. Skeete; having triturated magnesia with some bark and water, and added the mixture to a solution of <hi>sal martis,</hi> he found the black color produced more intense, than that struck by a simple solution of the bark.</p>
            <p>DECIPIMUR <hi>specie</hi> recti; from this and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, he supposed the astringency of the bark increased, and thought the fact might be of some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the tanning of leather, whereas, had he digested the magnesia on the bark for twenty-four hours, or triturated it with a solution of galls, he would have found the astringent principle completely destroyed.</p>
            <p>IN a note to the last edition of Dr. Percival's works, we are informed he still adheres to his
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:026496_0005_0FD05BE246565080"/>
former opinions, but as neither health nor time, will permit him to engage in the controversy, he leaves it to be decided by others.</p>
            <p>THE errors of a great man, it is said, are conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; the truth of this is evinced, from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples contained in Dr. Percival's essay being generally adopted; bitters have been exhibited under the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious idea of neutralising acidity, the doctor has been quoted, and implicit credit given to his experiments.</p>
            <p>THE author of the following trifle, has but one object, the establishment of truth; as he has made free with the opinions of his predecessors, he wishes his own may be diligently scrutinised, for he is as equally liable to be deceived, as others of his medical brethren.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS ON THE COMBINATION OF ACIDS, BITTERS, AND ASTRINGENTS.</head>
            <p>DR. PERCIVAL has divided his essay on astringents and bitters into four sections; in the eighth experiment of the first section, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused a quantity of powdered Peruvian bark in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and water, and added some of the infusion to a chalybeate solution, he found at first no change of color take place, though in a few minutes a slight black tinge appeared.</p>
            <p>THE result of this experiment, induced him to make further trials of the effects of acids on vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table astringents, and having added some white wine vinegar to an infusion of chamomile flowers,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026496_0007_0FD05BE544B1EF50"/>
and a triturated infusion of the bark, and added these infusions to a solution of <hi>sal martis,</hi> he found no change of color produced. Afterwards having made ink, with an infusion of galls, and a solution of <hi>sal martis,</hi> he discharged the black color by the acid of vitriol, and then restored the original blackness with the spirit of hartshorne.</p>
            <p>FROM these experiments he supposed an affinity between acids, bitters and astringents, and this sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested to him an idea, that they might possibly neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralise each other, and form what the chymists call a <hi>tertium quid.</hi> This point he attempted to ascertain, by adding vinegar to infusions of the bark, Alep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po galls and gentian, and concluded from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, that acids, bitters and astringents neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralise each other.</p>
            <p>HAVING given this summary of the experiments of Dr. Percival, I shall</p>
            <p n="1">1. TAKE notice of the best method of disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering an astringent quality in vegetables.</p>
            <p n="2">2. SHEW that change which takes place, upon adding a vegetable astringent to a solution of green vitriol.</p>
            <p n="3">3. POINT out the manner in which the doctor was deceived, and</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:026496_0008_0FD05BE7045F9160"/>4. RELATE several decisive experiments, in which mineral and vegetable acids, were added to bitters and astringents.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE property of striking a black color with a solution of green vitriol, has long been regarded as an indubitable test of astringency, but as this is owing to the gallic acid uniting with the iron of the green vitriol, as many vegetables contain this acid, which are not astringent, as the black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor produced is not in proportion to the astring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, as it <hi>does not happen</hi> when the astringency is <hi>not destroyed</hi> by the acids, and it <hi>takes place</hi> when the astringent principle is <hi>completely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed</hi> by magnesia or the alkalies, it follows that the property by which vegetables strike a black color, with a solution of green vitriol, cannot be considered as a proof of their astringency.</p>
            <p>IN the fifth volume of the London Medical Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says, and in Irwin on the bark, two sketches of machines may be seen for determining the astring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power of different substances, but as these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines are unnecessary refinements, and astringent vegetables readily impart a sense of constriction to the mouth and fauces, the taste appears to be the most easy and least fallacious test that can be used.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="12"
                   facs="unknown:026496_0009_0FD0507191E20890"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>2. UPON adding a vegetable astringent to a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>sal martis,</hi> a black color is produced.</p>
            <p>THERE have been many different explanations of this fact; the opinion to which Dr. Percival seems to have adhered, is that the astringent principle was united to the iron of the green vitriol.</p>
            <p>IN an inaugural dissertation on the chemical and medical properties of the Persimmon tree, and the analysis of astringent vegetables, I proved the astringent principle to be composed of the gallic acid united to that precipitate, which is thrown down by alkalies from vegetable astringents, which possesses all the properties of the earth of alum.</p>
            <p>IN the making of ink then, a double elective at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction takes place, the gallic acid unites with the iron of the green vitriol, while the vitriolic acid unites with the <hi>radical,</hi> or base of the astringent principle.</p>
            <note n="*" place="bottom">
               <hi>The double elective attraction only takes place when the astringent principle</hi> undecomposed <hi>is added to a solution of</hi> sal martis; <hi>ink may be made either by adding the gallic acid to the green vitriol, or to the calx of iron precipitated from</hi> sal martis <hi>by the vegetable alkali, or by adding the astringent principle to the calx of iron; in the same manner, if Glauber's salt is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a solution of muriated barytes, a double elective attraction takes place, the vitriolic acid unites to the ponderous earth, which for some time remains suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fluid, and the decomposition happens, if the vitriolic acid alone is used, or any salt containing the vitriolic acid, hence Professor Bergman has made the muriated barytes a test for the discovery of the vitriolic acid, as others have made the gallic acid, a test for the discovery of iron.</hi>
            </note>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:026496_0010_0FD05BE8595C4B58"/>3. DR. PERCIVAL was deceived, first, from using a fallacious test of astringency, secondly, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the influence of a preconceived opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thirdly from being ignorant of that change which takes place, upon adding a vegetable astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to a solution of <hi>sal martis.</hi> As he thought he had proved, that acids neutralise astringents, so when he added the vitriolic acid, to a decoction of galls and a solution of <hi>sal martis,</hi> he supposed the acid neutralised the astringent principle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, it only dissolved the ferrugen<gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous particles; that this is actually the case may be proved by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the pure gallic acid, which is <hi>not astringent,</hi> to a solution of green vitriol, and then discharging the black color, by dissolving the precipitate, with the vitriolic or marine acid.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:026496_0011_0FD05BE9C5D5CE10"/>4. I SHALL relate a few experiments, in which mineral and vegetable acids, were added to bitters and astringents, and take notice of the result.</p>

by Mr. HENRY, published in the third volume of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester memoirs, wherein he asserts a complete de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composition of alum takes place when added to a solution of galls, which is by no means the case, as the alum may be obtained by chrystallization after the addition.</p>
                           <p>THE insoluble precipitate is the resin of the galls, which may be thrown down, by using a solution of columbo root, instead of alum, but which will not take place with chamomile flowers or gentian, or by adding the alum to a solution of Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian bark.</p>
                           <p>THE frequent opportunities Dr. Percival had of observing the effects, arising from a combination of green vitriol and astringents, naturally led him to examine into the principles of ink, and from a number of fallacious experiments, he was led to

differ materially from Dr. Lewis, who has paid particular attention to this subject.</p>
                           <p>HAVING immersed a piece of polished iron, into a cold infusion of the Peruvian bark, made with distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led water, he found the liquor in three hours just per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly tinged black; while the same piece of iron wiped clean, and immersed in another infusion of the cortex, made with common spring water, in a less time gave a deep purple color to the liquor.</p>
                           <p>THE spring water employed, he tells us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a considerable portion of selenitic salt, and hence, by dissolving the iron immersed in it, formed a perfect <hi>sal martis,</hi> from which he inferred an acid is essentially necessary in the formation of ink, and having afterwards prosecuted the subject, concluded
"whatever deprives green vitriol of its acid, whether it be heat, the addition of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali, or repeated <hi>affusions of water,</hi> destroys its power of striking a black color, with vegetable astringents."</p>
                           <p>THE experiments detailed by the Doctor, by no means justify this conclusion; he did not attempt to make ink, with a <hi>calx of iron,</hi> precipitated from green vitriol by an <hi>alkali,</hi> and it clearly appears he

            <p>HAVING thus taken a summary of part, and the most important part, of the essay on bitters and astringents, pointed out the taste as the least fallacious test of astringency, shewn the manner in which Dr. <hi>Percival</hi> was deceived, and confuted him in several particulars, we may conclude.</p>

            <p>THE astringency of the oak bark was increased by the vitriolic acid, because it contains a large proportion of earth unsaturated by the gallic acid, hence the copious precipitation, upon the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the alkali, after adding the vitriolic acid.</p>
            <p>BY spontaneous evaporation in the open air, an acid salt is produced, and during the chrystallizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>micaceous spangles,</hi> resembling drops of tar thrown into water, appear swimming on the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the fluid.</p>
            <p>THE bark of an oak tree may be considered as a coat of pure argillacious earth; to prove this, let

                     <hi>Vitriolic acid readily dissolves the earth of alum when moist, and newly obtained, but does not act with equal rapidity when it is dry. This solution in the quantity of many ounces affords chrystals of alum, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with small scales, similar to those of mica. Mr. Baume adds, that if this experiment be made in the small way, the scaly substance only is obtained, and scarcely any alum.</hi>
