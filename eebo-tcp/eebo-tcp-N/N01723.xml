            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AND upon THIS DAY, What Remarkable, What Admirable Occaſions, has our Glorious GOD given us to Repeat this <hi>Proverb of Iſrael!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS there never was any Man on the Face of the Earth, whoſe <hi>Name</hi> has been ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally known among the Children of Men, as the Patriarch <hi>Abrabam,</hi> to whom a <hi>Great Name</hi> had been Promiſed by our GOD, ſo
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002043_0004_0FBA8E4C23773170"/>there is nothing more known about this Renowned Patriarch, than this, <hi>By Faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Iſaac; and be that had received the Promiſes, offered up his only begotten Son; Accounting that GOD was able to Raiſe him up even from the Dead.</hi> This Memorable <hi>Friend of GOD,</hi> after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny previous Trials, at laſt had his <hi>Faith tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> unto the uttermoſt, with an Order from the Sovereign Lord of Life, making His uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Deſcent in the <hi>Shechinah</hi> unto him; an order whereof every Word was a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt; It was, <hi>Take now thy Son, thine only Son, Iſaac, whom thou loveſt, and get thee into a Land, forty miles off, and offer him for a Burnt offering upon a Mountain there.</hi> The <hi>Obedience</hi> which our Father paid unto this aſtoniſhing Order, has been celebrated in all Succeeding Ages, and with very many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Ancients, who have employ'd their Pens in the celebration, have alſo told us, that the Story was rarely beheld in a <hi>Picture,</hi> without <hi>Weeping Eyes</hi> among them. The Pagans had their famous Traditions of the Matter; Eſpecially That of <hi>Saturn</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of his <hi>Jeoud.</hi> The Jews tell us, That the Two Sons of <hi>Sennacherth</hi> had like to have been a <hi>Sacrifue</hi> to the Tradition of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s. I am not ſure, That <hi>Satan</hi> took Advantage from hence, to draw the poor Pagans into <hi>Humane Sacrifices,</hi> particularly
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002043_0005_0FBA8E4E2A231430"/>of their Children unto <hi>Moloch.</hi> But I find <hi>philo,</hi> notably cenſuring and confuting the Envious Detractions of thoſe who would go to compare them with the Piety of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Action</hi> you know. The Action of Binding <hi>Iſaac</hi> on the <hi>Altar,</hi> on the Account whereof the whole Buſineſs is by the Jews called, <hi>Gnakidah Jitzchah,</hi> Or, <hi>The Binding of Iſaac.</hi> The brave Young Man, tho' above Twenty Years of Age, readily Submitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Action of his Father. Doubtleſs the ſame <hi>Eaith</hi> which was in his Excellent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, filled and acted the Soul of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Youth! But what was the <hi>Iſſue</hi> of the Action?</p>
            <p>Our Glorious GOD would ſee the Triumph of the <hi>Faith,</hi> with which He had Enriched the Soul of the Patriarch; and at the ſame time give in his <hi>Iſaac</hi> a Lively, and Lovely Type of what was afterwards to be done unto our SAVIOUR. <hi>Abraham</hi> does as firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Believe, that GOD would Raiſe his <hi>Iſaac</hi> from the Dead, yea, out of his Aſhes, as if he had ſeen it with his Eyes. <hi>Iſaac</hi> is laid on the <hi>Altar.</hi> Every thing is ready for the <hi>Mortal Stroke.</hi> The Father gives his <hi>Laſt Kiſs</hi> to the Reſigning Victim. The <hi>Knife</hi> is in his hand. His <hi>hand</hi> is lifted up. One Second of a Minute more, and the <hi>deadly Stab</hi> reaches the Heart that lay expos'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002043_0006_0FBA8E4FB3F8A830"/>to it; <hi>Iſaac</hi> is a <hi>Dead Man</hi> without any more ado. But behold, GOD by an <hi>Angel</hi> from Heaven, <hi>Steps in at the very Moment:</hi> The Voice of GOD by an Angel, calls to him, <hi>Stop, Stay, Lay not thy hand upon the Sacrifice!</hi>— O moſt <hi>Seaſonable Interpoſition!</hi> What a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,</hi> in what an <hi>Extremity! Abraham</hi> could not but ſettle a <hi>Memorial</hi> of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Deliverance, in the Name of, JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH-JIREH, on the Place where he received it. <hi>GOD will provide;</hi> This was the Engliſh of it. You know, That the <hi>Mountain</hi> was alſo called, <hi>Moriah,</hi> which is of the like Importance. And you know, what was afterwards done upon that Exalted <hi>Mountain of the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> And now, Don't wonder, that we now hear of a <hi>Proverb,</hi> which from this amazing Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence obtained among the People of GOD, in the Succeeding Ages. A <hi>Proverb,</hi> which has been called, <hi>Proverbium Tribulatorum:</hi> A Sentence fitted for the People of GOD, in every <hi>Extremity</hi> of Adverſity: A ſaying with which the People of GOD ſhould ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their Expectation of Help to come from Heaven, when any Adverſity comes to an <hi>Extremity</hi> upon them. The Proverb is, <hi>In the Mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen.</hi> O Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD, When a Perplexity comes upon you to an <hi>Extremity</hi> like what <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaw in the <hi>Mount</hi> Which the Lord led
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002043_0007_0FBA8E5180690AA0"/>them to, then <hi>it ſhall be ſeen,</hi> what GOD will do for you; <hi>it ſhall be ſeen,</hi> how GOD will appear for your <hi>Deliverance.</hi> Sooner ſhall the <hi>Mountain</hi> of <hi>Moriah</hi> depart, and the <hi>Hill</hi> of GOD be removed, than this <hi>Proverb</hi> grow into a Deſuetude.</p>
            <p>Behold, The Entertainment that is now provided for you. A Relation of <hi>Seaſonable Interpoſitions from Heave, for the Relieſ of the Diſtreſſed,</hi> is what is now to Entertain you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Seaſonable Interpoſition of the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to prevent the Deſtruction of ſuch as are upon the very Point of being De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; This is a Diſpenſation, much to be wondred at, and ſtill to be looked for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis no Rare Thing for the Glorious GOD, <hi>Seaſonably to Step in,</hi> and prevent the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> which we are <hi>upon the Point</hi> of being brought unto. 'Tis no Rare Thing, for the Glorious GOD <hi>Seaſonably to Step in,</hi> and put by a Deadly Blow, which is <hi>upon the very Point</hi> of being Struck at our deareſt Intereſts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Succour</hi> which our GOD has for us in our <hi>Diſtreſſes,</hi> is often <hi>deferr'd</hi> until we even Deſpair of a <hi>Deliverance.</hi> But when Things are come to an <hi>Extremity, Then</hi> 'tis then He <hi>Steps in</hi> to Succour us.</p>
            <p>We read of our GOD and SAVIOUR, Heb. IV. 16. That from Him, we <hi>obtain Mercy and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002043_0008_0FBA8E52F79FAB78"/>find Fevour, to Help in a Time of Need.</hi> But the <hi>Time of Need,</hi> wherein the <hi>Only Wiſe GOD</hi> chuſes to <hi>help</hi> us, is, when our <hi>Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> comes to an <hi>Extremity.</hi> And then He takes as we ſay, the very <hi>Nick of Time,</hi> to ſend in His <hi>Help</hi> unto us.</p>
            <p>We may give this LOCTRINE of <hi>Seaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Interpoſitions,</hi> in the Terms of an Old ſaying very common among the People of GOD, <hi>Mans Extremity is GODs Opportunity.</hi> Is there not ſuch a Promiſe as That, Zech. XIV. 7. <hi>At Evening it ſhall be light.</hi> At <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening!</hi> Who would have Expected a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Evening?</hi> A <hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Salvations in an <hi>Evening</hi> of Diſtreſſes! But GOD will <hi>Perform</hi> what He does <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> And the <hi>Upright</hi> ſhall in their <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> have <hi>Light ariſing</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>We will Declare, firſt, THAT it <hi>has been</hi> ſo.</p>
            <p>Let us for a few Minutes walk about the Field of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and gather here and there a <hi>Roſe of Sharon;</hi> Make a brief Collection of Inſtances, wherein GOD has with <hi>Seaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Interpoſitions,</hi> come in for the Relief of the Faithful, when <hi>Extreme Dangers</hi> of Ruine have ſorely terrified them.</p>
            <p>And here, Oh! Let it not be forgotten,— indeed, I cannot go on with my <hi>Collection,</hi> till I firſt make this <hi>Introduction</hi> to it!— It muſt be Remembred, That <hi>Mankind</hi> upon

            <p>We will Enquire, Secondly; WHY it <hi>muſt be ſo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis with <hi>Scoſonable Interpoſitions,</hi> that out GOD will <hi>Step in</hi> to Relieve the Faithful, when things are gone ſo far that they can ſee none but <hi>Extreme Dangers</hi> of Ruine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It muſt be ſo;</hi> Becauſe a Glorious GOD will give a Manifeſtation of His <hi>Perfections,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002043_0017_0FBA8E649E0D7B40"/>and will be greatly Glorified in ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.

But then, <hi>It muſt be ſo,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and the Frames, and the Steps, of the <hi>Diſtreſſed</hi> Ones in their <hi>Extremities,</hi> are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuch as prepare them to <hi>See the Salvation of GOD.</hi> Our GOD brings us into <hi>Extreme Dangers;</hi> 'Tis to bring us down upon our Knees.

            <p>And why may it not be ſaid, It <hi>muſt be ſo,</hi> Becauſe our SAVIOUR will in this way keep <hi>Alive,</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> for the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> Seldom is a <hi>Good Thing</hi> beſtowed upon us, <hi>till</hi> we firſt have had a <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> written upon it. <hi>Extreme Dangers</hi> muſt bring us to That, 2 Cor.

            </p>

            <p>How the <hi>Old Plotters</hi> came to think of <hi>Gunpowder,</hi> as the moſt agreeable Tool for them to work withal, Some have wondred, who forgot the Fate of him who had been a Father to the King then deſigned for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. This however may be ſaid upon it: It is very Surpriſing, that a Spaniſh Writer, whoſe Name was <hi>Del Rio,</hi> Publiſhing a Book of <hi>Magical Diſquiſitions,</hi> and the <hi>Powers of Evil Spirits,</hi> Two or Three Years before our Celebrated <hi>Fifth</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> puts there the very Caſe of the <hi>Gun-Powder-Plot,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002043_0023_0FBA8E6FDCD83F30"/>his Deciſion of the Caſe, is That a <hi>Father-Confeſſor</hi> made Privy to ſuch a <hi>Plot</hi> in a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> ought by no means to diſcover it. And now, whatever <hi>Hidden works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> relating to that <hi>Helliſh Plot</hi> may remain Undiſcovered, until the <hi>Day</hi> of our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OURS <hi>Revelation,</hi> we may without any Scruple ſay, The <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> which <hi>Del Rio</hi> treated of, uſed their <hi>Inſtigation</hi> to puſh on the Conſpirators to their infandous Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Could my Sermon reach to any of thoſe, who are at this Day hoping to <hi>Blow up,</hi> whole Kingdoms, and more than Three Nations, that ſo they may ſee what their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Garnet</hi> and Company, miſs'd of, I would Entreat theſe <hi>New Plotters,</hi> to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſeriouſly, Whoſe <hi>Inſtigation</hi> it is, that they are <hi>Moved</hi> withal, when they have ſo little <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> before their Eyes; And they ſhould hear me ſaying, <hi>Surely, Thou wilt ſlay the wicked, O GOD; and therefore, ye Bloody men, Depart from me!</hi> I would Expoſtulate with ſuch Unhappy People. <q>When the Juſt and Neceſſary <hi>Oathes,</hi> are by the Beſt of Governours, from a Tender Concern for the <hi>Publick Safety</hi> propoſed unto you, with what loud Vociferations do you Complain &amp; Exclaim, That your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is impoſed upon? May <hi>Conſcience</hi> then be hearken'd to. To Swallow <hi>Oathes,</hi> againſt a <hi>Diſſatisfyed Conſcience</hi> is what no
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002043_0024_0FBA8E71815A40A0"/>Good Man would adviſe you to. But, That you impartially Labour for a <hi>Better Conſcience,</hi> a <hi>Wiſer Conſcience,</hi> One more <hi>Ealightened;</hi> This is the Beſt Advice that we can give you. 'Tis nothing but a due Regard unto the <hi>Publick Safety,</hi> that makes theſe <hi>Oathes</hi> to be required of you: the <hi>Publick Safety,</hi> for the Diſturbance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, no Plea of a pretended <hi>Conſcience</hi> is to be admitted of. And, Sirs, Can your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> tell you, That Three Nations ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Blood, and the <hi>Britiſh Iſlands</hi> in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations which would require the Pen of another <hi>Gildas</hi> to deſcribe them, would be a <hi>Deſireable Spectacle?</hi> Can your <hi>Conſcience</hi> tell you, That every <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in the World, ought to have his Throat Cut, or be Condemned unto <hi>Louiſian</hi> Dungeons and Galleys? Can your <hi>Conſcience</hi> tell you, That the Religion which your Bible has taught you, ſhould be Extirpated by Fire and Sword, and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Idolatries eſtabliſhed with the moſt Barbarous and Inhumane Cruelties? Are you Aware, that you Really are in a <hi>Plot,</hi> for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of ſuch <hi>Horrible Things,</hi> while you abet the cauſe of a <hi>Popiſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender,</hi> who <hi>muſt needs go</hi> to do them all: Certainly, 'Tis a fearful Judgment of GOD, for any Man to be abandoned unto ſuch a <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Or, Can your <hi>Conſcience</hi> tell
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002043_0025_0FBA8E74A03A84D0"/>you, That if a Man be an <hi>Idoot</hi> or <hi>Lunatick,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> are not worſe than ſo, who do not provide (as not long ago, they did in <hi>Fortugal,</hi>) that ſuch an one ſhall not Sit &amp; Act on the Throne of the Kingdom? Whereas, a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> bound by Principle to Betray and Ruine his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> is a thouſand times more <hi>Diſqualified,</hi> (as being more <hi>Unreſtrainable</hi>) than ſuch an One! Does your <hi>Conſcience</hi> tell you a Story of <hi>Hereditary Right?</hi> But, you cannot but know, That <hi>Hereditary Right,</hi> has been many times diſclamed, many times diverted, often Superſeded in the Succeſſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarchy. If an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> may not Limit and Alter, the Succeſſion of the Crown, Thoſe from and thro' whom you derive the <hi>Right</hi> of your Pretender, had <hi>no Right</hi> at all; and ſo by conſequence <hi>He</hi> has <hi>no Right</hi> at all. The <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> which you inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (the <hi>Line</hi> whereof has been ſo often Interrupted!) vaniſhes into Nothing. You cannot in any <hi>Conſcience</hi> inſiſt upon it.</q> Thus may they be argued with! But theſe are a ſort of People, that NEW-ENGLAND is very much a Stranger to! Our <hi>Soyl</hi> don't agree with People that have that <hi>Venome</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>And now, was what our Nation ſaw in the <hi>Seaſonable Deliverance,</hi> which cauſes
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002043_0026_0FBA8E76A0FE9820"/>our Anceſtors to make this Day like the <hi>Days of Purim,</hi> the only Inſtance wherein GOD our SAVIOUR, has after an aſtoniſhing manner <hi>Step'd in,</hi> to reſcue us, when we were on the very <hi>Precipice</hi> of a Perdition to be trembled at? No; There was a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Deliverance wrought for the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Forty Seven Years</hi> before, by a ſwift change upon the Publick Affairs; A CHANGE which if it had been delay'd a few Months longer, <hi>England</hi> might have been a Province to <hi>Spain;</hi> And ſomething like the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition</hi> had been Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in it; But the PROTESTANT RELIGION,—<hi>Whither muſt thou have made thy Flight, O thou Daughter of GOD!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will not inſiſt on a <hi>Fifth</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> that ſhone Fifteen Years before this Country was born. I will rather <hi>Stir up your Minds to the Remembrance,</hi> of what has been done in <hi>Our Days,</hi> yea, in the very Year that is now paſſing over us.</p>
            <p>And I pray, How much does the <hi>Fifth</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> in the Days of King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, outſhine the <hi>Fifth</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> in the Days of King <hi>James</hi> the ſecond; on which Twice-memorable Day, there Landed on the Engliſh Shore, that Illuſtrious PRINCE, whom GOD rais'd and ſent for the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of our Nation, from a Return of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002043_0027_0FBA8E782C104DD0"/>
               <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> the Two Grand Plagues of a woful World, and of <hi>Europe</hi> from the Chains that <hi>France</hi> was laying upon it. How Near, how <hi>very Near!</hi>—was the whole PROTESTANT Intereſt in the World, unto an Apparent Ruine?—Verily, It lay bound on the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Knife</hi> was juſt Ready to Strike, when a Great King was for that purpoſe United with <hi>France,</hi> and had a <hi>Standing Army</hi> at his command, and there only remained the Experiment of ſome <hi>New Creations</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>bold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns</hi> for an Houſe of <hi>Commons;</hi> to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce at Once the <hi>Horrible Stroke!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Rebuilder of the <hi>Romiſh Jericho,</hi> found the <hi>Curſe</hi> of our Glorious JESUS, to Blaſt the Enterprize. That unhappy King, had no ſooner boaſted in a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That there was nothing left now to diſturb the future Tranquillity of his Reign,</hi> but a ſudden REVOLUTION chaſed him from his Throne; An <hi>Eighty Eight</hi> brought unto the Nation a Deliverance not inferiour to that of the <hi>Eighty Eight</hi> in the Century that went before it; and a Change came on, whereof he muſt be very Inſenſible, who does not make that Acclamation, <hi>The Lords doing, and Marvellous in our Eyes!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Fifth</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> is the more to be kept in thy Remembrance, O NEW-ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002043_0028_0FBA8E7A2A309D08"/>Becauſe among the Things after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brought into the Light, it was found, That the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Popery</hi> in theſe Colonies, was an Article that had been very particularly provided for.</p>
            <p>Thus was our GOD <hi>ſeen in the Mount!</hi> And it ſhall no more be ſaid, <hi>The Lord Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> who Saved the <hi>Parliament-Houſe,</hi> and all that was in it, from a <hi>Deſolation in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and an <hi>Utter Conſumption with Terrible Things:</hi> But it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>The Lord Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> who <hi>Step'd in,</hi> at the Moment, when all that is dear to us, was on the very Point of going from us, and by an Happy REVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUTION Enabled us to ſing, <hi>Our Soul is Eſcaped as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; The Snare is broken, and we are Eſcaped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Memory of the Never-to-be-forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten King WILLIAM, will be for ever precious to all True <hi>Protestants,</hi> but none more than the <hi>New Engliſh</hi> ones, on a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Accounts; But very particularly for the Influence which he had on that <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> by which the Succeſſion of the Britiſh Crown has been Settled on the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> and we ſee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, what is moſt Valuable to a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> ſecur'd unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:002043_0029_0FBA8E7B2D6F5130"/>
Behold, What a New Field of <hi>Wonders</hi> we are brought unto! And what wonderful <hi>Interpoſitions</hi> of GOD our SAVIOUR, to make Things Turn well for us, when we have been upon the very Point of being made a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> we are invited now to take into our contemplation!</p>
            <p>Every body now knows, That there was a Deſign with a Strong Hand carried on, to put by that Succeſſion to the Crown, which all the Good Men in the Nations wiſh'd well unto. One cannot look back on the Story, without being ever now and then in pain for the <hi>Next Event!</hi> Without being Surprized &amp; Amazed at the <hi>Strange Things</hi> which fell out One after another, to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Deſign which the Men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd the Nations to <hi>France,</hi> had brought ſo near, ſo <hi>very near!</hi>—to an Execution!</p>
            <p>Our Lawful &amp; Rightful King GEORGF, being Peaceably and Wondrouſly Settled on the Throne of Great BRITAIN, to the Joy of all the Good Men in the World, it was not long before the <hi>Popiſh Pretender</hi> made an Invaſion upon the Britiſh Nations, and an Infaruated Party of Self-deſtroyers made Violent Efforts to bring him in. A <hi>Seaſonable Death</hi> gave a <hi>Mortal Wound</hi> unto the Undertaking; very much Diſpirited the Undertakers, Diſconcerted all their
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002043_0030_0FBA8E7CC7C20DB0"/>Meaſures! The <hi>Leviathen</hi> at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> being Smitten of GOD, Putrified into a moſt loth ſome Carcaſe, and left off to <hi>Make the World a Wilderneſs, and to deſtroy the Cities thereof.</hi> The <hi>Tree</hi> that ſheltered and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the Birds of Prey was moſt <hi>Scaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> hewn down by the Order of GOD. And the <hi>GOD of Beltel,</hi> in <hi>One day,</hi> gave a <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Defeat</hi> unto the <hi>Inſurrections of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Iniquity.</hi> In <hi>One Day</hi> did the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> powerfully defeat them, and both <hi>Dunblain</hi> and <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaw the <hi>Treading down</hi> of all their <hi>Strength.</hi> But He Step'd in, how <hi>Opportunely,</hi> how much at the very <hi>Nick of Time,</hi> which Diſpenſations to be for ever wondred at!</p>
            <p>The Laſt Winter the Men who are <hi>Like the troubled Sea,</hi> prepared for another Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. A <hi>Seaſonable Death</hi> again gave a <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wound</hi> unto the Undertaking; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew the Aſſiſtences which the Undertakers mightily relied upon. A Monatch who had <hi>cauſed Terror in the Land of the Living,</hi> was moſt <hi>Seaſonably</hi> taken off; And thereby, as the Oppreſſed <hi>Swedes</hi> have had their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick Liberties</hi> Miraculouſly <hi>Reſtor'd</hi> unto them, ſo there was a Thing of Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence done towards the <hi>Priſerving</hi> of ours. The Embarcation from <hi>Spain</hi> indeed went on. But, when there was above an
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002043_0031_0FBA8E7E1C09DF28"/>hundred and thirty Years ago, a Deſcent from <hi>Spain</hi> upon our Fore-fathers, within Navy that called it ſelf, <hi>Invincible,</hi> GOD fought againſt it, and by the <hi>Stormy Wind ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling His Word,</hi> confounded that Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And now another Deſcent from <hi>Spain</hi> was making upon us, GOD who holds <hi>the Wind in His Hand,</hi> by His own Irreſiſtible Hand, brought all the coſtly Expedition to Nothing. But He Step'd in, how <hi>Opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> how much at the very <hi>Nick of Time,</hi> with Diſpenſations to be for ever wondred at!</p>
            <p>O the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of Soveraign <hi>Grace,</hi> in theſe <hi>Divine Appearances,</hi> for our moſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Nations! I <hi>will ſing unto</hi> our moſt Gracious GOD. <hi>for He has triumphed gloriouſly!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NEW-ENGLAND is Thankfully ſenſible of the ſhare which it has in the <hi>Seaſonable Salvations</hi> wherewith our Nation had been thus <hi>highly favoured of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, How many <hi>Peculiar Salvations</hi> hath NEW-ENGLAND ſeen, wherein our Glorious LORD has muſt <hi>Seaſonably</hi> Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us, in our <hi>Extremities.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia CHRISTI.</hi> ever the <hi>Seaſonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſitions</hi> of GOD out SAVIOUR, to deliver us, when <hi>Extreme Hazards</hi> of Ruine look'd very dark upon, us; Theſe are Things which
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002043_0032_0FBA8E81894B3620"/>the Hiſtory of NEW-ENGLAND is filled withal. <hi>Many a Time,</hi> let NEW-ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND now ſay, <hi>Many a Time, in Affliction, from my Youth, had the Deſtroyers prevailed againſt me, if my Glorious Lord had not Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably Step'd in to reſcue me.</hi> Verily, NEW-ENGLAND <hi>continues to this Day,</hi> having <hi>obtained Help from GOD,</hi> in ſuch Seaſonable Diſpenſations!</p>
            <p>One Time above the reſt, cannot but be Remembred by many that <hi>remain to this Day.</hi> Some who did then <hi>Jeopard their Lives in the High Places of the Field,</hi> are now in this very Auditory. There was a Time Three and Forty Years ago, when the fierce <hi>Indian</hi> Salvages, having Spred the Flame of a Dubious War, from One End of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the Other, Every One thought, the Summer then coming on, would be fill'd with Deſolations, that would very near have broke Up the Colonics. But Behold, when Things were come to that <hi>Extremity,</hi> GOD Step'd in, and made bare His Almighty Arm for our <hi>Deliverance.</hi> The Enemy diſtracted like Beaſts that are Stung with <hi>Hornets,</hi> fell an eaſy Prey, to the <hi>People In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the Wilderneſs.</hi> Yea, <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in a few Months conſumed whole Nations of them!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:002043_0033_0FBA8E83ED9CF0E0"/>
This has indeed been the way of GOD our SAVIOUR all along Appearing for us.</p>
            <p>What a <hi>Seaſonable Proviſion</hi> did our GOD make for us, by a <hi>Friend on the Spot,</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Court for us, at the Revolution, that we might be delivered from a Total and Final Deprivation of all the <hi>Privileges,</hi> which diſtinguiſhed us, from the reſt of the Plantations!</p>
            <p>How often have we been upon <hi>the very Print,</hi> of being made the <hi>Prey of the Terrible?</hi> Thoſe which are called, <hi>The wild-beaſts of the Earth,</hi> have been juſt coming upon us! But the Great GOVERNOUR of the World, <hi>Seaſonably Stepping in,</hi> has very Unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more than Twice done the Things, which have enabled us to ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, who has not given us as a prey to their Teeth!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How often have our Churches been upon <hi>the very Point</hi> of doing Things which would have been attended with an Unknown Train of <hi>Diſturbances?</hi> But their Glorious HEAD <hi>Seaſonably Stepping in,</hi> has put a <hi>Stop</hi> unto them, and the <hi>feared Storms</hi> have all blown over.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Who can Utter the mighty Acts of the Lord? Who can ſhew forth all His Praiſe?</hi> How long a work would it be to Recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the <hi>Seaſonable Interpoſitions,</hi> wherewith
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002043_0034_0FBA8E84E05A8438"/>He has reſcued us from <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> when we have been <hi>upon the very Point.</hi> of being overwhelmed with them! Lo, GOD <hi>hath ſent from above; He hath drawn us out of many Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Improvement, which we are to make of this <hi>Experience,</hi> muſt be to Encourage our <hi>Prayers</hi> and our <hi>Hopes</hi> for the continuance of it. Sirs, Let us Improve our <hi>Experience,</hi> unto that Argument; 2 Cor. 1.10. <hi>GOD, who raiſes the Dead, has Delivered us from ſo great a Death, and He doth Deliver; and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> truſt in Him, that He will ſtill deliver us.</hi> The <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> I confeſs, is not of any ſuch form as our common <hi>Logick</hi> allows of; But <hi>Faith</hi> Legitimates this way of Arguing, and can <hi>Remove Mountains</hi> with it!</p>
            <p>You will allow me to uſe the Language of the Day; and ſay, There may be Things which may threaten to <hi>Blow up</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and <hi>Blow up</hi> the <hi>Churches,</hi> which have the <hi>Beauty</hi> and the <hi>Safety</hi> of the Country in them. Let thy <hi>Watchmen ſet upon thy Walls,</hi> O NEW-ENGLAND, give thee yet more faithful &amp; more ſolemn Warnings of them, and may their <hi>Viſions</hi> prevent thy <hi>Periſhing!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, Why may we not <hi>Hope,</hi> That before the Diſtreſſes which the <hi>Exportation</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:002043_0035_0FBA8E86695D0128"/>of our Coin thro' the <hi>Extravagancy</hi> of our Living has brought upon us, be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to much greater Extremity, the Methods which the <hi>Men of Thought</hi> have to offer for the Stopping of that <hi>Hemorrhage,</hi> will be yet more thoroughly Digeſted, will be hearkened unto, will be complied withal: And all fooliſh Animoſities that may hinder this Felicity, be entirely Extirpated?</p>
            <p>Why may we not <hi>Hope,</hi> That the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe, who may be willing to ſee us a <hi>Miſerable People,</hi> yea, of thoſe <hi>Treacherous Men</hi> from among our ſelves, who, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend themſelves unto preferments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and purſue things that would make our Miſeries Unſupportable; may by the Hand of our GOD <hi>Seaſonably Interpoſing</hi> for us, and with them that help us, have their <hi>Chariot-Wheels taken off,</hi> ſo that they <hi>ſhall drive heavily,</hi> and anon be all <hi>Abortive?</hi>
