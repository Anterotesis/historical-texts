            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A YOUNG MAN, once known among village-readers <note n="1" place="bottom">The Editor, not without emotion, calls up in review the tranquil pleasures of a studious life, amid the ever-green forests of Newhampshire.

The conclusion of the fourth Georgic of the Mantuan bard vividly describes the pursuits of "a self sequestered man." The nice ear'd Prosodist must forgive the substitution of harsh "Hantonia" for "Parthenope," the classical and the liquid.

Having, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, a right to vary, at pleasure, his <hi>fictitious</hi> name, he now, for higher reasons than any fickle humour might dictate, assumes the appellation of OLDSCHOOL.<note n="2" place="bottom">A name, which though harshly combined, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly expressive, and not unprotected by analogical autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. BOLINGBROKE published his Remarks on the History of England, under the name of <hi>Old Castle.</hi> To a diffident Editor, the machinery of a fictitious title is convenient. Sir Richard STEELE, as a periodical Mentor, appeared to many a delighted eye in the shape of an Isaac BICKERSTAFF, and a Nestor IRONSIDE; and, if an <hi>English Knight</hi> deemed it decorous to avail himself of the "immunities of invisibility," it is surely proper they should be claimed by an unobtrusive American.</note> Fond of this title, indicative of his moral, political, and literary creed, he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses publishing, every Saturday, on a super-royal quarto sheet,</p>

Of the name for a popular vehicle it is required that it should be concise, modest, and appropriate. The words Port Folio, from the French <hi>Porte Feuille,</hi> are not to be found in Johnson's Dictionary, but they are very currently employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in pure English, to signify a <hi>portable repository for fugitive papers,</hi> which is the exact definition of this Miscellany. Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ambitious of sonorous, or brilliant titles, frequently select a name, not intimately connected with the nature of their work. We hear of "The Mirror," and the "Aurora," but what relation has a literary essay with a <hi>polished plane of glass,</hi> or what have politics to do with The <hi>morning?</hi>

BY OLIVER OLDSCHOOL, ESQ.</p>
            <p>Warned by "the waywardness of the time<note n="4" place="bottom">
                  <p>This phrase alludes to our indifference to elegant let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to the acrimony <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> our party bickerings, and to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal eagerness for political <hi>texts,</hi> and their <hi>commentary.</hi> Hence, it is generally, and not without reason, supposed that amid such "wild uproar," the gentle voice of the Muse is scarcely audible. Prudence, therefore, has dictated a concise paper, not quite a <hi>Gazette,</hi> nor wholly a <hi>Magazine,</hi> with something of Politics to interest Quidnuncs, and something of literature to engage Students. To those, who utterly despair of the success of such a plan, and to those who would deride the temerity of the Editor for <hi>persevering to the end,</hi> it may be said, that the <hi>first similar scheme</hi> in England commenced at a time, when the nation was divided into whigs and tories, and coxcombs and impertinents, rather than into Patrons and Readers. But, to use the Tatler's own words, "by forming that paper, by <hi>way of Letter of Intelligence,</hi> consisting of such parts as might gratify the curiosity of persons of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and each sex, the design, however executed, met with so great success, that there is hardly a name now eminent among us for power, wit, beauty, valour, or wisdom, which is not subscribed." This was no empty vaunt of Steele's, for on consulting the celebrated edition of the Tatler, published in 1786 by the indefatigable and accurate John Nichols, we find a list of the subscribers, at an early stage of the undertaking. The names are both very numerous, and very respectable.</p>
                  <p>The condition of a literary adventurer, meditating a new work, and solicited to publish by some, and to suppress by others, is drolly described by honest John BUNYAN. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion drawn by his whimsical logic is what might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the natural wishes, and self complacency of every author.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Some said, John print it; others said, not so.</l>
                     <l>Some said, it might do good; others said, no.</l>
                     <l>Now I was in a strait, and did not see</l>
                     <l>Which was the best thing to be done by me:</l>
                     <l>At last I thought, since you are thus divided,</l>
                     <l>I print it will, and <hi>to the case decided!</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </note>," and the admonitions of every honest printer, the Editor begins his work on a Lilliputian page, and, like a saving grocer, gives of his goods only a small sample; but Subscribers, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure <note n="5" place="bottom">
                  <p>The Editor employs this old fashioned adverb to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his scepticism, with respect to the immediate encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and success of this paper. But under every disadvantage of a narrow subscription, he is resolved to persevere. He is sure of being fondly fostered by the liberal <hi>Few,</hi> and will trust to Time for the <hi>slow</hi> reward of literary toil.</p>
                  <p>This it is presumed will prove ultimately successful, if men of virtue, influence, genius, learning, and wealth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist his honest endeavours to promote the dissemination of the true, and the beautiful. But this assistance must be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with fervent zeal, and unabating kindness. A paper to be advantageously edited, must be liberally supported. The compositor <hi>must</hi> be requited for his mechanical toil, the publisher <hi>must</hi> be compensated for his cares and risque, and the conductor, if competent to his highly responsible duties, has a claim to what an ancient author, who well knew the value of literary service, calls the "quiddam honorarium," the generous stipend for mental efforts, not the paltry wages of a vulgar hireling. If an industrious and high minded man thus situated, received only a servant's price of labour, he will quickly sink to the level of the mercenary fugitive in the gospel. He will flee from or neglect his duty, because he is an <hi>Hireling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Literary industry, usefully employed has a sort of draught upon the bank of opulence, and has the right of entry into the mansion of every Maecenas. When to government or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals it renders actual service, gives harmless pleasure to some, and new ideas to others, it confers at least a species of obligation, which any code of ethical precept will teach men to repay. Let not this be considered a mercenary doctrine, and let not writers be rashly censured for <hi>vending</hi> the fruits of mind. Authors, far elevated above the mire of low avarice, have thought it debasement to make Literature common and cheap. The affluent lord LYTTLETON made his history of Henry II. a book-sellers property at the price of three thous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and pounds; and Gibbon, and Robertson, and Blair, and Sir William Jones sold their manuscripts for sums, which the generosity of Britain did not scruple to pay, nor the pride of authorship blush to receive.</p>
               </note> the Editor should have any, <hi>must not "despise the day of small things."</hi> It is proposed always to give plenty of letter-press, in proportion to the public demand, and, as the exigency of the season, or copiousness of materials may require, to double, treble, and even quadruple the number of pages in the PORT FOLIO. Hereafter, more may be done, if more be wanted, and if more be fostered. At present, with the prudent policy of wary beginners, it is judged expedient to risk but little. No sonorous promises are made, and no magnificence of style attempted. The paper is to be neither <hi>wire-woven,</hi> nor <hi>hot-pressed,</hi> and it certainly, in more senses than one, shall not be <hi>cream-coloured;</hi> but, in a plain dress of Quaker simplicity, may, perhaps, offer something tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on political, literary, and transient topics, and something, auxiliary to sound principles, which, <hi>after church,</hi> "retired leisure <note n="6" place="bottom">MILTON. Il Penseroso.</note>" may read on Sunday<note n="7" place="bottom">The choice of <hi>Saturday</hi> is propitious to our plan. The leisure, which is generally found, or made on that day, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the retirement and quiet of the Sabbath, seem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite moral speculations, and "the cherub Contemplation." The union of Literature, Piety, and Morals, is fervently and elegantly wished by the admirable author of "The Pursuits of Literature," a lofty and columnar work, whose grace and strength will endure, when the delusions of fanatic democracy and Gallic philosophy shall have vanished, like the filthy fogs of a morbid autumn.

            <p>Empirical vaunting is always nauseous and arrogant; and the plausibility of mighty promise has generally a pitiful conclusion. The Editor, with honest diffidence, declines making specious engagements; timid, lest time or chance, lest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness, sickness, or stupidity, should step between stipulation and fulfilment, he applies to himself one of the didactics of Solomon, and
<q>boasts not himself of to-morrow, for he knows not what a day may bring forth.</q>

            <p>But though the making of such promises is no less trite than fallacious, and it is the part of Effrontery to exclaim,

yet, on the other hand, it will be both novel and safe for an Editor to declare, what he will <hi>avoid.</hi> More certain and confident respecting that which he can <hi>shun,</hi> than that which he can <hi>accomplish,</hi> he stipulates, with perfect sincerity, <hi>not to do</hi> certain things, and makes his public contract as Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, at the beginning of the century, used to divide their sermons, with a First, <hi>negatively.</hi>

                  <p>Dr. SMOLLET, in one of his merry novels, describing a quackish prescription of a <hi>neutral</hi> draught, adds, "it was so <hi>neutral,</hi> as to declare neither for the patient nor the disease." Such is the neutrality of many a news-paper; and it may be added, of its readers too, men of <hi>convenient</hi> maxims, who can cry amen to every creed, and venture on all sides, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being trusted by any. Of such infamous principles the Editor has the deepest abhorrence, and for the silly scheme of Impartiality, he cherishes the most ineffable contempt. This is not a time for "creamy smoothness" in our speculations, nor for lukewarmness in our conduct. When "bold bad men" are assailing THE CITADEL, and violating the tombs of the ancients, and plucking up the old land-marks, it is salutary to apply to each timid Bystander what was once indignantly addressed to the supineness of Laodicea, "I know thy works that thou art <hi>neither cold nor hot,</hi> I would thou wert cold or hot." When Classical Learning is exploded as a senseless study of words; public quiet disturbed by every boorish bawler; a church pronounced no better than a barn, and the bible classed with an obsolete almanac: When Genius, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and Virtue are wrenched from their just elevation, and "trodden under the hoofs of a swinish multitude," it is right and decorous, and useful to be <hi>partial, bigotted,</hi> adhesive to old systems.</p>

To gratify the malignancy of fanatics, he will not <hi>asperse</hi> the government or the church, the laws or the literature of England. Remembering that WE ARE AT PEACE with that power—that the most wholesome portions of our polity are modelled from hers—that we kneel at Shrines, and speak a language common to both, he will not flagitiously and foolishly advert to ancient animosities, nor, with rash hand, attempt to hurl the brand of discord between the nations.</p>

            <p>Having succinctly stated what he will avoid, and what he will attempt, the Editor now feels the propriety, the necessity, the utility of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning to his aid the <hi>Master-Spirits</hi> of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It must be apparent to the most heedless observer, that it is the object of this undertaking, to combine literature with politics, and attempt something of a more honorable destiny, than a meagre journal. To accomplish this purpose, the co-operation of many minds is requisite; and, without the cheerful and constant contributions of erudition, taste, and genius, an Editor, the most inventive and industrious, would have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occasion to sigh over his pages, either "mournfully jejune," or ignominiously vacant and incorrect. The causes of the inaccuracy, inequalities, dulness, and, at length, the total fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of many of our American Gazettes may be easily traced; and it may be useful to read a <q>brief chronicle</q>
of the rise, progress, and downfal of a newspaper, lamely conducted, and penuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously supported.</p>
            <p>An obscure and illiterate individual, of mere mechanical skill in the art of printing, contracts debt for his press and paper, and issues proposals for a Gazette. As education or habit, as chance or interest, may determine, he professes himself a republican, or a federalist; or, what is more common, a man of no party; willing to publish trash for all, and pretending to be unbiassed by any. <hi>Fervet opus.</hi> The press groans, the work begins, and <hi>with</hi> the paltry aid of <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> subscribers, and <hi>without</hi> assistants, either literary or political, he, of necessity, prints from week to week <hi>a thing</hi>—"without a name," with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out correctness, without consistency; in narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion turbid, or false, in comment clumsy, in its original departments crude and juvenile, in its selections uncouth, vicious in the humblest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of grammar, and a trespasser on all the limits of language.<note n="15" place="bottom">This fashionable mode of bad writing is forcibly, though quaintly ridiculed by the vivacious HOWELL, an "old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish gentleman" of sound understanding, and of sparkling wit "A kind of simpering, and lank hectic expressions, made up of a bombast of words and finical affected compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only. I cannot well away with such sleazy stuff, with such cobweb composition, where there is <hi>no strength of matter,</hi> nothing for the reader to carry away with him, that may <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>large the notions of his soul.</hi>"</note> A puny bantling from the press "so faint, so spiritless, so dull, so dead in look," quickly "goeth to its long home," its <hi>inky</hi> "mourners go about the streets," and its <hi>numerous</hi> sponsors and friends strangely wonder at its dissolution.</p>
            <p>Thus conducted, and thus unsupported, can it be expected that a paper should flourish in vigor, or possess interest; that it should furnish docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Historian, or even amusement to

The journals of Europe are res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable, are read eagerly, and preserved long, because they are under the direction of active skill, assisted by the researches of statesmen, and the liberal labours of literature and genius.— <hi>Abroad,</hi> it is generally understood that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of a press is a scholar and a gentleman <note n="16" place="bottom">It is well known to all, who are conversant in the history of the writers in the reign of Queen Ann and of George II. that some of the finest wits of the age, both scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and statesmen, were actively engaged in writing for the public papers.

Richardson, the author of Clarissa, was the conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of two papers, and Bowyer, one of the most learned of English printers, published for many years a weekly museum.</note>. In Germany and Holland, university professors, men erudite and dignified, are frequently engaged in this honourable service. A <hi>Gazette of Leyden,</hi> and a <hi>Spectator of the North</hi> have been conducted by men who associated the statesman's research and the scholar's lore; men who visited the tombs of the learned, and the camps of the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. In France, under the <hi>old government,</hi> abbés, lawyers, and men of letters by profession, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended the <hi>flying-sheets</hi> of the time; and now, UNDER THE ANARCHY, it is notorious that all the public prints, <hi>controuled by whatever faction,</hi> are composed, or compiled, by men of invention and learning, many of whom were <hi>once</hi> among the clergy. In Scotland, more than one paper has been illuminated by many a ray from the constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of genius and wisdom, shining in her three universities; and in England, not to mention that political articles and arguments are frequently furnished by the ministry themselves, the best and most popular papers exhibit the abilities of numerous writers, ACTING IN CONFEDERACY. The memory of WOODFALL has supplied with parliamentary debates the columns of a Chronicle, and DUNNING has given it sparkling wit, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical precision. By the side of SMART's poetry, Dr. JOHNSON published his Idlers in a Saturday's paper, by Newberry. The Whitehall Evening Post, and the St. James' Chronicle numbered Soame JENYNS, Lord CHESTERFIELD, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race WALPOLE, on an ample catalogue of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished auxiliaries; and both the literary virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oso, and the laborious annalist, still preserve and read the files of "The Public Advertiser," which displayed, at one period, the political arguments of the Marquis of ROCKINGHAM, the playful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Dr. GOLDSMITH, the polite literature of ARTHUR MURPHY, and the gorgeous imagery of EDMUND BURKE<note n="17" place="bottom">Well conducted, authentic, and accurate newspapers often afford useful, and sometimes the only materials to the historian. Bolingbroke somewhere in his letters mentions the utility of gazettes both to the studious and the compiler of History.

            <p>From the experience of some years, while he was conducting the FARMER's MUSEUM, a paper pronounced, by the partiality of the public, not altogether vacant of original composition, the Editor concludes, that of learning and wit, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance <hi>defensive</hi> can be formed even here. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate assurances have been already made of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral contributions from learned minds; and the Editor will omit nothing, which can add to the literary forces of this enterprize. To this end, a correspondence with men of political information, and miscellaneous writers will be commenced; and arrangements are already made, to obtain from Europe every new and interesting publication, which, either for use or ornament, may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply proper materials to be deposited in the PORT-FOLIO.</p>

                  <p>As an orator he disputed the palm of eloquence with Cicero himself. He cultivated every muse, and was the patron of every man of genius.

                  <p>The name of Sir WILLIAM JONES demands the amplest tribute of praise. The Editor, captivated by the versatility of his powers, and benefited, he hopes, by his industrious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, owes the sincerest compliments to the varied excellence of a <hi>lawyer,</hi> in whose learned and luminous pages one may discern the most exact proportions of logic, and the most beautiful forms of diction. He is "a legitimate English classic." He has omitted nothing useful or pleasant in lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. He has translated the oratory of the Greeks, and compiled a grammar of the Persic; he has methodized the most chaotic of English law titles, and described the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risprudence and morals, the arts and amusements of Asia. He has instructed and charmed the courts of Calcutta, and playfully investigated the origin of chess. He has embodied the features of the landscape of Hinzuan, and composed clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical epithalamiums on wedded Beauty.</p>

            <p>The tranquil sect of Quakers, a description of men, imbued with that "charity, which suffereth long, and is kind;" men honourably distinguished for their aversion to pernicious novelties, and to the state charlatans, and audacious deists of France, and to all the trumpery of her bungling innovation, and to all the tampering of her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical restlesness, are invited to countenance this work.</p>
            <p>In aid of a paper, principally devoted to moral instruction, and polite literature, it would be equally indecorous and undeserved, to neglect so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting the good opinion, and assistance of the ladies. The influence of female elegance on the manners, and female principles on the character of men, is wide and powerful. They not only fix the standard of fashion, but regulate most of the duties, and decencies of life. On every question of delicacy, and sentiment, and taste, and decorum, they have the clearest right to be respectfully heard. To the honour of the country, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of its CAPITAL, where their education is the most sedulously regarded, there are many, who, possessing learning, which would be thought extensive in the other sex, set an example of deep humility to their own;—women who distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for wit and genius, are eminent for domestic qualities; who, excelling in the fine arts, have carefully enriched their understandings; and who have not refined elegance into insipidity, nor frit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered down delicacy into frivolousness<note n="21" place="bottom">

To this respectable and polished class of female characters, the Editor looks confidently for the exertion of their influence, and for the display of their talents in support of his Miscella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It has been his privilege to know more than one highly instructed and accomplished woman, indulging herself in a chaste display of literary as well as fashionable excellence, benignant to the votaries of science, which she loved, and patroniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the learning which she herself adorned. Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and fondness have extolled the Aspasias and the Glyceras of Athens, and the Talliens of

            <p>SUCH are the outlines, and terms of an adventurous paper, which, not without anxiety, is now to be presented to the public. Between Criticism and the conducter of the Port-Folio, there are but few hours: and, during a suspense, so interesting in the annals of a writer, the proudest heart would beat, and the firmest nerves tremble. In this walk of composition, this is not the Editors <hi>first</hi> essay. To some little experience, he may, without arrogance, pretend, who for many years has been laboriously employed in a Literary Journal. At an early season of life, he voluntarily forsook the path of ordinary business, for a <hi>lowly</hi> seat in the Muses' bower. Though his choice has not enriched, or advanced him, yet of its propriety he has never doubted. "I was," says Mr. HUME, "seized very early with a passion for literature, which has been the ruling passion of my life, and the great source of my enjoyments." The heart of every literary enthusiast is always responsive to such sentiments; the Editor has a <hi>right</hi> to make a similar declaration. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon too with many others, he has long been urged by a sober wish, or, if the sneering reader will have it so, he has long been deluded by the visionary whim, of making literature the hand-maid of Fortune, or, at least, of securing something like independency, by exertions, as a man of letters. Hitherto, his success has been far from brilliant: But though the gains of Authorship have been trivial, yet once they secured him a portion of <hi>rural</hi> comfort, and, perhaps, they will enable him to flourish in a city. The antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of an adventurer, are like the desires of a lover, "Gay hope is their's by Fancy fed." With a spirit lofty, yet not insolent, with a voice timid, yet not servile, he calls on his countrymen to inspect and appreciate his labours; and, with a <hi>moderate</hi> estimate, he will persevere and be cheerful.</p>
