            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>REVENGE, by nature, animates each breast,</l>
            <l>As fierce in man, as in the savage beast:</l>
            <l>Ev'n the vile reptile feels this passion strong;</l>
            <l>The abject Worm resents injurious wrong.</l>
            <l>Does not the Wasp, provok'd, dart forth his sting?</l>
            <l>The patient Swan will sometimes arm his wing.</l>
            <l>Nature's the same in All—What wretch so low</l>
            <l>Not to rataliate, or resent a blow?</l>
            <l>Why then must I <hi>alone</hi> to <hi>insult</hi> yield,</l>
            <l>And use no arms but the <hi>defensive</hi> shield?</l>
            <l>Shall coward Scandal dare to wound my name,</l>
            <l>Publish dis-praise and privately defame?</l>
            <l>And blast, by falsehood, what's my greatest good,</l>
            <l>A reputation dearer than my blood?</l>
            <l>Shall sons of <hi>Belial</hi> saucily presume,</l>
            <l>While I must sit, like patience on a tomb?</l>
            <l>No:—to <hi>rataliate</hi> is a <hi>nat'ral law</hi>;</l>
            <l>Reason, in self-defence, the sword will draw.</l>
            <l>Arms less offensive to the Bard belong;</l>
            <l>The Pen alone must vindicate his wrong:</l>
            <l>Thus, like the fretful Porcupine's, his quill,</l>
            <l>Venom'd with gall, his vengeance must fulfil.</l>
            <l>Revenge, like Honor, has some noble laws;</l>
            <l>Arm me then, Satire, and maintain my cause.</l>

            <l>PRAISE-GOD, the Brat was called; a name,</l>
            <l>Among fanaticks, of great fame:</l>
            <l>So call'd, in mem'ry of the event,</l>
            <l>When at his birth a B—was sent,</l>
            <l>Which by a fost'ring Mother's help,</l>
            <l>Might save and suckle the young whelp:</l>
            <l>Thus when Rome's Founders sprawling lay,</l>
            <l>Expos'd in woods, it chanc'd, that way</l>
            <l>A prowling Wolf came passing by,</l>
            <l>Which on the Bantlings cast an eye:</l>
            <l>She paw'd, and lickt, and seem'd to hug</l>
            <l>The Cubs, who hung about her dug:</l>
            <l>Thus was the infant PRAISE-GOD nurs'd,</l>
            <l>To head, in time, the League accurs'd.</l>
            <l>Near to the place renown'd of old,</l>
            <l>(The nurs'ry of many a scold)</l>
            <l>Tradition says there was a den,</l>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:010340_0005_0F7E80F272C377D8"/>Like that which CACUS skulk'd in, when</l>

            <l>Where he his cattle stol'n could trace,</l>
            <l>Which, VIRGIL says, so stunk and smoak'd,</l>
            <l>That HERCULES was almost choak'd.</l>
            <l>This was the den design'd by fate</l>
            <l>For <hi>Bare-bone lodge,</hi> call'd <hi>Billingsgate.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Hither the Dam brought home her young,</l>
            <l>And laid him on a bed of dung;</l>
            <l>Having observ'd that Beggars suck,</l>
            <l>Like roots, much nourishment from muck:</l>
            <l>But she forgot that the infection</l>
            <l>Of dunghill-steams would spoil complexion;</l>
            <l>Wherefore, alas! her little Bumkin</l>
            <l>Grew up in colour like a pumpkin.</l>
            <l>Yet well he throve in strength and stature;</l>
            <l>No sucking pig could well be fatter:</l>
            <l>For, as old CHIRON fed ACHILLES</l>
            <l>With lion's, and with bear-bone jellies,</l>
            <l>So to young PRAISE-GOD oft was thrown</l>
            <l>A bullock's pluck, or marrow-bone.</l>
            <l>Hence he was big at six, or seven,</l>
            <l>As other younkers at eleven;</l>
            <l>And always prone to kick, and cuff,</l>
            <l>Prov'd he was made of rumpish stuff.</l>
            <l>Ere he was Ten, he wax'd so stout</l>
            <l>That he would join in ev'ry rout,</l>
            <l>Whene'er, to <hi>serve</hi> the <hi>holy cause,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Saints <hi>defy'd</hi> their <hi>country's laws.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Such too his early zeal 'gainst vice,</l>
            <l>Whoring, and drunkenness, and dice,</l>
            <l>First Mob he was, whene'er a nest</l>
