            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>NOW help me to rail, to curſe that ſeducing libertine ſex, who have for ſo many years been the ſubject of your ſatire.—Yes, Charles, I have for ſome time paſt been a convert to your opinion, my hopeful rib has followed the example of her eldeſt ſiſter, but in iniquity ſhe far out does her: your wiſe was comparatively a Diana, after being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in a faux pas ſhe had the grace to bury herſelf and her ſhame in obſcurity,—ſhe has ever ſince been dead to the world,—her prudent retreat in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, aton'd for her fault;—your honor received only a ſlight ſcratch, compared to that which mine has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; the broad ſhame comes ſtaring in my face, and boys—pride forbids me to finiſh the horrid ſentence—ſhe is gone—we are ſeparated for ever; I ſhall not take the trouble to ſue for a divorce; why ſhould I? ſince not even the charms of a Venus, with Pallas's mind, could tempt me again to play the fool and marry. I have thus got rid of one plague, but another ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. Can I ſleep in peace.—Can I enjoy that eaſe, of which your indolent friend, as you often call me, is ſo fond, while it is ſtill in the power of a female to plunge me deeper in diſhonor—marry your daughter

ſays ſomebody, I forget who, leaſt ſhe marry herſelf,—but an imprudent marriage in theſe our degenerate days, is not the worſt a parent has to fear.</p>
                  <p>The girl already, young as ſhe is, diſcovers ſo much of her mother's diſpoſition, that I have the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful forebodings of her future fate—who would have the courage to marry, did they but ſeriouſly weigh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.—This was not my caſe,—caught by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I ſaw ſhe had a graceful eaſe in her manner, that ſhe danced with elegance—ſung agreeably and ſpoke French with fluency. Satisfied that ſhe was miſtreſs of theſe ſuperficial accompliſhments, I gave myſelf no farther trouble: Her mind,—ah! I fear it is irreparably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; had it been left in a ſtate of nature, I might have had ſome hopes, but her native levity has gained new force, by the precepts of an intriguing governeſs; and the example of a mother loſt to virtue.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe perverters, theſe poiſoners of her youthful heart, are diſmiſſed with the infamy they deſerve; but 'tis too late—the miſchief is done:—What my next ſtep muſt be, heaven knows: The girl's continuing to live with me, is out of the queſtion; I have neither talents nor inclination to commence her preceptor; I have no maiden ſiſters to undertake the important charge;—would to heaven I could find ſome place of ſafety to ſend her to, till I can fix on a fit huſband for her.</p>

Her beauty; (for Bell has all her mother's charms, and I fear all her imperfections into the bargain) her beauty I ſay, and large fortune, will eaſily procure her a ſuitable match in this prudent age:—Do Charles, help me by your ſage advice out of this dilemma; do you know any old dowager to whom I could commit her?—it muſt be in the country remember; for our old har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridans in town, are only more practiſed in the ways of vice than their grand-daughters; but an ancient caſtle in the country, moted round, with a ſtarched virgin, neglected from her youth upwards, by the other ſex; whom nature has fenced round on every ſide, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſecured from all attempts; who never heard the ſepucing whiſpers of flattery; who never excited a tender ſigh, or amorous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>THERE is not a married man in England, but who ſooner, or later, will be compelled to ſubſcribe to my creed.—I need not tell you what that creed is, ſince you have a thouſand times, while an infidel, heard

me repeat it.—Poor Harry;—well, <q>your condition (our condition I ſhould ſay) is not to be ſcorned,</q> ſince the firſt men in the nation, "are now-a-days hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned."</p>
                  <p>A pretty taſk you would have me engage in,—to go in queſt of virginity,—of an old maid;—an old un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married woman is, I trow, eaſily found; but for a maid,—you muſt firſt provide me with a few of thoſe dogs mentioned in the Spectator,—my ſcent is not good enough to diſcover them.</p>
                  <p>I queſtion if in all London ſuch a phoenix is to be found out of leading-ſtrings; and you want, not a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but an antient Duena.—The ſcheme you propoſe is chimerical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the beſt advice I can give you, is, that you ſend Bell to keep her couſin company.—My girl has been in a convent ever ſince her mother's fine pranks were diſcovered;—and there ſhe ſhall remain, till I have a huſband ready at the foot of the alter to receive her hand, and to take the wayward charge out of mine.</p>
                  <p>I do not recommend a nunnery as a ſchool of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; on the contrary, I think with Rouſſeau, that it is a nurſery of coquettes; but ſince Mungo's receipt is found ineffectual (for we have loſt the art of which the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh once boaſted padlocking the minds of our females, by a generous confidence and reaſonable freedom;) ſince this will no longer reſtrain them, or rather ſince they no longer think it worth their while to deceive us, by an outward appearance of virtue, but ſin with a high hand, and in the face of day;—ſince this, I ſay, is the caſe, the Spaniſh padlock muſt be ſubſtituted in lieu of the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>I have placed bolts and bars, as guards upon my daughter; marriage alone ſhall releaſe her from her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon—ſhe then becomes the property of her huſband—if after that ſhe commences the modern fine lady—his

honor receives the principal wound—the diſgrace glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only obliquely on me—her name, her condition is changed; from me he receives her pure—'tis his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to keep her ſo—if not, he muſt take the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Ridiculous:—Unjuſt however, is that preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which makes us confound the innocent with the guilty—but 'tis no longer the caſe—******* is now an honorable name—no longer the prerogative to city-huſbands, but the high court faſhion—a title of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>Pardon me, Harry; you know there is no ſtopping either my pen or tongue, when I ſtumble on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but for once I will check myſelf—'tis hackneyed—all the world rail—but nobody looks at home, and begins the reformation ſo much wiſh'd for.</p>
                  <p>Let us return to the girls:—If you chuſe to carry your's abroad, I'll accompany you.—I do not think, if ſhe is the lively huſſy you deſcribe, ſhe ought to be truſted with any other eſcort but yourſelf.—Yet why ſhould I ſay, if ſhe is this, or that; vice is not confined

to any particular temper or age. Who could have a more ſeducing appearance, a more promiſing diſpoſition than my torment.—Mild as the gentle breeze of May—timid—bluſhingly modeſt—full of tender ſenſibility—her ſentiments delicate and refined.—Often have I, in the days of fooliſh love and rapture, read to her Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's fine deſcription of Eve, and ſwore ſhe ſat for the amiable picture—
not obvious, not obſtruſive—but retired.—</p>
                  <p>Such ſeemed to be her nature. Alaſs! too ſoon ſhe threw off the maſk. Do you know, Harry? No, you do not: Let me then ſpare myſelf the ſhame of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my weakneſs. Harriot is the exact image of her mother: As a daughter, ſhe acts with the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. No one can be more dutiful, more ſubmiſſive, more affectionate; never has ſhe uttered a ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint at her confinement,—but ſhe is of a grave turn—vaſtly ſentimental, forſooth;—in ſhort, the very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have drawn above. But as I muſt from fatal experience, exclaim with the poet, "Frailty, thy name is <hi>Woman.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>So do I not place any manner of confidence in theſe favorable appearances; the foundation of my ſecurity is good ſubſtantial iron bars. Let me know, whether or no you chooſe to follow my example. Harriot is not much older than your daughter: her gravity and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, however, will give her a ſort of authority over your giddy girl, and may be a means of moderating her too great vivacity. If you determine to place her at the convent of B—, I will as I before ſaid, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you in your expedition, and there we will leave from ſafe under lock and key, till we can find fit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Dreary now appears this malancholy encloſure—ſo the world calls it; but never till my Eliza's departure did it wear a gloomy aſpect to her Harriot; happy in your ſociety, guarded by pious precepts from the love of a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous world, of which I know nothing, but from the deſcription of thoſe whoſe intereſt it now is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I was perfectly content with my tranquil retreat: With what chearful alacrity did you and I enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our innocent amuſements; not a moment of our time hung heavy on our hands;—but, ſince ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from you, I feel an aching void in my heart; our little recreations have, to me, loſt their charms; I ſtill ſee round me the ſame ſerene, contented coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, but I ſee none to whom I can, with unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> freedom, unboſom myſelf: I like and eſteem them; but 'tis a cool ſentiment, compar'd to what I experienced for you.

your joy, at being again received into the arms of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mother, by my complaints; rather let me congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate you on your felicity: A mother! O my friend! the very mention of that endearing name, fills my eyes with tears. Long, long, have I been deprived of mine: But, young as I was, when I enjoyed that ineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable bleſſing, ſtrongly is it impreſſed on my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; I love to recollect her tenderneſs on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I ſeem ſtill to feel her kiſſes on my cheek, and fancy my ſelf preſſed to her maternal boſom. She is no more! Yet let me not repine, I have ſtill a parent left: But it ſeems natural to our ſex to be more fondly attached to the mother, than the father. I reverence the latter, but my affection is mixed with awe; a haſty word from him agitates my whole frame; while his ſmiles excite only a ſort of doubtful joy: A joy, alloyed by the fear of inadvertently doing, or ſaying ſomething that may diſpel the ſunſhine of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſubſtitute a cloud in its place. Whereas, had I a mother, I feel that my heart would expand itſelf in her preſence; I would preſume to make her the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidant of all my little ſecrets: Her feminine ſoftneſs would encourage me; on the contrary, my father's manly dignity, adds to my natural timidity; perhaps I ſhould be more at eaſe in his preſence, were I of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I enjoy at the grate but little of his company: My firſt emotions at the ſight of him, are always of the moſt agreeable nature; but he no ſooner beholds me, than his native vivacity is exchanged for a melancholy penſive air; for ſome moments he continues loſt in thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his viſits are ſhort, and he ſeems to leave me without regret.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, my dear, I have before now troubled you with the above remarks. Pardon me,—what led me to

the ſubject, was a note, which I receiv'd from him this morning, informing me that he, my uncle (Sir Harry Richmond) and my couſin Iſabella, will be here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow; the latter is, I fancy, coming to add to the number of our boarders; I never ſaw her, nor have I the leaſt knowledge of her character; but as the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my mother's ſiſter, I am prepared to love her, and expect her arrival with that female impatience and curioſity, ſo natural to us. Lady Richmond I have ſeen, ſhe favored me laſt winter with a viſit, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by my uncle; ſhe is I think, without exception, the fineſt woman I ever ſaw, and as lively as ſhe is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome:—Sir Harry is no leſs diſtinguiſhed for the charms of his perſon, ſo that I expect to behold in my little couſin, a perfect Venus; you know my dear, how fond I am of beauty—in others I mean. You will, perhaps, archly ſmiling, hint, that you could not ſuſpect, I could mean in myſelf, ſince you know of none I have to be fond of; this ſome would ſay, therefore to ſave your friend from the imputation of vanity, I ſaved them the trouble: Do not call this affected humility: I will ſay no more on the ſubject.</p>

                  <p>THEY are come my dear:—About eleven o'clock this morning I was ſummoned into the parlour, the outward parlour I mean, where we receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the lady abbeſs, and ſome of the ſiſterhood were

ready at the other ſide of the grate, to receive their new charge; my father entered, leading Iſabella, followed by Sir Harry; I was ſtruck with the uncommon beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her perſon; ſhe is very tall of her age, her air is graceful and animated; her travelling dreſs was ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitably becoming; ſhe changed colour at the ſight of the nuns, and as it appeared to her, their gloomy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure—ah! thoſe iron bars!—cried ſhe, with a faint ſmile, pointing to the grate, the very ſight of them makes a free born Engliſh ſpirit revolt. I doubt not my dear couſin, ſaid I, embracing her, but time will effectually reconcile you to our ſerene and tranquil joys. Serene and tranquil, repeated ſhe, a pretty deſcription, and admirably ſuited to the gravity of the no leſs pretty ſpeaker: In ſaying this, ſhe obligingly returned my careſſes.—All the Engliſh boarders dreſſed to the beſt advantage, now by order of the abbeſs, made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; this had before been requeſted by my uncle, who knew ſome of their parents: Here, ſaid he, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a ſmile to my father, one might, I fancy, find that phoenix you deſpaired to meet with. 'Tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, returned the other in the ſame tone,—thanks to the ſtrength of their impregnable garriſon; but how long will they remain ſo when they get into the world? Sir Harry ſhook his head—pity they ſhould ever come there, ſaid he, to loſe that engaging timidity, that ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing air of innocence, which is ſo charming! did wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men know their own intereſt would they wiſh effectually to enſlave us; they would relinquiſh the <hi>bon ton</hi> for the antient ſimplicity of manners, and again become retired, which renders them the more to be deſired.

After chatting about half an hour longer, Sir Harry ſaid, that he wanted to have a little private converſation with the lady abbeſs, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his daughter to my friendſhip, and promiſed to call again next morning.</p>
                  <p>On this my fair co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What an eaſe, what a vivacity is there in the manner of this charming girl! how little is ſhe reſtrained by the preſence of her father, to what I am by mine! but this is eaſily accounted for, not only by the difference of our tempers, but by the difference of theirs: Sir Harry is gallant, polite, and gay;—my father is well b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

However, were I even to undergo this unfavorable metamorphoſe my attachment to you would remain; as a female you excite my warmeſt friendſhip;—and were I a male, that friendſhip would be exchanged for love: This change would be ſo much more flattering to your vanity, that I fear I ſhall ſink in value as what I am, when you conſider what I might have been. But I forget,—I talk to you as if ſtill in the convent, where lovers are ſo ſcarce; on the contrary, you are in the beaux monde, where every heart endued with ſenſibility, pays you that tender homage ſo juſtly your due.</p>

                  <p>MY father talked of ſending me to a convent. You laughed at my fears:—Impoſſible.—Your papa, my dear, too much admires a woman of ſpirit, to ſend his daughter abroad on any ſuch gloomy er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.—No child, he will rather encourage, than damp your charming vivacity; you have already all the modiſh airs and graces, which coſt ſome of us (even women of faſhion) ſo much trouble to acquire. Do you recollect who ſaid all this to comfort her friend? Ah! lady Bab;—how much did flattering hope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us? Look at the place from whence I date this woe-begone epiſtle, the convent of R—. You doubt your ſenſes. Borrow your Aunt's ſpecks, child;—look again;—alas! 'tis even ſo;—but do not be too much affected: not long will Bell Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond be confined. By what pretty method do you think I am to be releaſed?—By marriage!—Delightful ſtate of freedom, as our modern wives manage the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>
                  <p>The poet makes Caliſta talk of the huſband's impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reign, "proud with opinion of ſuperior wiſdom," but our modern dames have taught them better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The tables are turned. 'Tis our reign now, not theirs, which then commences.—An unmarried woman is a mere cypher;—but when once the connu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial knot is tied, then pleaſures golden reign begins:—then for gallants, intrigues, the dear Coterie, and to crown all, a divorce.—What charming methods have the ladies of this poliſhed age diſcovered, to render marriage eaſy, Oh time! haſten that I may become

Young as I am, I know the world; early was I introduced into ſcenes of gaiety; often have I ſtood at the elbow of my mamma, while ſhe has loſt a cool hundred at Brag!—By the by, Lady Bab, brag is one of the moſt delightful games in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—ſomething in it ſo ſpirited—ſo fit for a woman of quality; I dare ſay I ſhould ſoon become miſtreſs of it. Ah! would I were now at the dear Coterie—learning the enchanting leſſon; inſtead of which, behold me, in a melancholy cell, with a death's head and a weeping Magdalene placed on my toilet, in the room of patch-box and coſmetics. The poor unfortunate ***** of a penitent was depicted with a countenance ſo horribly rueful, that there was no ſtanding it, if ſhe had not, by her ſiſter ſaints, been ſo effectually plaiſtered up againſt the wall, I ſhould have taken the liberty to remove her; but ſince this (without tearing to atoms the ſacred relict) could not be done, I have only with my pencil made a little reform in her face, and now ſhe appears with diſhevelled hair beating her breaſt, while her mouth is upon the broad grin: I never thought my drawing would have been of ſo much ſervice to me.</p>
                  <p>I was ſo diverted at the odd appearance of the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when I had thus touched it up, that I determined
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018142_0016_0FA562A1277D0A10"/>
to exerciſe my ſkill on ſome more of the <hi>memento mori's;</hi> accordingly, while the honeſt virgins were in the chapel, yawning over their beads I ſtole to their cells, and ſet their whole collection of ſaints a laughing; ſcarce a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the houſe, but what, with a few of my touches, I put into good humor, though before they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting in ſackcloth and aſhes. This is the leaſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous piece of miſchief I have amuſed myſelf with ſince I came here, and, to ſay truth, hardly worth rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but the Magdalene being facing me as I write, brought it to my remembrance: and whatever whim ſeizes me, whether in thought word or deed, you know I never check myſelf, ſo that if I am inclined to talk, or write nonſenſe, out it comes; it is a talent in which I excel: I know not how it may be reliſhed by my own ſex; but often have I by the moſt trifling prattle imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, drawn off the attention of a circle of beaux, from plain ſenſible women, who were left to entertain each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while they hung enraptured on the pretty follies that flowed from my ruby lips. Oh! Bab, when will thoſe happy days of dear flirtation return?—Now I talk of wiſe women, I muſt tell you that I have met with a female couſin of mine, one of the demureſt little toads you ever beheld; ſo ſentimental,—delicate,—ſo timid,—ſo feminine,—ſo much the antediluvian—Ah I Lord, there is no bearing her: and yet it muſt be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the girl has ſome agreeable talents, if ſhe did but know how to make uſe of them: ſhe has ſeen no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Her perſon too, is, what ſome people would call handſome: but ſhe is inanimate—at leaſt, ſhe appears ſo to me, when I compare her to thoſe charming affected lively

coquettes, amongſt whom I have been accuſtomed to flouriſh: What I here mean by inanimate, is the want of that modiſh air of freedom, ſo conſpicuous in the town bred belles; the loud laugh, the confident ſtare, which ſets all ruſtic baſhfulneſs at defiance. This kind of animation, is eaſily acquired; a couple of winters ſpent amongſt people of faſhion, will do the buſineſs; it has nothing to do with expreſſion of countenance, or I ſhould have no reaſon to tax my couſin with the want of it, for her features undiſciplined by art, betray every ſentiment of her heart: in her eyes, which are large, black, and languiſhing, one may ſee the ſparkle of joy; the tear of pity, and the gentle beams of friendly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility by turns: in ſhort, they are ſuch a pair of tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale eyes, that I know not what ſhe will do with them, when ſhe comes to figure in the beau monde: her hair is dark, her complexion delicate, rather inclined to pale; ſhe has good teeth, and a pretty mouth; yet will all this, is far from being a ſtriking beauty; her's is of that kind, which will not pleaſe the generality of men; but thoſe ſhe does affect will be deeply ſo. See here a proof how void I am of envy; but my vanity is too ſtrong to admit that humble vice.</p>
                  <p>I do not think Harriot is at all to be feared as a rival; ſhe is in every thing ſo very oppoſite to your humble ſervant, that we ſhall never interfere with each other's conqueſts.—Conqueſts!

I am, for my part, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, how your plain ſouls make ſhift to ſupport their inſipid exiſtence?

I ſhould think, void as they are of ſenſibility, faſhion governs them in every thing; nature has given them no peculiar bias;—they make love—take ſnuff—fight—dreſs—run to public places—and profeſs friendſhip with the ſame indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.—I have no patience—I am ſick of ſeeing perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, in all I meet, the ſame inſipid gaiety of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; the laugh without a joke,—and of hearing a jingle of words without meaning.—Why, ſince you are ſo fond of them, did you leave them? Why is your honor ſo much eaſier wounded, than that of the people whoſe manners you ſo much admire? You was in no danger of being either deſpiſed or ridiculed for your wife's gallantries; they would rather congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate you on being united to one, who is ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of <hi>la bon ton:</hi> ſure never any thing equalled the aſſurance of that woman! Far from being checked by my preſence, ſhe ſeems to watch for opportunities to throw herſelf in my way: Not often do I go to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018142_0020_0FA562A4286B59E0"/>
public places—but when I do, I am ſure to meet her. The other night at the opera ſhe made her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, blazing with jewels; I happened unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to place myſelf in the next box,—ſhe had the impudence to curteſy to me; I was compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the compliment: With this I could have put up, but fate had determined further to torment me. In coming out it was ſome time before my carriage could draw up; while I ſtood waiting for it, behold her again cloſe at my elbow.—"Your ſervant Mr. Rivers," cryed ſhe, <q>long have I wiſhed to have a little converſation with you;</q>—"with me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam!" and I darted at her a look of ineffable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.—<q>Unparalleled aſſurance! why you far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip your elder ſiſter; ſhe was a veſtal when compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you!—or to almoſt any other of her ſex;—</q> interrupted ſhe, <q>treat me as you pleaſe: but for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſake,—for your own ſake—be more juſt to your injured wife;—upon my life Rivers ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</q>—I hurried into my chariot without deign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to anſwer. She called to me, "ſtay one moment,—I have ſomething of conſequence!" I heard no more, I was glad to make my eſcape.</p>
                  <p>The ſubject in which ſhe ſtrove to engage me, is that, which of all others, is moſt trying to my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impetuous temper. There is a fooliſh weakneſs hangs about my heart, which neither my reaſon or pride can conquer: I ſhould have ſpent a horrid night: paſt ſcenes had taken ſtrong poſſeſſion of me; when my ſervant fortunately rouſed me from my diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reverie, by delivering a letter, the contents of which diverted my thoughts to another channel; it was from my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There was no bearing this;—I began to be mightily fooliſh, ſigh'd, grew penſive, reſtleſs, ceaſed to plague the nuns, and for a mere chimera, plagued myſelf. What was the moſt likely remedy for this diſeaſe? Marriage—well then, ſince the man is ſo teaſing on this head, I think I muſt even take him.—My father is good natured, I his only daughter; he is rich, the poverty of my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is of the leſs conſequence: in ſhort, if they won't provide me with a huſband, I muſt provide one for myſelf—to be cooped up in this odious houſe, priſon I ſhould ſay—where one's paſſions are doomed to ſtarve; ſhut up between four walls,—I can bear it no longer.—Death or liberty.—On the ſtrength of theſe wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections I made my eſcape, no matter how, reached Calais with my ſwain, from thence propoſed to proceed to England.—When behold! contrary winds forced us to remain here at this ſea-port; and what was ſtill worſe, blew my uncle to the place of our retreat, when we had ſung, laughed and toyed away the time—Oh, Lady Bab,—<q>What is life without paſſion, ſweet paſſion of love.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, I told you my uncle came to damp our joys.—He behaved like a man of ſenſe—in a few words, he clearly ſhewed me my folly, the word beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary dropped from his lips; away flew Cupid with extinguiſhed fire.

"'Tis well it's no worſe."—And yet, Lady Bab, I was exceeding indiſcreet—I do not mean in regard to virtue, and ſuch ſtuff—but I fear,—I fear,—hang it, we were both under age. I muſt not tell you all. I hate to recollect the fooliſh adventure: I terrified the poor ſilly youth, by letting him know, with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of my fingers, accompanied by a look ſtill more intelligible, that for the preſent it was neceſſary to put myſelf again into the power of my friends; that we muſt endeavour to have patience; that I could not, wiſhed not, to forget.</p>

                  <p>I have, ſince my return to priſon, found means, in ſpite of all their vigilance, to write to his ſiſter, who has, on my account, been, to her great joy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled our community: in it I incloſed one for our little Abbe, bidding him rely on my conſtancy, and truſt to my management for our re union, of which I did not deſpair, knowing the great influence I had over the heart of my fond father: I charged him not to ſtir in the affair; continue peaceably at your ſtudies, (I ſay to him in my letter) till I return to England; cruel fate ſhall not after that, long ſeparate hearts, which were formed for each other. When I get into that dear land of freedom, I will endeavour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile our tedious abſence, by a conſtant intercourſe of letters.

I can diſentangle myſelf;—ah! if you knew all—but—but—) Then, continued I, my arms ſhall be open to receive you; no longer need we wait for the conſent of parents—Let us my dear friend condole ourſelves with this happy proſpect;—and thus, I truſt, have I got rid of a troubleſome lover; and thus, I truſt, have I alſo got rid of love; I mean of the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic kind: now will I take the firſt good offer I meet with; never once will I ſtop to conſult my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; for I hold it as an infallible maxim, that no woman can properly govern her huſband, or ſhine as a fine lady, a modern wife I mean, if ſhe is ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh as to beſtow her heart on the man, to whom ſhe gives her hand—no, let all the love be on his ſide—the more fondly he doats the better; the eaſier taſk will ſhe find it to make him her dupe—then if ſhe has a mind to amuſe herſelf with <hi>la belle paſſion</hi>—there are in charming London, a thouſand handſome idle young fellows, who have nothing elſe to do but to furniſh her with this amuſement—Thus you ſee how ſenſibly I reaſon on theſe affairs, and how much I have profited by my early introduction into the <hi>beau monde.</hi> But the wiſeſt of us may, at ſome critical moments, be off our guard.—This was my caſe with the little Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be: for two long, long tedious months I had not ſeen the face of a male creature, except his: romances and iron bars had diſordered my imagination,—I played the fool.—It cannot be recalled—I muſt do the beſt to prevent any ill conſequences from the mad headed expedition. My demure couſin does not upbraid me with my imprudence; but her eves ſpeak, though her tongue is ſilent: before this adventure I regarded her with a ſort of neutrality; but now I heartily hate her, becauſe I cannot help feeling a kind of humbling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority: the time may come, when I will either bring

                  <p>THIS daughter of yours was born to torment me: but I intend to give you a minute account of the affair, and therefore will not anticipate.—Laſt night arrived in Paris, the Right Honorable Lord Oſſory, who will neither find his equal here, nor has he left his equal for every engaging quality, behind him. After our firſt congratulations were over, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his impatience to ſee Harriot; her idea, ſaid he, haunts me perpetually; and yet my good friend, in ſpite of the ſtrong prepoſſeſſions I experience in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, fate may not have deſtined me the happineſs of being allied to you; I muſt take the liberty to hope, that my choice is ſtill free, and that no offence will be taken—he pauſed:—I eaſily underſtood his meaning, and as eaſily diſſipated his delicate apprehenſions; he took his leave, promiſing to attend me next morning at twelve to the important interview.</p>
                  <p>I wrote a note to Harriot, informing her of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; but in regard to Lord Oſſory, I only ſaid, I ſhall bring with me a young gentleman who is deſirous
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018142_0036_0FA562B5B3FB9248"/>
of being introduced to you. I own I did not wiſh Bell to be preſent, therefore forebore to mention her in my billet—the hour arrived,—and punctual to his time his Lordſhip arrived alſo elegantly dreſſed;—we ſet off; during our little ride, he was viſibly agitated, I was not myſelf abſolutely indifferent as to the iſſue of our viſit.</p>
                  <p>Harriot made her appearance with a modeſt air and downcaſt eye, ſhe gave, by her not having in the leaſt degree altered the plain dreſs ſhe wears in common, a proof that ſhe had either very little vanity, or a great deal of pride; this at firſt glance appears a paradox. Rouſſeau has explained it in the deſcription of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia: her dreſs however, is always elegant and ſimple, and ſeemingly unſtudied; ſhe looked pretty, at leaſt in my eyes; the ſentimental expreſſion of her countenance, would, I thought, ſuit the taſte of Lord Oſſory.</p>
                  <p>She received me with her uſual reſpect, then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Lordſhip, who I preſented to her; ſhe timidly raiſed her eyes to his face, inſtantly her's was ſuffuſed with bluſhes; but a moment after, ſhe grew pale: in a faltering accent ſhe returned his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I never ſaw her ſo embarraſſed; he on the contrary appeared perfectly at eaſe; he examined her with attention, but in a manner delicately cautious leſt his glances ſhould add to her already apparent confuſion: not a look of either eſcaped my notice. I had no reaſon to be pleaſed with the ſerenity in his; I ſaw only a cool approbation: but in hers,—I wiſh the girl may be able to ſtop at that. While things were in this ſituation, a ſiſter came to inform me, that my niece begged leave to pay her reſpects—ſly gipſy, ſhe had ſeen my note:—not to me, but to Lord Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory did ſhe intend the compliment—In ſhe ſwam, adorned with all the charms that nature could beſtow, and embeliſhed with every ornament which a delicate
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018142_0037_0FA562B747E3CE50"/>
female fancy could ſelect; I never ſaw ſuch a blaze of charms. Harriot, for the firſt time in her life. I muſt do her the juſtice to believe, felt a momentary ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of envy; ſhe changed colour, and involuntarily retreated a few paces to make way for her too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rival.—This motion ſeemed to ſay—I give up the unequal conteſt.—Bell approached the grate with all the town-bred eaſe of a fine lady—graceful her air, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating her ſmiles. Lord Oſſory was transfixed into a ſtatute—the ſtatute of admiration—ſhe ſpoke—the harmony of her voice, her ſprightly wit completed her triumph.—He gazed, he liſtened with rapture,—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary praiſes burſt from his lips.—I had ſeen enough—too much, ſo aroſe to take my leave:—with viſible reluctance, he followed my example: his eyes quitted not the lovely object, till the envious door ſhut the delightful viſion from his ſight. I was not in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor to hear him tell me, as I ſaw he was preparing to do, that my girl had not anſwered his expectations. I therefore pretended indiſpenſible buſineſs, and politely paying my compliments, hurried from him. And now Sir Harry I expect to ſee you here That your daughter has made a conqueſt is paſt a doubt; the alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is every way deſirable,—pardon me, but I muſt ſay, that it is much better than ſhe deſerves:—her late adventure, I do not mean to call her virtue in queſtion, we muſt however allow that it was highly indiſcreet. I check my pen on this ſubject, there is a late in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage—always have I remarked that to hear a batchelor, who is not in love, deſcribe his future wife, is poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know that when he comes to make his choice, ſhe will be the very reverſe of what he then thinks he ſhall approve.—O man! of what uſe is thy boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reaſon! Adieu! let me know it I may hope for your preſence. My firſt proſpect has been fruitleſs,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018142_0038_0FA562B7A551ECB0"/>
but I have another in reſerve, of the ſucceſs of which. I cannot doubt:—my old friend Mrs. Williams, has made overtures for her ſon,—the young man is neither to be much liked, or much diſliked—one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon medly mortals, that make up the throng.—It is time my girl were ſettled in life,—till then, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be truly at eaſe, nor can I till then indulge my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in my wiſh for retirement. Mr. Williams then muſt be the man,—inſtantly will I write to his mother:—my daughter has been accuſtomed to obey,—on her part I fear not any oppoſition: this is my preſent plan, come and ſee it executed.—I think we have now a fair proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of getting rid of both our plagues.—Farewel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me</p>

my paſſion; the heavenly maid with ſweet compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, liſtens to my ſuit: we are preparing to return to England; where, as ſoon as the ſettlements can be drawn, our nuptials will take place: my impatience is inexpreſſible; you will not wonder at this, when you behold my charming bride: in my life I never ſaw ſo ſtriking, ſo dazzling a beauty; nor is her mind leſs perfect; ſuch lively wit, ſuch juſt and noble ſentiments, and, what more than any thing endears her to me, and promiſes the beſt foundation for our mutual happineſs, is, that in moſt things, I diſcover in her a ſimilarity of taſte, ſhe is, like me, a paſſionate admirer of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: prefers an agreeable retreat, with the ſociety of a few ſelect friends, to the noiſe buſtle, and unſatisfying amuſements of the <hi>beau monde.</hi> She has experienced both, and ſpeaks with virtuous indignation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of modern fine ladies; yet has not a tincture of cenſoriouſneſs in her amiable compoſition.</p>

Miſled by a lively fancy, I was ſtrongly poſſeſſed with an idea, that in her's I ſhould find my deſtined heart; and to do her juſtice, next to her lovely couſin, ſhe is the moſt amible girl I ever met with. I know not what impreſſion ſhe might hate made, tho' I was not immediately ſtruck with her charms, which are of that kind, that gently, and by degrees inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and fix a laſting empire in the heart: I know not I ſay, but ſhe in time might have fixed my choice, had not the tranſporting Iſabella made her appearance, with ſuch a ſuperior, ſuch a raviſhing blaze of beauty, that ſhe perfectly dazzled my ſenſes, and rendered me blind to every other object but herſelf;—no longer had reaſon any thing to ſay in the affair:—aſtoniſhed—over powered by her charms, I have ceaſed to be a free agent, and at the firſt became her ſlave.—Well is it for me, that ſhe has merit as well as thoſe powerful perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal attractions; for I feel, let her mind have been what it would, I was irreſiſtably doomed to love, however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſhe might have been of my eſteem: But thank heaven this is not the caſe, for ſhe is all that mortal man could wiſh. Mr. Rivers ſeemed diſappointed, but not offended at my being compelled to decline the honor of his alliance; he appears however, leſs pleaſed than I could wiſh, at that I am going to enter into with Sir Henry Richmond: out of regard for him, I as much as poſſible, reſtrain in his preſence, the overflowings of my heart in regard to my Iſabella, but when I involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily do juſtice to her merit, he looks diſſatisfied; tells me, with a forced ſmile, that love is blind, that if my paſſion was more modera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I wiſh I could prevail on Mr. Rivers to change his purpoſe; but in theſe affairs he is unperſuadably obſtinate; he has no tenderneſs for the ſex; he is more ſtudious of his own eaſe than of his daughter's happineſs; diſguſted with the world, he wiſhes to fly to retirement: but ere he can gratify his favorite whim, he thinks it neceſſary to put his Harriot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of a huſband: from the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of her mother he has loſt all confidence in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kind; he trembles for his honor, ſhould he truſt her in the world; from infancy, he has confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her to the gloomy encloſure of a nunnery, nor dare he take her from thence, till a huſband's arms are open to receive her.—Poor Harriot! I accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him this morning, as I before ſaid, on a viſit to her, and my angel: the latter did not for ſome time make her appearance:—if ſhe has any foible, it is a too great regard for dreſs: I have often to wait till ſhe has finiſhed the labors of the toilet.—How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary

                  <head>LETTER XVI. Miſs RIVERS to Miſs ELIZA DUDLEY.</head>
                  <p>CHIDE me not, my dear Eliza<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my ſpirits are weak. I have been ill. I could not write. But ah! never injure me ſo far as to ſuſpect I could forget my beloved, my only friend. What is the matter with my eyes? They flow inceſſantly. Indeed I have but too much cauſe to weep. O that you were here, that in your ſympathizing boſom I might hide my bluſhes, while I reveal my weakneſs. I die with ſhame even when my heart whiſpers to myſelf the fatal ſecret. Why, alas, was this moſt amiable of men thrown in my way? A hopeleſs paſſion conſumes me;—but this is not all. Patiently would I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſubmit to my own wretched fate; but to know that he is alſo doomed to miſery, 'tis too much. Eliza, his raſh choice will be his ruin. That artful diſſembler, my couſin, by wearing before him the maſk of hypocriſy, has ſhewn herſelf to me in her true colours. I know her utterly unworthy of his heart. Think not that I view her with the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant envious eye of a rival. Would it were ſo. Alas! I have convincing proofs how little ſhe is formed to contribute to his felicity. Their taſte, their diſpoſition, oppoſite as light and darkneſs; with what anguiſh do I behold the ſenſible, amiable, unſuſpecting youth, duped by her artifice! But who ſhall attempt to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him? Alas! too ſoon his own fatal experience will convince him of his error. How he idolizes her charms! with what fervor, yet delicate tenderneſs does he manifeſt his paſſion! She affects to love with equal ardor, while ſhe cannot conceal, even from me, her
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:018142_0052_0FA562C8159B24A8"/>
triumph, at having ſo artfully impoſed on him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Eliza, a heart like her's is incapable of that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. She has not one grain of tender ſenſibility in her compoſition. If ſhe had, no man on earth is more formed to awaken it than Lord Oſſory. There is in his countenance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat winning, irreſiſtable ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that is far more ſeducing than the moſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar beauty. His eyes, ſuch ſoftneſs, ſuch expreſſion, ſo languiſhingly ſweet! Fatal to your poor Harriot has been their tender glances; for tender they are even to me; he cannot diveſt them of it, the language of love is ſo natural to them. From the attentive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency with which he treats me, I flatter myſelf that I may, in time, aſpire to the honor of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; with that I muſt endeavour to be ſatisfied. It will alſo, alas, ſoon be criminal to view him in any other light. Every thing is now in readineſs for our return to England. Soon ſhall I have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to embrace my Eliza. That pleaſing hope ſupports my drooping ſpirits—well may they droop.—I have not yet told you half my miſery. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear either to think or write on the horrid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.—Let me not dwell on it. In a few words, my father is determined to ſacrifice me to a wretch. Eliza, it muſt not, cannot be; death will free me from his cruel power, and nothing but death can, I fear, ſave me from the threatened miſery. My tears, my entreaties are ineffectual; he is even deaf to Lord Oſſory's perſuaſive eloquence! that generous noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has condeſcended to become my advocate; but, alas, all he has been able to procure for me is a few month's reſpire. Thoſe months, O my friend, where do you think they are to be paſſed? With the happy, happy bride, at her lord's country ſeat. Sir Harry has a ſmall, but pleaſantly ſituated lodge in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018142_0053_0FA562CA1F5126A0"/>
where my father and he propoſe to take up their reſidence, that the former may be near enough to watch over the conduct of his unfortunate girl. The odious Williams is alſo to be Lord Oſſory's gueſt. Think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then, Eliza, what your Harriot muſt ſuffer from ſuch a ſituation; a mortified witneſs of her rival's felicity—peſtered with the addreſſes of the man ſhe hates—ſpies placed over her—a hopeleſs paſſion to combat with, at the very time ſhe is under the ſame roof with the object who inſpired it;—ſhe muſt ſee him daily—muſt daily converſe with him, and yet ceaſe to love.—What a taſk!—All that is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I will attempt. Either I muſt conquer it, or it will conquer me, and lay me in the ſilent tomb. No matter how ſoon. This ſcene of vanity cloſes on me. Who would wiſh to be a reſtleſs inhabitant of this diſorder'd world? I feel a reluctance to lay down my pen, it is a great relief to me to pour my griefs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your gentle boſom. You muſt permit me, when we meet, to renew the melancholy theme.—This is the laſt letter you will receive from me, dated from the dear, the peaceful convent. I grieve to think of my parting from the amiable women with whom I have ſpent ſo many tranquil years. In a convent, as well as in the world, there is a mixture of good and bad; but in this houſe the good is happily predominant. Many of the nuns, from ſenſe, ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, and unaffected piety, are entitled to our greateſt reſpect. In this I am ſure Eliza will agree with her</p>

                  <p>AT length the important day—the day which to Lord Oſſory was a day of exquiſite love and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the day which to Iſabella was a day of triumph and exul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Sleep lights on lids unſullied with a tear."</p>
                  <p>Mine are not of that number, I muſt not therefore expect a viſit from the welcome gueſt, inſtead of it, I ſit down to fulfil the promiſe I made—My dear Eliza, you are too virtuous, too amiable to gain the good gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my couſin.—I know ſhe would not like you, but I thought ſhe would have included you in our party, that ſhe might the better carry on the farce of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to me, (how my diſpoſition is changed) I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuſpicious, cenſorious,—nay, even I fear a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious—but I cannot—do not—Ah! how ſhould I love Lady Oſſory (muſt I call her) Well my dear, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your company, your preſence which I never more ſtood in need of, was denied me. With what ſoothing gentleneſs did you endeavour, the night before, when I bad you a reluctant adieu, to arm my weak heart for the approaching dreadful trial. Yet in ſpite of all your ſenſible arguments I aroſe next morning, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once cloſed my eyes, more dead than alive, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, agitated to ſuch a degree, that I could hardly keep myſelf from fainting, while my maid put on me thoſe ornaments, which I was obliged to wear in honor of the happy bride. When the taſk was finiſhed I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed

her, and raiſing my eyes to the glaſs, beheld a face ſo pale, ſo pathetically moving, (if I may ſo expreſs myſelf) that I burſt into tears, which flowed the faſter, for my gazing on my ſtreaming eyes:—Thus was I indulging a ſad luxury of grief, when I received a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to breakfaſt. It was ſome time ere, by breathing on my handkerchief, I could render myſelf fit to make my appearance: I endeavoured to muſter up a little pride. Weak, imprudent Harriot, cried I, Lord Oſſory does not love you, it is true, but why will you alſo compel him to deſpiſe you.—This thought rouſed me: I hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down leaſt the impreſſion of it ſhould wear off; there I found the moſt amiable of men, ſeated by his ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſmiling Iſabella, holding between both his, her paſſive hand; his fine eyes fixed on her's with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible delight, tranſported with her charms; ſhe engroſſed every faculty of his ſoul. I felt at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment emotions for which I deteſt myſelf.—I ſtarted, and put up an ejaculatory prayer, for grace to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Ah! curſed envy, never more ſhall you find room in my heart!—You have ſeen—You admire my couſin's uncommon beauty; but on this her bridal day, that beauty ſhone out with redoubled luſtre; well it might, for—ah! how inviting, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful were the ſmiling proſpects which opened to her view; light were her ſpirits, eaſy her deportment, no ruſtic baſhfulneſs, no timid modeſty to embarraſs her:—but let me reſume the thread of my ſtory.—The company whom I found aſſembled in the breakfaſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, were, beſides the bridegroom and bride, Sir Henry Richmond, Lady Bab Wilmot, and my father. This fine lady of quality is my couſin's confidant and boſom, friend, and well are their diſpoſitions ſuited to each other.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018142_0056_0FA562CBE65FDA40"/>
I know not whether or not you recollect her, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſhe was at St. James's ſquare, the firſt time I embraced my Eliza after my return to England.—Bell and her retired ſoon after you came in, I dare ſay ſhe eſcaped your notice: it is indeed that of the other ſex which ſhe alone wiſhes, and labors to attract—In this ſhe is, thanks to her rank, tolerably ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; her perſon is naturally paſſable, but ſhe renders it ridiculous and diſguſting by her unſufferable affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſhe is lively, haughty, coquette and ſatirical. This ſlight deſcription may ſuffice for my ſiſter bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, who had omitted no ornament that could ſupply the defects of nature. The little buſtle ſhe made in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her compliments to me, which like other fine ladies, ſhe always does in a high key, made Lord Oſſory turn his head; he roſe politely, led me to a ſeat; with a ſort of tender pity preſſed my hand;—<q>you have not yet my ſweet couſin,</q> ſaid he, <q>recovered the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of your voyage, but I hope the freſh country air, to which we are haſting, will produce a favorable change.</q> I forced a ſmile, looked my gratitude for his kind attention to my health, but durſt not truſt my voice. He again placed himſelf by his blooming Iſabella, ſhe did not however now ſo wholly engroſs his attention but that he ſometimes addreſſed his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing diſcourſe to me, and that always in the gentle ſoothing voice of friendſhip; Lady Bab, for want of a younger beau, flirted with my uncle, whoſe perſon is ſtill exceſſively agreeable, and who has all the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and vivacity, requiſite to the character of a fine gentleman. My father had been amuſing himſelf with the newſpapers; but ſoon after I came in, he beckoned to me; I followed him to a window at ſome diſtance from the reſt of the company. <q>I had always intended,</q> ſaid he, <q>to let you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

This huſband is provided; and had I not been teaſed out of my plan, you would this day have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your couſin's example. I already begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent my weak compliance with your caprice. A ſtrange weight hangs on my ſpirits. I dread the conſequence of unneceſſary delay: I have yielded but to—what purpoſe can it anſwer; you muſt ere long, give your hand to Mr. Williams; nothing ſhall tempt me to violate the promiſe I have made both to him and his mother; I expect therefore that you will conquer your fooliſh prejudice, and prepare yourſelf to receive him as your intended huſband: Lord Oſſory has, at my requeſt invited him to be preſent at his nuptials, in a few moments he will be here.</q> (I ſtarted and changed colour.) "None of your female airs and graces," continued my father; <q>I am determined not to be trifled with; your fate is determined; I called you aſide in order to prepare you for his viſit: this you muſt allow is acting with all the tenderneſs of a parent; do you in return, act with that ſubmiſſive duty which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a child. You never ſaw the man, therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I was not miſtaken: in a few moments, a tall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aukward figure entered the room, dreſſed with inelegant finery, tho' early in the morning—I was going, my dear Eliza, to repeat the fooliſh compliments he paid me; but I have not patience to dwell on the hated ſubject: his converſation was interlarded with ſcraps of plays, the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:018142_0058_0FA562CE162DC3D0"/>
bombaſt of which, mixed up with his own home-ſpun country dialect, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>formed a moſt ridiculous contraſt, and might truly be called the art of ſinking in poetry. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring breakfaſt, I contrived to make my eſcape to the other ſide of the table, leaving him next to Lady Bab, who was pleaſed with an opportunity of ſhewing her talents for wit and ridicule: ſhe played him off moſt unmercifully, to the great entertainment of Sir Harry, and the great diſpleaſure of my father, who ſeverely chid me with his eyes for having changed my ſeat. Odious as this man appears to me, when viewed in the light of a huſband,—yet, when I conſidered him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected with myſelf, I was ſorry to ſee him made a butt of. Want of ſenſe is the fault of nature; not he that labors under this defect, but thoſe who take advantage of it, are the perſons who ought to excite our contempt. As Miſs Richmond had inſiſted on being married with a ſpecial licence, we had not what ſhe called the vulgar parade of going to church. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve, we retired to the drawing room, where the ceremony was performed by the biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who is related to the family.—The bride ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared perfectly at eaſe while repeating thoſe vows, the ſolemnity of which made me tremble. I ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſteal a glance at Lord Oſſory in his amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble countenance, I beheld all the marks of genuine piety,—with a compoſed and manly voice, he plight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his faith,—it was plainly to be ſeen, that his heart ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded his lips, while he ſwore to live for her alone, till death ſhould diſſolve their union—A ſhivering ſeized me—ah! then, ſaid I, from this moment I muſt tear the dear image from my breaſt,—from this moment to love thee is a crime.—Now then, Harriot kneeling at the foot of the altar, make a ſacrifice of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="unknown:018142_0059_0FA562CE26B48DD8"/>
Aſſiſt me Heaven!—Agitated with theſe pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful emotions, my eyes grew dim, my head grew gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and I ſunk ſenſeleſs on the carpet. When I recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I found myſelf on my bed; my maid ſtood by the ſide of it, and my father at ſome diſtance; I uttered a deep ſigh; he approached, <q>Harriot, child what is the matter with you; your illneſs has thrown a damp over the general joy; you have delayed our journey; Lord Oſſory would not ſet out without you. Poor Mr. Williams is in deſpair; indeed you have greatly alarmed us all.</q>—"I am ſorry for it Sir," replied I <q>but I beg they will no longer wait for me; I am not ſufficiently recovered to make one of the happy party.</q>—<q>But indeed you muſt, my amiable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,</q> cried an inſinuating voice, which I knew to be Lord Oſſory's, <q>this ſmoaky town will never agree with your delicate conſtitution.</q> He advanced and took my hand as he ſpoke this; I bluſhed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of my weakneſs, too haſtily withdrew it, then wept for fear I had betrayed myſelf.—But pardon me, Eliza, I am tireſomely minute; it would fill a quire to deſcribe half the painful emotions—the ſtruggles of my heart, during a day which to me appeared an age. I muſt lay down my pen, not able to hold it any longer; quite overpowered with fatigue, I will throw myſelf on the bed.—How delightful is the ſituation of this houſe, ſo elegant—ah!

                  <p>AT length I return to my favorite amuſement. I have been very ill my dear Eliza. My fever was violent while it laſted. To-day, for the firſt time. I took a ſhort airing, accompanied by my maid. The reſt of the family are too much engaged with their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to dedicate any of their time to a poor, low-ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed invalid: I ought however, in juſtice, to except the amiable Oſſory. Nothing could equal his friendly anxiety for me during my illneſs. Every hour of the day did he call at the door of my apartment to enquire how I did. The moſt ſkilful phyſicians, were, by his order, ſent for from town—my father alſo behaved with a tenderneſs which excites in my breaſt the warmeſt ſentiments of gratitude. But it was my couſin on whom I meant juſtly to reflect, when I talked of being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected: neither her or her friend Lady Bab once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to honor me with a viſit; both violently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of fevers, it ſeems. Such was their excuſe. Mr. Williams, honeſt man, never having been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to think or act for himſelf, did as he ſaw the reſt do. When they expreſſed ſorrow for my illneſs, he endeavoured to look ſorrowful; when they ſent up to enquire after me, he followed their lead, and joined in the ceremony. This account I had from Sally, who added, that he was very aſſiduous about Lady Bab Wilmot. Heaven grant ſhe may have made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of him. I doubt not but her Ladyſhip would ſnap at ſuch an offer, as her rank is much ſuperior to her fortune. I was near a fortnight confined to my room, and ſtill find myſelf extremely weak and languid. My indiſpoſition needed not to have confined me ſo
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:018142_0061_0FA562CFA6E11C18"/>
long, but I wiſhed to be retired: I trembled at the thoughts of being again expoſed to the too attractive graces of Lord Oſſory's converſation. I ſpent my time in endeavouring, by the aids of religion and philoſophy, to cure my heart of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s now criminal weakneſs. I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered myſelf that I had, in ſome meaſure, ſucceeded; and therefore entered the parlour where the company were aſſembled with an air of compoſure, placing great confidence in the ſtrength of my laudable reſolutions. Fortunately Lord Oſſory had rode out to pay ſome morning viſits, and was not yet returned. I found only Lady Oſſory, Lady Bab, my uncle, Mr. Williams, and Monſieur La Fare. The latter ſat by my couſin, tuning her guitar; Sir Harry was engaged at piquet with Lady Bab; and Mr. Williams was amuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with her ladyſhip's netting, at which he is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert. Such was the arrangement of the little party. Lady Oſſory looked like an angel; the country air had given an additional glow to her fine complexion; and her morning dreſs was inimitably becoming. The agreeable Frenchman ſeemed, by the homage he paid her with his large black eyes, to be perfectly ſenſible of her attractions. You muſt permit me to give you a ſlight ſketch of this gentleman's hiſtory. As Lord Oſſory's friend, he deſerves the honor of being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to my Eliza. I know not myſelf the particulars of his ſtory, which, I am told, is uncommonly unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: all I have hitherto learnt is, that he is deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a younger branch of a noble family; that in conſequence of a love affair, he fought a duel, and killed his antagoniſt, whoſe rank and power being ſuperior to his, obliged him to fly his country, where no pardon was to be hoped for; that in leaving his country he was alſo obliged to leave all he had, eſcaping only with his life.—He changed his name,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:018142_0062_0FA562D070219820"/>
and fled to Holland, I think it was at Bruſſels; that fortune, weary of perſecuting him, preſented him with an opportunity of rendering a ſignal ſervice to Lord Oſſory, who was on his travels. Of what nature this ſervice was. I have not yet been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but from that moment the generous young Engliſhman took him under his protection. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his patron hither: as ſoon as they arrived here, Lord Oſſory, whoſe favors are rendered dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly valuable, by the noble delicacy with which they are conferred, made him independent, by ſettling on him a very conſiderable annuity; he lives with his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor from choice; is treated with ſo much reſpect by all the domeſtics, and has ſo much command in the family, that one can hardly tell which of the two is maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. My Lord doats on him: and indeed he is ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo agreeably gay, and in every reſpect ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, that one cannot wonder that he ſhould gain ſuch an aſcendency over his worthy friend. He has, it ſeems, propoſed himſelf, as a proof of his gratitude, to become tutor to Lord Oſſory's ſon and heir, if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould bleſs him with one—a taſk for which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears admirably qualified. For this purpoſe, he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in abridging Roſſeau's Syſtem of Education,—ſelecting what is practicable, and omitting what he and Lord Oſſory think exceptionable. This man is tho't, by the belles of our ſociety, uncommonly handſome: he is very well for a foreigner;—but I muſt own, his chief recommendation to me is, his being honored with the friendſhip of Lord Oſſory. This ſubject has run away with my pen. I was going to deſcribe the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I met with.—Mr. Williams was the firſt who eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. As I entered the room, he ſtarted up, and with ridiculous emphaſis repeated,</p>

                     <pb n="64" facs="unknown:018142_0063_0FA562D1255BF318"/>

                  <l>"Art thou, &amp;c.</l>
                  <p>Then advancing, led me to a chair, and ſwore I looked divinely.—<q>Since you allow her to be a heavenly ghoſt,</q> cried Lady Bab, laughing, <q>your queſtion of 'bring'ſt with thee blaſt from hell,' was needleſs.

                     <q>Mr. Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</q> ſaid Sir Harry, <q>has ſhews great judgment in the choice of a wife; he is a body, and if man and wife become one, he will then alſo have a ſoul.</q> "But I fear," cried Mr. La Fare, with vivacity, <q>that if this match ſhould take place, the apoſtle's ſaying will be reverſed, and the ſpirit will war againſt the fleſh.</q> Then turning to me, he paid me a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with all the eaſy gallantry of a Frenchman, ſaying, that my late illneſs had ſo refined my beauty, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my complexion ſo tranſparently clear, that it was no wonder Mr. Williams miſtook me for one of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial tribe. While every one was thus diſplaying their wit at that poor man's expence, he was, at the expence of my Dreſden ruffles, endeavouring to diſengage his netting pin, which in handing me to a ſeat, he had aukwardly entangled in them. "I uſed to wiſh," ſaid Lady Bab, <q>to have our beaus about town, taught a little needle-work, or netting, to keep them out of miſchief; but I find Mr. Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams has ſuch a happy nack of doing every thing, that the very thing which I propoſed as a remedy, is, in his hands, the cauſe of—</q> "Spare him," inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted La Fare, laughing, <q>for if he ſhould unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately

                  <p>'TIS monſtrous provoking my dear Bab, that your mother ſhould take it into her head to be ſick, at a time ſo unſeaſonable both for yourſelf and your friend—I could cry for vexation: your preſence here is abſolutely neceſſary.—Williams is ſuch an aſs that there is no depending on his conſtancy: ſuch a paſſive ſoul, or rather body, for he has not a ſpark of ſpirit about him, that his mother, when ſhe comes, will, with
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:018142_0066_0FA562D75FAFD8D0"/>
half a word, be able to perſuade him that he never tho't you tolerable,—and that Harriot, againſt whom you had taken ſuch pains to ſteel his heart, is an angel. For ſome hours after your departure, he did not know what to do with himſelf, and was ready, like a great boy, to blubber for the loſs of his play thing; but unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for you, he has at laſt hit upon a new method of making a netting ſhuttle, this entirely engroſſes his tho'ts—and you, poor Lady Bab, may now bind your brow with mournful willow.—He ſeeks only to be diverted; and, honeſt man, every thing has the good fortune to produce in him this effect; a wife, a monkey, a netting ſhuttle, or a Lord Mayor's ſhew, 'tis all one to Ranger.—However, I'll do what I can for you. Luckily Mrs. Williams is obliged to deny her viſit; in that time I do not deſpair of effecting the ſcheme we concerted <hi>enſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>—I have only to perſuade him that he is deſperately in love with you.—he will ſtare no doubt, and perhaps be at firſt a little incredulous, but I ſhall tell him, that I ſee it in his eyes—that people are often affected with that diſeaſe, without being ſenſible of it, and that it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently proves fatal where timely remedies are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. I will every day pretend to diſcover new ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of it, both in his face and perſon.—In ſhort, let me alone to work him to our purpoſe,—if we can but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him of the awe he has for the old lady, he will be vaſtly pleaſed with a jaunt to Scotland, it will, to uſe his own ſtile, be rare fun. How my uncle will fret—that's a trifle,—but I am vexed to death to think, that while I am laboring to promote the intereſt of my friend, I am at the ſame time compelled to do an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſervice to my foe.—Yes Bab, I muſt ever regard my couſin as ſuch, her conduct is a conſtant reproach to mine—ſhe loves my huſband, I know ſhe loves him to diſtraction.—Yet cenſure itſelf cannot find the ſlighteſt
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:018142_0067_0FA562D7F436C2A0"/>
indiſcretion in her behaviour,—ſhe ſtruggles with her paſſion, even to the endangering of her life; her health is viſibly impaired,—ſhe has more ſenſibility than me, yet can ſhe walk ſteadily in the thorny path of virtue.—I cannot bear her ſuperiority—how I ſhall glory in her fall—ſhe muſt—ſhe ſhall be humbled—ſtrong are the temptations that are flung in her way. Oſſory (whoſe heart and mine were never paired above, ſo very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent are the form and temper of our minds) has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for her, what the ſentimental ſoul calls a tender friendſhip.—When I, as is often the caſe, drive him from me by my coolneſs or caprice, he flies to her for conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,—in the mean time I am left at liberty to enjoy the more delightful company of my dear La Fare. There's a man for ye—ſo lively, ſo elegant, ſo formed to pleaſe, ſuch a compleat maſter of the art of love—'tis impoſſible to reſiſt him.—I may ſay with the old Counteſs Marmontel, I am virtuous hitherto—by good luck. Neither of us are troubled with very ſqueamiſh conſciences—we muſt however be cautious. La Fare is under obligations to my huſband: he has too much gallantry to ſcruple making free with his neighbour's wife; but he would not wiſh to appear openly ungrateful. I wiſh alſo to wait till Oſſory ſets me the example. If I can but draw him into the ſnare I have laid for him, I ſhall then think myſelf entitled to the privilege of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern wife: the fear of my expoſing the frailty of his dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

human nature—you was from the firſt the confident of my new paſſion—You have ſeen the dear man at my feet—You have heard his perſuaſive eloquence,—and you have owned, that inſtead of cenſuring our loves, you wiſhed yourſelf in my place.—How I miſs you.—the preſence of a third perſon prevented all ſuſpicion: while you was here, I had a thouſand opportunities of ſeeing him in private; but now, how ſeldom does a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable opportunity offer.—Our enchanting country rambles are no more; a <hi>tete a tete</hi> might give room for cenſure, and a trio was alone ſupportable, with my kind Wilmot.—I am become quite peeviſh,—that unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prude, Harriot, has ſuch a vile pair of penetrating eyes. La Fare was this morning ſo indiſcreet, as to put my hand to his lips, while ſtooping at my knee to lift my handkerchief; he imagined the eyes abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fixed on a piece of embroidery, the fitteſt place for them, but behold on glancing mine towards them, full in my face did they dart a look of mingled ſurprize, pity, and contempt.—Contempt! heavens!—it is not to be borne!—In revenge for this piece of impertinent watchfulneſs, I gave Williams the hint, Harriot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid I, thinks you neglect her—fye, who could expect ſo fine a gentleman as you are, would give room for ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. From that moment till the evening, when Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory came home and releaſed him from the taſk did he peſter the girl with his nonſenſe. When this huſband of mine had paid his reſpects to the reſt of the company, he pranced up to me, offered to ſalute me, and auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly tore my apron with his ſpur. <q>Oh! for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſake,</q> cried I, puſhing him from me, <q>none of your odious pawing; the hated familiarity which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony admits of, is a perfect antidote to love</q>—"'Tis I madam," ſaid he, <q>not the familiarity, that is odious.</q> He retired, and with a penſive air ſeated

                     <q>Not if that huſband expreſſed his fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with as much delicacy as your lordſhip.</q> 
                     <q>I am much obliged to you for ſo flattering a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</q> returned he bowing, <q>but Lady Oſſory has, you find, very different ideas of what you call delicacy: pawing is the expreſſion ſhe thinks fit to make uſe of.</q> He ſpoke with an air of diſdain, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemptuous. I tripped to the harpſichord, &amp; began warbling, "None but fools would marry now, &amp;c." For the reſt of the evening he took not the ſlighteſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of me. He thought, honeſt man, to vex me, by being uncommonly aſſiduous to my couſin: it was the very thing I wiſhed for, as ſhe wholly engroſſed his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. La Fare found a thouſand opportunities of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing (at leaſt by his eyes) the ardent paſſion which glows in his breaſt.

any example. Stop—my good friend—I unintentional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived you, becauſe, alaſs! I was myſelf deceived. Too late my eyes are opened, and I awake from the pleaſing dream. I do not diſſuade you from entering into a ſtate, which I ſtill believe is capable of the higheſt happineſs, tho' I, from an imprudent choice, have failed of obtaining it:—but I adviſe you to beware:—let my fate be a warning to you:—truſt not alone a lovely face, a gentle air:—endeavour, if poſſible, to penetrate the thick vale of hypocriſy, with which the female heart is enveloped; moſt female hearts, I ſhould ſay, for I have found, alas! too late, one lovely, amiable exception: but dazzled with the gaudy blaze of mere external charms, I overlooked, I was blind to the more durable, the more enchanting graces of a heavenly mind.—My wife—my torment as I fear ſhe will prove, has thrown aſide the maſk, and now ſtands confeſs'd, the coquette, the modern fine lady; while her couſin every day diſcovers new attractions.—Fool that I was, to be caught by outward ſhow!—What advantage do we derive from our boaſted reaſon, when our ſenſes ſo eaſily miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead us?

Her health declines.—What an affecting object!—And then to know myſelf the cauſe,—can you wonder if I feel more for her than friendſhip alone could inſpire? My wife's caprice, her mortifying indifference is inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. Short is the reign of mere external beauty; yet ſhe might ever have held me in her chains, had ſhe but have taken the leaſt pains to pleaſe; if ſhe had felt for me a mutual paſſion: ſhe made me believe ſhe did. Artful creature! A heart like her's is incapable of love. I fear ſhe as ſtrongly reſembles her mother in her mind as in her perſon—that wanton libertine, who is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to her ſex. I ſhall not at preſent tell you my reaſons for this apprehenſion; ſuffice it to ſay, that my domeſtic happineſs is at an end. In what gaudy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions did I indulge my imagination! how many plans of future felicity had I formed with the woman, (the angel as ſhe then appeared) whom I adored, and a friend who I believed ſo worthy of my eſteem! How repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly did ſhe talk of a country life, of calm content, and rational joys!—Infatuated wretch that I was, how could I be ſo eaſily deceived? She now laughs at my folly, in ſuppoſing that ſhe would ever ſubmit to be buried in obſcurity,—a perſon who is formed to attract univerſal admiration. She ſickens at the ſight of country ſquires; expires at the ruſtic converſation of their dowdy help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; a murmuring ſtream throws her into the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours; the birds deafen her with their unmeaning notes; ſhe cannot ſupport the fatigue of walking over my parks and gardens; yawns when I talk to her of my intended improvements; can juſt make ſhift to kill the tedious day, by playing at piquet with La Fare; enters into none of my amuſements; hates reading; never touches her harpſichord in my preſence, becauſe ſhe knows I am paſſionately fond of muſic: but I can pardon her this, ſince the ſweet Harriot, with far more taſte, ſupplies her

My affairs here are in the beſt train imaginable-my huſband and Harriot bill from morning to night—I give them every opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they could wiſh—prudes, I trow are fleſh and blood as well as their neighbours—my ſcheme muſt be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; then let me but catch her tripping, and all the joys of unbounded liberty are mine beſides the dear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant triumph I ſhall experience at her fall—Oſſory's mouth will be ſtopped: if he dares to murmur, the world ſhall know the provocation I have received, and his idol, his Harriot's reputation, as well as my own, ſhall be ſacrificed to my revenge; the world will juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify me. What! to be forſaken for one, whoſe charms are ſo inferior! who will wonder, that urged by wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vanity, I ſhould make repriſals?—My uncle ſtorms at the trick you have played him, while his daughter looks upon you as the guardian angel who has ſaved her from ruin. Your double chinned ambling mother-in-law, was at firſt piqued at the diſobedience of her boy, but there is ſomething ſo ſoothing in the name of my daughter Lady Bab, to the pride of your half bred gentry, that it ſoon conquered her reſentment, a conſtant ſimper plays on her full blown features, while

Rivers is now again looking out for a mate for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſeveral neighbouring male creatures have offered themſelves; but tho' he is in a violent hurry to diſpoſe of his troubleſome charge, yet has he ſo much family pride about him, 'tis not every one will go down—mean time Harriot it as gay as a bird eſcaped from its cage: the tender aſſiduity of my honeſt man does not a little contribute to raiſe her late dejected ſpirits—I ſuſpect they have come to an explanation—what the next ſtep may be one may eaſily gueſs.—Do you not marvel to ſee me ſo paſſive in this affair? not a tincture of jealouſy in my whole compoſition—but pride one would think—Lard child!—what ſignifies loſing the affections of a huſband, when one is ſure of being adored, followed, admired, courted by all the reſt of his ſex; this will be the caſe when I get to dear London, or at leaſt you and I will ſhare between us all that we deem worthy of our ſmiles,—at preſent give me La Fare, and take all the reſt.</p>

                  <p>HARDLY is your Harriot delivered from one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, when another commences; and I have reaſon to be much more apprehenſive of the laſt than the firſt.—The ſimple Williams was eaſily governed, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perſuaded to deſiſt from his ſuit: but Mr. Melvill, ah! what ſhall I do with Mr. Melvill?—The moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, the moſt amiable man, next to Lord Oſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I ever ſaw; approved by my father, approved even by myſelf. What objections can I urge?—that I love another,—a married man. I ſhudder at the thought. And yet is not this the caſe? Unhappy guilty Harriot, Guilty! no, my paſſion is free from every baſe alloy; 'tis more tender than friendly; but no leſs pure. My heart harbours not a wiſh in regard to Oſſory, but what I durſt avow to all the world; and yet he has ſuch ſtrong poſſeſſion of that too ſuſceptible heart that I cannot govern its emotions in favor of any other. I will be virtuous, that is all I can anſwer for. My Eliza deſerves unlimited confidence—I muſt tell you—do not too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely condemn me. Lord Oſſory has diſcovered the ſecret I ſo carefully ſtrove to conceal. Think not I made a voluntary confeſſion; O, no! I ſhould have expired with ſhame ere it could have found utterance. My eyes,—ſome little inadvertency betrayed me.</p>

We were alone the other day in the park. What a variety of emotions does the recollection excite! I was too much agitated, too much confuſed at the time to know the particulars of what paſſed; I only remember that he was at my feet; that in the plaintive voice of woe he lamented his wretched <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ate, in having choſe my couſin;—that he now too late found I alone was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make him happy; that he had miſtaken admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for love; love! Which till I inſpired it, was a ſtranger to his heart;—that heart, added he, which heaven has united to your's by the ſtrongeſt ſympathy and ſimilarity of ſentiment.</p>
                  <p>I was ready to have fainted—he ſtarted up, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported me in his arms:—Harriot; my beloved Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, long have I ſeen your virtuous ſtruggles. O! then, cried I, diſengaging myſelf, and hiding my face with my hands—I am compleatly wretched. I cannot, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear that you ſhould deſpiſe me. And yet added I, with a reſolute and rather haughty air,—I will, by my future conduct, put it out of your power. You know the whole extent of my weakneſs; it ſhall go no farther. I own I have not been able to behold you with indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but were you a thouſand times more engaging than you are; were you in the ſlighteſt manner to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume on the diſcovery you have made,—did you dare to offer the leaſt indignity; from that moment I ſhould regard you as the moſt deſpicable of your ſex;—from that moment contempt would be the only ſentiment you would excite.—For your own ſake then, my lord, forget that you are become maſter of my unfortunate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and treat me, as you have hitherto done as a friend.</p>
                  <p>I will treat you as the moſt amiable, the moſt virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of women, interrupted he,—as the friend of my heart.—And here I ſwear, added he, putting one knee to the ground, to reſtrain my paſſion—to reſpect your's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="81" facs="unknown:018142_0078_0FA562E550623E90"/>
to be the guardian of your honor; and forgetting my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſtudy only your peace, your happineſs and fame.</p>
                  <p>I am ſatisfied cried I, giving him my hand, ſo high an idea do I entertain of your integrity,—ſo confidently do I rely on your ſincerity, that all my fears are huſhed to reſt, and I am even pleaſed that we have come to this painful but ſalutary explanation: a load is taken off my heart: now I ſhall act with leſs reſtraint, depending on your promiſe, on your eſteem: you ſhall aſſiſt me to conquer my weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>The appearance of my father and another gentleman, put an end to our intereſting tete a tete. The ſtranger haſtily advanced to Lord Oſſory, who uttering an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of joyful ſurprize, ran to embrace him, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, Welcome, welcome, my dear Melvill, I rejoice to ſee you at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> no other anſwer than that it was very improbable ſo fine a gentleman ſhould think of an inſignificant girl like me. While I ſpoke, Melvill looked back;—I bluſhed gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from that, that I was the ſubject of their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—This bluſh, I fear, proceeded from vanity:—We women are very apt to conſtrue any little notice from the other ſex as marks of admiration. I had no great reaſon to ſuppoſe he would at that time view my perſon in a favorable light:—My morning dreſs was not calculated to ſhew it to advantage;—and had he thought it tolerable, my cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

every becoming ornament, ſo lately eclipſed mine, that I could not doubt but ſhe would efface the tranſient impreſſion he might have received from your Harriot. But, alaſs! my friend, there is no accounting for the caprice of taſte: I find I am miſtaken. This engaging man has already made propoſals to my father, and I every moment dread a declaration of his paſſion. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have taken care that he ſhould not find an opportunity. Lord Oſſory is become exceedingly melancholy:—he ſhuns me and ſeeks retirement:—no doubt Melvill has made him his confident.</p>
                  <p>My couſin rewards us all with ſcrutinizing eyes:—ſhe ſeems diſpleaſed at the latter's aſſiduity to your friend:—her vanity is hurt to ſee any one ſo blind as to give me the preference. Surely ſhe might be ſatisfied with La Fare, who is her ſlave from morning to night; too much ſo, I think, conſidering ſhe is the wife of his friend—or any man's wife indeed.—Stop, Harriot; ah! ſhall you dare to cenſure?—Shall you attempt to pluck the more out of your neighbour's eye, who have ſuch a beam in thine own?—O conſcience! I bow, I humble myſelf under thy juſt reproof.</p>
                  <p>Adieu, my dear Eliza Pray that I may act ſo as to merit the regard with which you honor your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate</p>

in love with that vile, little provoking Harriot.—I tremble for the ſucceſs of my plots—This man has a thouſand attractions, beſides on overgrown eſtate, and a title which will devolve to him on the death of an uncle. O! if the girl ſhould be wiſe enough to take him, I ſhall expire with vexation:—all the gaieties of life will then be in her power:—but what is ſtill worſe, ſhall I ſuffer her to eſcape with unſullied fame?

My uncle, that he may be near to watch over the conduct of his precious daughter, plagues me with his company from morning to night. La Fare dares hardly look at me, for fear of attracting ſome of their vile penetrating eyes:—'tis too much—I die with

                  <p>O MY dear! the day is fixed; urged by my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,—importuned by the moſt generous of
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:018142_0086_0FA562EB76FC3BA0"/>
men, for ſuch Mr. Melvill has proved himſelf: with trembling emotion I gave a reluctant conſent: But ere I ventured to take this important ſtep, I thought it my duty to make the man to whom I am going to unite my deſtiny, acquainted with my weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>From the moment I brought myſelf to regard him in the light of a huſband, I thought myſelf bound in honor to make him my unlimited confidant. Fatal is the conſequence of any ſecret reſerve, any concealment between man and wife!—With inexpreſſible confuſion therefore I revealed to him my unfortunate, my impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent attachment to Lord Oſſory. He ſtopped me ere I had finiſhed the painful taſk, and preſſing me to his breaſt to hide my bluſhes,—No more, my adorable Harriot, interrupted he, you ſhall not be mortified by the humbling confeſſion of an involuntary error: the manner in which you have acted, in ſo critical a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, does you more honor than if you had never been tempted. Your delicate frankneſs to me too in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, proves you be the nobleſt of your ſex. I own I wiſhed you to come to this eclairciſſement; not that you have told me any thing, of which I was not before acquainted; but it would have been inconſiſtent with your character to have acted otherwiſe. Now may I, with undoubted ſecurity, depoſit my honor in your hands, and place unlimited confidence in your's. Now my eſteem can know no increaſe; for I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that you as much excel the reſt of your ſex in virtue, as you do in every other amiable qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My only regret is, that I was denied the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite pleaſure of firſt inſpiring your gentle heart with tender ſenſibility, becauſe firſt impreſſions are always the moſt fervent and moſt laſting. However, give me at preſent all you can, my lovely girl; your eſteem and friendſhip: it ſhall be my unremitted ſtudy to deſerve
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:018142_0087_0FA562EC29851EB0"/>
the reſt.—I offer myſelf to be the guardian of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Hitherto you have nobly ſtruggled in the cauſe of virtue, and I doubt not of your laudable perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But I am ambitious of ſharing with you the glorious taſk, and O! how amply ſhall I be rewarded, if, by my fond aſſiduity, my unbounded love, I ſhould be able, not only to baniſh my rival from your breaſt, but to have the inexpreſſible delight to ſupply his place.</p>
                  <p>This flattering hope induced me to ſolicit your hand, though I knew the mutual attachment ſubſiſting between you and my friend; but then I alſo knew the worth of that friend, and a very little acquaintance with Miſs Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers convinced me that ſhe was far ſuperior to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon run of females;—that ſhe was a treaſure, for the purchaſe of whom one could not pay too high a price; deign then, adorable Harriot, to bleſs me with your hand; but let me not owe it merely to the authority of a parent. Were the man ſingle whom you diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh with your regard, nothing ſhould tempt me to trouble you with my addreſſes. No, I would honor your choice, be he who he would; that choice alone would give him merit; then would I bury my hopeleſs paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at the bottom of my heart:—But Lord Oſſory is married.—Your father will not ſuffer you to remain ſingle—I offer myſelf therefore, to ſave you from one who might be leſs ſenſible of your worth, who might love you with a leſs diſintereſted affection.—Ambitious as I am to poſſeſs your whole undivided heart; yet well I patiently wait, without murmuring, till your can complete my happineſs by that invaluable gift: mean time, I will ſympathize in all your tender diſtreſs, nor claim any thing as a right, but receive every little mark of your regard as a favor:—If on theſe terms my charming girl will conſent to be mine—He pauſed, and fixed his ſenſible eyes on my face;—I caſt mine down, and ſighed.</p>

La Fare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways La Fare, from morning to night: 'tis rather too much, Melvill and he are the only decent beings that are to be met with in this deſart.—I forget Oſſory, but he poor ſoul's a huſband; no wonder I forget him; for we have ſeparate apartments, ſeparate views, and ſeparate pleaſures.—Never did we experience an union of hearts;—we were tacked together by mere human ties.—At which,</p>

He took her hand and bath'd it with tears.</p>
                  <p>I ſuſpected that the drowly draught began to operate, for ſhe either did not make any anſwer to what he had ſaid, or elſe did it in ſo low a voice, that I could not hear her. The candles ſtood on her toilet facing the bed,—he roſe, extinguiſhed one, and placed the other at a greater diſtance; this deprived me of light enough to ſee what paſſed, but for a good while after my Lord continued to talk in a low plaintive tone. Need I tell you the conſequence of all this? Harriot dozed, and left her virtue to ſhift for itſelf. My Lord had long ſtruggled againſt a paſſion that now became too ſtrong for all his reſolutions;—powerful was the temptation, the paſſive ſtate to which his fair one was reduced; can one wonder,—I am ſure I do not. They fell; and now my long threatened revenge is accompliſhed.—In due time I ruſhed into the room, threw open the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,—there, looked in her lover's arms, lay the ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Harriot.—I affected to ſcream, and ſunk, as if faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, into a chair,—Nurſe hobbled to my aſſiſtance;—Oſſory ſtarted from the bed; ſaw me, and claſping his hands, exclaimed, wretch,—diſhonorable villain that I am, what have I done?—O Harriot, my love. I have ruined thee!—he threw himſelf with violence on the
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:018142_0094_0FA562F52B1B9560"/>
floor. Harriot awoke with the noiſe,—ſhe looked wildly round, ſhe had, I ſuppoſe, heard ſome part of Oſſory's exclamation.—She beheld me in a rage, and him ſtretched at his length on the ground;—all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of her ſituation ruſhed to her view; ſhe lay half raiſed on her elbow, one arm extended,—diſtraction in her countenance, ſhe ſeemed converted into a ſtatue, the ſtatue of deſpair. I declare there was ſomething ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying in her aſpect, that ſhe abſolutely made me ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;—for ſome moments I was as little able to ſpeak as the two delinquents; however, I ſoon got the better of my terror, (I believe I might call it my remorſe.) Tis well my lord, cried I, at length you appear in your true colours,—now am I able to account for your indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to me,—long have I patiently borne it;—long too have I ſuſpected this intrigue.</p>

                  <p>She was ſtill in the poſture before deſcribed; but on my thus addreſſing her, ſhe with a mild and humble air bowed her head, as much as to ſay, alas! I plead guilty to the charge: Then caſting a glance at Oſſory,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:018142_0095_0FA562F5ED17EA30"/>
ſhe uttered a faint ſcream, and ſunk inſenſible on the bed. He advanced to ſupport her, but ſtopped ſhort, and folding his arms, gazed for ſome moments in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on her pale face, while deep ſighs heaved his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.—At laſt, you madam, ſaid he, feel an ill natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pleaſure, while you contemplate our diſtreſs; you have the inhumanity to triumph in that angel's fall; becauſe, till this fatal night, ſhe was in virtue, in merit, ſo much your ſuperior. O! Harriot, continued he, in an accent that ſpoke the anguiſh of his ſoul, how could thy Oſſory forget the reſpect he owed thee? How I abhor myſelf! Villain that I was, to take advantage of thy weakneſs;—ah! ſhall I dare to talk of thee in a ſtile ſo debaſing,—of thee, whoſe every thought was pure and ſpotleſs as thy form: There, my Lord, cried I, that will do; I have long enough liſtened to your wonderouſly affecting complaints: Now 'tis time to proceed to buſineſs;—others have, like me, been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, by the ſpecious appearance of that vile hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite; her intended huſband in particular,—be it my taſk to undeceive them,—her reputation ſhall not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live her virtue,—this night was doomed to put a period to both;—yes, I will have witneſſes of the injury you have done me; her father, her lover, the whole world ſhall be acquainted with my wrongs, and her ſhame. So ſaying, I ran to the bell, but he ſeized hold of me, are I could reach it: Go then, ſaid I to nurſe, ſummon the ſervants—call Mr. Melvill. Stir at your peril, cried Oſſory, in a voice that made the beldam tremble: I ſwear, added he, that if either of you dare to attempt expoſing the misfortune of that dying angel, both your worthleſs lives ſhall be ſacrificed to my revenge: ſo ſaying, he went and locked the door, and put the key in his pocket.</p>

My courage began to fail me, terrified at the fierce wildneſs of his air. The man was certainly out of his ſenſes. I condeſcended to ſooth him; he paid not the ſlighteſt attention to what I ſaid: Nurſe was all this time buſy in adminiſtering medicines to reſtore her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but with as little ſucceſs as I found in attempting to quiet my Lord's violent emotions: At laſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his ſpirits were quite exhauſted; he turned to Harriot with a mournful air, gazed a few moments in ſilence, then exclaimed,—yes, ſhe is gone forever, and to me ſhe owes her death: The laſt words were hardly articulate: he claſped his hands, and uttering a deep groan, down he fell, like a tragedy hero, by the ſide of his dulcinea.</p>
                  <p>I now began to be alarmed at Harriot's long inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and feared that La Fare's drug was not of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent a nature as we had imagined, for death was painted on her pale countenance. I ſent for him; he aſſured me, there was nothing dangerous in the draught; he had made phyſic one branch of his ſtudy. I left him therefore to take care of the two inſenſibles while I went in queſt of Melvill; impatient to expoſe the frailty of his idol. I knew the generally ſpent an hour in his cloſet ere he went to reſt; it was now about the time of his retiring thither, for he is as regular as a clock.—I ruſhed in upon him, where, after venting my well acted rage, I told him the particulars of my late mortifying diſcovery.

                  <head>LETTER IX. From the SAME to the SAME.</head>
                  <p>POOR La Fare!—theſe Frenchmen are ſo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: Oſſory and him have had a tilting bout<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are both wounded, but neither dangerouſly, as Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill came in time to part them: Such confuſion reigns amongſt the whole ſet, that I can get no ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the quarrel. La Fare, as the nurſe ſays, ſpoke of Harriot's conduct as it ſeemed to deſerve; my Lord took fire, called him a villain, ſaid it was time to wipe off the ſtain he had caſt upon his honor; your intrigues, your vile ingratitude, is no ſecret to me; but my mind, till now, was too much engroſſed by worthier objects, to find leiſure to inflict on you the puniſhment you merit. Much more was ſaid, as you may ſuppoſe, but nurſe's memory reached no farther: She ſcreamed with all her force; Harriot too recovered her ſenſes, and frantic with terror, ſprung from the bed, and threw herſelf between the combatants. At that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Melvill fortunately made his appearance, the ſcene changed, deadly weapons were caſt aſide, the bleeding Oſſory ſupported the fainting Harriot. Melvill, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſeſpoir,</hi> kneeled at her feet: La Fare was carried to his own apartment by my orders; no one elſe troubled their head about the poor Frenchman. After a proper buſtle, my Lord was alſo carried off the ſtage, inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with loſs of blood. Harriot is replaced in her bed, which, it is believed, ſhe will never quit more; death ſeems to have marked her for his own, in defiance of all his rivals; the expected nuptial bed, will now be exchanged for the ſilent tomb. Poor girl, even from me, her, till now, implacable enemy, ſhe extorts the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:018142_0098_0FA561D47417E448"/>
pitying tear; my enmity reaches not beyond the grave, to which ſhe is haſtening. Bab, I am vapoured to the laſt degree,—there is no bearing this horrid houſe, nothing but ſighs and groans are to be heard;—I'll to dear London for conſolation,—the invalids have a whole college of phyſicians to attend them;—why then ſhould I ſtay, to die of the ſpleen?—</p>
                  <p>Melvill took upon him to break the affair to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,—I don't believe he told him one ſyllable of truth, for he has ſo much of the Roman in him, that, had he intruſted him with the ſecret of his daughter's fall, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I am convinced, could have ſcreened her from his fury. I don't know how it is, but I can't find in my heart to undeceive him;—no, here I ſtop, ſufficient has been my revenge,—if ſhe dies, her diſaſterous adventure ſhall, for me, remain a ſecret.—If on the contrary (but there is little probability of that) ſhe ſhould recover, then indeed, I will not anſwer for myſelf, for no two charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can be more oppoſite, than that of your friend when low, and your friend when high ſpirited.</p>
                  <p>I had almoſt forgot to tell you, that nurſe vaniſhed in the midſt of the buſtle, and has never ſince been heard of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mounted on a broom-ſtick, ſhe took her flight through the air;—the truth is, at leaſt it does not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a doubt with me, that Melvill has got her removed to a proper diſtance, leaſt ſhe ſhould blab. Well, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely he is a worthy fellow; but how does he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſtop my tongue?—there is one method by which he might effectually make me his friend.—Ah! a letter,—from I'Abbe—how has he found me out?—who has undeceived him in regard to my death?—the epiſtle you wrote for me to his ſiſter, has not then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the deſired effect. I dread to open the provoking ſcrawl;—that wretch was born to be my torment.—Adieu, let's ſee what he has to ſay for himſelf.</p>

Your compaſſion for a poor, ruined, miſerable wretch has tranſported you beyond the bounds of reaſon;—your generoſity excites my wonder more than my admiration; when carried to ſuch exceſs, it degenerates into weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—Do you conſider to whom it is that you ſeek to be connected?—'tis not ſimply to a woman, who has forfeited her virtue, but to one whoſe crime is of the deepeſt dye,—adultery.—Oh, heavens! hardly yet can I credit my ſenſes;—what demon poſſeſſed me?—it was madneſs.—But ſtop, Harriot, attempt not to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate thy guilt,—I am loſt, undone, the darkneſs of the grave can alone hide my ſhame: leave me then Mr. Melvill, leave me to the fate I merit,—the world and I can never more be reconciled.

my fall.—Indeed, my amiable friend, (you permit me ſtill to call you by that endearing name) I am not the depraved wretch my conduct ſeems to ſpeak me,—I abhor, I ſhudder at the very thought of the crime, which yet I have committed. O! why ſlumbered my guardian angel, when I was fatally beſet by the powers of darkneſs!—but I perhaps was too arrogant, placed too much confidence in my virtue, therefore was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to fall as a puniſhment of my pride: how effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual is that puniſhment!—I am humbled even to the duſt! the whole black tranſaction appears ſtill to my terrified imagination like a frightful, dream,—I cannot diſtinctly remember any thing that paſſed. Why do I ſeek to recollect it? it drives me to madneſs;—not much longer will my heart be able to ſtruggle with ſuch a weight of woe;—my end approaches, I feel a gradual decline.

Sir, pardon and pity your unfortunate daughter! forget that you have a child; but oh! let not a parent's curſe be added, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm her with miſery. I dare not reveal the cauſe of my flight; I have bid an eternal adieu to the world, and all its deluſive joys: my ſeparation from you, Sir, is the only thing I regret; but alas! I am no longer worthy to appear in your preſence. I am now hid in an obſcure retreat; and here, unknowing and unknown, will I ſpend my few remaining ſorrowful days—You, Sir, may regard me as already dead, for never more will you behold me. Do not hate my memory; faulty as I have been, want of love, of reverence, and duty to my parent, was not amongſt the number of my crimes. From others you will, I doubt not, hear that fatal ſtory which I dare not reveal: ill-nature may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate, but for your ſake, Sir, I wiſh that they would ſpeak of me as I am, "nothing extenuate, nor ſet down aught in malice,"—then, if they take into the account, the ſincerity of my repentance, I would hope that compaſſion would mix with your too juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>YES, Eliza, I have indeed a mother, a mother who has been leſs guilty, but not leſs unfortunate than her daughter. In her ſympathizing boſom. I have da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to pour out my grief; I have told her all my fatal ſtory. She bathed me with her tears.—Alas! even thoſe pure, thoſe precious drops, cannot wipe out the ſtain of my diſhonor; nor can her pardon, her ſoothing pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or her kind maternal care, ſave me from the grave, to that I now make quick advances. I am almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a ſkeleton; my conſumption is paſſed all cure; freſh air and aſſes milk juſt keep me alive, and that is all.—Well might my amiable mother be in doubt, whether or not to claim me as her daughter; nature pleaded for me in her breaſt, or I am ſo unlike the blooming, happy, innocent creature, I was ten years ago, that none but a mother could have known me.</p>
                  <p>Eliza, you have almoſt reached the laſt page of my ſad ſtory; one ſcene more, and you may cloſe the book forever; till that arrives, the intermediate ſpace will be a mere blank: to fill that blank, give me leave to treat you with a melancholy tale, in which my dear mother is the principal character.</p>
                  <p>She is of a noble family, but her fortune was ſmall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nevertheleſs, her perſonal attractions were ſo great, that
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:018142_0111_0FA561E06D0C64F8"/>
even from a child, ſhe was ſurrounded with admirers. My grand-father had a country ſeat near Windſor:—When my mother was about fifteen, ſhe, for the firſt time, made her public appearance at a ball in that town; ſeveral of the Eaton ſcholars were there; amongſt the reſt, Lord W—'s ſecond ſon, a handſome youth: he danced with her, was ſtruck with her beauty, and from that moment became her admirer.—He was not remarkable for interior accompliſhments; but he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered agreeably, and was too gay and too aſſiduous, not to pleaſe a young unexperienced girl, who was hardly out of her leading ſtrings;—they parted with mutual regret;—it was not long ere they met again. At length, in a moſt paſſionate epiſtle, he declared his love; and having no hopes, that either of their parents would conſent to the match, propoſed a jaunt to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land—The lady liked him, but her attachment was far from being ſo indiſcreetly violent as his: ſhe anſwered not his letter; he wrote again:—terrified at the tho'ts of a clandeſtine correſpondence, againſt which ſhe had received ſo many cautions, ſhe prudently reſolved to reveal the whole affair to her mother:—She received the praiſes ſo juſtly merited for a conduct ſo laudable. Her father inſtantly wrote to Lord W—. The youth was ſent on his travels;—a new lover ſoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf to ſupply his place—a lover every way unexceptionable. My mother was not long ere ſhe became ſenſible of the wide difference between Mr. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Mr. W—: She now found that ſhe had never loved the latter, and that the former was the only man who ever had, or ever could make an impreſſion on her heart. In ſhort, with the conſent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all parties, they were married, and for more than three years, nothing could equal their felicity. My father perfectly doated on his charming wife, and ſhe
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:018142_0112_0FA561E128A6B918"/>
almoſt adored her huſband. About ten months after their union, your unfortunate Harriot firſt made her appearance in this world of wretchedneſs.—I became the idol of both, and the more ſo, as for near three years after my birth, there was no proſpect of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>reaſe to their family.</p>
                  <p>At this time M. W—, now Lord W—, by the death of his father and elder brother, returned to England, to take poſſeſſion of his new dignity: neither time nor abſence had weakened his attachment to my mother: he had indeed forborne to write, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but his letters would be intercepted: now, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he flattered himſelf, that every obſtacle was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. What then was his cruel diſappointment, when the firſt news he heard on his return, was her marriage with Mr. Rivers! He raved, ſtormed, and vowed revenge for her inconſtancy; nay, raſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous by nature, he vowed ſhe ſhould ſtill be his, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſtratagem or force! The firſt ſtep he took was to cauſe a report to be ſpread, in order to excite my father's jealouſy, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> my mother had been compelled by the arbitrary will of her parents, to give her hand to one man, while another had poſſeſſion of her heart; he was named as the latter:—Ambiguous and cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hints were dropped in regard to their private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>To corroborate theſe reports. Lord W—, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, made his appearance at Rivers' Park, where he behaved to my mother in a manner ſo daringly indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, that my father, without much ceremony, forbad him the houſe: he thought ſit to put up with this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, the better to facilitate his horrid purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>My unſuſpecting mother rejoiced that they had ſo eaſily got rid of a man, whoſe unexpected viſit had cauſed her much uneaſineſs. From that time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:018142_0113_0FA561E2143EE838"/>
a fatal alteration was viſible in my father's beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; he became watchful and ſuſpicious:—no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger did he return his lady's tender careſſes; no longer was he amuſed with her innocent chearfulneſs. The moſt artleſs of women, was now regarded as the moſt artful. But how was his jealouſy increaſed, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by one of his ſpies, that Lord W—had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up his abode at a farm houſe in the neighbourhood, and that he every night in diſguiſe was ſeen, either in the park or gardens.</p>
                  <p>This villain of a ſpy, as appears from the ſequel, muſt have been a creature of his lordſhip's, though my too credulous father believed him wholly devoted to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt:—to be ſhort, this deluded huſband, one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, roſe early, on pretence of going a hunting; he took leave of my mother, and ſaid he ſhould not be back till evening;—ſhe, as ſoon as he was gone, again compoſed herſelf to reſt. But ah! my dear Eliza, to what miſery did ſhe awake!—a noiſe ſhe heard at the door of her apartment made her ſtart from her peaceful ſlumber; it was bol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed on the inſide, a precaution ſhe had never thought of, but her enemies had done it for her, and ſtrongly did that circumſtance appear to confirm her guilt. Thoſe without, forced it open;—ſhe with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling emotion, drew back the curtains;—by her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſhe beheld the villainous plotter, Lord W—, in his ſhirt, as if he had juſt ſprung from it, and a few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from him, her huſband, his ſword drawn, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible fury in his countenance. She uttered a pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcream and fainted: her fit muſt have continued a conſiderable time, for all was ſilent when ſhe recovered, and none preſent but two of her female attendants, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtracted with deſpair and grief.—She aroſe, in ſpite of the remonſtrances of her women, and hurrying on a few of her cloaths, ran wildly through the houſe,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:018142_0114_0FA561E50C2B0550"/>
in queſt of her wretched, deluded huſband.—She found him in his cloſet, ſtretched at his length on the floor.—She ſprung forward, and falling on her knees by his ſide, exclaimed, O Rivers! my life, my huſband, caſt me not off, I am indeed, indeed I am innocent. She ceaſed, and remained, with claſped hands, ſtreaming eyes, and diſhevelled hair, a ſilent moving ſuppliant. He looked up, and with a fierce air and determined accent, ſaid, Leave me; were an angel to deſcend from heaven, as a voucher for your innocence, I would not believe:—go, let me never ſee you more; fly and hide your ſhame, my diſhonor nothing can hide. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his poſture, ſhe threw herſelf upon him, in ſpeechleſs agony;—he ſpurned her from him, ſtarted up, and haſtily left the room.</p>
                  <p>For ſome time ſhe lay almoſt deprived of ſenſe and motion;—at length, a burſt of tears came to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: ſtill, however, ſhe continued on the ground, and that for ſeveral hours; at laſt the door opened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a maid entered with the reſt of her cloaths; thoſe ſhe placed on a chair, and retired without ſpeaking.—O! then, cried this unfortunate wife, he has indeed abandoned me! A ſpark of reſentment was kindled in her gentle breaſt, at ſuch unmerited cruelty.—This, and conſcious inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, ſupported her ſpirits: She dreſſed herſelf;—the taſk was hardly finiſhed, when my father, with redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled rage in his countenance, again entered the room; toſſed a letter to her.—there, madam, ſaid he, judge if I can about. Go; I will not give you the ſatisfaction of being divorced from the man you hate; but I do not hinder you to join your infamous paramour:—Go, ſince you prefer the ſhelter of his arms, to thoſe of a huſband who adored you: go, lead a life of infamy, ſince it is your choice.—O! Harriot, added he, ſtriking his breaſt, while his voice was hardly articulate,—how
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:018142_0115_0FA561E671DB4A58"/>
have I deſerved ſuch treatment? Why did you deceive me? or rather, why, ah! why am I not ſtill deceived? You appeared to be the gentleſt, kindeſt, lovelieſt of your ſex; a pattern of every female virtue. He pulled out his handkerchief: She kneeled and claſped his knees;—Rivers, my adored huſband, liſten to your injured wife; let me clear my innocence; ſtill we may be happy.—Never, never, exclaimed he, diſengaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; 'tis the laſt ſtruggle of my ill placed love, and now 'tis paſſed:—I tear you from my heart:—Go, take your cloaths, your jewels;—fly, leaſt rage ſhould get the better of my reaſon;—fly, and never let me ſee you more;—read that,—pointing to the letter,—and then judge, if there is a poſſibility of my forgiving you.</p>
                  <p>He left her. She dried her eyes, raiſed them to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, put up a ſhort, but fervent prayer;—it was inſtantly anſwered;—a compoſed ſadneſs ſucceeded the tranſports of grief, which had lately torn her gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boſom, and ſhe felt a degree of fortitude that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuper-natural.

She read and wept,—wept more for her deluded huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, than for herſelf. She took leave of me, and her tears flowed with redoubled violence;—then hurried into her chaiſe—looked back, as Eve did when driven from Paradiſe,—uttered a deep ſigh,—reclined her languid head on her hand, and proceeded to London: there ſhe ſold her jewels; moſt of them were her own before her fatal marriage, being left her by an aunt.—She found herſelf, after ſhe had diſpoſed of theſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding her bank notes, miſtreſs of about five thouſand pounds: this ſhe placed in the funds, reſolved to ſtint herſelf to the intereſt of it, and on no account to receive any thing further from her huſband;—nay, her deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was, never more to ſee any of her relations or friends, but to bury herſelf in ſome obſcure retreat. This melancholy plan ſhe accordingly, as ſoon as ſhe had ſettled her little affairs, put in execution. Chance directed the mourning fugitive to this village.</p>
                  <p>The worthy Mr. Stephens, whoſe wife was then alive, received her as a boarder; with him ſhe has continued ever ſince, except a few weeks which ſhe ſpent in France: having diſcovered that I was ſent there with my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hargrave, maternal affection led her to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.—Ah! why did ſhe not then diſcover herſelf to me?—Nancy, it ſeems, was in the ſecret, but by this too prudent mother, ſworn to keep it. She had the ſatisfaction to ſee me well, and happily ignorant of her diſhonor—having indeed been made to believe, that death had, while I was an infant, robbed me of this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable parent.—She ſettled a correſpondence with my worthy companion, which was regularly continued till the good girl's death;—then ſhe returned to her peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſylum.</p>

                  <p>But let me anſwer the queſtions in your laſt:—firſt, in regard to my torment,—my wife, muſt I call her! She has for this week paſt been ſhut up in her apartment, having firſt given ſtrict orders to be denied to all company:—Her women, I am told, are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily employed in packing up her cloaths; ſhe in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. I foreſee an elopement: if ſhe knew how much I wiſh to get rid of her, ſhe need not take ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to conceal her deſign. She means, I ſuppoſe, to follow her worthleſs paramour, who, the very night you took leave of us, privately left the houſe, though not out of danger from his wounds. With what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude did that villain repay the benefits I had loaded him with! and what a dupe have I been to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended friendſhip!</p>

I am particularly indebted to you, for ſo cautiouſly concealing from Mr. Rivers, the unfortunate ſhare I had in his daughter's—ruin, muſt I call it. But for her own affecting letter to him, her flight might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared only a ſtep taken in order to avoid a hated mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but in it the noble hearted ſufferer hints at her diſhonor; 'tis however, one great point to keep her father from a more particular knowledge of her fatal ſtory.—Did he know the man!—ah! why am I that man!—his wounded honor would prompt him to ſeek revenge: my life is at his ſervice:—There is little me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in being willing to part with what is become a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; but though I would chearfully reſign it, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence might be fatal to him; and I would ſooner loſe a thouſand lives than draw my ſword againſt the father of my ill fated love.—Much therefore, I again repeat, am I indebted to your prudent conduct, to your watchful care, which has ſaved me from ſo diſtreſſing a dilemma. You ſay, that he is now eager to put his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite ſcheme in execution,—I mean his retreat from the world:—miſanthrophy grows upon him—one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder at it.—I, who am ſo much younger, and naturally ſanguine, already ſee life in its true colours, and conſequently am ſick of it: like him, I bid adieu to its empty deluſions. But there is one tree of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs planted in this wilderneſs—fortunate are they who pluck and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I don't, however, imagine, from the character of the lady, that this harmony will be of any long continuance.

                  <head>LETTER XVIII. The SAME to the SAME.</head>
                  <p>A MOST ſurpriſing event has happened, my dear Melvill,—an event, which at firſt threw me into a tranſport of joy,—but already does that begin to ſubſide. I dare not indulge the delightful hope, that I ſhall be freed from my unfortunate engagement:—and if I were, of what advantage would it be, ſince the amiable Harriot, for whoſe ſake alone I wiſh to be reſtored to liberty,—ſince ſhe, that idol of my heart, is loſt? O! that ſhe were now here,—but let me explain this myſtery.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday morning I was ſitting in my library, which has, you know, a view of the road;—I was reading,—often have I recourſe to books,—but alas! how vain are precepts of philoſophy? how ineffectual
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:018142_0122_0FA561ED2B50CE60"/>
to ſooth a grief like mine?—Seneca was in my hand,—but an unhappy paſſion wholly ingroſſed both my head and heart; my eyes were fixed on the road,—I, in imagination, traced my Harriot in her flight,—every cariage that paſſed, ſeemed to be conveying that dear ſuffering angel from my ſight.</p>
                  <p>In this manner was I indulging my woe, when a chaiſe, which drove at a furious rate, attracted my notice: there was nothing in this, which could reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly excite in me the leaſt emotion;—and yet I found myſelf uncommonly agitated: it drew nearer, and at laſt entered my court-yard.—I ſtarted up.—O! heaven, exclaimed I—can it be her? Not a moment was I ſuffered to enjoy this improbable hope.—A young man, of genteel appearance, ſprung from the carriage:—the arrival of this ſtranger excited ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,—I hurried to meet him;—he was at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant enquiring of the ſervants, in broken Engliſh, for Lady Oſſory.—They anſwered, agreeable to her orders, that ſhe was not at home.—I addreſſed him in French;—there was ſomething in his countenance, that, in ſpite of the diſguſt La Fare's treachery had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in me, for his countrymen, prejudiced me in his favor—He returned my civilities with great politeneſs.—I led him into a parlour, for he ſeemed exceſſively fatigued:—When we were ſeated, to my infinite ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, he ſaid to me, You ſee before you, my Lord, one of the moſt unfortunate of men,—a man, injured by you in the moſt tender point. By me!—Yes, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that injury was unintentional: we have both been the dupes of an artful woman; a woman, whom tho' I have reaſon to hate and deſpiſe, my ungovernable heart ſtill fondly doats on. In me, my Lord, behold the diſhonored, the wretched huſband of her, who has, for ſome months paſt, aſſumed the title of Lady Oſſory;
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:018142_0123_0FA561EE0AE71B70"/>
a title to which ſhe can have no claim—ſince, long before ſhe ſaw you, ſhe was mine by the moſt ſacred ties: but, preferring the ſplendor of your rank to my humble ſtation, ſhe forgot her vows,—deceived me with falſe hopes, till ſhe returned to England,—then, ſtill more fatally deceived me, by ſpreading the report of her death. A friend of her's, wrote to my ſiſter on this ſubject, pretending that ſhe did ſo, in compliance with her dying requeſt. Confined to my ſtudies, and ſtrictly watched by an arbitrary father, I had no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of detecting this falſhood. I was inconſolable for the ſuppoſed loſs of a wife whom I adored:—ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent was my grief, that my life was deſpaired of.—I was ordered to the Spa: there I, a few weeks ago, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acquainted with an Engliſh gentleman, who was alſo an acquaintance of your Lordſhip's;—you may gueſs the reſt. The ſudden death of my father obliged me to defer my journey here for ſome time. I am now independent; can inconteſtibly prove my marriage, and have therefore a right to claim my wife: of you, my Lord, I claim her. I am well informed ſhe is in this houſe, though your ſervants have denied her:—but from you, Sir, I expect juſtice.</p>
                  <p>I am only ſorry, returned I, that this wife is ſo little worthy of your affections:—but believe me, Sir, I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to with hold her from you; on the contrary, I am ready <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> is there, though I have not ſeen her for ſome days. The character I have heard of your Lordſhip, ſaid he, convinces me, that I may firmly rely on your honor: go then, Sir, do me the favor to lead me to that fallen angel, whom, infatuated with her charms, I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to worſhip.</p>
                  <p>I leave you, Melvill, to judge my tranſports on this occaſion, for I will not ſwell my narrative with reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:018142_0124_0FA561EEA6484718"/>
or comments: he followed me; but neither in her own apartment, nor in any other apartment in the houſe, was the fallen angel to be found. My gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man began to ſuſpect me of a deſign to rob him of his right; and in conſequence of that thought, aſſumed an air, which in any other perſon, or on any other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I might have been tempted to reſent; but I felt ſo much compaſſion for the poor enamoured, injured youth, that it left no room for any other ſentiment. I condeſcended to expoſtulate, and dropped ſome hints of the treatment I had received from the woman he ſo eagerly ſought;—hints, that one would have thought, might have damped his ardor; or at leaſt were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have convinced him, that inſtead of wiſhing to with-hold her, I ſhould rejoice to quit all right and title to her. My aſſurances, however, did not ſatisfy him: I therefore called up my ſervants, every one of whom, in his preſence, underwent a ſtrict examination: they, one and all, denied any knowledge of her flight. As length, however, intimidated at my threats, or perhaps won by my promiſes of reward, one of her women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the inſtant the ſtranger arrived, her lady, who had ſeen him from her window, rang for her;—that ſhe found her almoſt fainting; but after taking a few drops, ſhe haſtily cried, follow me, and bring that caſket with you. She then deſcended the back ſtairs, and hurrying thro' the park, reached the neighbouring village,—when pulling out her purſe, ſhe gave it to her attendant; charged her not to betray the truſt repoſed in her, nor on any terms to confeſs, that ſhe was witneſs to her flight; ordered her, as ſoon as ſhe conveniently could, without being ſuſpected, to hire a chaiſe, and follow her to town with her cloaths; added, that ſhe would hear of her at Lady Bab Williams's: then procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a man and horſe, mounted behind him, took the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:018142_0125_0FA561F18DB5D3A0"/>
road to London, and was ſoon out of ſight. This intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence was ſufficient for the impetuous Frenchman; he ſtaid not to aſk any more queſtions, only wrote Lady Bab Williams, and the place of her reſidence in town, in his pocket-book, bowed to me and ſprang into his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ordering the man to make all poſſible expedition.</p>
                  <p>And now Melvill, what think you of this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected adventure?—I dare not freely indulge my joy: they were both under age—no conſent of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;—Sir Harry will ſpare neither pains nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to ſet aſide this firſt marriage, and to eſtabliſh mine.—Faint, very faint are my hopes of a releaſe.—Her father acted moſt diſhonorably in concealing from me her elopement from the convent. The ſtory is too long:—I am interrupted.</p>
                  <p>Adieu, my dear Melvill; call at Williams's; I make no doubt, but ſhe would fly to her friend Bab for ſhelter. I am exceedingly anxious to know what will be the iſſue of this affair.</p>
                  <p>Your account of Mr Rivers, gave a deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to my peace:—you, I ſuppoſe, are intruſted with the knowledge of his retreat. May that retreat afford him the tranquility, which he has in vain ſought for in the world;—Once more adieu.</p>

                  <p>THE incloſed letters made me ſhudder! What a ſcene of horror do they diſcloſe!</p>
                  <p>In compaſſion to the ill-fated Aubigny, I inſtantly ſet off for Barnet, that I might, if poſſible, ſave him from the conſequences of his raſhneſs.—I would not wiſh to ſcreen a criminal from juſtice: But the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this melancholy affair, the provocation he had received, greatly extenuated his guilt, and rendered
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:018142_0129_0FA561F405289650"/>
him an object of pity. Alas! my pity came too late; ere I arrived he had finiſhed his part, the tragedy was at an end. I was led to the apartment: the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that ſtruck me, was the body of La Fare; be his crimes forgot, they ought not to outlive their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I heard a deep ſigh, and paſſed on to the bed,—there, in the laſt agonies of death, lay the wretched Iſabella, the fair cauſe of all this miſchief: ſhe was cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed in the arms of her unfortunate huſband,—his eyes were cloſed, and he was totally deprived of ſenſe and motion;—yet, ſo firmly did he claſp her, that the nurſe, who wanted to raiſe her a little, could not diſengage her from him.—'Twas no matter, ſhe was too far gone, nothing could ſave her life.—I gueſſed by the expreſſion of her countenance, that ſhe knew me, but ſhe could not ſpeak;—all ſhe could do, was to turn her languid eyes towards Aubigny;—a tear dropp'd on his pale face;—ſhe then raiſed them to me (now deprived of all their luſtre) with a mournful ſupplicating look, as if to ſolicit my aſſiſtance for him: a deep groan followed that moving glance, which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my heart, and will never be effaced from my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:—that glance was her laſt,—a ſecond groan releaſed her ſtruggling ſoul from its narrow priſon; and her once brilliant eyes were cloſed forever.</p>
                  <p>Our whole attention was now engroſſed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigny.—With great difficulty we unfaſtened his claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands, a ſurgeon bled him, a few drops only iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but his pulſe ceaſed to beat, all remedies were fruitleſs;—he no longer ſtood in need of our aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>What we had miſtaken for a ſwoon, was death:—grief and deſpair had broke his tender heart.—I have ſeen them decently, though very privately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred;—one grave contains the ill-fated pair.—La Fare,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:018142_0130_0FA561F4C8538010"/>
out of reſpect to the memory of Aubigny. I ordered to be placed at the oppoſite ſide of the church:—in death, at leaſt, his Iſabella ſhall be all his own.—Peace be to their aſhes—She who in life, out-ſhone the faireſt of the fair;—ſhe who ſo late, triumphant in her charms, her rank and riches now lies low, her duſt mixes with beggars, and not a ſtone marks out her humble grave.</p>
                  <l>Favor is deceitful,</l>
                  <l>And beauty is vain:</l>
                  <l>A virtuous woman</l>
                  <l>Is a crown to her huſband.</l>
                  <p>Adieu, my dear Melvill: the proſpect of happineſs, which now opens to my view, would be too much for me to ſupport, were it not for the melancholy ſcenes in which I have been engaged.—I could wiſh how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that my joy had received a more moderate alloy.—To-morrow morning I ſhall proceed to London.—The rapturous ſubject neareſt my heart, I defer till meeting: I ſhall then write to Mr. Rivers; he will, I hope, accompany us to the retreat of my love. I am now convinced that my Harriot and I were deſtined for each other. But ah! how fatal were the events, by which our union was to be accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Why hangs this weight upon my heart?—'Tis true, I cannot yet call her mine,—but what now is there to prevent her being ſo?—every obſtacle is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved—O! I will not admit a doubt of my approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing felicity.</p>

                  <p>GRIEF was ſlow in its operations;—joy was forced to come to its aſſiſtance, and now indeed the blow is ſtruck;—the tranſport was too violent: to find myſelf in a great meaſure cleared from a crime, which hung ſo heavy on my heart;—to be claſped in the arms of a reconciled father; to behold at my feet the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, who I have long ſo fondly loved; to be at laſt permitted to indulge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

Adieu!—a long adieu!—This is, I fear, the laſt aſſurance you will receive of your Harriot's love.

                     <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN compliance with the requeſt of your angel friend, (every requeſt of her's was a law to her Melvill) I intended to have given you a minute account.</p>
                  <p>I cannot,—my full heart ſwells to my eyes.—I do not bluſh to own my ſenſibility;—I have wept—I ſtill weep—a Stoic would have been ſoftened at the mournful ſcene, to which I was a ſad witneſs—Poor Oſſory!—that relief is denied him: to fall from ſuch a height of happineſs!—Need I tell you that the lovely Harriot is no more? this I might tell you; but to deſcribe our grief, is not in the power of language!—ſhe alone was calm and piouſly reſigned.—O! how beautiful did ſhe look!—her form ſeemed more than human,—while with placid ſweetneſs ſhe ſtrove to conſole us,—while ſhe kiſſed off a mother's tears, and beſought a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's bleſſing;—but when ſhe turned to the deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oſſory,—ſighs ſtopped the paſſage of her ſoothing voice;—ſhe graſped his hand,—ſhe raiſed her eyes to heaven;—heaven only could ſupport her in ſo ſevere a trial.</p>
                  <p>Why do I attempt it?—No human pen is equal to the taſk.</p>
                  <p>He was forcibly dragged from the lifeleſs body. The firſt tranſports of his grief were terrible:—this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I left him for a moment to the care of his ſervant, while I went to feed my woe by paying a viſit to the chamber of mourning;—there dreſſed in the pale habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments of the dead, lay the now literally angel Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,</p>

                  <l>A drooping lily, wither'd in its prime.</l>
                  <p>I took my ſeat by her bed: I had not ſat long, when in ruſhed my unfortunate friend. The curtains on his ſide were cloſed; he threw them open, fixed his eyes on the corpſe, claſped his hands, and ſtood fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſilent grief, the ſtatue of deſpair;—not a tear flowed—not a ſigh heaved his boſom: at laſt his colour changed, his eyes cloſed, and he fell to the ground in a deep ſwoon. We have reſtored him to ſome degree of life; he breathes, and that is all. I beg leave to ſubſcribe myſelf, with great eſteem,</p>

                  <p>HOW is your unhappy friend, my dear Melvill? Has the exerciſe of travelling and change of ſcenes, in any meaſure produced the wiſhed effect? Is he yet recovered from that alarming ſtupefaction, in which I ſaw him depart—when he appeared a mere machine, moved at our pleaſure?

hearts, than my poor ill-fated Harriot. In this life we muſt not hope for unmixed felicity. Had my love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly girl been ſpared, mine would have been perfect, and I ſhould have deſcended to my grave in peace: ſhe alone is wanting to fill up the meaſure of my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; but let me be thankful for the ineſtimable bleſſings that are ſtill left me,—a wife, whom I have ever loved, at length reſtored to me—pure and unſullied; all my injurious ſuſpicions removed; the ſtrongeſt, the moſt convincing teſtimonies of her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence produced: that villain Lord W—, on his death-bed, confeſſed to Mr. Stephens, who he purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent for, the accurſed arts he had uſed to excite my jealouſy; he expected a divorce would have followed, and that he ſhould by that means become maſter of that amiable wife, of whom my raſh credulity had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me ſo unworthy. This beſt of women conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to be reconciled to me; ſhe has not uttered one ſingle reproach; with pious charity ſhe forgives my paſt cruelty: ſhe is now, if poſſible, more dear to my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ond heart than when I firſt received her to my arms, in all the blooming pride of youthful beauty. What a ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary effect has her example, and the converſation of the worthy Stephens, produced in me? Long have I ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died philoſophy, and from its ſpecious precepts hoped for peace. Vain hope! Fruitleſs remedy for the ills of life; "their force alone religion can diſarm."</p>
                  <p>Here then I fix, and here only can I find a firm an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor for my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>My wife, whoſe will ſhall now be a law to me, is fond of this retreat. I have as little inclination as her to launch again into a tumultuous world: I have, therefore, in compliance with her requeſt, purchaſed a commodious, pleaſantly ſituated houſe, which is not a

quarter of a mile from our preſent habitation. We cannot prevail on Mr. Stephens to live with us: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he ſays, could bribe him to quit his humble cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, wherein he has paſſed ſo many years of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and tranquility. He will, however, be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our welcome gueſt. A more youthful one, but one no leſs worthy, is come to conſole, to wipe off the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ears of a diſconſolate mother, and to ſupply to her the loſs of a dear lamented daughter; the perſon I mean is the amiable Miſs Dudley, the friend and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of my departed Harriot; ſhe is independent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of a large fortune; is naturally of a grave turn; her gentle heart is formed for friendſhip, but ſeems averſe to attachments of a more tender nature: the late melancholy event has added to her penſive caſt of mind.</p>
                  <p>She had let off to pay her Harriot a viſit ere ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your letter: long before would ſhe have given that proof of her regard, but that her friend refuſed till our arrival here, to reveal to her the place of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. The moment ſhe was informed of it, ſhe ſet off, and travelled poſt; greatly was ſhe fatigued;—when I handed her from her chaiſe, ſhe was obliged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port herſelf on my arm;—yet with all her friendly haſte ſhe came too late to receive her Harriot's laſt adieu. She fainted on being told the fatal news;—when recovered, ſhe gave me her hand,—Lead me to her Sir,—burſting into a flood of tears ſhe exclaimed in broken accent,—Yes, Harriot! my ſiſter, my friend, I will cloſe thine eyes.—My child had juſt been placed in her coffin;—the ſerene ſmile of innocence rendered her lovely even in death.—The moment we entered the room, Miſs Dudley haſtily quitted my arm, and ruſhed forward; ſhe wrung her hands in an agony of grief, while her ſtreaming eyes were fixed on her friend?—
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:018142_0136_0FA561FE6B6EFCF0"/>
at length, uttering a deep ſigh, ſhe threw her arms round the coffin, and laid her cheek cloſe to her's;—ſobs choaked the paſſage of her voice; at laſt,—Not one tear only, my Harriot, raiſing her head,—O, no! my eyes ſhall never ceaſe to flow!—in retirement will I bury myſelf, till thy grave receives me. You will not deny your Eliza a place by your ſide?—there will I join thee, my ſweet companion,—my friend,—how benign is the air of that pale face!—ſo have I ſeen thee look, when liſtening to a tale of woe;—the tears with which I have bedewed thee, ſeem thine own.—Such were the gentle drops that pity has often cauſed to flow;—but where is that dimpled ſmile of innocent vivacity, with which you uſed to enliven our little parties?—Alas! long, long has mirth been a ſtranger to my Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot's breaſt,—and now it is for ever baniſhed from that of thy friend. Thy voice is ſtopped, my love; but I know what would have been thy laſt requeſt, Comfort my mother,—ſupply my place. Yes, Harriot, that late-found amiable mother ſhall be mine;—we will mix our tears, and talk of thee for ever. And now farewel, farewel my angel friend,—daily will I viſit thy grave.—not a weed ſhall be ſuffered to grow near thee; thou withered roſe, untimely cropped by the rude hand of death. One kiſs more. While ſhe ſpoke, my diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate wife entered the room; there is a ſolemn dignity in her grief, that is not to be diſſembled.—Eliza ruſhed into her arms, and ſobbing, exclaimed,—O Madam, let me, let me be your child; I am an orphan,—receive to your protection the friend of your Harriot.</p>
                  <p>Such ſcenes as theſe loſe by the recital; to feel their force you ſhould have been preſent; but I cannot wiſh you had at this; it was too affecting.</p>
