            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have been often sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to consider, how I have been unaccountably governed by various Views &amp; Motives, &amp; successively led on from One to Another till they all intirely vanished but the Prospect &amp; Love of My <hi>Country.</hi>

                     <pb facs="unknown:001996_0003_0FBA4D8B346EC678"/>MY Reception into My <hi>Native Country</hi> with so great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect &amp; Affection I must account to be One of the happiest <hi>Scenes</hi> in all My Life. I was so young &amp; unknown when I left it, that I had hardly contracted any other Acquaintance than among my contemporary <hi>Students</hi> at <hi>Colledge:</hi> And I had spent such a Series of Years abroad, as I thought They had almost lost their Affection &amp; Remembrance of Me. It must therefore needs be a surprizing &amp; inexpressible Joy to find Myself at my Arrival embrac'd &amp; surrounded with Numbers of Friends, &amp; many that seem'd to know Me at Once, tho' They never saw Me before. I cou'd not forbear imagining Myself as Happy as the <hi>Roman Orator,</hi> if the Reader will forgive the bold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, when He returned to <hi>the City</hi> in Triumph; Tho' I dare not speak as He, That <hi>the Pleasures of that single Day were almost preferable to Immortality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT as there is an unavoidable &amp; perpetual Succession of Delight &amp; Trouble in Humane Life; I quickly found that I must exchange my Scenes of Diversion &amp; Pleasure into the contrary Scenes of Care &amp; Business. And these have surprized Me as much as the other.</p>
                  <p>THE sudden Invitation of so desirable &amp; considerable a Church &amp; Town as <hi>Hingham</hi> within <hi>Eight &amp; Forty Hours</hi> of my Landing &amp; their Call in a little Time after, together with <hi>Yours</hi> at the same Conjuncture and the Motion of <hi>Another,</hi> for which I bare a peculiar Esteem and Affection, as well as to Their most Reverend, Pious &amp; Learned <hi>Pastors,</hi> must needs involve Me in the greatest Perplexities, &amp; astonish my Mind.</p>
                  <p>I COU'D hardly imagine Myself duely Qualifyed for the Ministerial Office, &amp; shou'd scarcely have ingaged in it, were it not for the Perswasion of Others, &amp; the repeated Call of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence by so many Churches. I had denyed the Sollicitations of <hi>Two</hi> in <hi>England</hi> before; Of <hi>Battisford</hi> &amp; <hi>Combs</hi>

                     </note> on the Borders of <hi>Cambridgshire</hi> and <hi>Essex.</hi> I was now therefore seized with Fear, lest <hi>GOD</hi> who knew My Unfitness &amp; Sin, shou'd over-rule these extraordinary Things for my utter Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The Anxiety &amp; Distress of my Soul has been beyond Expression: And with a Concurrence at the same Conjuncture of various other Extraordinary Temptations &amp; Troubles wou'd have overwhelm'd &amp; sunk Me without a Divine Support: As
<pb facs="unknown:001996_0004_0FBA4D8E039684A0"/>
indeed they have made such unusual Impressions on Me, that I have not yet intirely recovered that Sedateness of Temper which I thank <hi>GOD</hi> is so Natural to Me, &amp; had been a firm &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Proof against all the Difficulties of my Preceeding Life.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE spoken of some of these Things already in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to Your Call &amp; the succeeding Discourse, Together with the Principal Motives that determined me to Enter into the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Office, &amp; to Accept of Your Flock for My Peculiar Charge.

                  <p>BUT if You can bear Me with Patience, I wou'd now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to offer a few Things more before I conclude.</p>

To this Account, I have learned from Those that were acquainted with Him, That He was a Person of great Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Meekness &amp; Sweetness of Temper.

                  <p>HIS Successor was the Reverend Mr. <hi>Willard,</hi> the Learned <hi>Vice-President</hi> of <hi>Harvard Colledge.</hi> We were all acquainted with Him, &amp; shall ever revere his Memory.

I shall never forget His admired Expositions Twice a Week in the <hi>Hall,</hi> His Gracious Deportment, nor the copious, exact, &amp; pathetical Prayers He as frequently poured out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Us. I must ever Remember Him with peculiar Esteem &amp; Gratitude for the Heavenly Gravity, Condescention &amp; melting Affection wherewith he treated me in my tender Years, when he took me aside at <hi>Colledge</hi> to incourage &amp; direct me in the Affairs of my Soul. He was settled among You on <hi>April 10. 1678.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sewall</hi> &amp; <hi>I</hi> were Two of the last who received their <hi>Degrees</hi> from Him, which was on <hi>July 2. 1707,</hi> &amp; He dyed the <hi>12</hi>th of <hi>September</hi> after, at <hi>68</hi> Years of Age.</p>
                  <p>IT has been my great Unhappiness &amp; Sorrow, that I was never in Company with the Reverend Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Person who follow'd Him, Before I went out of the Country I have often heard him with the greatest Admiration &amp; Pleasure; methought he spake like a Flaming <hi>Seraph.</hi> Upon my Return I find he has left as Great a Character for Superior Abilities &amp; Universal Learning as any that have gone before

Him. The Reverend Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> &amp; my Reverend <hi>Colleague</hi> have drawn it in its lively Colours in their Funeral Sermons. It is a very Grateful &amp; Singular Honour to have the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; excellent Remains of His inclos'd in the same Cover with Mine. He was Ordained among You on <hi>August 28. 1700,</hi> &amp; Deceased <hi>February 13. 1716,</hi> at <hi>45</hi> Years of Age.</p>
                  <p>WHEN I consider of My standing up in the Room of such extraordinary Persons as These, &amp; in One of the most Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Honourable, Learned and Judicious Auditories I know in the World; It must needs Surprize Me with Shame and Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and throw My Mind into a great Degree of Consternation &amp; Terror.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER, in the midst of all My Distress, I must own that thro' the over-ruling Wisdom &amp; Goodness of <hi>GOD</hi> I am now settled in the Happiest Country &amp; in One of the Delightfullest Towns upon Earth. It is an invaluable Priviledge that I now <hi>Here</hi> enjoy, In living among such Numbers of Persons of every Order that so illustriously shine in Piety, Justice, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; Social Virtues. It is a singular Advantage which I could hardly find any where-else, to be fix'd in a Constellation of such Eminent Ministers, united in the same Design &amp; Affection: Three of whom have done Me the Honour to accompany Me in the following Pages, and for their various Excellencies I find are justly Renowned &amp; Esteemed abroad.</p>
                  <p>I MUST likewise admire the same over-ruling Wisdom &amp; Goodness, in settling among you about <hi>Five</hi> Years before, Mr. <hi>Sewall</hi> Your Reverend Pastor, My Classmate, the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of My Youth, and one of My Dearest &amp; most Intimate Friends at <hi>Colledge.</hi> As this has been a very powerful Incentive and Incouragement to Me to submit &amp; associate with Him in the same <hi>Ministerial Service;</hi> So it seems to be a most hopeful Foundation, if <hi>GOD</hi> is pleased to continue Our Lives, of the greatest Advantage &amp; Pleasure. Our Nearness of Age, Our Conformity of Inclinations &amp; Principles, Our long &amp; early Acquaintance &amp; Friendship, the peculiar Communion &amp; Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, wherewith We have often unbosom'd Our Souls; and especially the Raising Our Respect and Affection on the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>Basis</hi> of Religion &amp; Virtue, does already support &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Me to proceed in My Work, and afford Me the lively Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of so much Happiness as I am sometimes afraid is too great to be looked for, or not long enjoyed in this evil &amp; changeable World.</p>

                  <p>THE Apostle founds the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of the <hi>Peoples Duty,</hi> upon Their <hi>Spiritual Rulers</hi> awful &amp; important <hi>Office</hi> &amp; Concern for Those committed to Them: And <hi>every Word</hi> He uses is exceeding cogent &amp; emphatical.</p>

                     <p>IT does <hi>Not</hi> imply as if the Care of Your Souls were so devolved on Your <hi>Ministers,</hi> as to relieve or excuse <hi>You</hi> from the Care of them. <hi>Your</hi> Care of them is never a whit diminished by Your <hi>Ministers</hi> taking the Charge of them. <hi>You</hi> are rather obliged to take the greater Care of Your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; or the Care of Your <hi>Ministers</hi> may be vain &amp; fruitless to You, &amp; only serve to enhance Your present Sin, &amp; Your future Doom &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> ascribe the Creation of the Ministerial Office to GOD, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6.

according to it in an inferior Office, in <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3—6. They directed the People to choose Their <hi>Deacons,</hi> in Their Presence; &amp; then the Apostles ordain'd Them.

                     <p>IN a <hi>Literal</hi> Sense, Your Ministers are many times to keep awake &amp; watch &amp; study for your Souls Salvation, &amp; deny Themselves the Rest &amp; Ease that You enjoy.

                     <p>THE Ministers of CHRIST are not then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge Themselves in Negligence or Ease: But attend on Their Charge with a wakeful &amp; lively Spirit.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Reader</hi> is desir'd to observe, That the following <hi>Discourse</hi> is published from the first and rough Draught of the Reverend <hi>Author,</hi> and wants his finishing Hand to have been put to it; Which Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage if it might have had, it would doubtless have appeared more Correct in <hi>Style</hi> &amp; <hi>Diction,</hi> &amp; with <hi>Enlargements</hi> in some parts of it, which I suppose it had in the <hi>Delivery</hi> of it. But especially I am prone to think, <hi>He</hi> would not have let it go out of his hands without directing the Reader to the particular <hi>Pages</hi> of the <hi>Authors</hi> whom he names &amp; refers us to. Yet as it is, whoever attentively reads it, &amp; knew Mr. <hi>PEMBERTON,</hi> can't but discern evidently here his strong and masterly way of <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Writing,</hi> his close and nervous manner of <hi>Reasoning</hi> and <hi>Arguing,</hi> and that the <hi>Discourse</hi> is worthy of his known <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> and excellent <hi>Judgment.</hi> So that I hope I have done an Honour to my deceased <hi>Friend,</hi> as well as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Honour to my <hi>Country,</hi> in transcribing it for the Press, and shall please &amp; oblige many.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Wish</hi> is, that we could recover, and that the <hi>Publick</hi> might enjoy more of the <hi>Valuable Discourses</hi> of this <hi>Great Man:</hi> But alas, he carry'd the mighty <hi>Stores and Treasures</hi> of his laborious Studies in his own vast Mind, and for the most part wrote only

Hints to himself, to be Enlarg'd on in the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi> which he wonderfully perform'd. So that as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks of the <hi>Princes</hi> of the Earth, we may say here, <hi>In the day that his breath went forth, and he return'd to his Earth, in that very day his Thoughts perish'd:</hi> Saving those few which he has left in Print, and more I trust graven on the Hearts of many by the finger of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>May the <hi>DIVINE SPIRIT</hi> bless what is here publish'd for the <hi>Enlightning</hi> and <hi>Establishing</hi> many in the <hi>present Truth:</hi> And may the Spirit of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Meekness</hi> that breaths every where thro' the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Argument</hi> and adorns it, rest upon all Christians in their <hi>Researches</hi> after Truth and <hi>Defences</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>I desire also to add my thankful Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Divine Goodness, which has return'd Mr. <hi>PRINCE</hi> to us to stand up in and fill the place of the <hi>Deceased;</hi> at whose earnest desire and instant Motion it is that <hi>this Discourse</hi> now sees the light, and accompanies his own <hi>Ordination Sermon</hi> to the Press: And while he thankfully takes up this Skirt of the <hi>Mantle</hi> of his Ascended <hi>Predecessor,</hi> may he with a double Portion of his Spirit enter into his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; always bearing in mind those Words of our <hi>LORD JESUS, I must work the Works of Him that sent Me while it is day, the night cometh wherein no man can Work.</hi>

                  <head>A DISCOURSE, To Prove that ORDINATION By the Hands of the <hi>Presbitery,</hi> Is Valid and Regular According to <hi>Divine Institution.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS <hi>Audience</hi> cannot but be Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that the design of this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Assembly</hi> is to Seperate <hi>One</hi> to the Service of GOD in the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the Gospel of his dear SON, by Solemn Prayer, and the <hi>Imposition of the Hands of the Presbytery.</hi> And I cannot but apprehend it proper and Seasonable to preface this <hi>Solemnity</hi> with some brief Account of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the present Sacred Action, and of the <hi>Grounds</hi> on which we apprehend that we regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to Gospel Rule are attending on it.
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001996_0088_0FBA4EC09F7CB310"/>
And this I shall endeavour to do with all due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Godly and Learned,</hi> who may see things in another light; and without offence to any, unless such as are for stretching or cutting all men to their own Measure. This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I at present apprehend necessary, as we are <hi>Accountable</hi> peculiarly for such publick Actions to GOD and Man.</p>
                  <p>I shall proceed herein gradually, in these steps,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. It is not to be disputed but that <hi>Christ</hi> has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>a standing Gospel Ministry</hi> in his Church, to continue to the Consummation of all things. It was not a Temporary Constitution, but a Standing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that there should be in all Ages of the Church an order of men to represent his Person, publish his Laws, exhibit the Promises, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Seals and Censures. This seems evident to a Demonstration, from the Promise of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Presence</hi> to be with his Ministers to the End of the World, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20. In that the <hi>Reason</hi> of such an Institution of Men to this Service will continue. Their <hi>work</hi> will: The <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is to be administer'd till Christ shall come: Christ's Church needs such Ministrations: for the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Spiritus Sancti,</hi> such a Dispensation of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> as shall supercede the Use of Ministry and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, is not to be expected till Christ shall come in the Clouds, when the <hi>Lamb</hi> himself shall be the Light and Glory. Agreeably we have the End and Duration of the Gospel Ministry stated, Eph. 4.12, 13. <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, till we all come to the Unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the measure of the Stature of the fulness of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:001996_0089_0FBA4EC2763C6640"/>II. It is most evident that those who are to serve God in the Ministry of his Gospel, <hi>must be duely Authorized to discharge the Office of a Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> This Honour no man must take to himself but they that are called. The <hi>Apostles</hi> Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion implies a vehement Assertion; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How can one preach unless he be sent?</hi> God has not left this Work of the Ministry in common, but within a Sacred Inclosure, which can't be broke over without the Efforts of a <hi>Corah</hi>-like Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Now We are to observe <hi>two</hi> things necessary in Ordinary cases to intitle any to the power of the Ministerial Office; <hi>viz. The Power it self,</hi> and the <hi>Investiture</hi> whereby they are regularly authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to the Exercise of that Ministerial power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These</hi> must be distinguish'd; for want of which confusion follows. The <hi>Power</hi> comes alone from the <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> by his Commission given in the Gospel to all Ministers. The <hi>Investiture</hi> is only requisite unto the regular Exercise of that power which is given by Christ's Commission. And the Distinction may be Illustrated by para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel Cases among men. Thus particularly the <hi>Mayor</hi> of a City, his Power is one thing, and his regular Introduction into the Exercise of it, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The people or <hi>Burgesses</hi> ele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ce.</p>
                  <p>So in the Case before us, — The whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Gospel Minister is from <hi>Christ</hi>: for that Charter in the Gospel in which he institutes such an Order of men states their Work, and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and appoints what power shall belong to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001996_0090_0FBA4EC4D63F8A98"/>
their Office. And it is not in the power of any men to institute a new Office. They can't alter their Work, nor require other Qualifications than what Christ has stated: for that wou'd be to encroach upon the Authority and Governing Wisdom of <hi>Christ,</hi> the great Lawgiver of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And hence it follows, that it is not the <hi>Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ordainers</hi> that can determine what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a Gospel Minister is invested with. When he is introduced into the Office, he has all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that by the Gospel belongs to that Office. For the Minister is not <hi>of</hi> Men; tho' <hi>by</hi> Men; as those that invest regularly with that Authority.</p>
                  <p>Now the Investiture is by Persons authoriz'd by Christ hereto; whose Business only is <hi>designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re personam,</hi> to signify that the Person offering himself to the Ministry has Gospel qualifications for it, and being willing to Dedicate himself to it, and having Opportunity for the exercise of it, is Commissioned by Christ, approved as such, charged and commended to the Grace of God. They declare according to the Grace of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, it is the Will of Christ the great Lawgiver of the Church, that the Person Ordained should officiate in the Sacred Function, and be under the solemn Bonds and Obligations, &amp; endowed with all the Priviledges and Power that belong to the Office. The Person thus qualified has a Right <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>: A right to be admitted, — and the Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can't be deny'd him. It is not at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of men to deny it.</p>
                  <p>This Investiture is received in <hi>Ordination,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according to Scripture precept and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And no man, how qualified soever for the Work, can regularly exercise this right &amp; power
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001996_0091_0FBA4EC5E298CBD8"/>
in ordinary Cases (I meddle not with Cases of Necessity) till he is regularly Introduced into the Ministry and Invested. Now according to Gospel Order a Minister receives his Investiture by being <hi>separated</hi> to this Work by the Imposition of Hands and solemn Prayer, by which he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Grace of God: Which <hi>Separation</hi> by the approved Ceremony is to be performed regularly only by such as Christ has given a right and power thus to separate and ordain to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Office.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore these <hi>three</hi> things are necessary,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Solemn Prayer,</hi> by which the Presence of God with them, and his Acceptance of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, is implored. So we find <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> were recommended to the Grace of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> which is a <hi>Sacred Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> used in the setting a Person apart for the Discharge of a Sacred Office. This Ceremony we find used in Scripture on various Occasions. 1. <hi>As a Rite of Benediction.</hi> So <hi>Jacob</hi> used it when he blessed <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasseh.</hi> And so our <hi>Saviour</hi> on the Children when he blessed them. Sometimes in <hi>Conferring Miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Sometimes for working, <hi>Miraculous Cures.</hi> But chiefly as a <hi>Rite of Consecration,</hi> whereby a person was dedicated to the Exercise of a Function, which immediately related to the Service of God. So <hi>Moses</hi> laid his hands on <hi>Joshua</hi> before the whole Congregation, and gave him a Charge, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.23. So the <hi>Apostles</hi> used it in Ordaining Deacons, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had hands laid on them, when separated
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001996_0092_0FBA4EC7821E30C8"/>
to the Work, to which God had called them. And so <hi>Timothy</hi> was separated, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This</hi> was not borrowed from the Ceremonies of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> or <hi>Temple</hi>; for the <hi>Priests</hi> were not consecrated by that Ceremony; but from the <hi>Synag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>e,</hi> where their <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> were set apart to their Work by Imposition of Hands. And there is an admirable Conformity between the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and the Constitution of <hi>Christian Churches</hi>; as may be seen in <hi>Blondel, Vitringa,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lightfoot, Stillingfleet,</hi> and <hi>Basnage.</hi> However this Ceremony is now Introduced into the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, and it is requisite in the Ordinary Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of a Person to the Work of the Ministry, and may not be despised or neglected without Sin. And hence we have <hi>Gospel Examples</hi> of its Use, and the <hi>whole</hi> of Ordination is sometimes expressed by i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> thing requisite in an Orderly Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the Ministry is, <hi>That this Investiture be made by those that have Authority from Christ to Ordain.</hi> Which Power of Ordination must come from Christ. And such as have not a Right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in their Office to Ordain, may not presume to do it. For as it is Christ's Will manifested that tells Us who shall be Ordained, so who shall have power to Ordain. This is therefore necessary to a regular Investiture in the Ministerial Office, that it be performed by such as have been delegated by <hi>Christ</hi> to this Work.</p>
                  <p>Now here the <hi>Great Question</hi> is, Who these are? And this will be consider'd under the next <hi>Assertion,</hi> to which we pass,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001996_0093_0FBA4ECAAD96BEF0"/>III. That we cannot but Apprehend that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of Christ, <hi>Gospel Presbyters or Elders, the Ordinary standing Ministry of the Gospel, who have Power to preach and dispence the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have power to Ordain, and admit Persons sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably qualified and called into the Ministerial Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Grounds</hi> on which we build this <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion</hi> are, — That we are satisfied that we have <hi>Scripture light</hi> to direct Ordinary Ministers in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining — That we have nothing in Primitive or later <hi>Antiquity</hi> but what may be reconciled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and much to confirm this Practice, — That there are no <hi>Pleas</hi> we can find against it which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of sufficient force to invalidate it — And that there will certainly great <hi>Inconveniences</hi> and <hi>Mischiefs</hi> to the Church of God follow from a denyal of this power to Ordinary Presbyters.</p>
                  <p>Something I shall offer to each of <hi>these,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>We are satisfied that by Scripture light the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Ministers or Presbyters have power to invest others with Ministerial Authority.</hi> And from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> we have such <hi>Reasons</hi> as these to confirm our Assertion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Presbyters</hi> or the <hi>Ordinary Ministers</hi> of the Gospel appear to have this Power, <hi>in that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Christ, by which any that are supposed of a Superior Order Degree or Character do ordain, doth certainly belong to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They that have power to ordain must have it from <hi>Christ,</hi> by his Commission. Where now shall we find this <hi>Commission?</hi> We must look to the <hi>Time after Christs Resurrection</hi>; for before there was no <hi>Officers</hi> appointed, nor any Christian <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001996_0094_0FBA4ECEC2204FC0"/>
gathered. Now there are <hi>two Places</hi> which are pleaded to contain this power of Ordination, not expresly but implicitly. John 20.21, 23. <hi>As my Father hath sent me, even so send I You: Whose soever Sins ye remit, they are remitted to them.</hi> The other is, Math. 28.19, 20. <hi>Go t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, baptising them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o I am with you always, even unto the End of the World,</hi> Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n. Now <hi>these</hi> belong equally to Presbyters or Gospel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. It is by this they <hi>Baptise, Preach,</hi> &amp;c. and by these the <hi>Opponents</hi> to our Assertion do assert <hi>the power of Presbyters to remit and retain Sins.</hi> Now if the <hi>Commission</hi> belongs to 'em it must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to 'em in its full power, unless Christ has li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited them. And this Limitation we demand. If Christ hath not limited, none else have power to limit their Comission. Either therefore they have by this Commission no power to <hi>Baptise</hi> and administer the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> or they have power to <hi>Ordain.</hi> For the power of an Office must be taken from the Commission which impowers to the Discharge of it.</p>
                  <p>And this is owned by Several of a great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and name in the <hi>Establish'd Church</hi> of our Nation. So Dr. <hi>Forbes</hi> in his Discourse of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y</hi> says, that Presbyters have the same power to Ordain by Divine Right, as to preach and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise. And Dr. <hi>Charlton</hi> in his Treatise of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction says, The power of Order is given alike by Christ to all Bishops and Priests in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration. So Dr. <hi>Field</hi> of the Church. And it was a Celebrated Saying of Dr. <hi>Usher,</hi> that <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis est Ordinare.</hi> Presbyters therefore having the power of Order, have the power of Ordination.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001996_0095_0FBA4ED38F1D52E0"/>2. A second Reason is, <hi>Because we cannot find in Scripture the Institution of any standing Officer in the Church of a Superior Degree or Order to that of Elders, or Ministers of a particular Flock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read indeed of <hi>Apostles, Evangelists, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>; but these were Extraordinary Offices, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with extraordinary powers, and had an extraordinary Call. But these ceased with the extraordinary Circumstances of the Church of God, which then called for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> do in Scripture evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear the same. Were <hi>Bishops</hi> of a Superior degree or Office we must surely discover it by distinct <hi>Names</hi> or by distinct <hi>Qualifications</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of them, or by different <hi>Work</hi> assign'd them; by a different <hi>Commission</hi> given them, or by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Ordination and Consecration. But we find nothing of this upon <hi>Scripture</hi> Record. The same Office and Officers are promiscuously styled <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. The Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi> are termed <hi>Bishops: Take heed to the Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers: i e.</hi> Bishops, in the <hi>Original.</hi> So the Elders of <hi>Philippi</hi> are called <hi>Bishops,</hi> Philip. 1.1. Now <hi>these</hi> must be <hi>Elders</hi> and not <hi>Bishops,</hi> because there could not be more than <hi>One</hi> Bishop in a Church according to the Scheme of our <hi>Opponents.</hi> Moreover, The same qualifications are required: See <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5—9. the same Work is assign'd to them: the <hi>Elders</hi> are to take the Oversight of the Flock and to do the Work of a Bishop: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>The Elders which are among you, I exhort, — feed ye the Flock of God which is among you, taking the Oversight thereof, — not as Lords over God's He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, but being Ensamples to the Flock.</hi> The
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001996_0096_0FBA4ED4CFF90510"/>
word is <hi>Episcopountes.</hi> Again, We find no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in their Commission, Consecration or Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We have a Directory for the Ordination of <hi>Elders in every Church, Tit.</hi> 1.5. But none for the Consecration of <hi>Bishops</hi> to a Superior Office. Nay we want a <hi>Scripture Canon</hi> for any ordinary standing Officer to rule <hi>Presbyters.</hi> And we have no shadow of a Command to <hi>them</hi> to subject themselves to any standing Superior Degree or Order of Officers.</p>
                  <p>So that we can't but conclude <hi>Scripture Bishops and Elders</hi> to be of the <hi>same</hi> Order and Degree in the Church; and that either there is no <hi>Elder</hi> as a Minister of a particular Flock, or no <hi>Bishop</hi> as Superior to an Elder. And this made Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> say, "There were no <hi>Presbyters</hi> of an Inferior Order instituted by the <hi>Apostles</hi>: and Dr. <hi>Stilling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>leet</hi> on the Contrary, "That there were no <hi>Bishops</hi> during the <hi>Apostles</hi> life. And a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Officer without an Inferior under him, or an Inferior without a Superior over him, comes to one and the same. And if there be no Officer Superior to Ministers, then Ministers have <hi>the Authority to Ordain,</hi> if there be <hi>any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Reason is, <hi>Because they that have Authority to exercise the power of the Keys, and are consequently Rulers in God's Houshold, have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Ordaining Ministers.</hi> But the Ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel have the <hi>Keys</hi> committed to them. It is universally acknowledged, they have the Key of <hi>Doctrine</hi>; but how, or by what Rule, can <hi>that</hi> be separated from the Key of <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>full</hi> power of the <hi>Keys</hi> was committed to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and must be transmitted to all <hi>Gospel
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001996_0097_0FBA4ED71A7DD088"/>
Elders.</hi> Unless some <hi>Divine Canon</hi> may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to divide them.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>Rulers</hi> in the Church of Christ: <hi>A power to bind and loose: Qualifications for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> are required: the <hi>feeding the flock</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends Government in it: <hi>Submission</hi> is required to them that <hi>rule,</hi> Heb. 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and submit your selves, for they watch for Your Souls, as they that must give Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi> And we can find no <hi>Elders</hi> but what have the power of <hi>Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>We can't but apprehend their power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Scripture Precedents.</hi> I shall name <hi>two</hi> famous Instances. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by the hands of <hi>Ordinary Elders: Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. So was <hi>Timothy</hi> ordained by the Imposition of the <hi>Hands of the Presbytery</hi>: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. And what was then <hi>valid</hi> is now. So that if we err, it is safest erring with such <hi>Guides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, If <hi>Scripture</hi> be the <hi>Rule</hi> then we can't but safely conclude for the <hi>Right</hi> of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, or Ordinary Gospel Ministers, to Ordain Others into that holy Function without Intrusion, or Encroachment upon the Prerogative of any other Degree or <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>We find much in Antiquity, Primitive and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that favours this power of Presbyters; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what may be reconciled to it.</hi> Tho' our Cause is not to stand at this <hi>Tribunal</hi>: We have a more <hi>sure Rule</hi> to judge by. Yet <hi>here</hi> we meet with what confirms our Assertion. <hi>Clemens Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus and Polycarp</hi> mention only <hi>two</hi> Orders of Officers as of Divine Institution; <hi>viz.</hi> Bishops or
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001996_0098_0FBA4ED989154D58"/>
Elders, and Deacons. <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Hil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>y</hi> are on our side by the consent of all. And where he speaks of Ordination as the peculiar of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> he speaks what was according to Constitution Ecclesiastical. And we have Evidence that in <hi>Alexandria</hi> for two hundred Years only <hi>Presbyters</hi> appointed any unto the Sacred Office.</p>
                  <p>It must be acknowledged that <hi>Early</hi> there was a <hi>distinction</hi> between Bishops and Presbyters. But this at first was not greater than between a <hi>Moderator</hi> of a <hi>Council</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of which it is Constituted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Authority doth not move us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>his Bishop</hi> was certainly but a <hi>Pastor of a single Congregation</hi>; and <hi>his Presbyters</hi> not the Ministers that had the care of different Flocks, but <hi>Assistants</hi> to the Bishop in one and the same Flock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In that also he asserts "That his Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did <hi>succeed into the Bench of the Apostles,</hi> and as such are to be regarded and submitted to. Not to say, how much reason we have to question whether <hi>his Epistles</hi> are genuine.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the Superior power of Bishops was fixed by <hi>Councils,</hi> and by common Agreement. We find sufficient in <hi>Canonists, Councils and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to give us to understand, that <hi>this Limitation</hi> of the Power of Presbyters was not owing to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution,</hi> but to <hi>Ecclesiastical Constitutions:</hi> with what warrant I leave.</p>
                  <p>If we come to the time of the <hi>Reformation</hi> we find it as clear as the Light <hi>that the Reformers were for an inherent power in Elders to Ordain.</hi> The Judgment of the <hi>forreign Churches</hi> of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed is evident from the <hi>Harmony of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,</hi> which assert an <hi>Equality</hi> in all Gospel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.

The sense of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches of the <hi>German Empire</hi> may be well known from those <hi>Articles</hi> called the <hi>Smalcaldic</hi>; in which the Equality of Ordaining power by Divine right is asserted to belong to Presbyters; which was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>three Electors, Forty five Noblemen,</hi> the <hi>Consuls</hi> and <hi>Senators</hi> of <hi>Thirty five Cities,</hi> and a vast Number of <hi>Divines.</hi> At Home <hi>in our Nation,</hi> the Reformers asserted the same Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of power by Divine right.

                     </gap>d by the <hi>Kings</hi> Command, it is asserted That <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> by God's Law are one and the same; and that the power of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> belongs Equally to both. I shall only add, that when the three <hi>Scottish Bishops</hi> came to be <hi>Consecrated</hi> in the days of <hi>Arch-Bishop Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft,</hi> the Motion for their being <hi>first Ordained Priests,</hi> because they had never received <hi>Episcopal</hi> Ordination, was over-rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d for this Reason, <hi>because Priests had the power of Ordination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We stand therefore with the <hi>Reformed,</hi> in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own <hi>Ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ining Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>We cannot see sufficient Strength in any Pleas alledged against Ordination by Presbyters, without a Superior Officer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is pleaded that the <hi>Seventy</hi> were subbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated to the <hi>Apostles</hi>; and that <hi>Bishops</hi> succeed to the Apostles, and <hi>Presbyters</hi> to the Seventy. But this appears to us only asserted, not proved; nor as we think can be; for the <hi>Apostles</hi> were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001996_0100_0FBA4EF58C09B210"/>
Officers, unfixed, and <hi>had no Successors,</hi> as is made good by Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> in his Discourse of the <hi>Popes Supremacy.</hi> Nor can we find the <hi>Seventy</hi> subjected to them; but rather that they had the same Commission: Their <hi>Mission</hi> also seems but for a season, and we hear no more of them after <hi>Christs</hi> Resurrection and Ascention and therefore they have no <hi>Successors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is pleaded that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had as <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> a Superiority over <hi>Presbyters.</hi> But we find them no where styled so in the Word of God; and the Superiority they had was as they were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers, and not as fixed Bishops. For we are assured that they did not <hi>fix</hi> their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in the <hi>Places</hi> where they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> said to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. We find them <hi>both</hi> in other <hi>Cities,</hi> and carrying on the some Work. And we find several Bishops of <hi>Ephesus</hi> together, while <hi>Timothy</hi> was alive, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. And tho' <hi>Timothy in Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> and <hi>Titus in Crete</hi> had the Power of <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> yet there appears nothing to restrain the Stated Elders of those Places from the Exercise of the like power.</p>
                  <p>It is pleaded, <hi>that the Bishops that ordained Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did not commit to them ordaining Power.</hi> But we see no weight in this: If they were Ordained <hi>to the Offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e</hi> of Gospel Ministers, and the power of that Office <hi>is not to be determined by the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ordainers,</hi> but by the Powers granted by <hi>Christ</hi> unto such an Office.</p>
                  <p>It is pleaded, That <hi>the want of a lineal Succession in a direct line from the Apostles,</hi> doth wholly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the power of Subordinate Presbyters to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. But we cannot be moved by this; <hi>partly</hi> because we believe there is <hi>no necessity</hi> of such a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001996_0101_0FBA4EFA83B06D70"/>
Succession; <hi>partly</hi> because we are satisfied that the Ordination of <hi>no one Minister</hi> on Earth can be thus made evident; <hi>and</hi> because the same way that <hi>others</hi> make good that <hi>they themselves</hi> are in the Line of Succession, Presbyters may prove that they are equally in it. But we dare not put the <hi>Regularity</hi> and much less the <hi>Validity</hi> of our <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi> upon such an uncertain foundation.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. We cannot but apprehend <hi>manifest Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,</hi> nay <hi>Mischiefs</hi> to the Church of God, by denying this power of Ordination to all true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel. I shall mention <hi>two.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we deny that power, <hi>we must conclude that the main part of the Churches of the Reformation have no regular or Lawful Ministers, nor regular Ordinances,</hi> And we cannot pass a Judgement so rash and severe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then also we must conclude, <hi>that when Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are overun with the greatest Heresies and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try there can be no Reformation unless the Ministers of an Episcopal Character lead therein.</hi> For if they reform without them, they will lose all regular power to propogate the Ministerial Order. And this is a Thought so big with <hi>shocking Conclusions</hi> that we can on no terms be reconciled to it.</p>
                  <p>Upon all these Accounts we are satisfied, <hi>that Ordination by the Hands of the Presbytery is valid and regular according to Divine Institution</hi>: And we trust that we have found the <hi>Presence of God with us</hi> herein, and with <hi>our Ministers</hi> thus Separated to the service of the Gospel: And therefore we hope at this time to enjoy his Presence and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the <hi>present Solemnity,</hi> in which we shall now engage in his Name and Fear.</p>
