            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT <hi>Man is formed for Society,</hi> is evident from the Conſtitution of his Nature, and the neceſſary Connections of human Life.—What a ſurprizing ELO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUENCE has the GOD OF NATURE given to the <hi>Eyes,</hi> the <hi>Countenance,</hi> the <hi>Voice,</hi> the <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>Geſture</hi> of Men! How <hi>expreſſive</hi> of inward Sentiment and Feeling! And how wiſely calculated to raiſe <hi>correſponding</hi> Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Feelings in the Breaſts of <hi>others!</hi> And is it not conſpicuous that <hi>all the Paſſions</hi> have an Aptitude to communicate <hi>ſtrong</hi> Emotions to, and to raiſe <hi>ſimilar</hi> Paſſions in one another? How readily (for Inſtance) do the Paſſions of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Hope, Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred, Joy</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> vibrate from one Boſom to another; and awaken the very ſame Kind of Paſſions in <hi>many</hi> which were felt at firſt but in <hi>one!</hi>—Moreover, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve amongſt Men a <hi>Variety</hi> of GENIUS—Some are framed with peculiar Talents for <hi>forming</hi> Plans, <hi>making</hi> Laws, <hi>inventing</hi> Arts, <hi>taking the Lead</hi> in Science and Government; and conſequently to <hi>refine</hi> the Minds, and <hi>poliſh</hi> the Manners; and <hi>by that Means</hi> to civilize and felicitate human Life. Others, not ſo ready to contrive and plan Meaſures, may be more prompt to <hi>execute</hi>—and tho' not ſo eminent for Wiſdom, may be as much diſtinguiſhed by their Integrity, Love of Freedom, juſt Regard to Government and the Laws, and Benevolence of Heart.—Now, <hi>all this</hi> was moſt certainly intended by the gracious AUTHOR of our Being, to promote the <hi>common Safety</hi> and <hi>common Good</hi> of the human Kind.

            <p>Firſt. The DUTIES ſuited to our Station as Members of SOCIETY <hi>in general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Duties are a <hi>religious Regard</hi> to GOD, a <hi>hearty Love</hi> to our COUNTRY, a <hi>juſt Regard</hi> to the LAWS; and a <hi>Promptitude</hi> to <hi>preſerve</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> the CONSTITUTION.</p>
            <p>A <hi>religious Regard</hi> to GOD, is the Baſis of <hi>all Order</hi> in civil Government, and the only <hi>ſecure Band</hi> of civil Society. Where the DEITY is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, there is <hi>no Conſcience,</hi> and conſequently <hi>no juſt Meaſure</hi> of Good and Evil. All <hi>good</hi> Laws are founded in REASON—GOD is the <hi>ſupreme</hi> REASON—If then there is no Regard to HIM, the Foundation is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, and the Superſtructure muſt tumble down; conſequently <hi>remorſeleſs</hi> Treaſon, Rebellion, Injuſtice, Fraud, and Rapine would diſturb the public Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, whenever <hi>private</hi> Paſſion or <hi>private</hi> Intereſt might pleaſe to throw off Reſtraint.</p>
            <p>In a Country of Atheiſts, or of Men deſtitute of <hi>religious</hi> Principles, what Force could there be in OATHS for the <hi>Deciſion of Controverſies?</hi> What Sincerity in an Appeal to GOD? And <hi>without</hi> Sincerity an OATH
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011460_0004_0F832EAFDF2E0A58"/>
becomes, inſtead of a Means to <hi>promote</hi> Juſtice, and to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> Right, a Cloak for Villainy, an Engine of Miſchief! Now it is juſtly <hi>implied</hi> in the Form of an OATH eſtabliſhed by our Laws, that GOD is <hi>not only</hi> to be religiouſly regarded, but alſo that that Regard ſhould be <hi>manifeſted</hi> by a becoming Reſpect to the GOSPEL of our SAVIOUR. CHRISTIANITY is <hi>thereby</hi> recommended to Us as the <hi>only</hi> Syſtem of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that can make Us <hi>good</hi> Men and <hi>good</hi> Members of SOCIETY—And that with the higheſt Reaſon—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the GENIUS of the GOSPEL, to <hi>recover</hi> Us from the Dominion of Sin; to <hi>rectify</hi> the Diſorders of our Minds; to <hi>correct</hi> and even to <hi>eradicate</hi> our Vices; and to <hi>lead</hi> us on through all the Stages of Virtue, and every Claſs of Duties, to the higheſt Perfection. It is therefore <hi>eſſential</hi> to our being <hi>good</hi> Members of SOCIETY, that We <hi>cultivate</hi> in Ourſelves, and <hi>promote</hi> in Others, <hi>ſuch</hi> a religious Regard to the DEITY.</p>
            <p>A <hi>hearty</hi> LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY is another Duty incumbent upon Us as Members of SOCIETY. This is a Duty of a very <hi>extenſive</hi> Nature; and includes in it all thoſe Duties which We <hi>owe</hi> to our Parents, our Children, Brothers, Friends, Neighbours, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen in general—Without an <hi>undiſſembled</hi> and <hi>active</hi> Benevolence to whom, the human Breaſt muſt be as a dark hideous Dungeon—a Habitation of the vileſt Vermin!</p>
            <p>This LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY, is not therefore a mere partial Regard to <hi>any particular Soil or Province,</hi> where We firſt drew our Breath (tho' that <hi>natural</hi> Tie, in Conjunction with <hi>moral</hi> Ones may, in certain Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtrengthen our Attachment) —but it implies a <hi>ſtrong</hi> Affection to the COMMUNITY in which Wedwell, as governed by <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>equitable</hi> Laws, flowing from a wiſe and happy CONSTITUTION; and <hi>cemented</hi> in all it's Parts by the great Principle of a COMMON INTEREST.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:011460_0005_0F832EB2A2B66210"/>
               <hi>Such</hi> a CONSTITUTION of GOVERNMENT We partake of, who are Members of the ROYAL-COMMONWEALTH of BRITAIN—A CONSTITUTION which (when well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) gives Security againſt the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of Princes, and againſt the <hi>Licentiouſneſs</hi> of the People—A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which admits not of Injuſtice to <hi>any,</hi> and gives Freedom and Safety to <hi>all</hi>—A CONSTITUTION under which our Lives, our Liberty, our Property, can never be touch'd, but by the JUDGMENT OF OUR PEERS, and by the LAWS of <hi>our own enacting.</hi> What <hi>honeſt</hi> Boſom then does not glow with Love to the COMMUNITY, being founded in Principles ſo juſt and equitable? And what worthy Heart does not burn with Indignation againſt it's Enemies?—In this Caſe, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference muſt be highly criminal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is our Duty <hi>alſo</hi> to pay a <hi>due</hi> REGARD TO THE LAWS. By the Laws We are not to underſtand <hi>every</hi> Law that <hi>may poſſibly</hi> be enacted, (for it is <hi>poſſible</hi> that under <hi>Colour of Law,</hi> We <hi>may</hi> one Day be called upon to ſwear Allegiance to <hi>ſome</hi> PRETENDER) but by the Laws, We mean every Law that is <hi>regularly</hi> paſſed in <hi>Conſiſtence</hi> with the <hi>fundamental</hi> Laws of the Realm— eſpecially the GRAND CHARTER, the BILL OF RIGHTS, the ACT OF SETTLEMENT, and the <hi>ancient</hi> CUSTOMS —To <hi>ſuch</hi> Laws, and their <hi>due</hi> Execution, We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for our <hi>common</hi> Safety and <hi>common</hi> Happineſs. It is <hi>therefore</hi> the Duty of each Individual to obey the Laws, and to ſubmit to the <hi>civil</hi> MAGISTRATES, as the Guardians and Executors of them. It is from THEM that We expect Protection, as the Conſervators of the public Peace, and as the Guardians of our Freedom; and therefore We <hi>owe</hi> THEM the higheſt Defference in their ſeveral Departments, and the beſt Support in the Execution of their reſpective Offices. <hi>Without this</hi> Regard to the <hi>conſtitutional</hi> Laws, the Community can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long exiſt; but muſt quickly ſink into a lawleſs Rabble; Anarchy and Confuſion would over-run our
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011460_0006_0F832EB2EF5D1770"/>
Country, while Juſtice, Mercy, Honour, Truth and Bliſs, would forſake our Dwellings!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Duty,</hi> incumbent on Us all, as Members of Society in general, is a PROMPTITUDE to <hi>preſerve</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> the <hi>happy</hi> CONSTITUTION of our Country—A Conſtitution perhaps the beſt, becauſe the moſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and the leaſt liable to abuſe, of any under the Sun—<hi>wiſely</hi> balanced, and <hi>exactly</hi> calculated to anſwer all the deſirable Ends of Government—SUCH A SYSTEM ought to be watched with the greateſt Circumſpection —for tho' it is an Object of Veneration amongſt the wiſe and good; yet it is an Object of Diſlike amongſt the Sons of Avarice and Debauchery, who can never thrive but amidſt their Country's Diſtreſſes. And if at any Time Corruption or Violence ſhould attempt an Encroachment upon it, We ought to reſiſt the Attack, ſo as to defeat, if poſſible, the <hi>traiterous</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention—and <hi>this</hi> at the Riſque of all that is dear to Us under the Heavens.—The <hi>unmanly,</hi> the <hi>iniquitous,</hi> Doctrine of <hi>paſſive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> is I hope for ever exploded, and baniſhed theſe Realms— ſo that, however it <hi>may</hi> lurk in the dark Boſoms of Malevolence, Selfiſhneſs, and Diſloyalty, it will ever be aſhamed to appear again in any Part of the Britiſh Dominion—For it is very certain that the PEOPLE are the <hi>natural,</hi> the <hi>original,</hi> FOUNTAIN of HONOUR, AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORITY, and LAWS. When therefore their <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> LAWS are <hi>corrupted</hi>; when their <hi>delegated</hi> AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORITY is <hi>proſtituted</hi> to pernicious Purpoſes; when THEY ſee the CONSTITUTION of their Country <hi>over-turning</hi>;—are THEY to ſtand as <hi>paſſive</hi> Spectators of the Ruin?—Rather it is their Duty to ſtand forth as the AVENGERS of Injuſtice, the RESTORERS of public Virtue; and to bring Tyranny <hi>or</hi> Treaſon to <hi>condign</hi> Puniſhment.—This is a Doctrine (not of Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but) of the <hi>higheſt</hi> Loyalty, and the <hi>pureſt</hi> Regard to the public Good. For this <hi>Doctrine</hi> not admitted,

this <hi>Duty</hi> not practiſed upon an Emergency, what Safety has our SOVEREIGN in his Throne? What Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the PEOPLE in their Rights?—An ignorant, or a debauched Mind, can't perhaps conſider this Doctrine, without the Idea of a <hi>lawleſs</hi> Rabble in Arms againſt <hi>lawful</hi> Government—but I am perſuaded that <hi>ſuch</hi> an Idea is more abhorrent to the <hi>ſober</hi> Advocates for this Principle, than to <hi>thoſe</hi> who generally debaſe it by ſo <hi>groſs</hi> a Conception.—It is a Principle on which was founded the GLORIOUS REVOLUTION; and to which the ILLUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRIOUS HOUSE OF HANOVER is indebted for its Right to the Britiſh Crown—<hi>which may GOD preſerve to the lateſt Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having pointed out the Duties incumbent upon Us all, as Members of Society in general; I am now to <hi>recommend</hi> ſome Meaſures to THIS SOCIETY in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that the PLANTER's SOCIETY was <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> formed, tho' on Principles of Public Virtue, yet, on a <hi>limited</hi> Plan—But on particular Occaſions theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples will certainly excite You to purſue Meaſures of more <hi>extenſive</hi> Utility; and where your Country calls, for <hi>either</hi> Counſel or Action, You are ever prompt to <hi>obey</hi> the Call with Alacrity and Cheerfulneſs, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of your Ability.—I need not inform You, GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLEMEN, that at <hi>this very Time,</hi> Your Country calls for the Exertion of <hi>all</hi> your Talents—Not only is your OWN PROVINCE, but all NORTH-AMERICA, and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the WHOLE BRITISH EMPIRE, in Hazard of being plunged into Diſgrace and Ruin, by Meaſures <hi>ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> of Freedom—You know there have been two Queſtions <hi>lately</hi> agitated in the Britiſh Parliament, and reſolved againſt the very <hi>firſt</hi> Principles of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution! The firſt is, <q>
                  <hi>Whether</hi> You are Freeholders and Men of Property, <hi>or only</hi> Tenants at Will, and the Money in your Purſe at <hi>your Own,</hi> or at the Command of <hi>Others?</hi>
               </q> Secondly—<q>Whether you
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011460_0008_0F832EB62112C048"/>
ſhall be ſubject to the Laws of the Land, and the Judgment of your Peers, in Matters of Debate, <hi>or</hi> to a Court of Admiralty, and abſolute Dependants on the Crown?</q>—It has been alledged, that theſe Points are ſettled by the Parliament of Great-Britain, and that their Determinations <hi>ſhould</hi> and <hi>muſt</hi> be deciſive. The BRITISH PARLIAMENT is an <hi>auguſt</hi> Body, and We ſhould ever ſpeak of it's Wiſdom and Authority with the Reverence it <hi>deſerves.</hi> But is the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment infallible? Should it, or <hi>can it legally,</hi> contradict itſelf? If LORD CHIEF-JUSTICE COKE was alive, HE would declare that ſuch Determinations, as above hinted at, are <hi>void in themſelves:</hi> And that for this plain Reaſon, becauſe they are repugnant to the GREAT CHARTER of ENGLAND, to the BILL OF RIGHTS, and to <hi>many other</hi> ACTS OF PARLIAMENT, which ſtand <hi>unrepealed</hi>—To theſe <hi>capital</hi> Laws, Britiſh Subjects may ſafely appeal: Theſe Laws are our Judges; by their expreſs Determination We abide. If <hi>they</hi> ſhould declare that the Law of the Land is as a <hi>Noſe of Wax,</hi> and Trials by our Peers a <hi>dubious</hi> or <hi>precarious Right,</hi> then the Point would be ſettled, till We could make our <hi>imaginary</hi> Freedom <hi>real.</hi> But here, my COUNTRYMEN! We ſtand upon a ſtable Bottom—here's a Baſis that can never be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,</hi> but by the total Ruin of the whole Empire— <hi>Which may Heaven mercifully preſerve.</hi> But after all— <q>Is it not Rebellion to oppoſe an Act of Parliament? Is it not Treaſon to fly in the Face of Government?</q> To theſe Queſtions it may be ſafeſt to let the <hi>learned</hi> reply—Lord CAMBDEN declared <hi>ſuch</hi> Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be contrary to the RIGHTS of AMERICANS — And <hi>ſuch</hi> Oppoſition, MR. PITT told the Houſe of Commons HE rejoiced in. <hi>However,</hi> the Oppoſition, <hi>at preſent,</hi> is rather IN, than AGAINST, Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—One Act being <hi>contradictory</hi> to another. <hi>If any</hi> Oppoſition is <hi>now</hi> made by AMERICANS—it is <hi>argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:011460_0009_0F832EB6AA6272D8"/>
only—not an Oppoſition by a Breach of the Peace; but by ſober Remonſtrance, and humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, <hi>founded</hi> upon the Laws, and our unalienable, and accuſtomed Rights.—But theſe Remonſtrances are not heard—theſe Petitions are not anſwered: We are ſtill <hi>plundered</hi> of our Property, and <hi>deprived</hi> of our Birth-rights. Then I earneſtly recommend it to You, Gentlemen, as a Society of Freemen, a Band of Brothers, to give Us the Example in Signing the AGREEMENT. In that there is no Treaſon; no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty; nor any Thing that ſavours of Rebellion, <hi>even by the ſevereſt Implication of Law</hi>—Nothing in ſhort, but Reſolutions to <hi>avoid</hi> Extravagance, to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi> Oeconomy, and to <hi>encourage</hi> Induſtry. This is a Meaſure, that will anſwer both <hi>private</hi> and <hi>public</hi> good Purpoſes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it will enable you to pay your Debts. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it will operate ſo as to bring our MOTHER-COUNTRY to Right-Reaſon, and teach Her the Neceſſity of a maternal Regard to her virtuous Sons—which will be no Injury to HER, but of laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Benefit to BOTH.—By this ſober, quiet, ſhort, and eaſy Meaſure, We ſhall <hi>convince</hi> the World, that We are <hi>honeſt</hi> Men, and <hi>good</hi> Subjects, paying an <hi>equal</hi> Regard to the Peace, and to the Welfare of our Country—And, We may be confident, that our SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEREIGN (if rightly informed) will <hi>applaud</hi> our Virtue, while HE <hi>admires</hi> the Dignity of our Behaviour; and will not in future liſten to the Calumnies of thoſe Men who <hi>attempt to ſacrifice</hi> the Royal Repoſe, the Conſtitution of their Country, and the Freedom of Millions, to their unbounded Avarice and Ambition. —I hope <hi>therefore,</hi> that no HONEST MAN in this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and I am perſuaded, that no Member of the PLANTER's SOCIETY, will refuſe to ſign his Name to the AGREEMENT.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN! You will permit me farther to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that as your Society was at firſt formed upon a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011460_0010_0F832EB7724DE630"/>
Deſign of Uſefulneſs to this <hi>particular</hi> Part of your Country, there are two Objects highly worthy of your Attention. <hi>One</hi> is the ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Other,</hi> a REFORMATION OF MANNERS.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> viz. The ADMINISTRATION OF JUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICE, the Law provides indeed for the <hi>eaſy Recovery of ſmall</hi> Debts and Damages. But the Executors of this Law are not, <hi>all</hi> of them, (as it is ſaid) Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Honeſty, but the Promoters of Quarrels, and <hi>little litigious</hi> Suits, amongſt their Neighbours: Plunderers of the Poor, inſtead of Guardians of Right. Whether ſo <hi>heavy</hi> a Charge is <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>unjuſt,</hi> GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN, You know.—I am ſure, that no <hi>worthy</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, can ſuppoſe it aimed at Him; and as to <hi>Others,</hi> I leave them to feel that Remorſe which ſooner or later <hi>will faſten</hi> as a Vulture on their Boſoms. —But if the Charge is <hi>juſt,</hi> ſhould not Something be done to <hi>remedy</hi> this Evil? I would ſubmit it to the Conſideration of THIS SOCIETY, if it would not be proper to <hi>ſearch out</hi> Men of this Character—to <hi>lodge Complaints</hi> againſt them, and to <hi>uſe Endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> their being ſtruck out of the Commiſſion. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this Meaſure, becauſe it is thought in itſelf a <hi>neceſſary Meaſure</hi>—And you will the more readily come into it, as by this Means you will <hi>cruſh</hi> Injuſtice, and <hi>ſave</hi> the honeſt Poor out of rapacious Hands.</p>
            <p>You well know, GENTLEMEN! that it is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the <hi>due Admin<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ration of Juſtice,</hi> that <hi>proper Courts</hi> be legally eſtabliſhed for that Purpoſe. The Legiſlature now waits to <hi>hear</hi> and to <hi>redreſs</hi> your Grievances. Now is your Time, firmly to unite with your Fellow-Pariſhoners and Countrymen, in ſoliciting Relief. You know that You have a Friend in his HONOUR THE LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR, You have Friends in his MAJESTY's COUNCIL, and in the GENERAL AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEMBLY—but <hi>You have Enemies</hi> too, that will, if poſſible, (in Order to promote their own private
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011460_0011_0F832EB83913F810"/>
Emolument) elude the juſt Deſigns of all the Friends of their Country.—But do You be <hi>ſteady</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of every neceſſary Means to obtain the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired End—be <hi>patient</hi>—be <hi>ſpirited</hi>—be <hi>united</hi>—and as your Cauſe is good, I doubt not but GOD will <hi>befriend,</hi> and the LEGISLATURE <hi>relieve</hi> You.</p>
            <p>I mentioned REFORMATION OF MANNERS—This at <hi>the firſt View</hi> may ſeem, tho' neceſſary in itſelf, yet an Object that does not come within the Plan of your Inſtitution—But as you extend your Views in <hi>ſome</hi> Caſes, where You think it expedient, ſo with equal Propriety, You may in <hi>others,</hi> under the ſame Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. Now, You very well know, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Bleſſing of ALMIGHTY GOD is the <hi>beſt,</hi> yea the <hi>only,</hi> certain Security to our Rights and Privileges—If GOD ſhould forſake Us, and reſolve to puniſh Us for our Crimes, We fall a Prey to the Ambition and Avarice, the Pride and Luxury of Maſters, who will ſet no Bounds to their Luſt; and in Order to keep Us in abject Slavery, will <hi>rule Us with a Rod of Iron</hi>—And what can ſo directly tend to bring upon Us thoſe Evils, as our Vices? It was Vice that <hi>pulled</hi> down the Vengeance of Heaven upon the Cities of SODOM and GOMORRAH—upon BABYLON and NINEVAH—upon the States of GREECE—the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of ROME—and every other People, who have loſt their Liberty, their Glory, and Felicity. And as the <hi>ſame Cauſes</hi> produce the <hi>ſame Effects</hi> in the <hi>moral</hi> as well as the <hi>material</hi> World, our Vices will (unleſs repented of) bring upon us the like Ruin. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men! I addreſs You upon this Subject, becauſe, in this Part of our Province, moſt of You are elevated in your Circumſtances—above the generality of your Neighbours—This, added to your being Members of the PLANTER's SOCIETY, ſets You in a Point of Light, which attracts peculiar Notice——<hi>Your Example then, has conſiderable Influence,</hi> and which I hope will always
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011460_0012_0F832EB8E24E8820"/>
be ſo expreſſive of a pious Regard to the GOSPEL of CHRIST, and to the LAWS of GOD, as that <hi>We may ſafely tread in your Steps.</hi> And if you will uſe your Endeavours to procure an <hi>effectual Law</hi> for the Suppreſſion of Vagrants <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Legiſlature</hi> wiſely confiders that thoſe Perſons who have <hi>no viſible Way</hi> of acquiring an <hi>honeſt</hi> Livelihood, are ready to uſe <hi>diſhoneſt</hi> Means for that Purpoſe—from which ſprings up a School of Idleneſs and Vice, in the very Heart of the Common-Wealth—but by ſome Defect or other, Perſons of this Character ſwarm over the remote Parts of this Country, to the great Injury of the <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>induſtrious.</hi>
               </note>; and to promote the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Laws for the Regulation of public Houſes, the <hi>due</hi> Obſervation of the Sabbath, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of prophane Swearing, and of other Vices, which are the Reproach and Ruin of our Country, You will deſerve the Applauſe of every good Man, enjoy the ſweet Senſations of a benevolent Heart, and in all probability ſee the KINGDOM of Our SAVIOUR <hi>flouriſh,</hi> and the Kingdom of Darkneſs and Sin gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually <hi>ſink</hi> into Ruins—<hi>Which may</hi> GOD <hi>in Mercy grant for</hi> CHRIST's <hi>Sake.</hi> Amen.</p>
