            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>INTENDING not to trouble you with an Apology, or any thing Ceremonious, I thought fit in this place juſt to hint to you the Contents of the following Treatiſe, and the Motives inducing me to ſuch a Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; and alſo a little to Open and Expoſe the Doctrines of Quakeriſm at leaſt to give you ſuch a General View thereof, as perhaps may conſiderably facilitate your Underſtanding their particular Tenets, as they occur in the Place and Order in which they are diſpoſed in the Second Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> I have given you an Honeſt and True Account of my own Caſe, and of that Wonderful and Peculiar Providence of GOD, which was Concerned for me therein; In which, youd find many things worthy of your Notice, tending to your Profit, and Strongly engaging your Acknowlegements of the Finger of GOD, which I hope is Sincerely my chief End in giving you the Narrative thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002696_0004_0FE60BBAB855C0C0"/>
               <hi>In the next Place,</hi> I have given yon the main Heals of the <hi>New-London Quakeriſm</hi> an Hereſie Advanced and Maintained there by <hi>John Rogers,</hi> Late of that Town, Deceaſed, and to this Day adhered to by many Perſons thereabout.</p>
            <p>Together with which I have drawn the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Lines of the true Portraiture of proper <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> both Ancient and Modern.</p>
            <p>Mr Deſign herein, is to Remove the miſtakes &amp; Conſequently the Dangers which I fear many may be in. Who not imagining what Errors theſe People hold, or what Truths in Religion they Deny and Oppoſe, may have conceived a favourable Opinion of them &amp; their ways, who nevertheleſs may by the bare view of thoſe <hi>Hereſies,</hi> be induced to alter their opinions about them, for they ſo directly Contradict both <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> &amp; all <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> as that the very opening and Expoſing, will ordinarily prove an Effectual Confutation of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the third place,</hi> I have ſpoken ſomething in anſwer to <hi>John Rogers</hi>'s Boaſtings of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing In which I have indeavoured to ſhew the Criminal Cauſes of thoſe Sufferings; by which it is manifeſt, that his Gloryings were Extremely Vain, and that he had no cauſe to boaſt, except that becauſe his Puniſhments were Lighter than his Crimes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſt of all,</hi> I have concluded with a word of Advice to ſuch as are already taken in that Snare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002696_0004_0FE60BBAB855C0C0"/>Now as to <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> in General, I conceive of is to be nothing elſe but ſome of the Hereſies of <hi>Pelagius</hi> (Improved) who lived about <hi>Anno,</hi> 415 and held amongſt other Error, <hi>that Chriſt Dyed for all men,</hi> viz as much for one man as an other. To ſupport which Error 'twas neceſſary to advance the doctrine of <hi>Free-will,</hi> in oppoſition to the truth of <hi>Election and Free Grace</hi> (thence came all our free wiſers) For he that holds the Univerſality of Chriſts Death, can no way ſalve the divine Juſtice in Damning ſome, but by Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a full power in all to Reject or take Benefit by his Death of themelves.</p>
            <p>Theſe Errors of <hi>Pelagius</hi> have been ever ſince kept up and believed in whole or in part, 'till a few Years ago, <hi>viz.</hi> about or near the middle of the laſt Century, that one <hi>George Fox,</hi> came upon the Stage, who was the firſt proper <hi>Quaker</hi> that the world hath ſeen, he held the Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſts Death, and built upon it; he was ſoon followed by Multitudes, ſome of whom rather out went him and became very eminent &amp; Superior Guides of their Sect, who were called <hi>Quakers,</hi> becauſe of an horried ſhaking that would ſurpriſe their Bodies, eſpecially when their Souls were in Extaſies, which frequently happened.</p>
            <p>They held that JESUS the son of <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c' was not the Chriſt, in any other ſenſe then every Saint is, that he is not the Saviour of Sinners, that he Died for his Religion, but Merited nothing by it for any but Himſelf But that Chriſt the Son of God and Saviour of Sinners is
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002696_0005_0FE60BBCC75FC970"/>
a part of the <hi>Divine Eſſence,</hi> which is ſhed forth into the Hearts of all both <hi>Good and Bad,</hi> and is a <hi>Light</hi> unto all, but a <hi>Guide and Saviour</hi> to them that will Submit thereto as ſuch.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Chriſts coming in the Fleſh</hi> is the Entrance of this piece of the <hi>Divine Eſſence</hi> into the fleſh of men, that his Manifeſtation in the fleſh ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the apparent Exerting his <hi>Divine power in men,</hi> that His offering Himſelf a Sacrifice to God is ſomething done by Him in a mans body for the Pacifying the Wrath of God.</p>
            <p>That <hi>His Suffering and Dying</hi> on <hi>the Croſs,</hi> the <hi>Bruiſing His Body</hi> and <hi>Shedding His Blood,</hi> muſt be taken only in a <hi>Spiritual Senſe.</hi> Now all this they held to be done for <hi>Every Man</hi> in his own Body by the aforeſaid peice of the proper Eſſence of God, which they moſt frequently ſtiled the <hi>Light within.</hi> And ſo they are to be underſtood when they ſay, that <hi>the Death of Chriſt</hi> is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, or that <hi>He Dyed for all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They alſo held the Doctrine of <hi>Free Will;</hi> and aſſerted that Every Man had a <hi>Full Power</hi> in himſelf to follow the Dictates of the <hi>Light within,</hi> or to <hi>Diſobey</hi> them, and in caſe of Diſobedience they held that this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Light</hi> would after a while give over playing the Saviour with a man, and turn to be a <hi>Spirit of Horror</hi> and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment in him; &amp; this they called <hi>Hell,</hi> but to the <hi>Willing and Obedient</hi> it would be their <hi>God and Saviour;</hi> it would procure them pardon of <hi>Paſt Sins</hi> and keep them from Committing <hi>Future ones,</hi> it would perfectly Illuminate and
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:002696_0005_0FE60BBCC75FC970"/>
Sanctify them and make them Equal with <hi>God Himſelf.</hi> (As to this Equality, ſee <hi>Francis Howgills works,</hi> Page 232.) Hence the <hi>Quakers</hi> Rejected all <hi>Revealed Religion,</hi> Damned the <hi>Bible, &amp;c.</hi> and gave themſelves up to walk Intirely by the <hi>Light within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Tenets being ſo Extremely <hi>Nonſenſical</hi> &amp; <hi>Blaſphemous,</hi> few men of knowledge have been taken in the ſhare, yet ſome there have been, Particularly one <hi>Barclay,</hi> a Learned &amp; Ingenuous <hi>Scotchman,</hi> who preached in the Time of <hi>King Charles the Second,</hi> He ſoon perceived that <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm</hi> needed Emendation and Poliſhing, which he Eſſayed to do in a Book called <hi>Propoſitions of Divinity,</hi> in which he expreſſes quite Different sentiments about many things, from what the <hi>Former Quakers</hi> had done, but yet Remained a <hi>Quaker:</hi> for both ſpake from the ſame Infallible Guide, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Light within,</hi> &amp; yet they Differed even about the very Light it ſelf: For as I ſaid before the former held it to be <hi>God;</hi> and as I might have ſaid, they accounted it to be <hi>the Soul of Man. Barclay</hi> ſays, <hi>'Tis neither of the Two,</hi> but a <hi>Certain Divine Subſtance</hi> Different <hi>from Both;</hi> He ſays, it's <hi>Palpable, &amp;c.</hi> and that God is wrap'd up in it, and Can't be ſeperated from it, he calls it the <hi>Vehicle of God,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Body of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Bread which comes down from Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Grace;</hi> a minute afterwards he makes it an <hi>Eatable subſtance,</hi> and ſays, That <hi>Good men do Eat and Drink its Blood,</hi> and that he calls the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:002696_0006_0FE60BBCDA224AD8"/>
               <hi>Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> he ſays 'tis he <hi>Saviour of Sinners,</hi> yet he acknowleges Chriſt too tho'in a Remote way, for he ſays that Chriſt by his ſufferings purchaſed <hi>the Light within,</hi> which is Properly and Immediately the Saviour. <hi>Barclay</hi> alſo minced the Doctrine of Free-will, for he held the power of mans Will to be only <hi>Negative</hi> and that it did not Extend to the performance of any <hi>Poſitive act of Obedience,</hi> but only that man by the power of his will might forbear to Reſiſt the Motions of the Light &amp; might yield &amp; ſubmit himſef to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of it; &amp; in caſe a man did ſo, then the Light would ſupply him with ſtrength to do whatſoever it Commanded to be done by him.</p>
            <p>It Remains that I ſpeak of the third ſtep in Quakeriſm taken by <hi>John Rogers,</hi> who Received his firſt Notions of Spirituality from <hi>Banks,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caſe,</hi> a couple of Lewd men of that ſort called <hi>Singing Quakers,</hi> whoſe <hi>Noiſyneſs</hi> acquired them that appellation to Diſtinguiſh them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Quakers,</hi> from whom they differ not in Doctrine</p>
            <p>Theſe men as they <hi>Danced through this Colony,</hi> (Attended by an herd of <hi>Women</hi> who ſaid of them, that their Lips dropped <hi>Myrrh &amp;c.</hi>) Lit of <hi>John Rogers</hi> and made a <hi>Quaker</hi> of him: But neither they nor the Spirit could teach him to ſing; God not having given him a <hi>Muſical ear,</hi> nor <hi>Tuneable Voice,</hi> which was a Torment to him: However he Remained their Diſciple for
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:002696_0006_0FE60BBCDA224AD8"/>
a while, and then being wiſer than his Teachers made a Tranſition to the Church of the <hi>Seventh Day Baptiſts;</hi> But the ſame Spirit not deſerting him but ſetting in with the diſpoſition of his own Spirit, to a Vehement affectation of <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi> he Reſolved to Reach it, though it ſhould happen to Lead to <hi>Singularity;</hi> whereupon after a few <hi>Revelations,</hi> he Reſolved upon Quakeriſm again, though under a Modification ſomewhat new, I call it Quakeriſm, not but that he differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them in many things, yet holding with them in the main; being Guided by the <hi>ſame Spirit,</hi> acknowleging their <hi>Spirit,</hi> and they his; he muſt needs be called <hi>a Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twere well if the Conſideration of mans <hi>Proneneſs to Err,</hi> from the <hi>Dreadful Inſtances</hi> of it in ſpiritual things, might Effectually Excite every one to Endeavour Seaſonably to have their <hi>Hearts</hi> Eſtabliſhed <hi>with Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be obſerved, that there are certain Times which paſs over ſome men, in which they are in mo re mminent danger of departing from the Faith, giving heed to <hi>Seducing Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One is the Time of <hi>ſore Affliction;</hi> when a man through the mere Providence of God, is under very <hi>Afflictive Circumſtances;</hi> then he will be Tempted to Diſcontent and Repining at Gods Providence; which if he don't Watch and Pray againſt, but ſuffers it to grow upon him, 'Tis well if the next ſtep be not to <hi>change his Religion.</hi> We know the <hi>Jews</hi> under Dark and Afflictive Providences Murmured and Fell to <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:002696_0007_0FE60BCD1824A618"/>Another time is when a man has <hi>Suffered very unjuſt Treatment from men,</hi> as he conceives; and having, applyed to the Authority for Relief, but not obtaining it, hell be Tempted to think Uncharitably of, and Rail againſt them, which if he allows him elf to do, his next Temptation will be to <hi>fall away to ſome Party that Oppoſes them:</hi> And this was the caſe of one <hi>Gates</hi> in <hi>New-Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>-County.</p>
            <p>The Third and Laſt that I will note is the Time <hi>of Spiritual Conviction,</hi> when a ſenſe of Guil has wounded the Soul, the Terrors of the Lord Inviron him on every ſide.

            <head>CHAP. I. Giving an Account of the <hi>Authors</hi> being Led into, and <hi>His</hi> Recovery from <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MY near Alliance to <hi>John Rogers,</hi> (then <hi>Junior</hi>) who is my Brother, <hi>viz.</hi> the Son of <hi>my Mother,</hi> Proved an Unhappy Snare to me. He being Naturally a Man as Manly, Wiſe, Facetious, and Generous, perhaps as one amongſt a Thouſand; I was exceedingly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in and with his Converſation: He alſo Indeared himſelf to me very much, by his Repeated Expreſſions of Complacency in me; by which I was Induced to be Frequently in his Company, and often at his Houſe, where his Father would be Entertaining of me with Exhortations to a <hi>Religious Life;</hi> Warning me of the <hi>Danger of Sin,</hi> &amp; Certainty of <hi>that Wrath</hi> which ſhall come on all that Know not GOD, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would ſome times for Curioſity be enquiring into <hi>his Principles,</hi> and other times for Diverſion, be Diſputing a Point with him; but I knew not <hi>that the Dead were there, Prov.</hi> 7.24 I was not <hi>Religious enough</hi> to be much concerned about his Principles, but <hi>Pitiful enough</hi> to be extreamly
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002696_0008_0FE60BCD283EE6F8"/>
moved with the Story of his Sufferings, who had a Faculty to Relate them very Artfully in his <hi>own Favour.</hi> Until at length my Mind came to be Inſenſibly tinged with ſomething of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt <hi>both Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Miniſters.</hi> I had alſo a Reſerve in <hi>his Favour,</hi> that 'twas Poſſible, he might be a Good Man (the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Doctrines notwithſtanding) eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeeing all his Sufferings were not Able to ſhake his Conſtancy, or Oblige him to Recede from the leaſt part of his Religion.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>my Brother</hi> became a very Strict and Devout Profeſſor of his Fathers Religion, and ſo became leſs Sociable, till at length our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was almoſt wholly Suſpended for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Years.</p>
            <p>When ſome Years and many Changes had roll'd over me, it Pleaſed GOD in a Solitary Moment to bring into my thoughts, theſe Words, <hi>Forſake the Fooliſh &amp; Live,</hi> I wondred at the Words, their ſound and ſavour was like the Word of GOD, but I remained ſome Days at a loſs about them. However I dwelt upon them, and they afforded me conſtant <hi>matter of Meditation.</hi> I underſtood them to Suggeſt that if I would <hi>Live Eternally,</hi> I muſt Forſake <hi>my Sins,</hi> which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls <hi>Folly,</hi> and my <hi>Vain Companions,</hi> which the Scripture calls <hi>Fools.</hi> Thus they Ingroſſed almoſt all my tho'ts for ſeveral Days, till by ſearch I found them <hi>In the Ninth of Proverbs at the Sixth Verſe:</hi> where the Senſe Compleat is, <hi>Forſake the Fooliſh and Live, and go in the way of</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002696_0008_0FE60BCD283EE6F8"/>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Whereupon I Concluded there was ſomething of God's more than <hi>Common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> in the bringing thoſe Words into my Mind, or at leaſt in the Application of them thereto; I took them as a Reproof of my <hi>Vain Courſe of Life,</hi> and a Counſel and Invitation to me <hi>to Walk with the Wiſe</hi> and be Wiſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I fully Reſolved from thence-forth to Turn from Sin to GOD, which I thought not <hi>Extreme Difficult</hi> to do, ſeeing my Underſtanding was now fully Perſwaded of the Neceſſity of it, in Order to Life and Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I began to ſet up a Strict and Religious Courſe of Life, to Reform the <hi>Errors of my Ways,</hi> to <hi>Pray to GOD in Secret,</hi> and to <hi>Attend the Means of Grace,</hi> expecting that GOD would ſoon meet me in his ways, and Anſwer me with <hi>Strength in my Soul.</hi> After ſome Tryal made, I found it far otherwiſe, I could Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence no ſenſible Supplys from God, but ſeemed to Labour wholly in my own Strength. I found I could neither <hi>Believe, Repent</hi> nor <hi>Reform</hi> to any Good Effect, nor Perſevere in my Good Purpoſes ſo Lately and Solemnly Reſolved upon This made me add to my Prayers <hi>Faſting,</hi> to <hi>Renew</hi> my <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> and to put forth <hi>more Strength,</hi> to Maintain a Stricter Watch over my Heart &amp; Life, but ſtill all <hi>ſeemed in Vain,</hi> I was never the nearer to GOD by all that I could do; and ſo perhaps for about Seven Months I was in a ſtrange Perplexity, I knew not what to do, nor was I Able to do any thing; ſometimes I ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002696_0009_0FE60BCE36A53A30"/>
be very much Concerned and Reſolute, at other times very Dull and Indifferent, &amp; at other times ready to give over all through Diſcouragement. At length upon conſidering thoſe Words, Gen. 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always Strive with Man,</hi> &amp;c. I was put into extream Fear, leſt GOD ſhould withold from me thoſe Convictions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions whereby I had been carried thus far, or that all my Purpoſes and endeavours might be Fruſtrated by a Sudden Death. This put me upon exerting all the Powers of my Soul, and for ought I know all that a Man <hi>without ſpecial Grace</hi> can do, I did, but all to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or rather to bad purpoſe, as it ſeemed; for the more Earneſtly I Deſired and Endeavoured to <hi>Believe, Repent,</hi> &amp;c. the further off I ſeemed to be from it: Temptations of all Sorts beſet me, and a Congregation of all Hateful Luſts I felt Raging within me; all the Threatnings in GOD's Word Traverſed directly againſt me; no Strength in <hi>my ſelf,</hi> nor any ſenſible Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys from GOD, but my Heart as hard <hi>as a Stone.</hi> And now I ſaw my ſelf in a very <hi>Doleful Caſe,</hi> a Sinner in Grain, an Enemy to GOD, and GOD Juſtly ſo to me, His Juſtice Ingaged againſt me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I was Diſtreſſed about the <hi>Decrees</hi> of GOD, fearing my <hi>Non-Election.</hi> Sometimes Fearing <hi>the Door of Mercy</hi> was ſhut againſt me, and ſometimes that I had <hi>Sinned <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npardonably.</hi> Sometimes I Queſtioned <hi>the Poſſibility of my Salvation,</hi> if GOD would Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Honour of His Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002696_0009_0FE60BCE36A53A30"/>I was now in <hi>the Depth of Darkneſs,</hi> and no Door of hope opened to me; Yet <hi>the Immenſe Riches</hi> of the Divine Grace, was ſo Frequently Hinted to me, in the Word, that <hi>a Spark of Hope</hi> was kept alive in my Soul, by which I was kept from utter Deſpair, and upheld in Seeking and Striving to enter in at the <hi>Strait Gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Cryed to GOD Inceſſantly for <hi>Mercy And Grace;</hi> I ſaw a neceſſity <hi>of Faith, a New Heart and Life,</hi> the <hi>Pardon of Sin,</hi> and <hi>Cleanſing my Soul from Guilt,</hi> but all out of my Reach, all above my Power, either to do or underſtand, I had heard of <hi>Looking to Jeſus,</hi> (but did not underſtand what it meant, to go out of my ſelf to Him for Life,) I Prayed GOD to Lead me to his Son to Undertake for me, and work in me the Works of His Grace.</p>
            <p>Thus it was with me about <hi>Three Months,</hi> During which ſpace of time, I continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>in Prayer,</hi> and other Religious Duties.</p>
            <p>About the End of the time, I was one day Surpriſed with an horrid fear of <hi>Diabolical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation</hi> in ſecret Prayer, I Reſiſted the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Prayed againſt it, yet the fear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed upon me, and I began to think whither it was not better to Omit the Duty.</p>
            <p>I Propounded the Difficulty to one who was a Strong and Skilful Chriſtian, who adviſed me, by no means to Omit the Duty, but rather to change the <hi>Place of my Retirement</hi> which was Remote in the Field. I thought to change the Place, though otherwiſe very Warrantable, yet
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002696_0010_0FE60BCE4A964420"/>
upon this Occaſion would be a giving way to Satan, whom I muſt always Reſiſt. Whereupon about the cloſe of the Day light, I retired to the uſual Place where I ſoon imagined my ſelf to be Attended with <hi>Innumerable Swarms of the Infernal Spirits,</hi> ruſhing towards me with utmoſt Fury, which made me Cry alond to GOD, in theſe Words, <hi>O Almighty GOD and my Father, who beldeſt theſe Spirits in thine Eternal Chains, wilt thou ſuffer me, for whom Chriſt hath Dyed, to be a Prey to them.</hi> Indeed I have often feared I was Guilty of very <hi>great Preſumption,</hi> in Claiming that Relation to the Almighty and Intereſt in the Death of His Son, on the beſt Grounds I could then have ſhewn; however, it proved of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Service at that time, for I felt upon it a very ſenſible Support of my Spirits, and the <hi>Imaginary Apparitions</hi> Diſappeared, I went thorow with the Duty, and then Returned as free from Fears of that Nature, (for ought I know) as I am at this time.</p>
            <p>Twice afterwards I met With ſomething of that Nature, but without any Annoyance to me. I have called this an <hi>Imaginary Apparition,</hi> for I ſaw nothing indeed with my Eyes; and whither there were there at that time the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of ſuch Spirits, or whether the Soul of Man be Capable of the <hi>Perception of Spirits,</hi> or any thing elſe, otherwiſe than by the Senſes, I leave to be conſidered by them that know more of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Humane Souls, &amp; of the Natures of Spirits, if they Pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002696_0010_0FE60BCE4A964420"/>But this at leaſt is true, that it was ſo fixed on my Imagination, as that I Realized it. and ſo it anſwered the deſign of the Tempter in that Reſpect.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not have Mentioned this, but that I could not have been a <hi>Faithful Witneſs,</hi> in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſo Material a Paſſage, in the ſtory of my Troubles.</p>
            <p>I had but a little paſſed this Temptation, but I began to be very Impatient that GOD had not Revealed Chriſt to me, and ſhewed me the way of Faith. At Length I began to Queſtion, whither I had not been ſeeking <hi>the Living among the Dead;</hi> I thought it Unuſual for God ſo long to withold the Knowlege of Himſelf &amp; Ways from any ſo Solicitous to have Known Him; whereupon I feared I had been in the way of an <hi>Erroneous and Heterodox Religion,</hi> I Reſolved to Examine it, and did ſo; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Methodically, Impartially, nor Effectually.</p>
            <p>Yet therein with all Poſſible Earneſtneſs, I asked Counſel of the <hi>Wonderful Counſellor,</hi> and Wiſdom of him that gives <hi>it Liberally to all,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo I proceeded after the following Strange and Prepoſterous manner: And Firſt, I took a View of the Profeſſors of Religion, amongſt whom I found but few that my Charity could reach.</p>
            <p>There is ſuch <hi>an one,</hi> thought I, that will not Swear, but I have heard, he will Cheat; and <hi>an other</hi> indeed will not be Drunk, but ſuch an one Affirms he will Lye Others I found whoſe Characters Black Mouths, had not ſulfied with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002696_0011_0FE60BD8639FDF80"/>
particular groſs Imputations, but of them I had underſtood that muſt of them were accounted Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe few whom I Judged to be Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, I thought it might be as ſome had ſaid, that ſome of every Religion are Saved, &amp; ſo I thought never the better of the way for their Sakes.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I conſidered the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> with whom I ſoon found fault for their Salaries, I thought they might Labour with their Hands, and Preach the Word by an extraordinary Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, as the Apoſtles did, if they were the Miniſters of Chriſt; and thus on a ſudden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was aware, I became deeply Prejudiced againſt <hi>both Miniſters and People</hi> before ever I had examined the Articles of Faith, ſo <hi>Fooliſh was I &amp; Ignorant even as a Beaſt before thee,</hi> Pſal 73.22.</p>
            <p>When I conſidered <hi>the Articles of Faith,</hi> I could not proceed in any Method or Order therein, for as ſoon as I thought of a Point, I firſt <hi>ſcrupled it</hi> and then <hi>hated it,</hi> and accordingly bent all the force of my Underſtanding to over throw it.</p>
            <p>Againſt ſome Truths I tho't <hi>I Prevail'd,</hi> others I could not gainſay, yet even them I would by no means <hi>Grant,</hi> and yet could <hi>not tell why.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Drunken Staggering Condition, I began to be Lead or rather Driven <hi>Head-long</hi> a very great pace in the greateſt imaginable Confuſion, and no leſs Perplexity, the whole frame of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was Tottering and ready to fall with me, yet I could not tell why, ſave that, in the general it looked all wrong, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002696_0011_0FE60BD8639FDF80"/>And now I perceived my ſelf to be in a worſe Caſe than ever, for as I was <hi>without Chriſt</hi> ſo I was at the greateſt loſs <hi>in what Form</hi> of Religion I ought to ſeek him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> I Abhorred for <hi>Idolatry</hi> and other things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church of England</hi> I thought not to differ in matters of Faith from what I was juſt now ready to Renounce.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> I Hated for Denying Chriſt and the Authority of the Scriptures and ſuch like things.</p>
            <p>I thought of a Conference with my Brother, but was afraid of <hi>his Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Diſtreſs I poured out my Soul to GOD in Prayer, I Implored the Guidance of his Word and Spirit. I Confeſſed my Sinful and Loſt Eſtate, but I told him of His Word, Hoſ 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou baſt Deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy Help found: I</hi> flew to our Saviours Words, that, <hi>If a Son Ask Bread, the Father will not give him a Stone,</hi> Luk. 11.11. And Pleaded them in this manner, <hi>O thou that Heareſt Prayers, and haſt never ſaid to the Seed of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſeek ye me in Vain; who art a Fountain of Light and Truth, and therefore the Sins of Men Believe thy Word, bebold the Promiſe of thy Son which I now Humbly Plead before thee. I Implore the Bread of Life, and the Knowledge of the Truth. Wilt thou now ſend me ſtrong Deluſions to Believe Lies, and ſo let his Words fall to the Ground! Surely thou wilt not, for they are ſelted in Heaven, and more permanent than the</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002696_0012_0FE60BD8724FB320"/>
               <hi>Heavens or the Earth, and I will Believe them and Adventure my Soul thereupon.</hi> Theſe Words of our Saviour I never let go, but they were a ways a preſent help to me in the Darkeſt Succeeding Moments; for although I did not Believe from thence, that the Lord would not lead me thro' a very Dark and Slippery way, yet I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Hope, in ſome Degree, that finally he would bring me forth to the Light, and that my Eyes ſhould ſee his Salvation.</p>
            <p>There was nothing now worthy of Remark that I Experienced for ſome Weeks, ſave only that I remained in <hi>a Confuſed, Unſetled Poſture,</hi> Doubtful of everything, and fixed in nothing but my Reſolutions to <hi>Pray always,</hi> and to Act according to the beſt Light I had, which by this time was very <hi>groſs Darkneſs;</hi> for a Spirit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation poſſeſſed my Underſtanding, ſo that in Spiritual things I was not able to Act as a Man; I grew ſo Prejudiced againſt the <hi>Miniſters</hi> as that I could ſcarce bear to hear Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> Preach, at length on a Saturday being about the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> 1709 10. I Wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>my Brother,</hi> in imating ſomething of my Difficulties, &amp; Deſiring a Conference with him; I carried it with me <hi>to Meeting,</hi> intending to ſend it or forbear, according as what I might <hi>meet with in the Sermons,</hi> but finding nothing that ſuited me, I ſent it, and the ſame Week he made me <hi>a Viſu</hi> and brought me <hi>Two Books</hi> and a <hi>Manuſcript</hi> from <hi>his Father,</hi> which when I peruſed, though I found not ſuch forceable Argument
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002696_0012_0FE60BD8724FB320"/>
therein as to ſway much <hi>my Judgment,</hi> yet I fancied a Marvel'ous <hi>Spirituality</hi> in them, which ſoon Captivated my Affections, and I began us hope GOD was Anſwering my Prayers.</p>
            <p>Now by the way, I would Obſerve to you, that until <hi>I Wrote to my Brother,</hi> I had not hinted a word of <hi>my Scruples</hi> about matters of Religion to the Deareſt Friend in the World; through a certain Averſation from my very Childhood to Conſult the wiſeſt or beſt Friend in Caſes of <hi>Extreme Difficulty,</hi> though in <hi>lighter Troubles</hi> I could do it freely; which is an Unhappy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage I Labour under to this Day.</p>
            <p>After this I ſoon laid aſide <hi>Family Prayer,</hi> could ſee no Rule for the Praftice of it.</p>
            <p>The Eighth of <hi>January,</hi> being <hi>the Lord's-Day,</hi> I doubted ſo much of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that I dared not go to Meeting.</p>
            <p>The Twenty Second of <hi>January</hi> I thought it my Duty to Labour as on other Days, and I did ſo.</p>
            <p>Now you may Pleaſe to Underſtand that by this time, there had been perhaps uſed with me, all proper means of Conviction, but in Vain; my Prejudices increaſed to that pitch, as that I could hardly talk Peaceably with a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and all but ſuch I Deſpiſed as <hi>Mean, Ignorant,</hi> and <hi>Bigotted perſons,</hi> that held their Principles (and Conſciences too) of their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> excepting a very few at whom Captain <hi>Huntington</hi> was one, whom I accounted a Man of Knowlege, &amp; I allowed he might have <hi>Grace,</hi> who being ſent
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002696_0013_0FE60BD984D95158"/>
for on this Occaſion, had almoſt perſwaded me to a <hi>Retraction</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time I had alſo had much Conference with <hi>John Rogers,</hi> been at his Meetings &amp; heard him Preach; and altho' I could not fall in at preſent with his other Diſciples, into the belief of all his Doctrines, yet I was perſwaded that GOD <hi>was in him of a truth.</hi>

            <p>The Twenty Sixth of <hi>January,</hi> refuſing to pay a Fine, or to ſuffer any to do it for me, I was carried to Priſon at <hi>New-London,</hi> for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the <hi>Sabbath laſt</hi> before.</p>
            <p>I conclude the Proſecution againſt me had not been ſo ſudden, nor ſo ſtrict (feeing all men knew I did the Fact in Obedience to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,) had they not hoped to have Reclaimed me by Sufferings; for every one was concerned to have me Recovered, and to that end exerted themſelves with a great deal of <hi>Zeal</hi> &amp; <hi>Fervour,</hi> but in very different Methods, according to their various Capacities or Diſpoſitions; Some by Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Prayers,</hi> Friendly <hi>Conferences,</hi> Sage <hi>Counſel,</hi> Forceable <hi>Arguments</hi> with a <hi>Sprit of Meekneſs,</hi> whilſt others by <hi>ſharp Rebukes,</hi> &amp;c. Laboured my Reſtauration: Warm Tempers where there was leſs Grace, would Rage againſt me, expreſſing themſelves to this Effect, <hi>Ephraim is joined to his Idols, let him alone; an Heretick after — Admonition, Reject,</hi> &amp;c. Mild Tempers would endeavour to <hi>Allure me,</hi> with Proſpects of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Advantages, which I muſt needs forego if I would perſiſt in that way. Of the Ruder Herd,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002696_0013_0FE60BD984D95158"/>
ſome <hi>Curſed me</hi> in the Streets, wiſhing me Dead <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others by Mockings &amp; other verbal Abuſes miniſtred to me ſuch Provocations, as one would think nothing but a Stock or Stone would have been Silent under; thoſe <hi>rough <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages</hi> tended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to increaſe my Doubts about the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Country, and Incenſed me ſtill more againſt the People that Proſeſſed it.</p>
            <p>In the Morning before I went to Priſon, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all Concerns and Intereſts to GOD, by <hi>Solemn Prayer with my Family,</hi> as I thought on ſuch an Extraordinary occaſion I might do, and then taking a ſad Valediction of my Wife, I Addreſſed my ſelf to the Journey, taking a <hi>Bible</hi> with me; but GOD knows that the Anguiſh of my Soul was Inexpreſſible, ariſing from a Variety of the Solemneſt Conſiderations, which I will Reduce under two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The loſs of all Valuables in this World, which ſeemed to me more than Probable; amongſt which none lay ſo near to roy Heart as <hi>my Wife</hi> juſtly did, (being a <hi>Beautiful</hi> &amp; <hi>Gracious young Woman</hi>) whom I had enjoyed but leſs then Five Months, and was now at the point of Death through extreme Grief on my account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And what added Amazement and Horrour to all was, that I had no ſure Proof, either that my Heart was Right with GOD, or that my ways were directed according to his Word.</p>
            <p>I greatly feared I might be found <hi>Fighting against him;</hi> yet at preſent could do no other
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002696_0014_0FE60BD992E9DBA0"/>
wiſe than to Proceed, for ſo my Conſcience led me, the Dictates whereof, I dare by no means Diſobey.</p>
            <p>Under this preſſing Burthen, I went to <hi>New-London,</hi> about Sixteen Miles from my own Houſe, lifting up my Heart to GOD by the way, in Thouſands <hi>of Ejaculations,</hi> with the moſt Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Application of Mind; and ſurely, <hi>I had Fainted unleſs I had Believed,</hi> from our Saviours Words before mentioned, <hi>to ſee the Goodneſs of GOD in the Land of the Living.</hi> I tarried in the Goalers Houſe about an Hour before he Committed me, and then pretty ſuddenly he ſaid to me, <hi>Come, Young Man, you muſt go to Cage.</hi> It put me a little out of Frame, for I gueſſed by the Expreſſion and the Air he uſed, that he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted me; however I followed him readily, &amp; entered the inner Priſon with more Conſtancy than I expected. But towards the cloſe of the Day I grew very Penſive, and taking a deliberate Survey of things; the Proſpect of the Sufferings of the Approaching, Night in a a <hi>dark Goal,</hi> with out Fire or Lodging, in a very Cold Seaſon, was ſomewhat ſhocking to me: yet I muſt ſay that by itſelf conſidered, it was the ſmalleſt Article in my <hi>Complicated Diſtreſs;</hi> for greater was the looſing <hi>Wife, Friends,</hi> &amp;c with all other Worldly good things at once, as I then expected to do, &amp; to be expoſed to all outward Miſerys, Harred, Reproach and Infamy; but greateſt of all were the thoughts of this, that my <hi>Spiritual Intereſt</hi> was as yet not at all Secured; and that whilſt I
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002696_0014_0FE60BD992E9DBA0"/>
earneſtly ſought GOD, for Chriſt, &amp; Pardon, &amp; Grace, I might Poſſibly be found taking part with his Enemies, and ſo Fighting againſt my own Salvation. All thoſe Doleful Idea's were Stamped upon my Soul, in the brighteſt &amp; deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mpreſhons poſſible &amp; under theſe Agonies <hi>my Fleſh and my Heart Cryed out for GOD, for the Strong and Living GOD</hi> I Supplicated his Mercy for Chriſts ſake, Confeſſing my Sin and Miſery, I Bleſſed him for his Word, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to his Omniſciency, that I Deſired <hi>to keep His Precepts,</hi> I Implored His Spirit to <hi>Help my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities</hi> and <hi>to Lead me into all Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, looking into my Bible, I lit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Eighth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and read on to the Thirty Fifth Verſe, whereupon I was blown up into an <hi>Extatick Joy,</hi> I thought I had now Aſſurance of my Union to Chriſt, and that <hi>nothing ſhould Separate me from His Love;</hi> this Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture laſted me that Night, but the next Day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Vaniſhed, the Darkneſs Recurring upon my Soul (if poſſible) in a more formidable hue I than ever.</p>
            <p>I was in tne Goal <hi>Five Days,</hi> in which time <hi>John Rogers</hi> and his Company often Viſited and Treated me with ſufficient expreſſions of the tendereſt Regard, Procuring me a Lodging in the Goalers Houſe the firſt Night (otherwiſe tis like I ſhould have Dyed of the Cold, being a Man of a tender Conſtitution, and not Inured to Hardſhips) and afterwards they furniſhed me with Lodging and other things for my Comfort
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002696_0015_0FE60BE2CE12EF90"/>
during my Impriſonment. I told them of what I met with the <hi>Firſt Night,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>it was from the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and that the preſent Deſertion was but for <hi>the Proof of my Faith and Patience.</hi> They Counſelled me to Perſevere with all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and aſſured me that in ſo doing I ſhould anon meet with ſuch clear Light as would fully aſſure me in all Points wherein I doubted, and yield me a Solid Support under all Sufferings I was willing enough to Believe them; but told them, that <hi>the Work of Faith was not wrought in me,</hi> asI feared, without which there is no Union to Chriſt, nor poſſibility of Pleaſing GOD. I gave them two Reaſon of this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That I could not Perceive the Guilt of Sin Removed from off my Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That I could not Diſcern in my Soul ſuch Actings towards and upon Chriſt, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the Effects of a Living Faith.</p>
            <p>To all which they ſaid, that it was now a Dark Hour with me, but in GOD's time He would bring me into Marvellous Light, if I Remained Conſtant and Unſhaken in my Sufferings, and were not aſhamed of the Croſs of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The next Remarkable that happened, was upon reading, Rom. 10.9, 10. <hi>If thou ſhalt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that GOD hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the heart man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is made unto Salvation.</hi> Hereupon I made ſome pauſe upon the Words, &amp; anon took them
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002696_0015_0FE60BE2CE12EF90"/>
fully to Anſwer my Doubts about a <hi>Saving Faith,</hi> for moſt certain it was that I Believed that GOD Raiſed Chriſt from the Dead, and thereupon I v a again Exalted above Meaſure, like him deſcribed, Hab 2.4 <hi>He whoſe Soul is liſted up, is not upright in him: but the Juſt ſhall Live by his Faith.</hi> My Sorrows were now turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Joy, and my Prayers into Praiſes of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; and thus I kindled <hi>a Fire &amp; Compaſſed my ſelf about with Sparks;</hi> But GOD did not ſay to me, as in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 50.11. — <hi>Walk in the light of your Fire, and in the ſparks that ye have kindled. This ſhall ye have of nine hand, ye ſhall ly down in ſorrow.</hi> This Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation laſted me not long, for I ſoon called to mind that its ſaid, <hi>The Devils alſo Believe and Tremble,</hi> Jam. 2.9. And now I began to examine my Faith, whether it differed from that of the Devils? &amp; though I could not well tell what Faith they had, yet to my Confuſion of Face I could not find that I my ſelf had any other than that I had had, for then above Twenty Years, even ever ſince that my <hi>Mother taught me</hi> that Chriſt was Delivered for the Offences of the Elect and Aroſe again for their Juſtification: a mere Hiſtorical Faith, such as any Wicked Man may have. On the Fifth Day of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinement, my Wife againſt my expreſs Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition having Paid the Fine, and Procured a Mandamus to the Goaler to Diſcharge me, the Meſſenger came in the Morning: This was Surprizing and Unwelcome News to me, for
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002696_0016_0FE60BE2D9CE4320"/>
that Morning I had awaked in a Marvellous Calm, every thing was Pleaſant &amp; Eaſie to me; I could Believe and Conclude any thing in my own Favour without any Premiſſes at all: and it ſeemed to me the more Spiritual way, &amp; indeed the only way of the Spirit, and now I hoped all would be well; amongſt other things I had a Deſire to be <hi>Baptized</hi> by <hi>John Rogers;</hi> thoſe words in <hi>Act.</hi> 22.16. ran much in my mind, <hi>And now why tarrieſt thou? ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins,</hi> &amp;c. And accordingly was Baptiſed of him as ſoon as Releaſed from Priſon, by bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Body in the Water: after which I went home, it being Tueſday. The Reſidue of that Week I walked in Darkneſs and deep Diſtreſs, for as I was <hi>without Light</hi> ſo I was <hi>without Comfort.</hi> The next Sabbath <hi>John Rogers</hi> and his Company, held a meeting at my Houſe, and he Preached and Prayed there. I was Refreſhed to ſee their Perſons, but not at all moved with their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All that Spirituality I had ſome times found in that way, and they had talked ſo much of, was now clean Evaniſhed, and an Horrour of <hi>thick Darkneſs</hi> reſted on me, and ſo I ſpent moſt of the enſuing Week, yet the Darkneſs was not unto Deſpair. I held faſt that Promiſe; that <hi>they that ſeek ſhall find,</hi> &amp;c. and Cryed to GOD Inceſſantly, but no Anſwer of Prayer, no Help from the Word, no Conference with Friends; for my Straight was now too great for that, my beſt Friends alſo had Surceaſed the Uſe of Arguments with me, and all other Means, except what they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002696_0016_0FE60BE2D9CE4320"/>
did in their Cloſets, or eſpecially what was done by a Day of Prayer Privately kept on my account by ſome of the Church that Week; upon whom its ſaid there was an Extraordinary &amp; Undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit of Prayer poured forth, at length I forced my ſelf to a Conſideration of things, and finally thus Reſolved, <hi>viz.</hi> That in as much as this Newly Embraced Religion ſeemed at the preſent the more Probable way wherein to find Chriſt and Peace, I would by no means Decline, ſeeking after him therein, at leaſt till I had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Light; yet withal that I would more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pry into it, and take nothing upon truſt from Men, &amp; accordingly I Prepared ſundry <hi>Queſtions</hi> for <hi>John Rogers</hi> his Solution at the next Meeting, which happened at his Houſe the next Sabbath, where I mentioned theſe Three, Deſiring to know what was to be Believed, in the Premiſſes, and alſo from what Scripture Grounds;</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>Whether the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion between Chriſt and a Beliver be the ſame with what is of the Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſt,</hi> viz <hi>a Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Whether the Sufferings of Chriſt in His Followers,</hi> viz. <hi>In the Bodies of the Saints, be of equal Value and Merit, with thoſe he Suffered in His Own Perſon, according to their Kind and Degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Whether an Eternal Decree of GOD had Determined the Salvation of thoſe we call the Elect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002696_0017_0FE60BE615458E80"/>I ſoon Perceived the Queries were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected to every one; however there was a very Profound Silence and Attention in the Aſſembly, Whilſt he with all poſſible wilyneſs, as it were, Confounded the Three Queſtions together and then there was no Queſtion in it: So that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Anſwer was both Needleſs and impoſſible: and then he went On quoting a multitude of Scriptures, and heaping up Words but with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Confuſion, and of no Pertinency or Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy to my purpoſe, until no Mortal <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have gueſſed at his Opinion about the matters, or have known by his Anſwer what the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were, nor ſcarcely to what Science they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed.</p>
            <p>After this, he ended his Diſcourſe with a Flouriſh to this Effect, viz. <hi>Thou doeſt well to ſeek Light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but thou our breſt to Conſider that thou art but a Babe in Chriſt, and ſeeſt Men but as Trees, and mayeſt ſoon Diſadvantage thy ſelf by too Curious an Inquiſuiveneſs into deep Matters of Faith; thou hadſt better be Content to Believe and Walk by what Light thou art Capable of, till by Reaſon of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe thou ſhalt be able to Digeſt ſtrong Meat: for my own part it was once with me as tis now with thee, but now its otherwiſe for theſe and ſuch like Wonderful Myſteries, are now all ſo Plain and Eaſie to me, as that I do not Deſire a better Knowlege of them than what I have, for I can ſee. Eye to Eye and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand as Perfectly as the Pen Men of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did, what they wrote, and ſo it will be with thee are long, if thou abide in the Truth, and remain</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002696_0017_0FE60BE615458E80"/>
               <hi>unmovable and ſtedfaſt in thy Sufferings for Chriſt.</hi> I was Confounded at his Talk, for indeed I think no Man would have looked for ſuch an Anſwer from a Miniſter of Chriſt; I ſaid not much upon it, but Determined to ſcan it in time convenient: And accordingly when I came Home, having Earneſtly begged Aſſiſtance of GOD, to make juſt and reaſonable Reflections upon it, I began &amp; conſidered <hi>Firſt</hi> the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the <hi>two firſt</hi> of them I judged to be very neceſſary to be well underſtood, in order to the being of a right Faith: as to the <hi>Third,</hi> I judged it a point of great concern, to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by every Chriſtian; and all Three of the Queſtions to Reſpect nothing but Revealed Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I conſidered my ſelf, and although I had as low thoughts of my Ability to Diſcern Spiritual things in a Spiritual Manner, as any one could have had of me; yet when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Maturity of my Years, and that from a Child I had had ſome Knowlege of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and withal that my underſtanding was not Deſpicable, I judged my ſelf capable of a Doctrinal Knowlege of any Revealed Truth; and how any ſuch Knowlege ſhould endanger my Spiritual Intereſt I could not conceive, for it is Written, that <hi>without Knowlege the mind can't be good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Laſt Place</hi> I conſidered the Reſpondent <hi>John Rogers</hi> and his Anſwer, and thought I, if he be a Miniſter of Chriſt, and if he be Guided by GOD's Spirit, and eſpecially if in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002696_0018_0FE60BE627923BD8"/>
and Infallible Manner, as he Profeſſes, then he has been giving me a reaſon of the Hope that is in him with Meekneſs and Fear, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 15. and has been feeding me with the Bread of Knowlege, For what Chriſt ſays to <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 21.15, 16 <hi>Feed my Lambs,</hi> is no leſs Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of every Miniſter of Chriſt. But I could not take his Anſwer by any means under ſuch a Conſtruction, without utterly excluding my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, according to which it was plain that he Induſtriouſly Concealed from me his own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Laboured with much Craftineſs to divert me from further ſearches after any Solid Knowlege in the matters propoſed.</p>
            <p>I Remember as I came home from that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I Rode part of the way with one of the Company, who ſaid thus to me, <hi>viz. why, Thee was't upon ſome very high Queries with</hi> John.</p>
            <p>I Anſwered him to this Effect, that all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith were high Things. But ſaid he, <hi>John Anſwered thee very notably.</hi> And I believe that man ſpake the mind of the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; for Ignorance in the Underſtanding, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in the Heart, &amp; a falſe Peace in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, make up the Three-fold Veil with which <hi>the God of this World</hi> Blinds the Eyes of that <hi>Poor Beſotted People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to Return, I Dwelt upon theſe Reflections ſeveral Days, and it pleaſed GOD to Reſtrain by Degrees, that Spirit of Prejudice whereby I was Blaſſed againſt the Truth, ſo that I was able to think more Indifferently and to Argue
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002696_0018_0FE60BE627923BD8"/>
more Regularly about Things, which I thought to be my Duty and Intereſt to Improve, and accordingly I preſſed forward with all poſſible Endeavours to try all things.</p>
            <p>I was quickly brought to a ſtand about <hi>my Miniſter;</hi> but my affections were ſo ſtrongly towards him that I could not eaſily Conclude againſt him, alſo the further progreſs I made in Tryal of his Doctrines the more I Scrupled them, my Scruples Increaſed to Doubts, till I had Little to ſay for the defence of the moſt of them, at Length I was afraid any Longer to Adhere to them, yet at preſent far from a good Opinion of the true Religion; but began to be able with ſome degree of Calmneſs, to Confer with others about Principles which laid me under great Advantage for Conviction, till at Length I came to be pretty well Satisfied that the Aſſemblies Catechiſm, in the General, was Orthodox, yet ſtill I Doubted of ſome things in it, particularly <hi>the Doctrine of Election;</hi> I could not bear that an Irrevocable Decree of GOD ſhould have Determined that, whilſt it Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo very Doubtful with me concerning my Self, till I perceived the main difficulty with me was touching my own Election; and that as to the Doctrine in general, I was not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>I began now to have ſad tho'ts of my Late Deviation from the Truth, &amp; at the end of three Weeks made <hi>a Publick Recantation,</hi> which the Church accepting, Received Me into their Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:002696_0019_0FE60BF31C31D5A0"/>And thus it pleaſed GOD to bring me intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly off from my adherence to that Faction, and their Errors; and that Principally without the force of arguments from Miniſters or Books, for I could Converſe but Little with them, but rather as the Prophet ſays, Zec. 4 6 <hi>Not by Might nor by Power, but by my Spirit ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Still after all there Remained Heavy upon me the Guilt of Sin and great Darkneſs and Uncertainty about my Spiritual Eſtate, I Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the tho'ts of thoſe Miſerable <hi>Jews</hi> who Periſhed in the Wilderneſs through the juſt Wrath of GOD, after their Deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and never ſaw the <hi>Good Land.</hi> I read Mr <hi>Guthery</hi> about the <hi>Tryal of a Saving Interest in Chriſt:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>'s <hi>Sincere Convert,</hi> with other Books to the ſame Effect, and Diverſe times had almoſt Concluded in my own Favour, but <hi>Shepard</hi> was ſo exceedingly ſearching, that he ſhewed me from time to time, my deceits of Heart, Miſtakes, Preſumptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo broke me off from every hold, drave me from every reſting place, and brought me many a time to my Wits end.</p>
            <p>In my Darkneſs I applyed to my ſelf, almoſt in Deſpair, what God ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 9 16 <hi>For this cauſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my Wonders in thee.</hi> I could now ſee nothing in the paſt Providences of my Life, but a ſeries of Evil from the Hand of GOD, and little Hopes of better things for the future, which brought on the Fears of my Non-Election, &amp; every thing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002696_0019_0FE60BF31C31D5A0"/>
ſeemed to Argue my Reprobation. Theſe deep Diſcouragements were alſo Accompany'd with the Blackeſt Temptations, through the force whereof I was ready to envy the Salvation of others. This Startled me, as what carried in it the expreſs Image of Satan I Cryed to God for Pardon and Strength; and thus I paſſed many Weeks, till Providentially reading the Thirty Firſt Chapter of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> &amp; the Third Verſe, <hi>I have Loved thee with an Everlaſting Love: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with Loving Kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> At the firſt view I was ready to have taken the Words for a full Proof of my Election, but ſoon call'd to mind how I uſed to be Impoſed upon, and that it concerned me to try every thing &amp; take nothing unreaſonably. However the Words brought with them a <hi>Sweet Influence,</hi> and were more excellent than to be lightly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over, I read them again and again, but was for ſome time at a loſs how to Improve them. By <hi>Everlaſting Love,</hi> I underſtood <hi>GOD's Eternal Electing Love,</hi> and by <hi>Drawing,</hi> &amp;c I underſtood <hi>Effectual Calling:</hi> Hereupon I Propounded to my ſelf two <hi>Queſtions</hi> from the Words, Firſt, <hi>Have I been the Subject of Loving Kindneſs?</hi> And if ſo, then Secondly, <hi>Have I been drawn thereby?</hi> For if I can Affirm theſe two, I muſt thence ln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my Election.</p>
            <p>Then taking a ſtrict Survey of things, I ſaw to my great Comfort, that I had Experienced abundance of Favours from the Hand of GOD, whereof divers had been Extraordinary great,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002696_0020_0FE60BF327B19F00"/>
and eſpecially my late Wonderful Inlargement from the Chains of Error. Such Reflections made me look again on the words to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which appeared now with another Aſpect: I conſidered that the moſt High, had <hi>Wonders of Mercy,</hi> as well as <hi>of Judgment</hi> to ſhew, and 'twas poſſible his Deſigns concerning me were to ſhew <hi>the Wonders of Free Grace.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Second Queſtion</hi> alſo I reſolved in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, for I found my Heart to be Senſibly drawn to Love, Fear, Acknowlege &amp; Worſhip GOD for all his Benefits: but yet whether I were Saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Effectually drawn I was at a loſs, and ſo Concluded nothing as to the Point of Election; but ſtill the Sweet Impreſſion of the Words Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a long time; whereby I was Supported and Carryed on with ſome Chearfulneſs, till by a Sermon of Mr. <hi>Noyes,</hi> I was caſt down to the Duſt; in which Sermon, he ſhewed from thoſe Words, Prov. 23.7. <hi>As he thinketh in his Heart, ſo is he:</hi> That a Mans Eſtate might be known to him <hi>by the ſetled bent &amp; Inclination of his Heart,</hi> &amp;c Which put me upon ſearching my Heart; by which I diſcovered nothing that Evidenced to my Satisfaction any real Change, I found it very much ſet upon Earthly things, Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons very ſtrong &amp; Unmortified. And although I Earneſtly deſired to eſcape Eternal Death, yet could not at that time Perceive any real Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actings or Diſpoſitions of my Soul towards GOD. Hereupon I was very Diſconſolate, my Patience was now almoſt at an end, and I feared
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002696_0020_0FE60BF327B19F00"/>
GOD's would be quite, &amp; his Spirit would ceaſe to ſtrive with me: And thus it was with me ſome time, till it Pleaſed the Lord to Refreſh my expiring Hopes, by that good Promiſe to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 18.15. <hi>And behold I am with thee, and will keep thee —For I wil not leave thee, till I have done that which I have ſpoken to thee of.</hi> This was Life from the dead to me; and by the ſtrength of this I walked many Days. (O who can expreſs the ſolid and ſubſtantial Supports of GOD's Promiſes?) Yet it did not Convert me; it did not carry me to Chriſt, nor Reveal Him to me; but I remained as before, ſave only the preſent Support of it.</p>
            <p>Quickly after this I entred into a more ſtrict Search of the Myſtery of a Juſtifying Faith; which the Divines variouſly Expreſs, ſometimes calling it <hi>a mans going out of himſelf to Chriſt for Life;</hi> and ſuch like Deſcriptions they give of it: I knew what the Scripture, and They, ſaid of it, and could ſpeak about it as I had Learned; but I had no Spiritual or Feeling Senſe of it, nor could I Conceive what it was in Reality ſo to do: And when I conſidered the Neceſſity of Juſtification, Adoption &amp; Sanctification, a New Heart and Life, with Victory over all Spiritual Enemies in order to Life and Bleſſedneſs; to be obtained only by going out of my Self to CHRIST for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which thing I could neither Do, nor poſſibly Underſtand what it meant, my Salvation look'd then Impoſſible. My Hopes were then reduced to the loweſt Ebb,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002696_0021_0FE60BF433556350"/>
and I was about to quit both Hopes and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours about it. Now things were come to the laſt Extremity, which is the fitteſt ſeaſon for Omnipotency to Interpoſe: Iſa. 37.3. <hi>The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are brought to the Birth, &amp; there is not ſtrength to bring forth.</hi> But now CHRIST's Hour was nearer than I knew of; for the next Sabbath, Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> (that Man of God) in his firſt Prayer of the Forenoon Exerciſe, framed a Petition to GOD in theſe words; <hi>viz. That although the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in our way to the Heavenly</hi> Canaan, <hi>might ſeem Inſuperable to us, by reaſon of the City being Walled up to Heaven; and of the Mighty</hi> Anakims <hi>who muſt be Overcome, Yet that we might not be Diſcouraged, nor in our Hearts turn back into</hi> Egypt; <hi>but that we might be Taught to Look unto JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, who is Entred into the Heavens as Our Fore-runner, and able to Draw us after Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had hereupon ſuch an Interview of CHRIST and of GOD through Him, as I never had had before any thing the like; but how Great! How Excellent! How Wonderful! How Glorious! And how Real and Evident! Words cannot at all Expreſs.</p>
            <p>I ſaw the Lord JESUS CHRIST as having Aſſumed the <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and therein having Done and Suffered in the Place and Behalf of <hi>the Elect,</hi> to the moſt Ample and Compleat Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of GOD the Father, and as being now Exalted unto the Dominion and Government of all Creatures in Heaven and in Earth, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Him as Sitting on a Glorious Throne
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002696_0021_0FE60BF433556350"/>
Exerciſing His Three-fold Office, &amp; ſending forth His Spirit to Offer and Apply to the Elect, the Redemption Purchaſed by Him, working Grace in them and bringing them at Length to a Participation of that Glory whereof He is Lord; and particularly offering <hi>this to me,</hi> with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Freedom &amp; Good-will.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid I <hi>ſaw theſe things,</hi> and what I mean is, that they were Diſcovered to me with more Demonſtration and Reality than things which occupy our Senſes are Evident to us when ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially preſent.</p>
            <p>And now, hereupon whether my whole Soul did agreeably make out after Him, ſo as to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Him as He is Offered in the Goſpel, and was then particularly Offered to me, were a great Thing for me to ſay.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, You will look for the Evidence of it in my Converſation; and if there may be any thing found Evidential of the Truth of my Profeſſion, let <hi>GOD have the Praiſe of it, through whoſe Grace—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whatſoever ſhall appear Otherwiſe, he that ſhall be forwardeſt to Reprove me for it in Love, ſhall moſt indear himſelf to me; <hi>Let the Juſt ſmite me it ſhall be a Kindneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now you have had a True and Punctual Account, of the moſt material Paſſages, both as to my being Led into Error, and gracious Return out of it; it being one of the wonderful Works of <hi>Him who is Perfect in Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:002696_0022_0FE60BF4434F0008"/>I ſhall only add, That for diverſe years after, I was frequently Aſſaulted with Temptations to call all in Queſtion over again; To Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether I had not Apoſtatized from CHRIST and His Truth, which has been no ſmall Annoyance and the occaſion of a great deal of Trouble to me; but the Grace of GOD has been ſufficient for me hitherto.</p>
            <p>And I will <hi>Praiſe Him</hi> who has done great Things for me; For He <hi>ſent from above,</hi> He <hi>took me,</hi> He <hi>drew me out of many Waters,</hi> He delivered me <hi>from the horrible Pit &amp; miry Clay,</hi> He brought me <hi>out of Darkneſs into Marvellous Light,</hi> He ſet my <hi>Feet upon a Rock</hi> and has put <hi>a New Song into my Mouth, Even Praiſe to GOD.</hi>

Light within is not GOD, nor is it Mans Soul, but an Heavenly and Divine Principle, which Excites &amp; Diſpoſes Men to that which is good; a little while after, he makes it a Subſtance, yea a palpable Subſtance, and ſays, that GOD is wrap't up in it, and cannot be Separated from it, he calls it the Vehicle of GOD: Sometimes the Spiritual Body of Chriſt, the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt which came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: A Minute after this, he makes it an Eatable Subſtance, and ſays, that Good Men do Eat it and Drink the Blood of it, and ſo are Nouriſhed unto Eternal Life, and this he calls the Communion of the Body &amp; Blood of Chriſt. Moreover, he ſays, that this Light is Properly and Immediately the Saviour, yet he Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges Jeſus Chriſt too, and his Sufferings: He holds his Sufferings and Death to be Univerſal, that is, for all Men, and Meritorious, that is, to the Purchaſing the Light within to be Imparted to every Man, which Light will Procure him Pardon of Sin, and Peace with GOD, and Work a Compleat Salvation for him, if he be willing, and thus he makes the Light within to be the Saviour, and Jeſus Chriſt to be the Purchaſer of that Saviour, and ſo he makes, as it were, two Saviours, one more Remote, and the other more Immediate: the Remoter by his Merits pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing the more Immediate Saviour, and he by his Merits Purchaſing Grace, Pardon, and Eternal Life. Moreover, He ſayes that this Light is at firſt but as a Seed in the Heart (and

               <p>ELection is GOD's chuſing a Man, &amp;c. which is, when Man has firſt choſen GOD, and Reprobation is the contrary, and never is till the Man has Rejected GOD, yet theſe may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively happen to a Man divers times in his Life, yea in a Week, for a Man may fall away from Saving Grace, and may or may not be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Repentance, as it Pleaſes GOD, yet

               <p>And here obſerve a neceſſary diſtinction, for I have ſaid, if it Pleaſe GOD, and elſe where, I ſay that <hi>Rogers</hi> held the Doctrine of Free-will; wherefore pleaſe to underſtand, by <hi>Rogers</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That every Man has a Power to Will his own Salvation or Damnation, and accordingly to be Saved or Damned; yet this Power is but Temporary in ſome Men, for when GOD has once wrought in a Man Effectual Saving Grace, and a Man is fallen from it, then in that caſe tis not if Men Will, but if GOD Will, that ſuch are Renewed by Repentance and Saved, for the Election is changed, and it happens that the moſt High has the Power of Giving his Grace only to whom he Pleaſes, which Power he had not before, but was under the ſtricteſt Ties of Giving or Withholding of it according to Mans will.</p>

               <p>THe firſt ſort of Quakers were extremely at a Loſs about the Soul of man, and ſeldom ſpake plainly of it, though they agreed in this, That man as Man was not Conſtituted of Soul and Body. Conſidering the Soul according to the Opinions of Philoſophers and Divines; yet the Scriptures ſo plainly &amp; plentifully yielding us ſuch an Idea of it, they were loth but to grant that the Scriptures intended ſomething, when they ſpake of the Soul, and therefore they uſed the Term themſelves alſo; yet at the ſame time ſome of them not knowing what they themſelves meant by it, others meaning only the Intellectual Faculties, whilſt others meant the Breath of God, otherwiſe called the Light within or Chriſt Incarnate. This I ſpeak by my own Knowlege, gained by Perſonal Conferences with divers of them about the Point And agreeable hereto Mr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> an Honeſt and Judicious Baptiſt tells US, that they ſaid, Chriſt came to ſave the Soul, but not the Body; and that elſe where they ſaid, <hi>That by the Soul they intended the Light withm:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he aptly obſerves, that according to Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm, <hi>Chriſt came to Save Himſelf.</hi> And Dr. Cotton <hi>Mather,</hi> in his Book called <hi>Quakeriſm Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played,</hi> Quotes a Paſſage out of one of their Chiefs, in theſe words, <hi>viz.

               <p>THe Civil Powers are the Rulers of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Preſent World; They are the Beaſt that gives Power to the Falſe Prophets; They wield the Sword of the Devils Spirit, and are thoſe Spiritual Wickedneſſes in High Places, againſt whom Chriſtians muſt inceſſantly Wreſtle: Yet ſo as that if their Precepts In join nothing but what's purely Civil, as the Building Bridges, Repairing High Ways, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle not with Matters neither Military nor Eccleſiaſtical, Chriſtians muſt Obey them for the Lord's ſake.

<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002696_0033_0FE60C17C0E57A18"/>
it thus happens, its a caſe of extreme Difficulty with a man, it being of very dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to Obey the Infortune, and yet next to impoſſible to diſtinguiſh his Influence from that of the Good Spirit; for the poor Man has by that time learn'd to believe every Spirit that teſtifies that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, that is, into the mans own Fleſh; for ſo they underſtand the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in his <hi>Firſt Epiſtle, Fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; Second Verſe.</hi> And hence they make not GOD's Word a Touchſtone for the Trying of the Spirits.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 3 Giving an Account of the Vnreaſonableneſs of <hi>John Rogers</hi>'s Beasting of his Sufferings And Offering ſome Advice to ſuch as hold his Principles of Religion.</head>
            <p>I Purpoſe in this Laſt Chapter, to make a few Remarks upon ſome of <hi>John Rogers</hi>'s Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002696_0034_0FE60C17CC258AF8"/>
and the Cauſes of them: To the end it may be known that his Sufferings were not Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor for his Religion and Conſcience, as he vainly and falſly Boaſted, and as ſome ('tis like) have Believed; but that Really he was himſelf a Perſecutor, and that his Sufferings were the Demerits of his horrid Immoralities &amp; Impieties,</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing that he mentioned on the account of his Sufferings, was the <hi>Divorcing his Wife from him</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer; That the Cauſe of it was his Adultery, Beaſtiality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which he had Lived for Divers years, as he Boaſted and Endeavoured partly to juſtify.</p>
            <p>If any in his behalf object that the Proof was lnſufficient, I Anſwer that neither they nor I are Competent to Judge of that. And farther, that upon his Trial, he never denied a tittle of the Charge, and out of Court always Own'd it, and in particular to Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> who was his Council, but athereupon deſerted him and gave an Evidence againſt him; and for the Proof of this, I Refer the Reader to the Records and Files, in the Secretary's Office, at <hi>Hartford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Suffering he Boaſted of, was the taking, <hi>his Children from him,</hi> and Delivering them to their Mother, after the Divorce.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, (Pretermitting what might be ſaid, as to the Equity of that Law of this Colony, Directing and Enabling Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of the Poor, with the Advice of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002696_0034_0FE60C17CC258AF8"/>
to take into their Care ſuch Children as are in danger greatly to ſuffer, as well for want of Competent Education, as for want of Suitable Subſiſtance) that the <hi>Mother</hi> had by Nature and Law as good Right to them as he had. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, The condition of the Children (being very Young) Required the Care of a Mother at the preſent; beſides his Condition at that time forbade their abode with him, who through the force of Enthuſiaſm, went about Raging and Raving to that Degree, as that no Sober Man could have tho't him to be <hi>Compos mentis,</hi> or fit to have been a minute out of <hi>Bedlam,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome Years his Son was returned to him by Authority (which I'm ſure would be as hard a thing for me to Defend as the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) but his Daughter having through GOD's Grace, ſo Effectually Imbibed, not only the Principles of true Religion, but the Real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and Seeds of ſaving Grace (as ſince has been more Evident) Nothing but force could have obliged her to abide with him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none was uſed, for theſe two things he has unſpeakably Rail'd upon &amp; Vilifi'd the Authority of the Government, Charging them with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery in the former, and Perſecution in both.</p>
            <p>Nor was She, who had been Divorced from him able whil'ſt Living to eſcape the Expreſſions of his Rage; he loaded her with all manner of Reproaches and Lies, at an execrable Rate (at the ſame time pretending the greateſt Love) Concerning whom the Rules of truth would
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002696_0035_0FE5F2261BEF3AD8"/>
Juſtifie me in ſpeaking as much of her Exem plary Piety, Charity, Goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c</hi> in Life and of her Faith at Death, as of moſt Good Women that have breathed; but its beſides my purpoſe, nor is my Teſtimony in Favour of my Mother ſo Authentick as others; wherefore in this Reſpect I chooſe rather to Appeal (as I do with all Freedom) to the <hi>Reverend Pious &amp; Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Elder,</hi> and to the <hi>Whole Church and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood at Lyme,</hi> whereof ſhe Lived a Beloved and Died a Lamented Member.</p>
            <p>Another Suffering that he Gloried in, was his Whippings and Impriſonments; of which to ſpeak particularly and to ſhew the Criminal Cauſes of them, would tire my ſelf and you.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let it ſuffice to Affirm, that great Part of his lmpriſonment at <hi>Hartford,</hi> was upon ſtrong Suſpicion of his being Acceſſary to the Burning <hi>New-London Meeting-Houſe,</hi> his Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings there were for moſt Audacious Contempt of Authority, his ſitting on the Gallows was for Blaſphemous Words; and in ſhort, he never Suffered the Loſs of One Hair of his Head, by the Authority, for any Article of his Religion, nor for the Exerciſe of it; unleſs when he has Purpoſely &amp; Contemptuouſly put himſelf under the unavoidable Notice of <hi>Grand Jurors,</hi> or the like, in Labouring on the <hi>Sabbath, Baptiſing,</hi> or ſome ſuch Fact, which the Laws forbid.</p>
            <p>No verily, it was not for his Religion; unleſs this were his Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> to Traduce and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002696_0035_0FE5F2261BEF3AD8"/>
Oppoſe the <hi>Sdbbath, Ordinances, Worſhip, Miniſters and People of God;</hi> yea, and the <hi>Government, Courts and Miniſters of Juſtice,</hi> in their Civil Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, in a ſort, like as if his Salvation had depended upon his being an Inveterate and Conſtant Plague to Mankind: For it was for ſuch things that he ſuffer'd Impriſonments &amp; other Corporal Puniſhments. It was his manner to Ruſh into the Aſſembly on the Lord's Day, in the time of God's Worſhip, in a very Boiſterous Way, and to Charge the Miniſter with Lies &amp; Falſe Doctrine; and to Scream, Shout, Stamp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which he offered inſufferable Moleſtations to the Worſhip and People of God: And this was his manner in the Court alſo, when he pleaſed or had a mind to make himſelf Sport, and he would Laugh at it when he had done, till his Sides ſhook.</p>
            <p>I ſaw him once brought to Court for ſuch a Diſturbance Committed on the Sabbath; he had contrived the matter ſo as to be Juſt without the Door when he was called to anſwer, upon which he Ruſhed into Court with a prodigious Noiſe, his Features and Geſtures expreſſed more Fury than I ever ſaw in a Diſtracted Perſon of any ſort; and I ſoberly think, that if a Legion of Devils had puſh'd him in head-long, his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance had not been more Horrid and Ghaſtly, nor have ſeemed more Praeternatural.</p>
            <p>When he came to the Bar, he demanded of the Court, what their Buſineſs was with him? The Indictment was ordered to be Read. To
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002696_0036_0FE60C1EFB5646F0"/>
which he Pleaded, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> after a new Mode; for as the Clerk Read, ſometimes at the End of a Sentence, and ſometimes at the Beginning, he'd Cry out, <hi>That's a Curſed Lie;</hi> and anon, <hi>That's a Devilliſh Lie!</hi> till at length a number of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, of both Sexes, tuned their Pipes, and Scream'd, Roar'd, Shouted &amp; Stamped, to that Degree of Noiſe, that twas Impoſſible to hear the Clerk Read. (But how contrary to the Meekneſs and Manſuetude of Chriſt's Sheep?) For which the Court put a Fine upon him, and ſo added an Article to the ſum of his Sufferings.</p>
            <p>I am prone to think, he may have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, Over done, by <hi>Officers,</hi> in their Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rates and Fines of him; which if it were ſo, the Authority could not have Redreſſed it, for want of his Application to them in that Reſpect.</p>
            <p>But before I Conclude, Let me Mention ſome other of his Sufferings; which tho' he Fretted at at Home, yet never Complained of Publickly, I mean what hapned to him about his Maid <hi>Mary Ransford;</hi> whom he firſt Bought, then took to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his Bed (at leaſt when he wanted her) till ſhe proved with Child, and in the Fifth or Sixth Month of her Pregnancy, as I remember, he So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Betrothed her to him; then afterwards Dwelling with her ſeveral Years, and having had Two Children by her, upon ſome Diſguſt, put her away, and all by his own Authority A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002696_0036_0FE60C1EFB5646F0"/>
to that Rule in the Law (atleaſt in one reſpect) <hi>Modo quo Oritur pactio, Eodem modo Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvetur,</hi> That in the ſame way that a Contract is made, it may be made Void.</p>
            <p>After which he was Lawfully Married to a Woman <hi>of Oyſter Bay,</hi> of Good Report, ſave only, that by her Religion, ſhe was one of thoſe Quakers, who for their Noiſyneſs,,are called <hi>Singing Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not at all at a loſs, how <hi>John Rogers</hi> and this Quaker Woman, over look'd the ſmall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity in Religion, that was between them, ſo as to Match together; but by what Sophiſtry he levelled that horrible Jogg in his Converſation, Reſpecting <hi>Mary,</hi> aforeſaid, I can't imagine.</p>
            <p>To me, I Remember, he accounted for it after this ſort; Said he, <hi>I have Experienced Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Operations of</hi> GOD <hi>'s Hand upon my Body, as well as upon my Soul;</hi> and ſo Proceeding, Signified to me, that upon his entring into a ſtate of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, he felt ſuch a marvellous Mortification of his Members which were upon the Earth, as that <hi>his Venereal Propenfuy</hi> in particular, ſeemed to be totally Extinguiſhed; but however after he had Incountred the ſharpeſt of his Trials, it flamed forth again, even beyond the Limits of Nature, whereby it was manifeſt that God's Hand was in an Eminent way in it; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, &amp;c.</hi> And I never could get him an Inch further than this; yet he would not make a full Stop neither; but ſignified to me that in a more Convenient Time he would let me into that
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002696_0037_0FE60C2177E710D0"/>
Myſtery, and fully Convince me that he did it by a Divine Impulſe, from Firſt to Laſt I gueſs he told Capt <hi>Witherell,</hi> who was then Judge of the Court, ſomething of this Story, by the Judge's Anſwer to him in Court.</p>
            <p>You ſhall hear the Rounds of the Matter, which you'l think ſtrange(if true) of a Miniſter, yea, more than a Miniſter, an Apoſtle, who had been then Perfectly Free from sin above Twenty Years; it was thus, At a County Court at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>London</hi> (my ſelf a Spectator, with a multitude of others being preſent) came <hi>John Rogers</hi> into Court, leading in his Hand <hi>Mary,</hi> aforeſaid; and Applying himſelf to the Judges, said thus, <hi>viz. I deſire you all to take Notice, that I take this my Servant-maid to be my Wife; I bought her with my Money, and I take her to be my Wife.</hi> Replyed the Judge, <hi>How, how? What do you mean, John? why are you not Publiſhed and Married in an Orderly Way?</hi> Continued he, <hi>I do not Regard your Laws in that Reſpect, nor will I he Married by your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> Then Applying himſelf directlv to the Judge, ſaid, <hi>Capt.</hi> Witherell, <hi>Thou knoweſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Occaſion of this, for I hinted it to thee at ſuch a time.</hi> Replied the Judge, <hi>why, thou filthy</hi> B—t, <hi>I know nothing that thou toldeſt me, but of a baſe Pang of Luſt that befel thee;</hi> Go, <hi>for ſhame; be gone, the Court will not be hindred.</hi>

            <p>In about Three or Four Months, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Mary</hi> brought him a Child, he own'd it and got her with Child again, having ſuffered Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for the Firſt according to Law; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

ſeeing the Second Perſecution, he Charged <hi>Mary,</hi> not to lay the Child to him, if Examined by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſhe promiſed him ſhe would not, but fail'd of her Word; which occaſion'd him further Sufferings for his Conſcience; which ſo Roiled him, that he put her away, and dwelt no more with her.</p>
            <p>And now to Conclude, I am very ſenſib1e, that although GOD has ſaid, That <hi>the Name of the Wicked ſhall Rot;</hi> and often in His Providence fulfils that Threatning, yet that by its felt-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is no ſufficient Warrant to us, to ſulley the Characters of the Dead, becauſe of their Impiety Yet, Methinks, when we are engaged in the Cauſe of Truth againſt Error, for as much as in the eyes of moſt men, nothing tends more to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the Credit of any Religion, than to ſhew the Preachers and eſpecially the Original Founders of it, to have been exceedingly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in their Morals; it may be very Warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea, Neceſſary, and more eſpecially where the Caſe is Peculiar, as this is, that a Man Boaſting <hi>of Perfection,</hi> of <hi>Immediate Communion with God,</hi> and the Conſtant and <hi>Infallible Guidance of His Spirit,</hi> ſhould Deliberately Practice Whoredom, and Live in it Divers Years, and then to ſave himſelf from the juſt Cenſures of men, <hi>father his Debaucheries Upon the Holy Ghost,</hi> as he did, I hope it will be granted that the dark Curtains of <hi>Death</hi> and the Grave, ought not to ſcreen him (in this Reſpect) from the notice of the Living, in the

World in all Succeeding Generations: and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeqently, that no Indifferent Perſon will be Prejudiced at my Animadverſions thereupon.</p>
            <p>AND now, I will in a few words, Apply my ſelf to thoſe who are Leſs Indifferent, and ſo Conclude, I mean, <hi>thoſe who are already fallen into the ſuare of that Fowler.</hi>

            <p>And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Be perſwaded, That its poſſible, you may have been miſtaken in what ever Comforts, Illuminations, or the like, you ſeem to have had: Conſider what the Scriptures ſay, that <hi>There is few that find the way of Life;</hi> That <hi>there is a way</hi>

               <hi>which ſeems Right to a man, but the End thereof are the ways of Death.</hi> That <hi>if it were poſſible the very Elect ſhould be Deceived,</hi> through the Activity of Error; That <hi>there is a Spirit of Error, as wll as a Spirit of Truth;</hi> And that by that Spirit of Error, men are Liable to be miſſed, not only in <hi>Spiritual Things,</hi> but alſo in a <hi>Spiritual Way,</hi> and therefore that it concerns you to Try the Spirits, whither they be of God.</p>
            <p>And ſuffer me to tell you how; and that is according to Gods Inſtitution &amp; the Practice of his People always.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> Do not try the Spirit by the Spirit, for that's no tryal at all: for you know a falſe Spirit will give a falſe Teſtimony in his own Favour, wherefore ſeek ſome Rule for the trying of the Spirits. I'll tell you what the Rule has been and what it is.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Affirmatively;</hi> Before the Finiſhing &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the Scriptures, GOD's SPIRIT in all the Prophets, &amp; alſo in CHRIST &amp; his Apoſtles Evinced his Divinity and Godhead by <hi>Miracles:</hi> and although that be not the General Rule now for the trying of the Spirits, yet Miracles when ſhewn muſt be Granted to be good Proof at all times: So that if one comes to me, Commanding me in the name of the LORD, to take a Voyage into <hi>Turkey,</hi> Preach the Goſpel, or do ſomething <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> out of my particular Calling; now if he

will Verify his Miſſion, <hi>by Raiſing the Dead,</hi> or the like Miraculous Action, I muſt then Believe and Obey; otherwiſe I'll try him by the general Rule, which in Goſpel Times, is this;</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to theſe, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi> Wherefore be intreated to try the Spirits, that is, try your Principles, &amp; try thoſe Extraordinary Motions and Influences which ſometimes you feel, by the Rules of Gods Word.</p>
            <p>I'll mention none of your Principles in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and but one of your Practices, Left I be troublelſome to you; and that is this, when you are moved to Diſturb others in their Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God according to their Conſciences, then try that motion before you execute it. If I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you how you know God moved you thereunto? I know your Anſwer will be,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That you had</hi> a good End in it, <hi>&amp; therefore you know it was from the LORD; for Satan never makes God's Glory his End:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer, The End and Deſign does not of it ſelf warrant the Action, <hi>Balaam</hi> had a Good End in going to Curſe <hi>Iſrael;</hi> it was to Enrich himfelf, which is Lawful for a man to do, provided it be, in a right Way &amp; by due Methods. Moreover <hi>Saul</hi> had a Good end in ſparing the <hi>beſt of the Cattle, &amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> it was to <hi>Sacrifice to the Lord,</hi> a pious End, but the Action no

the leſs abominable to GOD; and ſo had the ſame man, doubtleſs, a good End <hi>in Offering Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, You'll ſay, <hi>That at the time when you felt that Impulſe, you were in</hi> a very Spiritual Frame, <hi>and had very great Aſſurance that you were</hi> a Child of GOD; <hi>and that although Satan be permitted by Transforming himſelf into an Angel of Light, to Impoſe upon</hi> Hypocrites, <hi>yet be cannot ſo Impoſe upon GOD</hi>'s <hi>Children.</hi> This I know is your Principle.</p>
            <p>To which I <hi>Anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> That it Remains to be proved that you are a Child of GOD; for you may be Extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miſtaken in that point, and eſpecially Seeing (as I full well know) that you pretend to no other Proof of it, than the witneſſ of that Spirit, which I am now adviſing you to try; and that thus the caſe is with you in this Reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. You know you are a Child of GOD, becauſe the Spirit of GOD dwells in you, and you are led by it.</item>
               <item>2. You know that the Spirit of GOD dwells in &amp; leads you, becauſe you are a Child of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs,</hi> This is a way of Arguing far below what GOD expects of rational Beings. What is there to be ſpoken of, that can't be proved in this Way? May not the Angels of God, prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Apoſtates, &amp; the Devils prove themſelves <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by this circular Way of arguing, if Sound?
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:002696_0040_0FE60C2B6861F788"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In Anſwer to that Principle, that Satan can't ſo Impoſe on Gods Children; I ſay it Contradicts another of your Principles, and that is the Doctrine of a <hi>mixture of Spirits,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you hold that the Good and the Bad Spirit may perſonally Poſſeſs &amp; Influence a man at the ſame time; as it has often happened, as you ſuppoſe to Divers of you; Particularly to him that went to <hi>Anoint the two Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> Be perſwaded to take a view of <hi>John Rogers,</hi> and try him in ſome reſpects; I do not mean to try whether he be Sav'd or Loſt (that's not our buſineſs, nor may we pry into it) but try whether he were a Miniſter of CHRIST or not; for if he were not, you may well ſuſpect your ſelves to have been miſled by him.</p>
            <p>In trying of his Authority to Preach &amp; Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I think you may ſafely conclude that the Office of a Goſpel Miniſter is like that of a Prieſt, in this Reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>No man takes the honour of it upon himſelf, but he that it called of GOD, as Aaron was,</hi> Heb 5.4. Wherefore the Apoſtle ſays plainly, in Rom. 10.25. <hi>How can they Preach except they be ſent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the Call Of GOD Thereto, is either,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frist, Extraordinary,</hi> as GOD called divers of the Prophets of old, and as CHRIST called the Apoſtles, who always proved their Authority by Miracles; inſomuch that <hi>Moſes</hi> deſpaired of being believed when GOD ſent him to the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:002696_0040_0FE60C2B6861F788"/>
 in Bondage, without the Gift of Miracles; which therefore GOD gave him, that thereby he might prove his Miſſion to be Divine.</p>
            <p>Or,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> lt is <hi>Ordinary, viz.</hi> by <hi>Ordination and Laying on of the Hands of the Persbytery;</hi> whereby that Power which CHRIST at firſt veſted in the Apoſtles, is Delegated and Derived unto them; and this is the uſual way in Goſpel Times, being firſt practiſed by the Apoſtles themſelves, and ever ſince followed in the Church in all Ages; and every man pretending to that Office has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been able to prove his Authority in the one or other of theſe ways, excepting a few ſuch as <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>John Rogers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know he uſed to ſay when pinched in this Point, that his Converts and the Succeſs of his Miniſtry, were the Evidence of his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but if that Argument will do, then was <hi>Mahomet</hi> a Prophet of the LORD, &amp; <hi>Sabbatai Sevi</hi> the Eternal Son of GOD; for they had more Diſciples than he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Once more,</hi> Be perſwaded to make a few ſhort, but Reaſonable Reflections on ſome part of his Life, and ſee if you can therein Diſcover the Characters &amp; Signs of a Miniſter of CHRIST; Particularly the matter about <hi>Mary R<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ford.</hi> And methinks Reaſon ſhould Guide you thus in your tho'ts about it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That ſhe was either his Lawful Wife, or not; if not, then his [W—e,] with whom <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ived in Fornication divers Years; which
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:002696_0041_0FE60C2FA427EF88"/>
cannot poſſibly ſtand with the Perfection he pretended to, and Infallible Guidance of GOD's SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>Or,</p>
            <p>2 If ſhe were his Lawful Wife, then his putting her away was without Sufficient Grounds, not being any where Warranted by Laws neither Divine nor Humane, nay Condemned by his own Writing, &amp; Conſequently he broke Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, and committed Adultery in ſo doing. If you Reply, that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did as bad; I'll Grant it: but I obſerve that they both Repented of, Confeſſed and Forſook their Sins; but he always Juſtified his and Lived in it to the day of his Death, that is his Adultery. If ſhe were his Wife, as I think you will Judge ſhe was, let that land where it will rather than to make him a Fornicator. Now I am perſwaded that if you do but uſe your Underſtandings in the caſe, you cannot Reconcile theſe things and his pretenſions of Holineſs and Purity together; and if not, then what follows, but that he was an <hi>horrible Liar and Impoſtor!</hi> and that all his Doctrines are to be Suſpected and Immediately ſcanned &amp; ſifted to the Bran. Which if GOD Enable you to, I am ſure you will ſoon perceive that you have not been in the way that <hi>Leads to Life,</hi> though it has ſeemed Right to you.</p>
            <p>Cry to GOD for Underſtanding; its He that <hi>Leads the Blind</hi> by a way which they knew not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> Pray and Strive againſt this one Evil in ſpecial, which otherwiſe will greatly <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
