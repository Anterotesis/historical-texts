            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Doddington, Captain Samſon, failed from the Downs on the 23d of April, 1755, in company with the Pelham, the Houghton, the Streatham, and the Edgecourt, all in the ſervice of the Eaſt-India Company, and in about ſeven days got clear of the Channel; during this time Captain Samſon perceived that his ſhip ſailed faſter than any of the others, and he was unwilling to loſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this ſuperiority by keeping them company: He therefore ſtood on alone, and, having very ſoon loſt ſight of them, he made Bonaviſta, one of the Cape de Verd iſlands, lat. 16 north, on the 20th of May; and on the 21ſt he got into Porto Pilor Bay. It now appeared either that he had been miſtaken in ſuppoſing his ſhip to outſail the reſt of the fleet, or that he had loſt time by the courſe he ſteered, for he found the Pelham and the Streatham had reached the Bay two hours before him. The Houghton arrived ſoon afterwards, but the Edgecourt did not come in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the 27th of May, the Doddington, Pelham, Streatham, and Houghton, having taken in their water, proceeded on the voyage together, leaving the Edgecourt in the road; they continued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſteering S. by E. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Samſon, thinking the courſe too far eaſterly, ordered the Doddington to be kept ſouth, which again ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated her from the reſt of the fleet; and, after a fine voyage of ſeven weeks, ſhe made the land of the Cape of Good Hope. Having juſt doubled the Cape, a

new departure was taken from de Agulhas on the 8th of July; and the veſſel having ſteered eaſtward about 24 hours, between the latitude of 35 deg. 30 min. and 36 deg. the Captain ordered her to be kept E. N. E.</p>
            <p>In this courſe ſhe continued till about a quarter before one in the morning of Thurſday, July 17, when ſhe ſtruck: The Officer from whoſe journal this account is taken, was then aſleep in his cabbin; but, being ſuddenly awaked by the ſhock, ſtarted up in the utmoſt conſternation, and made all the haſte he could to get upon the deck; here all the terrors of his ſituation ruſhed upon him at once; he ſaw the men daſhed to and fro by the violence of the ſea that rolled over them, and the ſhip breaking to pieces at every ſtroke of the ſurge; he crawled over, with great difficulty, to the larboard ſide of the quarter-deck, which lay the higheſt out of water, and there he found the Captain, who ſaid very little more than they muſt all periſh; in a few minutes a ſea parted them, and he ſaw him no more. He made a ſhift to get back to the quarter-deck, but he was very much bruiſed, and the ſmall bone of his left arm was broken; all the reſt of the ſhip was under water, and ſhattered to pieces. In this dreadful ſituation, expecting every moment to be ſwallowed up, he heard ſomebody <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> out Land! Upon this he looked eagerly about him, but though he ſaw ſomething which he ſuppoſed was taken for land, he believed it to be only the rage of the ſea on the other ſide of the breakers; at the ſame moment the ſea broke over him with great violence, and not only forced him from his hold, but ſtunned him by a violent blow upon his eye; though from this time he lay inſenſible until after day-light, yet he continued upon the wreck, and when he recovered, he found himſelf made faſt to a plank by a nail that had been forced into his ſhoulder; beſides the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009058_0004_10302D44B88D66D8"/>
he felt from his wounds and bruiſes, he was now ſo benumbed with cold, that he could ſcarce move either hand or foot; he called out as loud as he could, and was heard by the people on the rocks; but they could give him no aſſiſtance, ſo that it was a conſiderable time before he could diſengage himſelf and crawl on ſhore.</p>
            <p>This ſhore was a barren uninhabited rock, in the lat. of 33 deg. 44 min. ſouth, and diſtant about 250 leagues eaſt of the Cape of Good Hope. Here were now met Mr. Evan Jones, chief Mate; Mr. John Collet 2d, Mr. William Webb 3d, and Mr. S. Powel 5th Mate; Richard Topping, carpenter; Neal Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well and Nathaniel Chiſholm, Quarter-maſters; Daniel Ladova, the Captain's ſteward; Henry Sharp, the Surgeon's ſervant; Thomas Arnold, a Black, and John Mackdowal, ſervants to the Captain. Robert Beaſeley, John King, Gilbert Chain, Terence Mole, Jonas Roſenbury, John Glaſs. — Taylor, and Henderick Scantz, ſeamen; John Yets, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipman, and John Liſter, Ralph Smith, and Edward Dyſoy, matroſſes. Theſe perſons, being 23 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, were all that remained of 270 ſouls that were on board when the ſhip ſtruck.</p>
            <p>Their firſt care was to ſearch among the things which had been thrown upon the rocks from the ſhip, for ſomething to cover them, in which they ſucceeded beyond their hopes. The next thing they felt the want of was fire, and this was not ſo eaſily ſupplied; ſome of them attempted to kindle two pieces of wood, by rubbing them together, but without ſucceſs; others went peeping about among the rocks to pick up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might ſerve for a flint and ſteel; after long ſearch they found a box that contained two gun flints and a broken file; this was a joyful acquiſition, but ſtill they had nothing that would kindle from a ſpark, and, till ſomething like tinder could be procured, the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009058_0005_10306ADFE2335F00"/>
flint and ſteel were uſeleſs; a farther ſearch was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore undertaken with inexpreſſible ſolicitude and anxiety; a caſk of gunpowder was at laſt diſcovered, but to their great diſappointment it proved to be wet; however, upon a near examination, a ſmall quantity was found at the bottom of the caſk, which had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no damage; ſome of this they bruiſed on a linen rag, which ſerved them very well for tinder, and a fire was ſoon made; the bruiſed and wounded gathered about it, and the reſt went in ſearch of other neceſſaries, without which the rock could afford them but a ſhort reſpite from deſtruction. In the afternoon a box of wax candles and a caſe of brandy were brought in; both were extremely welcome, eſpecially the brandy, of which every one thought it adviſeable to take a dram; ſoon after ſome others of the party returned with an account that they had diſcovered a caſk almoſt full of freſh water, which was yet of more conſequence than the brandy; and Mr. Jones brought in ſome pieces of ſalt pork, and ſoon after ſome others arrived, driving before them ſeven hogs, which had come on ſhore alive; ſome caſks of beer, water, and flour, were alſo ſeen at a diſtance, but it was not then poſſible to get them over the rocks; the approach of night made it neceſſary to provide ſome ſhelter; all hands therefore were employed to make a tent of ſome canvas that had been thrown on ſhore, which was at laſt effected, though it was ſo ſmall for want of more ſail-cloth, that it would not hold them all. The iſland was much frequented by a kind of water-fowl, ſomething larger than a duck, called a gannet; and the higheſt part of it was covered with their dung; upon this part they were obliged to build their tent, for fear of being overflowed; and they placed thoſe who could not walk, under the tent, and kindled a fire near them; but, as they had paſſed the day without food,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009058_0006_10306AE295770A78"/>
they paſſed the night without reſt; for, beſides that they were ſunk a foot in the fowl's dung, the night was ſo tempeſtuous that the wind blew away their fire, and, before it could be ſcraped together again, the rain put it out.</p>
            <p>In the morning, which was Friday, July the 18th, thoſe that were able went again about the rock, to ſee what could be ſaved from the wreck; but, to their great mortification, they found all the caſks which they had ſeen the night before, except one of beer, and one of flour, ſtaved to pieces againſt the rocks; ſoon after theſe were ſecured, the tide flowed up, and put a ſtop to the work of that day. The company therefore was called together to eat their firſt meal, and ſome raſhers of pork were broiled upon the coals for dinner.</p>
            <p>The ſitting down thus deſolate and forlorn to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, which they uſed to ſhare in the convivial cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, which naturally aroſe from the conſciouſneſs of preſent plenty, and the hope of future, ſtruck them with ſuch a ſenſe of their condition, that they burſt into paſſionate lamentations, wringing their hands, and looking round them with all the wildneſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; in ſuch tumult of mind, our thoughts hurry from one object to another, to fix, if poſſible, upon ſomething that may afford comfort; and one of the company recollecting, that, as the carpenter was among them, they might build a ſloop, if they could procure materials and tools, mentioned this as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of hope to the reſt; every man's attention was immediately turned upon the carpenter, who declared that he had no doubt but he ſhould be able to build a ſloop that would carry them all to ſome port with ſafety, if tools and materials could be found; at that time indeed, they had no rational proſpect of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing either, any more than of being able to victual
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009058_0007_10306AE55DFFA060"/>
a ſloop, if they had one ready built; yet they had no ſooner placed their deliverance one remove beyond total impoſſibility, than they ſeemed to think it neither improbable nor difficult; they began to eat without farther repining, and from that moment the boat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed their whole converſation, and they not only debated upon the ſize and manner of rigging her, but to what port they ſhould ſteer her, whether the Cape or Degagoa.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they had finiſhed their repaſt, ſome went in ſearch of tools, and others to mend the tent; no tools however were found that day.</p>
            <p>Saturday, July 19. They ſecured four butts of water, one caſk of flour, one hogſhead of brandy, and one of their little boats, which had been thrown up by the tide, in a ſhattered condition; but they found no tools, except a ſcraper.</p>
            <p>Sunday, July 20. They had the good fortune to find a hamper, in which there were files, ſail-needles, gimblets, and an azimuth compaſs card. They alſo found two quadrants, a carpenter's adze, a chiſſel, and three ſword-blades, and a cheſt of treaſure. This ſearch was made very early in the morning, as there had been a prodigious ſurf rolling in all the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by which it was reaſonable to ſuppoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be thrown up. At ten o'clock they all aſſembled to prayers, and did not go out again til<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſame day, as they were ſearching a beach, they found the body of a Gentle woman, which they knew to be that of Mrs. Collet, the wife of their ſecond Mate, who was then at a little diſtance from the ſpot The mutual affection of this couple was remarkabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſtepped aſide to Mr. Collet, and ſound means to take him to the other ſide of the rock, while the other two Mates, the carpenter, and ſome others, dug a grave in the bird's dung, in which they depoſited the body, reading over it the burial ſervice, from a French prayer book, which had driven aſhore with her from the wreck. Having thus paid the debt of humanity to the dead, and concealed from Mr. Collet a ſight which would moſt ſenſibly, if not fatally, have affected him, they found means, after ſome days, to dicloſe to him by degrees what they had done, and to give him the wedding-ring, which they had taken from her finger.

            <p>On Monday, July 21. They ſecured ſome more water and pork, and ſound ſome timber plank, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and canvas. Theſe they ſecured with great joy for the boat, though as yet they were in want of many implements, without which it was impoſſible for the carpenter to work. He had juſt finiſhed a ſaw, but he had neither hammer nor nails. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, however, that one of the ſeamen, Hendrick Scantz, a Swede, having picked up an old pair of bellows, brought them to his companions, and told them, that he had been by profeſſion a ſmith, and that with theſe bellows and a forge, which he hoped they would be able, by his directing, to build, he could furniſh the carpenter with all the tools he would want, nails included, as plenty of iron might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

with a tranſport of joy; the ſmith immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to mend the bellows, and the three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing days were ſpent in building a tent and a forge, in bringing together the timber and plank for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter's uſe, who was alſo buſy in getting ready the few tools he had, that he might begin the boat as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, July 24. The carpenter, aſſiſted by Chiſholm, the Quarter-maſter, began to work upon the keel of the boat, which they had determined ſhould be a ſloop, 30 feet long and 12 wide. This day alſo the ſmith finiſhed his ſorge, and laid in a quantity of fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As the lives of the whole company depended upon the carpenter, they watched his recovery with the utmoſt impatience and anxity; and, to their unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy, he was ſo far recovered on the 2d of Auguſt, as to return to his work.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the ſtores which they had ſaved from the wreck were ſo near exhauſted, that they came to an allowance of two ounces of bread a man per day, and had no ſalt pork, except what they were determined to keep to victual their boat; water alſo fell ſhort. In this diſtreſs they had recourſe to ſeveral expedients: They dug a well, in hopes to find a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>When they were driven to great diſtreſs, they killed a hog; but they had generally ſucceſs in fiſhing on a float, and they ſometimes ſent out two at a time. It happened, however, that Mr. Collet, the ſecond Mate, and Mr. Yets, the Midſhipman, were very near being driven out to ſea on one of theſe floats, where they would inevitably have periſhed. — On the 20th of Auguſt they had fiſhing all the afternoon, till about four o'clock, when they weighed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to come in again; but, the wind ſuddenly freſhening up to the weſtward, they found that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of gaining a head, they drove out very faſt.

This gave them freſh hope, and every one was ready to venture out for the deliverance of their friends. The carpenter diſpatched the boat in about a quarter of an hour, and ſhe ſoon overtook the float, and took Collet and Yets on board. They ſoon ſound, however, that the water gained very faſt upon them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

            <p>As they were now afraid of venturing any more on the raſt, the carpenter went again to work on the little boat, and put her into complete repair. Their ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor were the ſupplies they obtained on ſhore leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious; the gannets would ſometimes ſettle in amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing numbers, like a cloud; and ſometimes they would totally diſappear for ſeveral days together. This made them very deſirous of finding ſome way to preſerve the food they caught from putrifaction, that they might lay by the ſurplus of a fortunate day, to ſerve them, when neither gannets nor fiſh were to be caught. They made ſeveral atempts to cure both their fiſh and their fowl by ſmoaking it, but without ſucceſs. They then attempted to make ſalt, but this had like to have been fatal to them all. The ſmith had mended a copper veſſel for the experiment; and they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately began to work, without knowing that their proceſs in ſalt-making would diſſolve the ſurface of the copper into verdigreaſe, and that this ſolution or ruſt of copper was poiſon. Salt, however, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; but the quality that made it poiſonous hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to abound in ſuch a degree, as to make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably offenſive to the taſte: It was therefore thrown away; but thoſe who had ventured to palate it were ſeized with violent cholics, cold ſweats, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>While they were waiting the return of the boat, they were all thrown into the utmoſt conſternation by an accident which happened to the carpenter, who unfortunately cut his leg with an adze, in ſuch a manner, that he was in great danger of bleeding to death, they having no ſurgeon among them, nor any thing proper to apply to the wound. At length, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though with much difficulty, the blood was ſtaunched, and the wound healed without any bad ſymptom ſupervening.</p>
            <p>Saturday, Sept. 6. The weather having been fair for forty-eight hours, they impatiently expected the return of the boat. At noon they became very uneaſy at having ſeen nothing of her; but, juſt as they were ſitting down to dinner, they were agreeably ſurpriſed by two of their people, who came running over the rocks, crying out, the boat! the boat! They all ſtarted up, overjoyed at the ſound, and run to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, however, that he was miſtaken; for, inſtead of running away, they ſurrounded him, and began to whet their lances.

Upon which they thought fit to deſiſt. They then made ſigns for Roſenbury to come to them, who was all this while ſwimming about in the ſea; but he refuſed, and made ſigns that they would kill him. They then pointed to Taylor, intimating that they had not killed him: Upon this he came forward, and having firſt thrown them his piſtol, and all his clothes but his ſhirt, he ventured to put himſelf into their hands. When he came up they offered him to violence, only held the boat's maſts and the piſtol to him, by way of deriding the folly of his attempt to fright them. They ſeemed to be very much pleaſed with the clothes, which they divided among them as far as they would go. They then began to rifle the boat, and having taken all the rope they could find and the hook by which the rudder hung to the ſtern-poſt, they began to knock the ſtern to pieces, for the iron which they ſaw was about it.

The men, therefore, who thought fit ſecretly to take what they deemed their ſhare of this treaſure, were not, in their own opinions, guilty of diſhoneſty, but intended only to ſecure what they feared the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers would monopoliſe, and by this means prevent diſputes which, in their circumſtances, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce fatal effects.

Accordingly three men went on ſhore in the boat, one of which was Thomas Arnold, a black ſervant of the Captain's; carrying with them a ſtring of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber beads. The Black had jumped overboard and ſwam to ſhore, and the natives, in number about forty, followed him.

account of their expedition, that when he firſt got on ſhore they ſeemed very ſhy of him; but he followed them, and, when he came to them, they all ſat down, and deſired him to ſit down by them, which he did. Upon preſenting the ſtring of amber beads to the oldeſt man among them which ſeemed to be their chief, he received it very kindly; and, on making ſigns to them that be wanted to eat, they brought him Indian corn and fruit, and water in a calabaſh to drink. In the evening of the tenth ſeveral natives came down to the water-ſide hallooing to them, which made them endeavour to land, but found it impracticable. In the morning the natives repeated their ſignals, at the ſame time driving down great numbers of cattle, ſuch a goats and bullocks; but ſtill they could not find a place to land.</p>

Four men were ſent in the boat, two to go to meet the four men that landed yeſterday, and to found the river's mouth. In about three hours the two men returned with the other four, but were afraid to attempt to come off, there being too great a ſurf to launce the boat.</p>
            <p>Monday 15. At day light weighed, and ſtood cloſe to the ſhore; and ſeeing them ſtill loth to venture, called to them, that, if they did not come off im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, they muſt be obliged to leave them, being without proviſions, or any likelihood of getting any there. This threatening had its deſired effect, for two of them ventured off in the boat, though there was a large ſurf. When they come on board, they informed them that the natives received the men very civilly, and gave them beef and fiſh to eat, and milk to drink, and conducted them over the mountains, from where they landed, till they met our people. The wind being eaſterly, a fair wind into the river, they all agreed to wait till high water, and run the riſque of the bar. At two in the afternoon they weighed, and made ſail for the river, and got in very well, without ſhipping any water, and anchored in two and an half fathom water.</p>
            <p>Their firſt care was to conſult in what manner to trade with the natives for proviſions and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

bolts, nails, and ſome copper hoops, made into brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets for their arms and legs, which the people in India wear, and call them bangles. Theſe they took on ſhore, and ſhewing them to the natives; at the ſame time making ſigns for what they wanted in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, by kneeling down and gnawing the graſs, holding their hands up like horns, and making a noiſe like that of bullocks, ſheep, &amp;c. which they ſoon underſtood, and were very expeditious in driving down two ſmall bullocks, which they purchaſed for about one pound of copper and three or four braſs buttons, each bullock weighing about five or ſix hundred, very good meat. The ſavages ſeemed very well ſatisfied with their bargain, and promiſed to bring more bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks. They likewiſe brought milk in great quantites, which was purchaſed at a very cheap rate, giving only a braſs button for about two or three gallons. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a ſmall grain, like Guinea wheat, which they purchaſed at the ſame rate, and ground it between two ſtones, and baked it upon ſome embers for bread, hoping it would keep; but it grew mouldy in three days. They therefore uſed to boil it with their meat, and found it very good food. Here they ſtaid about a fortnight, during which time they viſited their towns about ten or twelve miles, where they lived in huts covered with ruſhes like a kind of thatch, and very neat within, and were extremely obliging. At theſe times they uſed to eat with the ſavages, who liked their way of dreſſing victuals, though they are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly fond of the entrails, ſuch as the paunch and guts, which they moſtly eat raw, only ſhaking out the excrement. In ſhort they behaved very ſociably, and were no ways ſhy of their women. Their chief exerciſe is hunting, and their only arms lance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are prodigious active and dexterous with their lances, which they will throw thirty or forty yards, and hit a ſmall head of corn. Among theſe natives, who are entirely black, and all woolly-haired, they ſaw a youth, ſeemingly about twelve or fourteen years of age, quite white; and his features had the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of an European, having fine light hair, not in the leaſt reſembling that of the other natives.</p>
            <p>Monday 29. Having, by the bleſſing of Providence, laid in a comfortable ſtock of proviſions, at five in the morning they weighed, and ſoon got over the bar, And made ſail for the river St. Lucia.</p>
            <p>Nothing material happened till Tueſday April the 6th, when, after ſome difficulty, they got into a river, and moored in three fathom water.</p>
            <p>Here they went on ſhore, and ſoon found the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to be quite another ſort of people from the laſt; for, when they ſhewed them what they had to trade with, they ſignified that they wanted ſome ſmall kind of grain. However, upon ſhewing them braſs buttons, they imediately brought down ſome bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, fowls, potatoes, pumkins, &amp;c.

The ſavages ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have a great veneration for braſs, they carried a braſs handle of an old cheſt and ſhewed it them; for which they immediately offered two bullocks, which was readily agreed to; and they drove them down to our boat. Theſe were a haughty proud peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not ſo honeſt as the former, having detected their principal Governor, whom they paid for a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one of their huts for the night, in ſtealing ſome pieces of iron. They ſtaid here two or three days in the country, in which time they never could get them to eat with them. They likewiſe differed greatly from the other people in their cookery, dreſſing all their victuals in a very cleanly manner, and are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very cleanly in their bodies; the firſt thing they do in the morning is to waſh themſelves all over; then they go to ſome kind of devotion, which they never obſerved in the others. Neither have theſe any of the ornaments the others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, in hopes to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the boat, they weighed and got to the breakers; there they lay beating in a diſmal condition, having no more than eight feet water, and the veſſel drawing five. After half an hour the ſurface was ſmooth, and by the Almighty's providence they got ſafe out of the river St. Lucia. The poor creatures who had left the veſſel, ſome with only a ſhirt and a pair of drawers, travelled along ſhore.</p>
            <p>The veſſel ſtood to the northward till Tueſday at four in the afternoon, when they anchored in Delagoa river in nine fathom, where they found the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
