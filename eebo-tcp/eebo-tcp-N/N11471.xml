            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the present alarming situation of America in general, and the town of Boston in particular; as well as the utter abhorrence which you lately expressed at the conduct of Messrs. USTICKS, for supplying the army under General GAGE, who is now carrying on the siege of Boston, with implements of war, &amp;c. and, notwithstanding that this matter had been previously and earnestly recommended to your most serious attention by the General Committee; yet, are there men to be found, who are base enough, for lucrative considerations, to continue supplying the troops with necessaries, for effecting the immediate destruction of our brethren and fellow-subjects in Boston, who are now suffering the most unjust and cruel hardships in the common cause of America, which, if accomplished, will finally overtake the inhabitants of all the colonies. The consideration of which, induced a number of the Freemen, Freeholders, Merchants, and others, to meet at the house of the Widow VAN DE WATER, in order to devise the most prudent and efficacious means for averting the impending ruin, that such a conduct must inevitably involve us in, and that to the eternal reproach of the community.</p>
            <p>Accordingly a Committee was appointed to wait on those persons, to dissuade them from acting so base and unnatural a part; but, to our inexpressible grief, they were found to be so infatuated with the hopes of gain, that no impression could be made on their minds, of the cruelty, or injustice of their conduct. It was therefore thought by the Meeting, absolutely necessary, once more, in the present posture of affairs, to collect the sense of the city and county, on the propriety of furnishing the troops with hay, straw, &amp;c. as well as boards and plank; the former of which will enable the General (as indeed without it, he cannot) more effectually to take the field, and the latter to make platforms for the artillery, &amp;c. And, as there are now two transports sent here for those articles, as well as others, no doubt.—And as <hi>Ralph Thurman</hi> and <hi>Robert Harding</hi> have been employed to furnish the aforesaid articles, it is earnestly requested that the Freemen, Freeholders, and other inhabitants of the city and county will meet at VI o'clock on next Saturday evening, at the LIBERTY-POLE, in order to signify their sense on the present occasion; as those persons both persist in supplying the army with every necessary, in their way.</p>
