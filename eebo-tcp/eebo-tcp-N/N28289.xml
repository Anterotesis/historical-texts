            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE <hi>CITIZENS</hi> OF THE UNITED STATES:</head>
            <p>WHILE candid and informed hiſtorians and other writers in the chriſtian church, confeſs and lament the ſpirit of intolerance which has frequently degraded their religion, it is hoped that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invaluable extracts from the works of that excellent man, Thomas Jefferſon, the preſent Vice Preſident of the United States, will be an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tribute of reſpect for true religion, correct animoſities among ſectarians, and extend univerſal peace and confidence through our country.</p>
            <p>This publication, appeared to be more needful at this time, when the profeſſors of chriſtianity in the United States, lament that faſts, prayers and ſermons, have been perverted to the purpoſes of war, and the animoſities of party.</p>
            <p>The truly religious man, impreſſed with due reverence for the author of his exiſtence and conſtant preſerver, invariably obtains reſpect, dignity and uſefulneſs, by avoiding the overtures of hypocriſy, and ſpecious pretexts of piety.</p>

Aſſuming no dominion over the faith of others, he reſpectfully reſigns the rites of religion and acts of piety to the acceptance of all men, according to the light they have received, and the dictates of their own conſciences.</p>
            <p>To put an end to perſecutions, jealouſies, rancors and deluſions, reſulting from the union of church and ſtate, by political eſtabliſhments, has been the aim of thoſe who ſecured independence and law for us, as a nation, with the aid of our own valour and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Upon the preſervation of theſe ſacred and ineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable rights, depends a large proportion of our felicity and proſperity at all times.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>DIFFERENT RELIGIONS</hi> RECEIVED INTO THE STATE OF <hi>VIRGINIA.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE firſt ſettlers in this country were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants from England, of the Engliſh church, juſt at a point of time when it was fluſhed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete victory over the religious of all perſuaſions. Poſſeſſed, as they became, of the powers of making adminiſtering, and executing the laws, they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equal intolerance in this country with their Preſbyterian brethren, who had emigrated to the northern government. The poor Quakers were flying from perſecution in England. They caſt their eyes on theſe new countries as aſylums of civil and religious freedom; but they found them free only for the reigning ſect. Several acts of the Virginia aſſembly of 1659, 1662 and 1693.
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:037706_0005_100F415780043238"/>bad made it penal in parents to refuſe to have their children baptized; had prohibited the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful aſſembling of Quakers; had made it penal for any maſter of a veſſel to bring a Quaker into the ſtate; had ordered thoſe already here, and ſuch as ſhould come thereafter, to be impriſoned till they ſhould abjure the country: provided a milder puniſhment for their firſt and ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but death for their third; had inhibited all perſons from ſuffering their meetings in or near their houſes, entertaining them individually, or diſpoſing of books which ſupported their tenets. If no execution took place here, as did in New-England, it was not owing to the moderation of the church, or ſpirit of the legiſlature, as may be inferred from the law itſelf; but to hiſtorical cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which have not been handed down to us. The Anglicans retained full poſſeſſion of the country about a century. Other opinions began then to creep in, and the great care of the government of ſupport their own church, having begotten an equal degree of indolence in its cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, two-thirds of the people had become diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at the commencement of the preſent revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The laws indeed were ſtill oppreſſive on them, but the ſpirit of the one party had ſubſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into moderation, and of the other had riſen to a degree of determination which commanded reſpect.</p>
            <p>The preſent ſtate of our laws on the ſubject of religion is this. The convention of May 1776, in their declaration of rights, declared it to be a truth, and a natural right, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of religion ſhould be free; but when they proceeded to form on that declaration the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of government, inſtead of taking up every principle declared in the bill of rights, and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:037706_0006_100F4170DFD1FB18"/>it by legiſlative ſanction, they paſſed over that which aſſerted our religious rights, leaving them as they found them. The ſame convention, however, when they met as a member of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly in October, 1776, repealed all <hi>acts of parliament</hi> which had rendered criminal the maintaining any opinions in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the forbearing to repair to church, and the exerciſing any mode of worſhip; and ſuſpended the laws giving ſalaries to the clergy, which ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion was made perpetual in October 1779. Statutory oppreſſions in religion being thus wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, we remain at preſent under thoſe only impoſed by the common law; or by our own acts of aſſembly. At the common law, <hi>heresy</hi> was a capital offence, puniſhable by burning. Its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition was left to the eccleſiaſtical judges, before whom the conviction was, till the ſtatute of the 1 El. c. 1. circumſcribed it, by declaring, that nothing ſhould be deemed hereſy, but what had been ſo determined by authority of the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſcriptures, or by one of the four firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral councils, or by ſome other council having for the grounds of their declaration the expreſs and plain words of the ſcriptures. Hereſy, thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed, being an offence at the common law, our act of aſſembly of October, 1777, c. 17. gives cognizance of it to the general court, by declaring that the juriſdiction of that court ſhall be general in all matters at the common law. The execution is by the writ <hi>De hoeretico comburendo.</hi> By our own act of aſſembly of 1705, c. 30. if a perſon brought up in the Chriſtian religion denies the being of a God, or the Trinity, or aſſerts there are more gods than one, or denies the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be true, or the ſcriptures to be of divine authority, he is puniſhable on the firſt offence by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037706_0007_100F415A694CEBF8"/>to hold any office or employment eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, civil, or military; on the ſecond by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to ſue, to take any gift or legacy, to be guardian, executor, or adminiſtrator, and by three years impriſonment without bail. A father's right to the cuſtody of his own children being founded in law on his right of guardianſhip, this being tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away, they may of courſe be ſevered from him, and put by the authority of a court, into more orthodox hands. This is a ſummary view of that religious ſlavery, under which a people have been willing to remain, who have laviſhed their lives and fortunes for the eſtabliſhment of their civil freedom.<note n="*" place="bottom">Furneaux paſſim.</note> The error ſeems not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are ſubject to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have no authority over ſuch natural rights only as we have ſubmitted to them. The rights of conſcience we never ſubmitted, we could not ſubmit. We are anſwerable for them to our God. The legitimate powers of government extend to ſuch acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbour to ſay there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. If it be ſaid, his teſtimony in a court of juſtice cannot be relied on, reject it then, and be the ſtigma on him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint may make him worſe by making him a hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, but it will never make him a truer man. It may fix him obſtinately in his errors, and will not cure them. Reaſon and free inquiry are the only effectual agents againſt error. Give a looſe to them, they will ſupport the true religion, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037706_0008_100F41735FF68A78"/>every falſe one to their tribunal, to the teſt of their inveſtigation. They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free inquiry, Chriſtianity could never have been introduced. Had not free inquiry been indulged at the aera of the reformation, the corruptions of Chriſtianity could not have been purged away. If it be reſtrained now, the preſent corruptions will be protected and new ones en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. Was the government to preſcribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in ſuch keeping as our ſouls are now. Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as a medicine, and the potato as an article of food. Government is juſt as infallible too when it fixes ſyſtems in phyſics. Galileo was ſent to the inquiſition for affirming that the earth was a ſphere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This error how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever at length prevailed, the earth became a globe, and Deſcartes declared it was whirled round its axis by a vortex. The government in which he lived was wiſe enough to ſee that this was no queſtion of civil juriſdiction, or we ſhould all have been involved by authority in vortices. In fact, the vortices have been exploded, and the Newtonian principle of gravitation is now more firmly eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, on the baſis of reaſon, than it would be were the government to ſtep in, and to make it an article of neceſſary faith. Reaſon and experiment have been indulged, and error has fled before them. It is error alone which needs the ſupport of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Truth can ſtand by itſelf. Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you make your inquiſitors? Fallible men; men governed by bad paſſions, by private as well as public reaſons. And why ſubject it to coercion? To produce uniformity. But is unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037706_0009_100F417A612A7A80"/>of opinion deſirable? No more than of face and ſtature. Introduce the bed of Procruſtes then, and as there is danger that the large men may beat the ſmall, make us all of a ſize, by lopping the former and ſtretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The ſeveral ſects perform the office of a cenſor morum over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent men, woman, and children, ſince the introduction of Chriſtianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, impriſoned; yet we have not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? to make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To ſupport roguery and error all over the earth. Let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thouſand millions of people. That theſe profeſs probably a thouſand different ſyſtems of religion. That ours is but one of that thouſand. That if there be but one right, and ours that one, we ſhould wiſh to ſee the 999 wandering ſects gathered into the fold of truth. But againſt ſuch a majority we cannot effect this by force. Reaſon and perſuaſion are the only prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable inſtruments. To make way for theſe, free inquiry muſt be indulged; and how can we wiſh others to indulge it while we refuſe it ourſelves. But every ſtate, ſays an inquiſitor, has eſtabliſhed ſome religion. No two, ſay I, have eſtabliſhed the ſame. Is this a proof of the infallibility of eſtabliſhments? Our ſiſter ſtates of Pennſylvania and New-York, however, have long ſubſiſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any eſtabliſhment at all. The experiment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has anſwered beyond conception. They flouriſh infinitely. Religion is well ſupported; of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds, indeed, but all good enough; all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to preſerve peace and order: or if a ſect
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037706_0010_100F4174EDE2BFF8"/>ariſes, whoſe tenets would ſubvert morals, good ſenſe has fair play, and reaſons and laughs it out of doors, without ſuffering the ſtate to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more diſturbed with religious diſſenſions. On the contrary, their harmony is unparalled, and can be aſcribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, becauſe there is no other circumſtance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy diſcovery, that the way to ſilence religious diſputes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of thoſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical laws. It is true, we are as yet ſecured againſt them by the ſpirit of the times. I doubt whether the people of this country would ſuffer an execution for hereſy, or a three years impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for not comprehending the myſteries of the Trinity. But is the ſpirit of the people an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, a permanent reliance? Is it government? Is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up? Beſides, the ſpirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careleſs. A ſingle zealot may commence perſecutor, and better men be his victims. It can never be too often repeated that the time for fixing every eſſential right on a legal baſis is while our rulers are honeſt, and our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves united. From the concluſion of this war we ſhall be going down hill. It will not then be neceſſary to reſort every moment to the people for ſupport. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights diſregarded. They will forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but in the ſole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting of effect a due reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for rights. The ſhackles, therefore, which ſhall not be knocked off at the concluſion of this
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037706_0011_100F417CB95959C8"/>war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, till our rights ſhall revive or expire in a convulſion.</p>

            <head>An <hi>ACT</hi> for establishing <hi>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM,</hi> passed in the Assembly of Virginia, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the year <hi>1786.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WELL aware that Almighty God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal puniſhments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy and meanneſs, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord both of body and mind, yet choſe not to propogate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do; that the impious preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of legiſlators and rulers, civil as well as eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, who, being themſelves but fallible an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſpired men have aſſumed dominion over the faith of others, ſetting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as ſuch endeavouring to impoſe them on others, hath eſtabliſhed and maintained falſe religions over the greateſt part of the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furniſh contributions of money for the propogation of opinions which he diſbelieves, is ſinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to ſupport this or that teacher of his
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037706_0012_100F4177DD8B85B8"/>own religious perſuaſion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular paſtor whoſe morals he would make his pattern, and whoſe powers he ſeels moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive to righteouſneſs, and is withdrawing from the miniſtry thoſe temporal rewards, which, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an approbation of their perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, are an additional incitement to earneſt and unremitting labours for the inſtruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependance on our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious opinions, more than our opinions in phyſics or geometry; that therefore the proſcribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of truſt and emolument, unleſs he profeſs or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly of thoſe privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellow-citizens he has a natural right; that it tends alſo to corrupt the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honours and emoluments, thoſe who will externally profeſs and conform to it; and though indeed theſe are criminal who do not withſtand ſuch temptation, yet neither are thoſe innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to ſuffer the civil magiſtrate to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude his powers into the field of opinion and to reſtrain the profeſſion or propogation of principles, on ſuppoſition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once deſtroys all religious liberty becauſe he being of courſe judge of that tendency, will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they ſhall ſquare with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purpoſes of civil government, for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts againſt peace
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037706_0013_100F417F5F2115F0"/>and good order; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to herſelf, that ſhe is the proper and ſufficient antagoniſt to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unleſs by human interpoſition diſarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate, errors ceaſing to be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous when it is permitted freely to contradict them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly,</hi> That no man ſhall be compelled to frequent or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any religious worſhip, place or miniſtry what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, nor ſhall be enforced; reſtrained, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, or burthened in his body or goods, nor ſhall otherwiſe ſuffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men ſhall be free to profeſs, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion and that the ſame ſhall in no wiſe diminiſh, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.</p>
            <p>And though we well know that this aſſembly, elected by the people for the ordinary purpoſes of legiſlation only, have no power to reſtrain the acts of ſucceeding Aſſemblies, conſtituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act irrevocable, would he of no effect in law, yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby aſſerted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act ſhall be hereafter paſſed to repeal the preſent or to narrow its operation, ſuch act will be an infringement of natural right.</p>
