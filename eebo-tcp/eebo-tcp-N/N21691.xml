            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF LITTLE JACK.</head>
            <p>THERE was once a poor lame old man that lived in the midſt of a wide uncultivated moor, in the north of England. He had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been a ſoldier, and had almoſt loſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

his own hands; and which ſupplied him with potatoes and vegetables; beſides this, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gained a few halfpence by opening a gate for travellers, which ſtood near his houſe. He did not indeed get much, becauſe few people paſſed that way. What he earned was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, enough to purchaſe cloaths, and the few neceſſaries he wanted. But though poor, he was ſtrictly honeſt, and never failed night and morning to addreſs his prayers to God; by which means he was reſpected by all who knew him, much more than many who were ſuperior to him in rank and fortune. This old man had one domeſtic. In his walks over the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he one day found a little kid that had loſt its mother, and was almoſt famiſhed with hunger: he took it home to his cottage, fed it with the produce of his garden, and nurſed it till it grew ſtrong and vigorous. Little Nan, (for that was the name he gave it) returned his cares with gratitude, and became as much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to him as a dog. All day ſhe browzed upon the herbage that grew around his hut, and at night repoſed upon the ſame bed of ſtraw with her maſter. Frequently did ſhe divert him with her innocent tricks and gambols. She would neſtle her little head in his boſom, and eat out of his hand part of his ſcanty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of bread; which he never failed to divide with his favourite. The old man often beheld her with ſilent joy, and, in the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent effuſions of his heart, would lift his hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to heaven, and thank the Deity, that, even in the midſt of poverty and diſtreſs, had raiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him up one faithful friend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:028539_0004_0FD938C2C7C86A98"/>One night, in the beginning of winter, the old man thought he heard the feeble cries and lamentations of a child. As he was naturally charitable, he aroſe and ſtruck a light, and, going out of his cottage, examined on every ſide: It was not long before he diſcerned an infant, which had probably been dropped by ſome ſtrolling beggar or gypſy. The old man ſtood amazed at the ſight, and knew not what to do. Shall I, ſaid he, who find it ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to live at preſent, incumber myſelf with the care of an helpleſs infant, that will not for many years be capable of contributing to its own ſubſiſtence? And yet, added he, ſoftening with pity, can I deny aſſiſtance to an human being ſtill more miſerable than myſelf?—Will not that Providence which feeds the birds of the wood and the beaſts of the field, and which has promiſed to bleſs all thoſe that are kind and charitable, aſſiſt my feeble endeavours?—At leaſt, let me give it food and lodging for this night; for without I receive it into my cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the poor abandoned wretch muſt periſh with cold before the morning.

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028539_0005_0FD938C740D97010"/>
called her to him, and, preſenting the child to the teat, was overjoyed to find, that it ſucked as naturally as if it had really found a mother. The goat too ſeemed to receive pleaſure from the efforts of the child, and ſubmitted without oppoſition to diſcharge the duties of a nurſe. Contented with this experiment, the old man wrapped the child up as warmly as he could, and ſtretched himſelf out to reſt with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of having done an humane action. Early the next morning he was awakened by the cries of the child for food, which with the aſſiſtance of his faithful Nan, he ſuckled as he had done the night before. And now the old man began to feel an intereſt in the child, which made him defer ſome time longer the taking meaſures to be delivered from its care. Who knows, ſaid he, but Providence which has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this child in ſo wonderful a manner, may have deſtined it to ſomething equally won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in his future life; and may bleſs me as the humble agent of his decrees? At leaſt, as he grows bigger, he will be a pleaſure and comfort to me, in this lonely cabin, and will aſſiſt in cutting turf for fuel, and cultivating the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. From this time he became more and more attached to the little foundling; who, in a ſhort time, learned to conſider the old man as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and delighted him with its innocent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes. Gentle Nanny too, the goat, ſeemed to adopt him with equal tenderneſs as her off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring: ſhe would ſtretch herſelf out upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ground, while he crawled upon his hands and knees towards her; and when he had ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>

his hunger by ſucking, he would neſtle between her legs and go to ſleep in her boſom.</p>
            <p>It was wonderful to ſee how this child, thus left to nature, increaſed in ſtrength and vigour. Unfettered by bandages or reſtraints, his limbs acquired their due proportions and form; his countenance was full and florid, and gave indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of perfect health; and, at an age when other children are ſcarcely able to ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the aſſiſtance of a nurſe, this little foundling could run alone. It was true, that he ſometimes failed in his attempts, and fell to the ground; but the ground was ſoft, and little Jack, for ſo the old man called him, was not tender or delicate; he never minded thumps or bruiſes, but boldly ſcrambled up again and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his way. In a ſhort time, little Jack was completely maſter of his legs; and as the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer came on, he attended his mamma, the

goat, upon the common, and uſed to play with her for hours together; ſometimes rolling under her belly, now climbing upon her back, and friſking about as if he had really been a kid. As to his cloathing, Jack was not much incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with it; he had neither ſhoes, nor ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor ſhirt; but the weather was warm, and Jack felt himſelf ſo much lighter for every kind of exerciſe. In a ſhort time after this, Jack began to imitate the ſounds of his papa the man, and his mamma the goat; nor was it long before he learned to ſpeak articulately. The old man delighted with this firſt dawn of reaſon, uſed to place him upon his knee, and converſe with him for hours together, while his pottage was ſlowly boiling amid the embers of a turf fire. As he grew bigger, Jack became of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able uſe to his father; he could truſt him to look after the gate, and open it during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: and, as to the cookery of the family, it was not long before Jack was a complete pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and could make broth almoſt as well as his daddy himſelf. During the winter nights, the old man uſed to entertain him with ſtories of what he had ſeen during his youth; the battles and ſieges he had been witneſs to, and the hardſhips he had undergone; all this he related with ſo much vivacity that Jack was never tired of liſtening. But what delighted him beyond meaſure was to ſee daddy ſhoulder his crutch, inſtead of a muſket, and give the word of command.

            <figure/>
            <p>The old man too inſtructed him in ſuch plain and ſimple morals and religion, as he was able to explain. "Never tell an untruth, Jack, ſaid he, even though you were to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>About this time, the poor goat which had nurſed Jack ſo faithfully, grew ill and died. He tended her with the greateſt affection and aſſiduity during her illneſs, brought her the freſheſt herbs for food, and would frequently ſupport her head for hours together upon his little boſom. But it was all in vain; he loſt his poor mammy, as he uſed to call her, and was for ſome time inconſolable; for Jack, though his knowledge was bounded, had an uncommon degree of gratitude and affection in his temper. He was not able to talk as finely about love, tenderneſs, and ſenſibility, as many other little boys, that have enjoyed greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of education; but he felt the reality of them in his heart, and thought it ſo natural to love every thing that loves us, that he never even ſuſpected it was poſſible to do otherwiſe. The poor goat was buried in the old man's garden, and thither little Jack would often come and call upon his poor mammy Nan, and aſk her why ſhe had left him? One day, as he was thus employed, a lady happened to come by in a carriage, and overheard him before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

upon? Jack anſwered, that it was his poor mammy, that was buried in the garden. The lady thought it very odd to hear of ſuch a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial place, and therefore proceeded to queſtion him, "How did your mammy get her living?" ſaid ſhe. "She uſed to graze here upon the common all day long," ſaid Jack. The lady was ſtill more aſtoniſhed; but the old man came out of his hut, and explained the whole affair to her, which ſurpriſed her very much; for though this lady had ſeen a great deal of the world, and had read a variety of books, it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once entered into her head that a child might grow ſtrong and vigorous by ſucking a goat, inſtead of eating pap. She therefore looked at Jack with amazement, admired his brown but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"Will you go with me, little boy, ſaid ſhe, and I will take care of you, if you behave well?" "No, ſaid Jack, I muſt ſtay with daddy; he has taken care of me for many years, and now I muſt take care of him; otherwiſe I ſhould like very well to go with ſuch a ſweet, good-natured lady." The lady was not diſpleaſed with Jack's anſwer, and putting her hand in her pocket, gave him half a crown, to buy him ſhoes and ſtockings, and purſued her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>Jack was not unacquainted with the uſe of money, as he had been often ſent to the next village to purchaſe bread and neceſſaries; but he was totally unacquainted with the uſe of ſhoes and ſtockings, which he had never worn in his life, or felt the want of. The next day, however, the old man bade him run to town, and lay his money out as the lady had deſired; for he had too much honour to think of diſobeying her commands, or ſuffering it to be expended for any other purpoſe. It was not long before Jack returned; but the old man was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee him come back as bare as he went out. "Heigh, Jack! ſaid he, where are the ſhoes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If conduct did Jack diſplay; from which it was eaſy to perceive, that he had an excellent ſoul, and generous temper. One failing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Jack was liable to; though a very good natured boy, he was a little too jealous of his honour. His daddy had taught him the uſe of his hands and legs, and Jack had ſuch diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the art of boxing, that he could beat every boy in the neighbourhood, of his age and ſize. Even if they were a head taller, it made no difference to Jack, provided they ſaid any thing to wound his honour; for otherwiſe he was the moſt mild, pacific creature in the world. One day that he had been ſent to the village, he returned with his eyes black, and his face ſwelled to a frightful ſize: it was even with difficulty that he was able to walk at all, ſo ſore was he with the pomelling he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. "What have you been doing now, Jack?" ſaid the old man.—"Only fighting with Dick the butcher." "You rogue, ſaid the old man, he is twice as big as you are, and the beſt fighter in all the country." "What does that ſignify, ſaid Jack, he called you an old beggarman, and then I ſtruck him; and I will ſtrike him again whenever he calls you ſo, even if he ſhould beat me to pieces; for you know, daddy, that you are not a beggarman, but a ſoldier."</p>
            <p>In this manner lived little Jack, until he was twelve years old; at this time his poor old daddy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He one day therefore called little Jack to his bed-ſide, and preſſing his hand affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, told him that he was juſt going to die. Little Jack burſt into a flood of tears at this information, but his daddy deſired him to compoſe himſelf, and attend to the laſt advice

At this Jack renewed his tears and ſobbings, for he was unable to reſtrain them. But the old man ſaid; "Have patience, my child; though I ſhould leave this world, as I have always been ſtrictly honeſt and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to do my duty, I do not doubt but God will pity me, and convey me to a better place; where I ſhall be happier than I have ever been here. This is what I have always taught you, and this belief gives me the greateſt comfort in my laſt moments. The only regret I feel, is for you, my deareſt child, whom I leave unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for. But you are ſtrong and vigorous, and almoſt able to get your living. As ſoon as I am dead, you muſt go to the next village and inform the people, that they may come and bury me.

The poor little boy was thus left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtitute and knew not what to do; but one of the farmers, who had been acquainted with him before, offered to take him into his houſe, and give him his victuals, for a few months, till he could find a ſervice. Jack thankfully accepted the offer, and ſerved him faithfully for ſeveral months; during which time he learned to milk, to drive the plough, and never refuſed any kind of work he was able to perform. But, by ill luck, this good-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red farmer contracted a fever, by over-heating himſelf in the harveſt, and died in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of winter. His wife was therefore obliged to diſcharge her ſervants, and Jack was again turned looſe upon the world, with only his cloaths, and a ſhilling in his pocket, which his kind miſtreſs had made him a preſent of. He was very ſorry for the loſs of his maſter; but he was now grown bigger and ſtronger, and thought he ſhould eaſily find employment. He therefore ſet out upon his travels, walking all day, and inquiring at every farm-houſe for work. But in this attempt he was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, for nobody choſe to employ a ſtranger and though he lived with the greateſt econ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a morſel of bread to eat. Jack, however, was not of a temper to be eaſily caſt down; he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſolutely on all day, but towards evening was overtaken by a violent ſtorm of rain, which wetted him to the ſkin before he could find a buſh for ſhelter. Now, poor Jack began to think of his old daddy, and the comforts he had formerly enjoyed upon the common, where he had always a roof to ſhelter him, and a ſlice of bread for ſupper. But tears and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were vain; and therefore, as ſoon as the ſtorm was over, he purſued his journey, in hopes of finding ſome barn or out-houſe to creep into for the reſt of the night. While he was thus wandering about, he ſaw at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance a great light, which ſeemed to come from ſome prodigious fire. Jack did not know what this could be; but, in his preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he thought a fire no diſagreeable object, and therefore determined to approach it. When he came nearer, he ſaw a large build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ſeemed to ſpout fire and ſmoke at ſeveral openings, and heard an inceſſant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of blows, and the rattling of chains. Jack was at firſt a little frightened, but ſummoning all his courage, he crept cautiouſly on to the building, and looking through a chink, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſeveral men and boys employed in blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fires and hammering burning maſſes of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

roughly, what buſineſs he had there? Jack an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with great humility, that he was a poor boy, looking out for work; that he had had no food all day, and was wet to the ſkin with the rain, which was evident enough from the appearance of his cloaths. By great good luck, the man he ſpoke to was good natured, and therefore not only permitted him to ſtay by the fire, but gave him ſome broken victuals for his ſupper. After this, he laid himſelf down in a corner, and ſlept without diſturbance till morning. He was ſcarcely awake the next day, when the maſter of the forge came in to overlook his men, who finding Jack, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtory, began to reproach him as a la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that he would not do to earn a ſubſiſtence. Well, my boy, ſaid the maſter, if this is true, you ſhall ſoon be tried; nobody need be idle here; ſo calling his foreman, he ordered him to ſet that lad to work, and pay him in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his deſerts. Jack now thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf completely happy, and worked with ſo much aſſiduity, that he ſoon gained a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable livelihood, and acquired the eſteem of his maſter. But unfortunately, he was a little too unreſerved in his converſation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the ſtory of his former life and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This was great matter of diverſion to all the other boys of the forge; who, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were inclined to be merry, would call him little Jack the beggar-boy, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the baaing of a goat. This was too much for his iraſcible temper, and he never failed to reſent it; by which means he was engaged in continual quarrels and combats, to the great diſturbance of the houſe; ſo that his maſter, though in other reſpects perfectly ſatisfied with his behaviour, began to fear that he ſhould at laſt be obliged to diſcharge him.</p>
            <p>It happened one day, that a large company of gentlemen and ladies were introduced to ſee the works. The maſter attended them, and explained, with great politeneſs, every part of his manufacture. They viewed with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the different methods by which that uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary ore of iron is rendered fit for human uſe. They examined the furnaces where it is melted down, to diſengage it from the dreſs, with which it is mixed in the bowels of the earth, and whence it runs down in liquid

torrents like fire. They beheld with equal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the prodigious hammers which, moved by the force of water, mould it into maſſy bars, for the ſervice of man. While they were buſy in examining theſe different proceſſes, they were alarmed by a ſudden noiſe of diſcord, which broke out on the other ſide of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the maſter inquiring into the cauſe, was told, that it was only little Jack, who was fighting with Tom the collier. At this, the maſter cried out, in a paſſion, there is no peace to be expected in the furnace, while that little raſcal is employed; ſend him to me, and I will inſtantly diſcharge him. At this moment Jack appeared, all covered with blood and dirt, and ſtood before his angry judge in a modeſt, but reſolute poſture. "Is this the reward, ſaid his maſter, you little audacious vagabond, of all my kindneſs? Can you never refrain a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028539_0020_0FD938F947D89B20"/>
               <figure/>
from broils and fighting? But I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to bear it no longer; and therefore you ſhall never, from this hour, do a ſingle ſtroke of work for me." "Sir, replied Jack, with great humility, but yet with firmneſs, I am extremely ſorry to have diſobliged you, nor have I ever done it willingly, ſince I have been here; and if the other boys would only mind their buſineſs as well as I do, and not moleſt me, you would not have been offended now; for I defy them all to ſay, that ſince I have been in the houſe, I have ever given any one the leaſt provocation, or ever refuſed to the utmoſt of my ſtrength, to do whatever I have been ordered." "That's true, in good faith, ſaid the foreman; I muſt do little Jack the juſtice to ſay that there is not a more honeſt, ſober, and induſtrious lad about the place. Set him to what you will, he never ſculks, never grumbles, never ſlights his work;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028539_0021_0FD938FBC477DC20"/>
and if it were not for a little paſſion and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I don't believe there would be his fellow in England." "Well, ſaid the maſter a little molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but what is the cauſe of all this ſudden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance?" "Sir, anſwered Jack, it is Tom that has been abuſing me and telling me that my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a beggarman and my mother a nanny-goat; and when I deſired him to be quiet, he went baaing all about the houſe; and this I could not bear; for as to my poor father he was an honeſt ſoldier, and if I did ſuck a goat, ſhe was the beſt creature in the world, and I won't hear her abuſed while I have any ſtrength in my body." At this harangue, the whole audience were ſcarcely able to refrain from laughing, and the maſter, with more compoſure, told Jack to mind his buſineſs, and threatened the other boys with puniſhment, if they diſturbed him.</p>
            <p>But a lady who was in company ſeemed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly intereſted about little Jack, and when ſhe had heard his ſtory, ſaid, this muſt certainly be the little boy who opened a gate ſeveral years paſt for me upon Norcot Moor. I remember being ſtruck with his appearance, and hearing him lament the loſs of the goat that nurſed him. I was very much affected with his hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and ſince he deſerves ſo good a character, if you will part with him, I will inſtantly take him into my ſervice. The maſter replied, that he ſhould part with him with great ſatisfaction to ſuch an excellent miſtreſs; that indeed the boy deſerved all the commend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tions which had been given; but ſince the other lads had ſuch an habit of plaguing, and Jack was of ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient a temper, he deſpaired of ever compoſing
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028539_0022_0FD938FD39B7E100"/>
their animoſities. Jack was then called, and informed of the lady's offer, which he inſtantly accepted with the greateſt readineſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived immediate directions to her houſe.</p>
            <p>Jack was now in a new ſphere of life. His face was waſhed, his hair combed, he was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed afreſh, and appeared a very ſmart active lad. His buſineſs was, to help in the ſtable, to water the horſes, to clean ſhoes, to perform errands, and to do all the jobs of the family; and in the diſcharge of theſe ſervices, he ſoon gave univerſal ſatisfaction. He was inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable in doing what he was ordered, never grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, or appeared out of temper, and ſeemed ſo quiet and inoffenſive in his manners, that every body wondered how he had acquired the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of being quarrelſome. In a ſhort time, he became both the favourite and the drudge of the whole family; for, ſpeak but kindly to him and call him a little ſoldier, and Jack was at every one's diſpoſal. This was Jack's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular foible and vanity; at his leiſure hours, he would divert himſelf by the hour together, in poizing a dung fork, charging with a broom ſtick, and ſtanding centry at the ſtable door. Another propenſity of Jack's, which now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered itſelf, was an immoderate love of horſes. The inſtant he was introduced into the ſtable, he attached himſelf ſo ſtrongly to theſe animals, that you would have taken him for one of the ſame ſpecies, or at leaſt a near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Jack was never tired with rubbing down and carrying them; the coachman had ſcarcely any buſineſs but to ſit upon his box; all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Jack, nor was it ever known that he neglected a ſingle particular. But what gave him more pleaſure than all the reſt, was ſometimes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his miſtreſs upon a little horſe, which he managed with infinite dexterit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Jack too diſcovered a great diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion for all the uſeful and mechanic arts. He had ſerved an apprenticeſhip already to the manufactory of iron, and of this he was almoſt as vain as being a ſoldier. As he began to extend his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the world, he ſaw that nothing could be done without iron. How would you plough the ground, ſaid Jack; how would you dig your garden; how would you even light a fire, dreſs a dinner, ſhoe a horſe, or do the leaſt thing in the world, if we workmen at the forge did not take the trouble of preparing it for you? Thus Jack would ſometimes expatiate upon the dignity and importance of his own profeſſion, to the great admiration of all the other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>Theſe ideas naturally gave Jack a great eſteem for the profeſſion of a blackſmith, and in his occaſional viſits to the forge with the horſes, he learnt to make and fix a ſhoe as neatly as any artiſt in the country.</p>
            <p>Nor were Jack's talents confined to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory of iron; his love of horſes was ſo great, and his intereſt in every thing that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, that it was not long before he acquired a very competent knowledge in the ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

tools; in which he ſucceeded as well as in every thing elſe; ſo that he was looked upon by every body as a very active, ingenious boy.</p>
            <p>There was in the family, where he now lived, a young gentleman, the nephew of his miſtreſs, who had loſt his parents, and was therefore brought up by his aunt. As Maſter Willets was ſomething younger than Jack, and a very good-natured boy, he ſoon began to take notice of him, and be much diverted with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Jack, indeed, was not undeſerving this attention; for although he could not boaſt any great advantages of education, his conduct was entirely free from all the vices to which ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

to the animals entruſted to his care, he not only refrained from uſing them ill, but was never tired with doing them good offices. Add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this, he was ſober, temperate, hardy, active, and ingenious, and deſpiſed a lie as much as any of his betters. Maſter Willets now began to be much pleaſed with playing at cric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and trap-ball with Jack, who excelled at both theſe games. Maſter Willets had a little horſe which Jack looked after; and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with looking after him in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he uſed to ride him at his leiſure hours with ſo much care and addreſs, that in a ſhort time he made him the moſt gentle and docile little animal in the country. Jack had acquired this knowledge partly from his own experience, and partly from paying particular attention to an itinerant riding-maſter that had lately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited various feats in that neighbourhood. Jack attended him ſo cloſely, and made ſo good
<figure/>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:028539_0026_0FD9390BA2877A40"/>
an uſe of his time, that he learned to imitate almoſt every thing he ſaw, and uſed to divert the ſervants and his young maſter with acting the tailor's riding to Brentford.</p>
            <p>The young gentleman had a maſter who uſed to come three times a week to teach him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and writing, and geography. Jack uſed to be ſometimes in the room while the leſſons were given, and liſtened according to cuſtom with ſo much attention to all that paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he received very conſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for his own improvement. He had now a little money, and he laid ſome of it out to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe pens and paper and a ſlate, with which at night he uſed to imitate every thing he had heard and ſeen in the day: and his little maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who began to love him very ſincerely, when he ſaw him ſo deſirous of improvement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, under one pretence or another, to have him generally in the room while he was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtruction himſelf.</p>
            <p>In this manner Jack went on for ſome years, leading a life very agreeable to himſelf, and diſcharging his duty very much to the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his miſtreſs. An unlucky accident at length happened to interrupt his tranquility. A young gentleman came down to viſit Maſter. Willets, who, having been educated in France, and among genteel people in London, had a very great taſte for finery, and a ſupreme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

with his hat under his arm, and a little ſword
<figure/>
by his ſide. This young man had a ſupreme contempt for all the vulgar, which he did not attempt to conceal; and when he had heard the ſtory of Jack's birth and education, he could ſcarcely bear to be in the ſame room with him. Jack ſoon perceived the averſion which the ſtranger entertained for him, and at firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to remove it, by every civility in his power; but when he found that he gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by all his humility, his temper, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally haughty, took fire, and, as far as he dared, he plainly ſhowed all the reſentment he felt.</p>
            <p>It happened one day, after Jack had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome very mortifying uſage from this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> gentleman, that as he was walking along <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

beaſts in a cart. Among the reſt was a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſized monkey, who was not under cover like the reſt, and played ſo many antic tricks, and made ſo many grimaces, as engaged all Jack's attention, and delighted him very much, for he always had a propenſity for every ſpecies of drollery. After a variety of queſtions and converſation, the ſhowman, who probably wanted to be rid of his monkey, propoſed to Jack to purchaſe him for half a crown. Jack could not reſiſt the temptation of being maſter of ſuch a droll diverting animal, and therefore agreed to the bargain. But when he was left alone with his purchaſe, whom he led along by a chain, he ſoon began to repent his haſte, and knew not how to diſpoſe of him. As there was however, no remedy, Jack brought him carefully home, and confined him ſafe in an out-houſe, which was not applied to any uſe. In this ſituation he kept him ſeveral days, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out accident, and frequently viſited him at his leiſure hours, with apples, nuts, and ſuch other preſents as he could procure. Among the other tricks which the monkey had been taught to perform, he would riſe upon his hind legs at the word of command, and bow with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt politeneſs to the company. Jack, who had found out theſe accompliſhments in his friend, could not reſiſt the impulſe of making them ſubſervient to his reſentment. He, therefore, one day, procured ſome flour, with which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>wdered his monkey's head, fixed a large paper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g to his neck, put an old hat under his arm, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> tied a large iron ſkewer to his ſide, inſtead of a ſword; and thus accoutred led him about
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028539_0029_0FD8C03CF6EC3DE0"/>
with infinite ſatisfaction, calling him Monſieur, and jabbering ſuch broken French as he had picked up from the converſation of the viſitor. It happened very unluckily at this very inſtant, that the young gentleman himſelf paſſed by, and inſtantly ſaw at one glance the intended copy of himſelf, and all the malice of little Jack; who was leading him along, and calling
<figure/>
to him to hold up his head and look like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of faſhion. Rage inſtantly took poſſeſſion of his mind, and drawing his ſword, which he happened to have on, he ran the poor monkey through with a ſudden thruſt, and laid him dead upon the ground. What more he might have done is uncertain, for Jack, who was not of a temper to ſee calmly ſuch an outrage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon an animal whom he conſider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:028539_0030_0FD9391600F9A628"/>
into twenty pieces. The young gentleman himſelf received a fall in the ſcuffle, which, though it did him no material damage, daubed all his cloaths, and totally ſpoiled the whole
<figure/>
arrangement of his dreſs. At this inſtant, the lady herſelf, who had heard the noiſe, came down, and the violence of poor Jack was too apparent to be excuſed. Jack, indeed, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive to his miſtreſs, whom he was very ſorry to have offended; but, when he was ordered to make conceſſions to the young gentleman, as the only conditions upon which he could be kept in the family, he abſolutely refuſed. He owned, indeed, that he was much to blame for reſenting the provocations he had received, and endeavouring to make his miſtreſs's company ridiculous; but as to what he had done in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his friend the monkey, there were no poſſible arguments which could convince him
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028539_0031_0FD9391779AC34B8"/>
he was in the leaſt to blame; nor would he have made ſubmiſſions to the king himſelf. This unfortunate obſtinacy of Jack's was the occaſion of his being diſcharged, very much to the regret of the lady herſelf, and ſtill more to that of Maſter Willets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jack therefore packed up his cloaths in a little bundle, ſhook all his fellow-ſervants by the hand, took an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate leave of his kind maſter, and once more ſallied out upon his travels.</p>

your looks—come along with us, and I don't doubt in a few weeks, you'll be as complete a ſoldier as thoſe who have been in the army for years." Jack made no anſwer to this, but by inſtantly poizing his ſtick, cocking his hat fiercely, and going through the whole manuel exerciſe.—"Prodigious, indeed, cried the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, I ſee you have been in the army already, and can eat fire as well as any of us. But come with us, my brave lad, you ſhall live well, have little to do, but now and then fight for your king and country, as every gentleman ought; and in a ſhort time, I don't doubt but I ſhall ſee you a captain, or ſome great man, rolling in wealth, which you have got out of

He is enough to make a whole company deſert."—"No, ſaid Jack, they ſhall never deſert through me; for though I know this, as I am at preſent out of employment, and have a great reſpect for the character of a gentleman ſoldier, I will enliſt directly in your regiment." "A brave fellow, indeed, ſaid the ſerjeant; here, my boy, here is your money and your cockade, both which he directly preſented, for fear his recruit ſhould change his mind; and thus in a moment little Jack became a ſoldier.</p>

All this country conſiſts of very lofty hills, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with trees and ſhrubs of various kinds, which never loſe their leaves, from the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warmth of the climate. Through theſe it is frequently difficult to force a way, and the hills themſelves abound in precipices. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that one of the officers whom Jack was attending upon a ſhooting party, took aim at ſome great bird and brought it down; but as it fell into ſome deep valley, over ſome rocks which it was impoſſible to deſcend, they deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of gaining their prey. Jack, immediately, with officious haſte, ſet off and ran down the more level ſide of the hill, thinking to make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>t and reach the valley into which the bird <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> fallen. He ſet off, therefore, but as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> totally ignorant of the country, he, in a ſhort time, buried himſelf ſo deep in the wood, which grew continually thicker, that he knew
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028539_0035_0FD9391FD57C88B8"/>
not which way to proceed. He then thought it moſt prudent to return; but this he found as difficult to effect as the other. He therefore wandered about the woods with inconceivable difficulty all day, but could never find his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany nor even reach the ſhore, or obtain the proſpect of the ſea. At length the night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and Jack, who perceived it to be impoſſible to do that in the dark, which he had not been able to effect in the light, lay down under a rock, and compoſed himſelf to reſt, as well as he was able. The next day he roſe with the light, and once more attempted to regain the ſhore: but unfortunately he had totally loſt all idea of the direction he ought to purſue, and ſaw nothing around him but the diſmal proſpect of woods and hills and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, without a guide or path. Jack now began to be very hungry, but as he had a fowling piece with him, and powder and ſhot, he ſoon
<figure/>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:028539_0036_0FD9396941218148"/>
procured himſelf a dinner; and kindling a fire with ſome dry leaves and ſticks, he roaſted his game upon the embers, and dined as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably as he could be expected to do in ſo forlorn a ſituation. Finding himſelf much refreſhed, he purſued his journey, but with as little ſucceſs as ever. On the third day, he indeed came in ſight of the ſea, but found that he was quite on a different ſide of the iſland from that where he left the ſhip, and that neither ſhip nor boat was to be ſeen. Jack now loſt all hopes of rejoining his comrades, for he knew the ſhip was to ſail at fartheſt upon the third day, and would not wait for him. He, therefore, ſat down very penſively upon a rock, and caſt his eyes upon the vaſt extent of ocean which was ſtretched out before him. He found himſelf now abandoned upon a ſtrange country, without a ſingle friend, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, or even any one who ſpoke the ſame language. He at firſt thought of ſeeking out the natives, and making known to them his deplorable ſtate; but he began to fear the reception he might meet with among them. They might not be pleaſed, he thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with his company, and might take the liberty of treating him as the white men generally treat the blacks when they get them into their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; that is, make him work hard with very little victuals, and knock him on the head if he attempted to run away. And therefore, ſays Jack, as he was meditating all alone, it may, perhaps, be better for me to ſtay quiet where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> am. It is true, indeed, I ſhall not have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028539_0037_0FD9392444502810"/>
have nobody to quarrel with me, or baa, or laugh at my poor daddy and mammy. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I at preſent ſee how I ſhall get a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, when my powder and ſhot are all expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but however I ſhall hardly be ſtarved, for I ſaw ſeveral kinds of fruit in the woods, and ſome roots which look very much like carrots. As to cloaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when mine wear out, I ſhall not much want new ones; for the weather is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly warm; and therefore, all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I don't ſee why I ſhould not be as happy here as in any other place.—When Jack had finiſhed his ſpeech, he ſet himſelf to find a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the night. He had not examined far before he found a dry cavern in a rock, which he thought would prove a very comfortable reſidence; he therefore went to work with an hatchet he had with him, and cut ſome boughs of trees, which he ſpread upon the floor, and over thoſe a long ſilky kind of graſs, which he found in plenty near the place, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a bed. His next care was, how to ſecure himſelf in caſe of any attack, for he did not know whether the iſland contained any wild beaſts or not. He therefore cut down ſeveral branches of trees, and wove them into a kind of wicker work, as he had ſeen the men do hurdles when he lived with the farmer; with this contrivance he found he could very ſecurely barricade the entrance of his cave. And now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the evening was again approaching, he began to feel himſelf hungry, and ſeeking along t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

with a reſolution to ſtruggle manfully with the difficulties of his ſituation. He walked into the woods and ſaw ſeveral kinds of fruit and berries, ſome of which he ventured to eat, as the birds had pecked them, and found the taſte agreeable. He alſo dug up ſeveral ſpecies of roots, but feared to taſte them leſt they ſhould be poiſonous. At length, he ſelected one that very much reſembled a potatoe, and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to roaſt it in the embers, and taſte a very ſmall bit. It can hardly, thought Jack, do me much hurt, in ſo very ſmall a quantity; and if that agrees with me I will increaſe the doſe. The root was fortunately extremely wholeſome and nutritive, ſo that Jack was in a very ſhort time tolerably ſecure againſt the danger of wanting food. In this manner did Jack lead a kind of ſavage, but tolerably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented life, for ſeveral months; during which time he enjoyed perfect health, and was never diſcovered by any of the natives. He uſed ſeveral times a-day to viſit the ſhore, in hopes that ſome ſhip might paſs that way and deliver him from his ſolitary impriſonment. This, at length, happened, by the boat of an Engliſh ſhip, that was ſailing to India, happening to touch upon the coaſt; Jack inſtantly hailed the crew, and the officer, upon hearing the ſtory, agreed to receive him; the captain too, when he found that Jack was by no means a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſailor, very willingly gave him his paſſage, and promiſed him a gratuity beſides, if he behaved well.</p>
            <p>Jack arrived in India without any accident, and relating his ſtory, was permitted to ſerve
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028539_0039_0FD93925BAF80220"/>
               <figure/>
in another regiment as his own was no longer there. He ſoon diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his courage and good behaviour on ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and before long was advanced to the rank of a ſerjeant. In this capacity, he was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon an expedition into the remote parts of the country. The little army in which he ſerved now marched on for ſeveral weeks, through a burning climate, and in want of all the neceſſaries of life. At length, they entered upon ſome extenſive plains, which bordered upon the celebrated country of the Tartars. Jack was perfectly well acquainted with the hiſtory of this people, and their method of fighting. He knew them to be ſome of the beſt horſemen in the world; indefatigable in their attacks, though often repulſed returning to the charge, and not to be invaded with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity; he, therefore, took the liberty of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028539_0040_0FD9397003A2B9A0"/>
to ſome of the officers, that nothing could be more dangerous than their raſhly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging themſelves in thoſe extenſive plains, where they were every moment expoſed to the attacks of cavalry, without any ſucceſsful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod

of defence, or place of retreat, in caſe of any misfortune. Theſe remonſtrances were not much attended to, and after a few hours farther march, they were alarmed by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a conſiderable body of Tartar horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. They, however, drew up with all the order they were able, and firing ſeveral ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive vollies, endeavoured to keep the enemy at a diſtance. But the Tartars had no deſign of doing that with a conſiderable loſs, which they were ſure of doing with eaſe and ſafety. Inſtead therefore of charging the Europeans, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with giving continual alarms, and menacing them on every ſide, without
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028539_0041_0FD9392B77D526E0"/>
expoſing themſelves to any conſiderable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The army now attempted to retreat, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that they ſhould be able to arrive at the neighbouring mountains, where they would be ſafe from the incurſions of the horſe. But in this attempt they were equally diſappointed; for another conſiderable body of enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on that ſide, and blocked their paſſage. The Europeans now found they were ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all ſides, and that reſiſtance was vain. The commanding officer, therefore, judged it expedient to try what could be effected by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, and ſent one of his officers, who underſtood ſomething of the Tartar language, to treat with the general of the enemies. The Tartar chief received the Europeans with great civility, and after having gently reproached them with their ambition, in coming ſo far to invade a people who had never injured them, he conſented upon very moderate conditions to their enlargement: but he inſiſted upon having their arms delivered up, except a very few which he permitted them to keep for defence in their return, and upon retaining a certain number of Europeans as hoſtages for the performance of the ſtipulated articles. Among thoſe who were thus left with the Tartars, Jack happened to be included, and while all the reſt ſeemed incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable at being thus made priſoners by a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nation, he alone, accuſtomed to all the viciſſitudes of life, retained his cheerfulneſs, and prepared to meet every reverſe of fortune with his uſual firmneſs.</p>
            <p>The Tartars, among whom Jack was now to reſide, conſtitute ſeveral different tribes or
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028539_0042_0FD9397325F112E0"/>
nations which inhabit an immenſe extent of country both in Europe and Aſia. Their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is in general open and uncultivated, with out cities or towns, ſuch as we ſee in England. The inhabitants themſelves are a bold and hardy race of men that live in ſmall tents, and change their place of abode with the different ſeaſons of the year. All their property conſiſts in herds of cattle, which they drive along with them from place to place; and upon whoſe milk and fleſh they ſubſiſt. They are particularly fond of horſes, of which they have a ſmall but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent breed, hardy and indefatigable for the purpoſes of war, and they excel in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, beyond what is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Immenſe herds of theſe animals wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der looſe about the deſerts, but marked with the particular mark of the perſon or tribe to which they belong. When they want any of theſe animals for uſe, a certain number of their young men jump upon their horſes with nothing but an halter to guide them, each carrying in his hand a pole with a nooſe or cord at the end. When they come in ſight of the herd, they purſue the horſe they wiſh to take at full ſpeed, come up with him in ſpite of his ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and never fail to throw the nooſe about his neck as he runs. They are frequently known to jump upon young horſes that have paſſed their whole life in the deſert, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uch was the nation with whom the lot of Jack
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028539_0043_0FD9392C801CFDE0"/>
was now to reſide, nor was he long before he had an opportunity of ſhowing his talents.</p>
            <p>It happened that a favourite horſe of the chief was taken with a violent fever, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in immediate danger of death. The khan, for ſo he is called among the Tartars, ſeeing his horſe grow hourly worſe, at length applied to the Europeans, to know if they could ſuggeſt any thing for his recovery. All the officers were profoundly ignorant of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riery; but when the application was made to Jack, he deſired to ſee the horſe, and with great gravity began to feel his pulſe, by paſſing his hand within the animal's fore-leg; which gave the Tartars a very high idea of his ingenuity. Finding that the animal was in a high fever, he propoſed to the khan to let him blood, which he had learned to do very dexterouſly in England. He obtained permiſſion to do as he pleaſed, and having by great good luck a lancet
<figure/>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:028539_0044_0FD93977B6117228"/>
with him, he let him blood very dexterouſly in the neck. After this operation he covered him up, and gave him a warm potion made out of ſuch ingredients as he could procure upon the ſpot, and left him quiet. In a few hours the horſe began to mend, and, to the great joy of the khan, perfectly recovered in a few days. This cure, ſo opportunely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, raiſed the reputation of Jack ſo high, that every body came to conſult him about their horſes, and in a ſhort time he was the univerſal farrier of the tribe. The khan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conceived ſo great an affection for him, that he gave him an excellent horſe to ride upon and attend him in his hunting parties; and Jack, who excelled in the art of horſemanſhip, managed him ſo well as to gain the eſteem of the whole nation.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:028539_0045_0FD9393340EE1538"/>The Tartars, though they are excellent horſemen, have no idea of managing their horſes, unleſs by violence; but Jack in a ſhort time, by continual care and attention, made his horſe ſo docile and obedient to every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hand and leg, that the Tartars themſelves would gaze upon him with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and allow themſelves to be out-done. Not contented with this, he procured ſome iron, and made his horſe-ſhoes in the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean taſte; this alſo was matter of aſtoniſhment to all the Tartars, who are accuſtomed to ride their horſes unſhod. He next obſerved that the Tartar ſaddles are all prodigiouſly large and cumberſome, raiſing the horſemen up to a great diſtance from the back of his horſe. Jack ſet himſelf to work, and was not long before he had completed ſomething like an Engliſh hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaddle, on which he paraded before the khan. All mankind ſeem to have a paſſion for novelty, and the khan was ſo delighted with this effort of Jack's ingenuity, that, after paying him the higheſt compliments, he intimated a deſire of having ſuch a ſaddle for himſelf. Jack was the moſt obliging creature in the world, and ſpared no labour to ſerve his friends; he went to work again, and in a ſhort time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted a ſaddle ſtill more elegant for the khan. Theſe exertions gained him the favour and eſteem both of the khan and all the tribe; ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Jack, indeed, behaved with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

greateſt generoſity to his countrymen, and divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them all the mutton and veniſon which were given him; but he could not help ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obſerving, that it was great pity they had not learned to make an horſe-ſhoe inſtead of dancing and dreſſing hair.</p>
            <p>And now an ambaſſador arrived from the Engliſh ſettlements, with an account that all the conditions of the treaty had been perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and demanding the reſtitution of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. The Tartar chief was too much a man of honour to delay an inſtant, and they were all reſtored; but before they ſet out, Jack laboured with indefatigable zeal to finiſh a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſaddles and a dozen horſe-ſhoes, which he preſented to the khan, with many expreſſions of gratitude. The khan was charmed with this proof of his affection, and in return made him a preſent of a couple of fine horſes, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral valuable ſkins of beaſts. Jack arrived without any accident at the Engliſh ſettlements, and ſelling his ſkins and horſes, found himſelf in poſſeſſion of a moderate ſum of money. He now began to have a deſire to return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and one of the officers, who had often been obliged to him during his captivity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him a diſcharge. He embarked, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with all his property, on board a ſhip, which was returning home, and in a few months was ſafely landed at Plymouth.</p>
            <p>But Jack was too active and too prudent to give himſelf up to idleneſs. After conſidering various ſchemes of buſineſs, he determined to take up his old trade of forging; and for that purpoſe made a journey into the North, and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028539_0047_0FD9393342893B20"/>
               <figure/>
found his old maſter alive, and as active as ever. His maſter, who had always entertained an eſteem for Jack, welcomed him with great affection, and being in want of a foreman, he engaged him at a very handſome price, for that place. Jack was now indefatigable in the execution of his new office; inflexibly honeſt where the intereſts of his maſter were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at the ſame time humane and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the men who were under him, he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the affection of all about him. In a few years, his maſter was ſo thoroughly convinced of his merit, that growing old himſelf, he took Jack into partnerſhip, and committed the management of the whole buſineſs to his ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King, having been informed of his daughter's ſentiments, ſent for her immediately. On her coming, he told her, without the leaſt diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure,
<q>That as ſhe was deſtined to reign, one day or other, over his kingdoms, he ſhould wiſh to know how far her talents were proper for ſo important a charge.</q>
               <q>We may, if you pleaſe,</q>
added this good prince,
<q>make the experiment without any delay. Careleſs as you always were about the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which have been given you in geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, you cannot but know that <hi>The Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iſland</hi> makes a part of my dominions; it is a ſmall, but well inhabited diſtrict; its people are active, induſtrious, good tempered, and thoroughly attached to their ſovereigns.

            <p>Myra, for ſome time, thought that the king meant only to divert himſelf, but ſoon found her miſtake, and that every thing was preparing for her voyage. She was even permitted to form a court to her mind, and accordingly ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028539_0051_0FD9393A57C0EEC0"/>
king, however, thought otherwiſe, and ordered the teachers to embark with their pupils. The young ſovereign, on her part, took care there ſhould be abundance of muſicians for her balls, and that a company of players ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the amuſement of herſelf and her court. On the morn of her departure, ſhe took an affectionate leave of her father, but the few tears which ſhe ſhed, were ſoon dried up by the conſideration of her being going to a place where ſhe ſhould do "juſt what ſhe pleaſed." "The only advice that I ſhall give you," ſaid the king at parting,
<q>is, that you would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the advice of Ariſtus (the governor of the iſland over which you are to reign) in every thing of importance. He is a man for whom I have a high eſteem, and with reaſon, as he is diſcreet, honeſt, and humane. I could wiſh that you would make him your firſt miniſter; I mean, that you ſhould conſult him in every thing, and entruſt him with the execution of all your orders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This direction no way ſuited the taſte of our young Queen, who wiſhed to have given that important charge to one of her favourites, Philintus, a tall, genteel lad, not indeed many years older than herſelf, but one who, to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ſkill in dancing and ſinging, added the very agreeable talent of elegant flattery. He was himſelf as averſe to ſtudy, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as ignorant as his royal miſtreſs; but he had knowledge enough of his own intereſt to excite him never to omit aſſuring her that every one looked on her as a model of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect princeſs, although he was conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious that,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028539_0052_0FD93986F5DECD50"/>
out of her hearing, ſhe was univerſally blamed for being ſo totally unlike her excellent father, and for ſpending her whole time in trifling amuſements.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the little ſovereign reached her iſland, ſhe beheld with pleaſure troops of ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and ſhepherdeſſes, in elegant fancy dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of roſe colour and white, who ſung carols in praiſe of their new Queen, ſtrewed ſweet ſcented flowers in her path, and preſented her with odoriferous noſegays. Myra, charmed with this ſpecimen of her ſubjects gallantry, ordered money to be diſtributed amongſt them; and, under the conduct of Ariſtus, repaired to a lovely, though ſmall palace, fitted up for her reception. Fatigued with the voyage, the Queen and her young court haſtened to their repoſe; but her Majeſty forgot not to order, for the next day, a comedy to be acted, followed by a ball and a ſplendid entertainment. On the next morn, Myra and her court amuſed themſelves by walking into the capital town, which lay not far from the palace. "Obſerve," ſaid Ariſtus to his ſovereign,
<q>the air of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which reigns in every face we meet.</q>
"That," ſaid Philintus,
<q>we ſhould attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the preſence of our lovely Queen.</q>
"Without doubt," replied Ariſtus,
<q>they are ſenſible of that honour; but I ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that their gaiety is chiefly owing to their being conſcious of the excellent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which they live, and of the wiſdom of thoſe laws by which their King, whom they look upon as their father, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the country.</q>
"Let us now," ſaid
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028539_0053_0FD9393BEFCE2CA8"/>
Myra, "extend our walks into the country." They did ſo. An orchard, in full bloom, now tempted her to take a nearer view of its beauty, "What," ſaid ſhe to Ariſtus,
<q>occaſions the buzzing ſounds which I hear?</q>
"The bees," replied he;
<q>a uſeful tribe of your Majeſty's ſubjects.</q>
At that inſtant, moſt unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, one of theſe animals, not perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the reſpect due to royalty, and diſguſted at the Queen's approaching too near to his hive, ſettled on her hand, and made her feel his ſting!—
<q>Shocking creatures, theſe bees!</q>
exclaimed Myra;
<q>one of them has half killed me!</q>
               <q>The preſumptuous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful wretches ought,</q>
ſaid Philintus, "to be utterly extirpated." "You are right," ſaid the Queen;
<q>I will have them deſtroyed, not on my own account, but to preſerve my poor people from receiving ſuch cruel wounds, when they are purſuing their occupations in the country.</q>
"Permit me," ſaid Ariſtus,
<q>to obſerve, that theſe accidents happen but very ſeldom, and that the pain which the bees occaſion by their ſtings, is trifling, when compared with the vaſt advantage which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues from their labours; your ſubjects, madam, will ſuffer ſeverely indeed, if they are deprived of that uſeful creature.</q>
—Here he was interrupted by Philintus, who burſting with laughter, cried out,

               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:028539_0054_0FD93987FA352750"/>
ſaid the young Queen with an air of dignity. "Poſſibly," ſaid Ariſtus,
<q>your Majeſty may ſee cauſe hereafter to repent of this haſty command.</q>
"Nevertheleſs," repeated Myra, "it <hi>ſhall</hi> be executed." Ariſtus retired with a ſigh, and Philintus loudly applauded the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led humanity and firmneſs of his infant ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. That evening the Queen entertained herſelf at the play, and afterwards was preſent at a ball, which, with a magnificent ſupper, laſted until two o'clock in the morning.</p>
            <p>Unluckily among the ladies of the bed cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were two, who, not having reached their eleventh year, had been uſed to eat little or no ſuppers, to take moderate exerciſe, and to go to bed early. But the royal banquet had been ſo tempting, the ball ſo charming, and the whole ſo perfectly new to them, that they had deſpiſed the admonitions of their governeſſes, who had very naturally remonſtrated againſt their launching at once into this new ſyſtem. In conſequence, they were both extremely ill the next morning. The phyſician attended, and ordered proper medicines, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take.
<q>They were permitted by the Queen,</q>
they ſaid,
<q>to do what they liked beſt, and they hated naſty phyſic.</q>
Their complaints, however, increaſed; they could neither eat, drink, or ſleep, and one of the two felt the attack of a fever. On this the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſes were obliged to have recourſe to the royal authority, and the Queen having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the young ladies to ſubmit to diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, they took what was ordered and all went right again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:028539_0055_0FD9393DC34C73B0"/>One day that the young Queen was walking in the garden of her palace, ſhe was diſguſted at the devaſtation which had been made by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars on the leaves of the trees.
<q>What vile creatures are theſe!</q>
ſaid ſhe to Philin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:
<q>Did you ever ſee ſuch a piece of work as they have made here?</q>
"I think," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the courtier,
<q>that it would be a good deed to root them out of the iſland, and to proclaim rewards for thoſe who would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to deſtroy them.</q>
               <q>What ſay you to that, Ariſtus,</q>
ſaid Myra,
<q>can my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects exiſt without caterpillars?</q>
               <q>Your Majeſty,</q>
replied Ariſtus,
<q>has not forgot the bees, I find, but here the caſe is widely different. The caterpillars which have ſtript thoſe trees do much miſchief, and are of no one uſe to ſociety.</q>
"I am heartily glad," ſaid the Queen,
<q>that we coincide in opinion, for I am determined to have all the cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars in my dominions deſtroyed; I hate them, naſty creatures!</q>
"Your Majeſty" ſaid Ariſtus,
<q>certainly means to except from this general maſſacre, that kind of caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar which produces the ſilk-worm.</q>
               <q>Do but hear him,</q>
ſaid Philintus, in the Queen's ear;
<q>that fellow makes a point of contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Majeſty in every thing.</q>
               <q>Let every caterpillar in my realm be put to death,</q>
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the piqued ſovereign.</p>
            <p>"I am tired to death," ſaid Myra, one day,
<q>of this eternal verdure. Theſe walks of turf, and theſe clumps of laurel, though I like them well enough on the whole, yet being repeated ſo often, they fatigue my eyes;—
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028539_0056_0FD9398DB6815E80"/>
green, and green, and nothing but green— Why can I not have a roſe-colour bower?</q>
Philintus now turned all his thoughts towards the accompliſhment of his ſovereign's rational wiſh. He had obſerved in a diſtant part of the garden an arbour where a honey ſuckle overſpread the green frame work. He ordered the leaves to be ſtripped off, the wood to be painted roſe colour, and he covered the whole with artificial roſes hanging by crimſon rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. The Queen was enchanted with this gaudy retreat, and as ſoon as ſhe ſaw it, ordered her dinner to be ſet out upon that very ſpot. The ſun ſhone out with great power, and ſcarce had the company ſate ten minutes at their meal, before ſome complained of aching heads, ſome of dazzled eyes; all loſt their appetites, and the whole was a confuſion of heat and glare. Ariſtus adviſed the whole party to abandon the flaring ſcene, and to refreſh their eyes by gazing on the turf in ſome ſhady place. They did ſo, and all went well again. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it was ſettled by her Majeſty in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that, during the ſummer, it were better for the leaves of the trees to be green, than to be roſe colour.</p>
            <p>Myra was ſo enchanted with the pleaſures of her palace, that ſhe gave herſelf little trouble as to what paſſed in the iſland at large. Her whole time was employed in ſchemes for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing and varying her amuſements: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, indeed, ſhe walked into the country: but her preſence no longer appeared to give any pleaſure to her ſubjects—there were no more ſongs in her praiſe—no more cries of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028539_0057_0FD939424F8196D8"/>
"Long live our Queen!" "What," ſaid Myra,
<q>can occaſion this ſtrange alteration in the behaviour of my people? Are they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with any part of my government?</q>
"If," ſaid Philintus,
<q>they are out of humour with ſuch an amiable ſovereign, they do not deſerve the honour of her inquiries.</q>
This anſwer was not entirely ſatisfactory to the Queen; ſhe was even for ſome time, buried in thought; but the efforts of Philintus, (who had obſerved the gloom on her countenance,) and the gay turn of his converſation, together with the novelty of an entertainment which he propoſed for the next evening, drove away all ſerious thoughts, and ſprightlineſs reſumed its reign again. The plan was, that all the court ſhould appear in paſtoral dreſſes, and that the company ſhould dance on one of thoſe elegant lawns with which the palace garden abounded. Myra approved of this plan, only deſiring that the habits might be as elegant as the plan would allow.
<q>They can only be made of linen, madam,</q>
ſaid one of the bedchamber-women. "How ſo,?" ſaid the Queen.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There is not, in your Majeſty's dominions, ſilk enough for one dreſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You muſt be miſtaken. On my taking the government into my hands, I obſerved ſhops without end, well furniſhed with ſilk.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is true, Madam, there were ſuch; but they are now all ſhut up, and the owner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>"And why ſo, pray?"</p>
            <p>
               <q>Since your Majeſty's orders for the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028539_0058_0FD9398EB9E19C98"/>
of all caterpillars, the ſilk manufacture is entirely ſtopped.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Aye! why, what have thoſe naſty vermin to do with the manufacture of ſilk?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There is one ſpecies of thoſe caterpillars which produces the materials, without which ſilk cannot be made; and as the ſellers of ſilk in the towns are in general connected, by marriage or relationſhip, with the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſilk-worms, they have determined all together to quit a country where they are deprived of the means of ſubſiſting.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That very evening the Queen obſerved with a ſurpriſe, which almoſt equalled horror, that the apartments of the palace were lighted with tallow candles. "Heavens!" exclaimed the affronted Sovereign,
<q>what means this filthy ſight?</q>
She was told that there were no wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en tapers to be found in the iſle. "'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible!" ſhe cried; "let Ariſtus be ſent for." He appeared.
<q>Have you not told me, Sir, that my iſland abounded with wax?</q>
               <q>Madam, it did ſo, when I gave you that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</q>
               <q>And how happens it that it is not ſo now?</q>
               <q>Becauſe ſince your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ordered the bees to be extirpated, no more wax is to be found.</q>
Philintus ſneer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this reply, and Myra aſked with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<q>What was the connexion between bees and tapers?</q>
"Without them," ſaid Ariſtus,
<q>the tapers can not exiſt, ſince the bees ſupply the materials of which the tapers are compoſed.</q>
               <q>And what is become of thoſe who uſed to get their living by making thoſe tapers?</q>
"Poor ſouls!" replied Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<q>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:028539_0059_0FD939456BE939E8"/>they are on the point of quitting a place, where they cannot earn their bread. Alas!</q>
added he,
<q>were your Majeſty to make, at this time, the tour of your dominions, you would find the face of the whole country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorably altered.</q>
Philintus would have turned this account into ridicule, but Myra, by a look, ſtopped his buffoonery, and retired to her chamber with a heavy heart.</p>
            <p>The next morning ſhe took Ariſtus with her, and drove into the environs of her capital. "You were too much in the right," ſhe ſaid,
<q>when you bade me expect a deplorable alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation among my people. I hear no more acclamations! no more ſongs! but I ſee the painfulleſt of ſights; crowds of people in rags, begging their bread,</q>
"Formerly," ſaid Ariſtus,
<q>no beggars were to be found here; there was a large building erected for the poor, where the old were maintained, the ſick cured, and all the young folks ſet to work; but ſince your Majeſty has allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twelve to be the age of diſcretion, many of theſe children have refuſed to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and chooſing to wander about the country, without knowing how to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:028539_0060_0FD939949B85FD70"/>that there was a mutual dependence of one trade upon another, and that, in conſequence of the departure of the ſilk and wax mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and manufacturers, thoſe who were uſed to ſupply that large body of men with cloaths, ſhoes and ſtockings, proviſions, and every other accommodation, having now no market for their goods, had ſhut up their ſhops, and were preparing, one and all, for their departure.</q>
He added,
<q>that it was much to be feared, that the farmers, who uſed to bring to the town corn, hay, butter, eggs, poultry, &amp;c. together with their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, labourers, &amp;c. would ſoon follow this example.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Struck with this painful detail, the young Queen, whoſe goodneſs of heart was equal to the thoughtleſſneſs of her head, exclaimed in an agony of diſtreſs,
<q>Oh heavens! why did I leave my father's court? why take upon me a taſk of which I was ſo incapable? I ſuffer ſeverely for my preſumption, but at leaſt I will do no more miſchief here.</q>
Then turning to Ariſtus, ſhe begged him to haſten the preparations for her return to the kingdom of her father. Her orders were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obeyed, and ſhe with her whole court, took leave of the Fortunate Iſland, and ſoon reached the port they wiſhed for. As ſoon as Myra ſaw the King, ſhe threw herſelf at his feet, bathed in tears. "How is this," ſaid he,
<q>my daughter, are you returned already? are you ſo ſoon weary of ſovereign power?</q>
"Alas! Sire!" replied the weeping Myra,
<q>never was any being more wretched than your

daughter! I have childiſhly thrown away my own happineſs, and that of thoſe whom you entruſted to my care. The iſland which I have governed, no longer deſerves the name of Fortunate. I have, by my own miſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, reduced an induſtrious people to beggary and ruin! but I conjure you, Sire, to order all my jewels to be inſtantly ſold, that I may, by their means, in ſome ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the miſeries which my infantine folly has brought upon them.</q>
               <q>Make yourſelf eaſy,</q>
ſaid the good King, ſoothing his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted daughter,
<q>the miſchiefs which your want of conſideration has cauſed, are by no means irreparable. I foreſaw that you would make great miſtakes in government, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged affairs ſo as to prevent thoſe miſtakes from having any very bad conſequences. Thoſe of your ſubjects, who have by your errors been forced to quit your iſle, have, by the direction of Ariſtus, found a comfortable retreat in this kingdom, have been ſupplied with all neceſſaries, and will now return to their own country, with proper materials, to re-aſſume their ſeveral trades and occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. You have, my beloved Myra, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent heart, and in all the miſchief which you have done, you have had the beſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world.

            <p>TO give a complete hiſtory of this inſect in a few pages, which ſome have exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed volumes in deſcribing, and whoſe nature and properties ſtill continue in diſpute, is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It will be ſufficient to give a general idea of the animal's operations; which, though they have been ſtudied for more than two thouſand years, are ſtill but incompletely known. The account given us by Reaumur is ſufficiently minute; and, if true, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wonderful: but I find many of the facts which he relates, doubted by thoſe who are moſt converſant with bees; and ſome of them actually declared not to have a real exiſtence in nature.</p>
            <p>It is unhappy, therefore, for thoſe whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod demands an hiſtory of bees, that they are unfurniſhed with thoſe materials which have

               </gap> entering, therefore, into the diſpute, I will take him for my guide; and juſt mention, as I go along, thoſe particulars in which ſucceeding obſervers have begun to think him erroneous. Which of the two are right, time only can diſcover; for my part I have only heard one ſide, for as yet none have been ſo bold as openly to oppoſe Reaumur's delightful reſearches.</p>
            <p>There are three different kinds of bees in every hive. Firſt, the labouring bees, which make up the far greateſt number, and are thought to be neither male or female, but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born for the purpoſes of labour, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the breed, by ſupplying the young with proviſion, while yet in their helpleſs ſtate. The ſecond ſort are the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ones; they are of a darker colour, longer, and more thick by one third than the former: they are ſuppoſed to be the males; and there is not above a hundred of them, in a hive of ſeven or eight thouſand bees. The third ſort is much larger than either of the former, and ſtill fewer in number: ſome aſſert, that there is not above one in every ſwarm; but this later obſervers affirm not to be true, there being ſometimes five or ſix in the ſame hive. Theſe are called queen-bees, and are ſaid to lay all the eggs from which the whole ſwarm is hatched in a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>In examining the ſtructure of the common working bee, the firſt remarkable part that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028539_0064_0FD9399770620C20"/>
is the trunk, which ſerves to extract the honey from flowers. It is not formed, like that of the other flies, in the manner of a tube, by which the fluid is to be ſucked up; but like a a beſom, to ſweep, or a tongue, to lick it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. The animal is furniſhed alſo with teeth. which ſerve it in making wax. This ſubſtance is gathered from flowers, like honey; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of that duſt or farina which contributes to the fecundation of plants, and is moulded into wax by the little animal, at le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſure. Every bee, when it leaves the hive to collect this precious ſtore, enters into the cup of the flower, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſuch as ſeem charged with the greateſt quantities of this yellow farina. As the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's body is covered over with hair, it rolls itſelf within the flower, and ſoon becomes quite covered with the duſt, which it ſoon after bruſhes off with its own hind legs, and kneads into two little balls. In the thighs of the hind legs there are to cavities, edged with hair; and into theſe, as into a baſket, the animal ſticks its pellets. Thus employed, the bee flies from flower to flower, encreaſing its ſtore, and adding to its ſtock of wax; until the ball, upon each thigh, becomes as big as a grain of pepper: by this time, having got a ſufficient load, it returns, the beſt of its way to the hive.</p>
            <p>The belly of the bee is divided into ſix rings, which ſometimes ſhorten the body, by ſlipping one over the other. It contains within it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the inteſtines, the honey-bag, the venom-bag, and the ſting. The honey-bag is as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent as cryſtal, containing the honey that
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028539_0065_0FD9394D0D79B500"/>
the bee has bruſhed from the flowers; of which the greater part is carried to the hive, and poured into the cells of the honey-comb; while the remainder ſerves for the bee's own nouriſhment: for, during ſummer, it never touches what has been laid up for the winter. The ſting, which ſerves to defend this little ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal from its enemies, is compoſed of three parts; the ſheath, and two darts, which are extremely ſmall and penetrating. Both the darts have ſeveral ſmall points or barbs, like thoſe of a fiſh-hook, which render the ſting more painful, and make the darts rankle in the wound. Still, however, this inſtrument would be very ſlight, did not the bee poiſon the wound. The ſheath, which has a ſharp point, makes the firſt impreſſion; which is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by that of the darts, and then the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous liquor is poured in. The ſheath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſticks ſo faſt in the wound, that the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is obliged to leave it behind; by which the bee ſoon after dies, and the wound is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably enflamed. It might at firſt appear well for mankind, if the bee were without its ſting: but, upon recollection, it will be found, that the little animal would then have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rivals in ſharing its labours. An hundred other lazy animals, fond of honey, and hating labour, would intrude upon the ſweets of the hive; and the treaſure would be carried off, for want of armed guardians to protect it.</p>
            <p>From examining the bee ſingly, we now come to conſider it in ſociety, as an animal not only ſubject to laws, but active, vigilant, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, and diſintereſted. All its proviſions
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028539_0066_0FD9399B8FA0C350"/>
are laid up for the community; and all its arts in building a cell, deſigned for the benefit of poſterity. The ſubſtance with which bees build their cells is wax: which is faſhioned into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient apartments for themſelves and their young. When they begin to work in their hives, they divide themſelves into four com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: one of which roves in the fields in ſearch of materials; another employs itſelf in laying out the bottom and partitions of their cells; a third is employed in making the inſide ſmooth from the corners and angles; and the fourth company bring food for the reſt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe who return with their reſpective bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. But they are not kept conſtant to one employment; they often change the taſks aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them: thoſe that have been at work, being permitted to go abroad; and thoſe that have been in the fields already, take their places. They ſeem even to have ſigns, by which they underſtand each other; for when any of them want food, it bends down its trunk to the bee from whom it is expected, which then opens its honey-bag, and lets ſome drops fall into the other's mouth, which is at that time opened to receive it. Their diligence and labour is ſo great, that, in a day's time, they are able to make cells, which lie upon each other, numerous enough to contain three thouſand bees.</p>
            <p>If we examine their cells, they will be found formed in the exacteſt proportion. It was ſaid by Pappus, an ancient geometrician, that, of all other figures, hexagons were the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028539_0067_0FD9395157B30FF8"/>
for, when placed touching each other the moſt convenient room would be given, and the ſmalleſt loſt. The cells of the bees are perfect hexagons: theſe, in every honey-comb, are double, opening on either ſide, and cloſed at the bottom. The bottoms are compoſed of little triangular panes, which, when united together, terminate in a point, and lie exactly upon the extremities of other panes of the ſame ſhape, in oppoſite cells. Theſe lodgings have ſpaces, like ſtreets, between them, large enough to give the bees a free paſſage in and out; and yet narrow enough to preſerve the neceſſary heat. The mouth of every cell is defended by a border, which makes the door a little leſs than the inſide of the cell, which ſerves to ſtrengthen the whole. Theſe cells ſerve for different purpoſes: for laying up their young; for their wax, which in winter becomes a part of their food; and for their honey, which makes their principal ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>It is well known that the habitation of bees ought to be very cloſe; and what their hives want, from the negligence and unſkilfulneſs of man, theſe animals ſupply by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry: ſo that it is their principal care, when firſt hived, to ſtop up all the crannies. For this purpoſe they make uſe of a reſinous gum, which is more tenacious than wax, and differs greatly from it. This the ancients called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis: it will grow conſiderably hard in June; though it will in ſome meaſure ſoften by heat; and is often found different in conſiſtence, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and ſmell. It has generally an agreeable aromatic odour when it is warmed; and by
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028539_0068_0FD9399D6EBE79F8"/>
ſome it is conſidered as a moſt grateful perfume. When the bees begin to work with it, it is ſoft, but it acquires a firmer conſiſtence every day; till at length it aſſumes a brown colour, and becomes much harder than wax. The bees car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it on their hinder legs; and ſome think it is met with on the birch, the willow, and pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. However it is procured, it is certain that they plaiſter the inſide of their hives with this compoſition.</p>
            <p>If examined through a glaſs hive, from the hurry the whole ſwarm is in, the whole at firſt appears like anarchy and confuſion; but the ſpectator ſoon finds every animal diligently employed, and following one purſuit, with a ſettled purpoſe. Their teeth are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which they model and faſhion their various buildings, and give them ſuch ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and perfection. They begin at the top of the hive; and ſeveral of them work at a time, at the cells which have two faces. If they are ſtinted with regard to time, they give the new cells but half the depth which they ought to have; leaving them imperfect, till they have ſketched out the number of cells neceſſary for the preſent occaſion. The conſtruction of their combs, coſts them a great deal of labour: they are made by inſenſible additions; and not caſt at once in a mold, as ſome are apt to imagine. There ſeems no end of their ſhaping, finiſhing, and turning them neatly up. The cells for their young are moſt carefully formed; thoſe deſigned for lodging the drones, are larger than the reſt; and that for the queen-bee, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of all. The cells in which the young
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028539_0069_0FD9395331EF0520"/>
brood are lodged, ſerve at different times for containing honey; and this proceeds from an obvious cauſe: every worm, before it is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an aurelia, hangs its old ſkin on the partitions of its cell; and thus, while it ſtrengthens the wall, diminiſhes the capacity of its late apartment. The ſame cell, in a ſingle ſummer, is often tenanted by three or four worms in ſucceſſion; and the next ſeaſon, by three or four more. Each worm takes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care to fortify the pannels of its cell, by hanging up its ſpoils there: thus, the partitions being lined, ſix or eight deep, become at laſt too narrow for a new brood, and are converted into ſtore-houſes, for honey.</p>
            <p>Thoſe cells where nothing but honey is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, are much deeper than the reſt. When the harveſt of honey is ſo plentiful that they have not ſufficient room for it, they either lengthen their combs, or build more; which are much longer than the former. Sometimes they work at three combs at a time; ſor, when there are three work-houſes, more bees may be thus employed, without embarraſſment.</p>
            <p>But honey, as was before obſerved, is not the only food upon which theſe animals ſubſiſt. The meal of flowers, of which their wax is formed, is one of their moſt favourite repaſts. This is a diet which they live upon during the ſummer; and of which they lay up a large win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proviſion. The wax of which their comb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are made, is no more than this meal digeſted, and wrought into a paſte. When the flowers upon which bees generally feed, are not fully blown, and this meal or duſt is not offered in
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028539_0070_0FD939A1BB5B6B58"/>
ſufficient quantities, the bees pinch the tops of the ſtamina in which it is contained, with their teeth; and thus anticipate the progreſs of vegetation. In April and May, the bees are buſy, from morning to evening, in gathering this meal; but when the weather becomes too hot in the midſt of ſummer, they work only in the morning.</p>
            <p>The bee is furniſhed with a ſtomach for its wax, as well as its honey. In the former of the two, their powder is altered, digeſted and concocted into real wax; and is thus ejected by the ſame paſſage by which it was ſwallowed. Every comb, newly made, is white: but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes yellow as it grows old, and almoſt black when kept too long in the hive. Beſide the wax thus digeſted, there is a large portion of the powder kneaded up for food in every hive, and kept in ſeparate cells, for winter provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This is called, by the country people, bee-bread; and contributes to the health and ſtrength of the animal during winter. Thoſe who rear bees, may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ob them of their honey, and feed them, during the winter, with treacle; but no proper ſubſtitute has yet been found for the bee-bread; and, without it, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals become conſumptive and die.</p>
            <p>As for the honey, it is extracted from that part of the flower called the nectareum. From the mouth this delicious ſluid paſſes into the gullet: and then into the firſt ſtomach, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-bag, which, when filled, appears like an oblong bladder. Children, that live in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try places, are well acquainted with this blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and deſtroy many bees to come at their
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028539_0071_0FD93954B2F9AAD8"/>
ſtore of honey. When a bee has ſufficiently filled its firſt ſtomach, it returns back to the hive, where it diſgorges the honey into one of the cells. It often happens that the bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers its ſtore to ſome other, at the mouth of the hive, and flies off for a freſh ſupply. Some honey-combs are always left open for common uſe; but many others are ſtopped up, till there is a neceſſity of opening them. Each of theſe are covered carefully with wax; ſo cloſe, that the covers ſeem to be made at the very inſtant the fluid is depoſited within them.</p>
            <p>Having thus given a curfory deſcription of the inſect, individually conſidered, and of the habitation it forms, we next come to its ſocial habits and inſtitutions: and, in conſidering this little animal attentively, after the neceſſary precautions for the immediate preſervation of the community, its ſecond care is turned to the continuance of poſterity. How numerous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the multitude of bees may appear in one ſwarm, yet they all owe their original to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle parent, which is called the queen-bee. It is indeed ſurpriſing that a ſingle inſect ſhall, in one ſummer, give birth to above twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand young: but, upon opening her body, the wonder will ceaſe; as the number of eggs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, at one time, amounts to five thouſand. This animal, whoſe exiſtence is of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to her ſubjects, may eaſily be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the reſt, by her ſize, and the ſhape of her body. On her ſafety depends the whole welfare of the commonwealth; and the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions paid her by all the reſt of the ſwarm, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhow the dependence her ſubjects have
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028539_0072_0FD93A143956F480"/>
upon her ſecurity. If this inſect be carefully obſerved, ſhe will be ſeen at times attended with a numerous retinue, marching from cell to cell, plunging the extremity of her body into many of them, and leaving a ſmall egg in each. When the queen-bee has depoſited the number of eggs neceſſary in the cells, the working bees undertake the care of the riſing poſterity. They are ſeen to leave off their uſual employments; to conſtruct proper receptacles for eggs; or to complete thoſe that are already formed. They purpoſely build little cells, extremely ſolid, for the young; in which they employ a great deal of wax: thoſe deſigned for lodging the males, as was already obſerve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> are larger than the reſt; and thoſe for the queen-bees the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of all. There is uſually but one egg de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in every cell. A day or two after it is depoſited, the worm is excluded from the ſhell of the egg, having the appearance of a maggot rolled up in a ring, and lying ſoftly on a bed of a whitiſh coloured jelly; upon which alſo the little animal begins to feed. In the mean time, the inſtant it appears, the working bees attend it with the moſt anxious and parental tenderneſs; they furniſh it every hour with a ſupply of this whitiſh ſubſtance, on which it feeds and lies; and watch the cell with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting care. They are nurſes that have a greater affection for the offspring of others, than many parents have for their own children. They are conſtant in viſiting each cell, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that nothing is wanting; preparing the white mixture, which is nothing but a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028539_0073_0FD93959946F1440"/>
of honey and wax, in their own bowels, with which they feed them. Thus attended, and plentifully fed, the worm, in leſs than ſix days time, comes to its full growth, and no longer accepts the food offered it. When the bees perceive that it has no further occaſion for feeding, they perform the laſt offices of tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneſs, and ſhut the little animal up in its cell; walling up the mouth of its apartment with wax: there they leave the worm to itſelf; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured it from every external injury.</p>
            <p>The worm is no ſooner left encloſed, but, from a ſtate of inaction, it begins to labour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and ſhortening its body; and by this means lining th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> walls of its apartment with a ſilken tapeſtry, which it ſpins in the manner of caterpillars, before they undergo their laſt transformation. When their cell is thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, the animal is ſoon after transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an aurelia; but differing from that of the common caterpillar, as it exhibits not only the legs, but the wings of the future bee, in its preſent ſtate of inactivity. Thus, in about twenty, or one and twenty days after the egg was laid, the bee is completely formed, and fitted to undergo the fatigues of its ſtate. When all its parts have acquired their proper ſtrength and conſiſtence, the young animal opens its priſon, by piercing with its teeth the waxen door that confines it. When juſt freed from its cell, it is as yet moiſt, and incommoded with the ſpoils of its former ſituation; but the officious bees are ſoon ſeen to flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> round it, and to lick it clean on all ſides with their trunks; while another band, with equal aſſiduity, are
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028539_0074_0FD939A483FBCE50"/>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the cell that has been juſt left; to carry the ordures out of the hive, and to fit the place for a new inhabitant. The young bee ſoon repays their care, by its induſtry; for as ſoon as ever its external parts become dry, it diſcovers its natural appetites for labour, and induſtriouſly begins the taſk, which it purſues unremittingly through life. The toil of man is irkſome to him, and he earns his ſubſiſtence with pain; but this little animal ſeems happy in its purſuits, and finds delight in all its employments.</p>
            <p>When bees firſt begin to break their priſons, there are generally above a hundred excluded in one day. Thus, in the ſpace of a few weeks, the number of the inhabitants in one hive, of moderate ſize, becomes ſo great, that there is no place to contain the new comers; and they are ſcarcely excluded from the cell, when they are obliged, by the old bees, to ſally forth in queſt of new habitations. In other words, the hive begins to ſwarm, and the new progeny prepares for exile.</p>
            <p>While there is room enough in the hive, the bees remain quietly together; it is neceſſity alone that compels the ſeparation. Sometimes indeed, the young brood, with graceleſs obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, refuſe to depart, and even venture to reſiſt their progenitors. The young ones are known by being browner than the old, with whiter hair; the old ones are of a lighter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with red hair. The two armies are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eaſily diſtinguiſhable, and dreadful battles are often ſeen to enſue. But the victory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

            <p>In different countries, the ſwarms make their appearance at different times of the year, and there are ſeveral ſigns previous to this intended migration. The night before, an unuſual buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is heard in the hive; in the morning, though the weather be ſoft and inviting, they ſeem not to obey the call, being intent on more important meditations within. All labour is diſcontinued in the hive, every bee is either employed in forcing, or reluctantly yielding a ſubmiſſion; at length, after ſome noiſe and tumult, a queen-bee is choſen, to guard, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than conduct, the young colony to other habitations, and then they are marſhalled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent conductor. In leſs than a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, they leave their native abode, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cloud round their protectreſs, they ſet off, without ſeeming to know the place of their deſtination; <hi>The world before them, where to chooſe their place of reſt.</hi> The uſual time of ſwarming, is from ten in the morning, to three in the afternoon, when the ſun <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

They flutter for a while, in the air, like flakes of ſnow, and ſometimes undertake a diſtant jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but more frequently are contented with ſome neighbouring aſylum; the branch of a tree, a chimney top, or ſome other expoſed ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. It is, indeed, remarkable, that all thoſe animals, of whatever kind, that have long been under the protection of man, ſeem
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028539_0076_0FD939A60300C0C8"/>
to loſe a part of their natural ſagacity, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for themſelves. The rabbit, when do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticated, forgets to dig holes, the hen to build a neſt, and the bee to ſeek a ſhelter, that ſhall protect it from the inclemencies of winter. In thoſe countries, where the bees are wild, and unprotected by man, they are always ſure to build their waxen cells in the hollow of a tree; but with us, they ſeem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident in their choice, and the firſt green branch that ſtops their flight, ſeems to be thought ſufficient for their abode through win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. However, it does not appear, that the queen chooſes the place where they are to alight, for many of the ſtragglers, who ſeem to be pleaſed with a particular branch, go and ſettle upon it; others are ſeen to ſucceed, and at laſt, the queen herſelf, when ſhe finds a ſufficient number there before her, goes to make it the place of her head quarters. When the queen is ſettled, the reſt of the ſwarm ſoon follow; and, in about a quarter of an hour, the whole body ſeem to be at eaſe. It ſometimes is found, that there are two or three queens to a ſwarm, and the colony is divided into parties; but it moſt uſually happens, that one of theſe is more conſiderable than the other, and the bees by degrees, deſert the weakeſt, to take ſhelter under the moſt powerful protector. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted queen does not long ſurvive this defeat; ſhe takes refuge under the new monarch, and is ſoon deſtroyed by her jealous rival. Till this cruel execution is performed, the bees ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go out to work; and if there ſhould be a queen-bee, belonging to the new colony, left
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028539_0077_0FD939608E29D2F0"/>
in the old hive, ſhe always undergoes the fate of the former. However, it muſt be obſerved, that the bees never ſacrifice any of their queens, when the hive is full of wax and honey; for there is at that time, no danger in maintaining a plurality of breeders.</p>
            <p>When the ſwarm is thus conducted to a place of reſt, and the policy of government is ſettled, the bees ſoon reſume their former labours.</p>
            <p>When a hive ſends out ſeveral ſwarms in the year, the firſt is always the beſt, and the moſt numerous. Theſe, having the whole ſummer before them, have the more time for making wax and honey, and conſequently their labours are the moſt valuable to the proprietor. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſwarm chiefly conſiſts of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bees, yet it is often found, that bees of all ages compoſe the multitude of emigrants, and it often happens, that bees of all ages are ſeen remaining behind. The number of them is always more conſiderable than that of ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous cities, for ſometimes upwards of forty thouſand are found in a ſingle hive. So large a body may well be ſuppoſed to work with great expedition; and in fact, in leſs than twent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> four hours, they will make combs above twenty inches long, and ſeven or eight broad. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will half fill their hives with wax, in leſs than five days. In the firſt fifteen days, they are always found to make more wax than they do afterwards during the reſt of the year.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned the induſtry of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable inſects, it will be proper to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the effects of their labour, of that wax and honey, which are turned by man to ſuch
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028539_0078_0FD939A77B6FD5E8"/>
various uſes. Bees gather together two kinds of wax, one coarſe and the other fine. The coarſer ſort is bitter, and with this, which is called <hi>propolis,</hi> they ſtop up all the holes and crevices of their hives. It is of a more reſinous nature than the fine wax, and is conſequently better qualified to reſiſt the moiſture of the ſeaſon, and preſerve the works warm and dry within. The fine wax is as neceſſary to the animals preſervation as the honey itſelf. With this they make their lodgings, with this they cover the cells of their young, and in this they lay up their magazines of honey. This is made, as has been already obſerved, from the duſt of flowers, which is carefully kneaded by the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inſect, then ſwallowed, and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone a kind of digeſtion, is formed into the cells, which anſwers ſuch a variety of purpoſes. To collect this, the animal rolls itſelf in the flower it would rob, and thus takes up the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable duſt with the hair of its body. Then carefully bruſhing it into a lump, with its fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paws it thruſts the compoſition into two cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties behind the thighs, which are made like ſpoons to receive the wax, and the hair that lines them, ſerves to keep it from falling.</p>
            <p>As of wax, there are alſo two kinds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The white and the yellow. The white is taken without fire from the honey-combs. The yellow is extracted by heat, and ſqueezed through bags, in a preſs. The beſt honey is new, thick and granulated, of a clear tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent white colour, of a ſoft and aromatic ſmell, and of a ſweet lively taſte. Honey made in mountainous countries, is preferable to that of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028539_0079_0FD939AD9279DFA8"/>
the valley. The honey made in the ſpring, is more highly eſteemed, than that gathered in ſummer, which laſt is ſtill more valuable, than that of autumn, when the flowers begin to fade and loſe their fragrance.</p>

            <head>Of the SILKWORM.</head>
            <p>THIS little creature, which only works for itſelf, has been made of the utmoſt ſervice to man; and furniſhes him with a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more beautiful than any other animal can ſupply. We may declaim indeed againſt the luxuries of the times, when ſilk is ſo generally worn; but were ſuch garments to fail, what other arts could ſupply their deficiency?</p>
            <p>Though ſilk was anciently brought in ſmall quantities to Rome, yet it was ſo ſcarce as to be ſold for its weight in gold; and was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſuch a luxurious refinement in dreſs, that it was infamous for a man to appear in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of which ſilk formed but half the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. It was moſt probably brought among them from the remoteſt parts of the eaſt; ſince it was, at that time of which I am ſpeaking, ſcarcely known even in Perſia.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more remote from the truth, than the manner in which their hiſtorians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the animal by which ſilk is produced. Pauſanius informs us, that ſilk came from the country of the Seres, a people of Aſiatic Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia;
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028539_0080_0FD939AF74BA8518"/>
in which place an inſect, as large as the beetle, but in every other reſpect reſembling a ſpider, was bred up for that purpoſe. They take great care, as he aſſures us, to feed and defend it from the weather; as well during the ſummer's heat, as the rigours of winter. This inſect, he obſerves, makes its web with its feet, of which it has eight in number. It is fed, for the ſpace of four years, upon a kind of paſte, prepared for it; and at the beginning of the fifth, it is ſupplied with leaves of the green willow, of which it is particularly fond; it then feeds till it burſts with fat: after which they take out its bowels, which are ſpun into the beautiful manufacture ſo ſcarce and coſtly.</p>
            <p>The real hiſtory of this animal was unknown among the Romans till the times of Juſtinian; and it is ſuppoſed, that ſilkworms were not brought into Europe till the beginning of the twelfth century; when Roger of Sicily, brought workmen in this manufacture from Aſia Minor, after his return from his expedition to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land, and ſettled them in Sicily and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria. From theſe the other kingdoms of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope learned this manufacture; and it is now one of the moſt lucrative carried on among the ſouthern provinces of Europe.</p>
            <p>The ſilkworm is now very well known to be a large caterpillar, of a whitiſh colour, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028539_0081_0FD939B0C1D2B878"/>
ſilk. The feeding theſe worms, the gathering, the winding, the twiſting, and the weaving their ſilk, is one of the principal manufactures of Europe; and, as their luxuries increaſe, ſeems every day to become more and more neceſſary to human happineſs.</p>
            <p>There are two methods of breeding ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms; for they may be left to grow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at liberty upon the trees where they are hatched; or they may be kept in a place built for that purpoſe, and fed every day with freſh leaves. The firſt method is uſed in China, Tonquin, and other hot countries; the other is uſed in other places where the animal has been artificially propagated, and ſtill continues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſtranger. In the warm climate, the ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm proceeds from an egg, which has been glued by the parent moth upon proper parts of the mulberry-tree, and which remains in that ſituation during the winter. The manner in which they are ſituated and fixed to the tree, keeps them unaffected by the influence of the weather; ſo that thoſe froſts which are ſevere enough to kill the tree, have no power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the ſilkworm.</p>
            <p>The inſect never proceeds from the egg till Nature has provided it a ſufficient ſupply; and till the budding leav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are furniſhed, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient abundance, for its ſupport. When the leaves are put forth, the worms ſeem to feel the genial ſummons, and burſting from their little eggs, crawl upon the leaves, where they feed with a moſt voracious appetite. Thus they become larger by degrees; and after ſome months feeding, they lay, upon every leaf,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028539_0082_0FD939B7CD2EF448"/>
ſmall bundles, or cones of ſilk, which appear like ſo many golden apples, painted on a fine green ground. Such is the method of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the Eaſt; and without doubt it is beſt for the worms, and leaſt troubleſome for the feeder of them. But it is otherwiſe in the colder European climates; the frequent chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the weather, and the heavy dews of the evenings render the keeping them all night ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſubject to ſo many inconveniences, as to admit of no remedy. It is true, that by the aſſiſtance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ets, they may be preſerved from the inſults of birds; but the ſevere cold weather, which often ſucceeds the firſt heats of ſummer, as well as the rain and high winds, will deſtroy them all: and therefore, to breed them in Europe, they muſt be ſheltered and protected from every external injury.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, a room is choſen, with a ſouth aſpect; and the windows are ſo well gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, as not to admit the leaſt air: the walls are well built, and the planks of the floor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cloſe ſo as to admit neither birds nor mice, not even ſo much as an infect. In the middle there ſhould be four pillars erected, or four wooden poſts, ſo placed as to form a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large ſquare. Between theſe are different ſtories made with ozier hurdles; and under each hurdle there ſhould be a floor, with an upright border all round. Theſe hurdles and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>loors muſt hang upon pullies, ſo as to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or taken down at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>When the worms are hatched, ſome tender mulberry leaves are provided, and placed in the cloth or paper box in which the eggs were
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028539_0083_0FD939B8C0970BF8"/>
laid, and which are large enough to hold a great number. When they have acquired ſome ſtrength, they muſt be diſtributed on beds of mulberry leaves, in the different ſtories of the ſquare in the middle of the room, round which a perſon may freely paſs on every ſide. They will fix themſelves to the leaves, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to the ſticks of the hurdles, when the leaves are devoured. They have then a thread, by which they can ſuſpend themſelves on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to prevent any ſhock by a fall; but this is by no means to be conſidered as the ſilk which they ſpin afterwards in ſuch abundance. Care muſt be taken that freſh leaves be brought every morning, which muſt be ſtrewed very gently and equally over them; upon which the ſilkworms will forſake the remainder of the old leaves, which muſt be carefully taken away, and every thing kept very clean; for nothing hurts theſe infects ſo much as moiſture and uncleanlineſs. For this reaſon their leaves muſt be gathered when the weather is dry, and kept in a dry place, if it be neceſſary to lay in a ſtore. As theſe animals have but a ſhort time to live, they make uſe of every moment, and almoſt continually are ſpinning except at thoſe intervals when they change their ſkins. If mulberry leaves be difficult to be obtained, the leaves of lettuce or holy oak will ſuſtain them: but they do not thrive ſo well upon their new diet; and their ſilk will neither be ſo copious, nor of ſo good a quality.</p>
            <p>Though the judicious choice, and careful management of their diet, is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, yet there is another precaution of equal
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028539_0084_0FD939BA82351FE0"/>
importance, which is to give them air, and open their chamber windows, at ſuch times as the ſun ſhines warmeſt. The place alſo muſt be kept as clean as poſſible; not only the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral floors that are laid to receive their ordure, but the whole apartments in general. Theſe things well obſerved, contribute greatly to their health and encreaſe.</p>
            <p>The worm, at the time it burſts the ſhell, is extremely ſmall, and of a black colour; but the head is of a more ſhining black than the reſt of the body: ſome days after, they begin to turn whitiſh, or of an aſh-coloured grey. After the ſkin begins to grow too rigid, or the animal is ſtinted within it, the inſect throws it off, and appears cloathed a-new: it then becomes larger and much whiter, though it has a greeniſh caſt: after ſome days, which are more or leſs, according to the different heat of the climate, or to the quality of the food it leaves off eating, and ſeems to ſleep for two days together: then it begins to ſtir, and put itſelf into violent motions, till the ſkin falls off the ſecond time, and is thrown aſide by the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's feet. All theſe changes are made in three weeks or a month's time; after which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to feed once more, ſtill in its caterpillar form, but a good deal differing from itſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its change. In a few days time it ſeems to ſleep again; and, when it awakes, it again changes its cloathing, and continues feeding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s before. When it has thus taken a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of food, and its parts are diſpoſed for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the aurelia form, the animal forſakes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

itſelf a retreat to defend it from external injuries, while it is ſeemingly deprived of life and motion.</p>
            <p>This retreat is no other than its cone, or ball of ſilk, which Nature has taught it to compoſe with great art; and within which it buries itſelf, till it aſſumes its winged form. This cone or ball is ſpun from two little long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh kinds of bags that lie above the inteſtines, and are filled with a gummy fluid, of a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold colour. This is the ſubſtance of which the threads are formed; and the little animal is furniſhed with a ſurpriſing apparatus for ſpinning it to the degree of fineneſs which its occaſions may require. This inſtrument in ſome meaſure reſembles a wire-drawer's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, in which gold or ſilver threads are drawn to any degree of minuteneſs; and through this the animal draws its thread with great aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. As every thread proceeds from two gum-bags, it is probable that each ſupplies its own; which, however, are united, as they proceed from the animal's body. If we examine the thread with a microſcope, it will be found that it is flatted on one ſide, and grooved along its length; from hence we may infer, that it is doubled juſt upon leaving the body; and that the two threads ſtick to each other by that gummy quality of which they are poſſeſſed. Previous to ſpinning its web, the ſilkworm ſeeks out ſome convenient place to erect its cel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, without any obſtruction. When it has found a leaf, or a chink fitted to its purpoſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028539_0086_0FD939C1E9122130"/>
its retreat. Though all its firſt eſſays ſeem perfectly confuſed, yet they are not altogether without deſign: there appears indeed, no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or contrivance in the diſpoſal of its firſt threads; they are by no means laid artfully over each other, but are thrown out at random, to ſerve as an external ſhelter againſt rain; for nature having appointed the animal to work upon trees in the open air, its habits remain, though it is brought up in a warm apartment.</p>
            <p>Malpighi pretends to have obſerved ſix dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent layers in a ſingle cone of ſilk: but what may eaſily be obſerved is, that it is compoſed externally of a kind of rough cotton-like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is called floſs; within the thread it is more diſtinct and even; and next the body of the aurelia, the apartment ſeems lined with a ſubſtance of the hardneſs of paper, but of a much ſtronger conſiſtence. It muſt not be ſuppoſed, that the thread which goes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the cone, is rolled round, as we roll a bottom; on the contrary, it lies upon it in a very irregular manner, and winds off from one ſide of the cone, and then from the other. This whole thread, if meaſured, will be found about three hundred yards long; and ſo very fine, that eight or ten of them are generally rolled off into one by the manufacturers. The cone, when completed, is in form like a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's egg, and more pointed at one end than the other; at the ſmaller end, the head of the aurelia is generally found; and this is the pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e that the inſect, when converted into a moth, is generally ſeen to burſt through.</p>
            <p>It is generally a fortnight or three weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the aurelia is changed into a moth; but no ſooner is the winged inſect completely form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than having diveſted itſelf of its aurelia ſkin, it p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>tered remnants of its aurelia ſkin lie in confuſion within the cone, like a bundle of dirty linen.</p>
            <p>The animal, when thus ſet free from its double confinement, appears exhauſted with fatigue, and ſeems produced for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to tranſmit a future brood. It nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flies nor eats; the male only ſeeking the female, whoſe eggs he impregnates; and their union continues for four days, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The male dies immediately after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from his mate; and ſhe ſurvives him only till ſhe has laid her eggs, which are not hatched into worms till the enſuing ſpring.</p>
            <p>However, there are few of theſe animals ſuffered to come to a ſtate of maturity; for as their burſting through the cone deſtroys the ſilk, the manufacturers take care to kill the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia, by expoſing it to the ſun, before the moth comes to perfection.

As to the paper-like ſubſtance which remains, ſome ſtain it with a variety of colours, to make artificial flowers; others let it lie in the water, till the glutinous matter which cements it is all diſſolved: it is then carded like wool, ſpun with a wheel, and converted into ſilk ſtuffs of an inferior kind.</p>
