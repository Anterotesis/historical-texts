            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOU have here a Specimen of the Cloggs &amp; Fetters with which the Liberty of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are intangled at <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Jerſey Governments</hi> beyond any places in Her <hi>Majeſties Dominions;</hi> And when the Conditions, and Impoſitions required, are as heavy, and uneaſy to be bore; and as great a <hi>Scruple of Conſcience,</hi> as the grounds of their Separation and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it is next to no Liberty at all.</p>
            <p>And what the Conſequences of ſuch practices, if perſiſted in, will prove to ſuch a Place, where <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are above twenty to one, for one Church-man, and where men and money are ſo much wanting, for the defence of <hi>New-York,</hi> both by Sea and Land, which not many years, (by demands of men and money from the Neighbouring Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies on the Continent) was repreſented, as their only Barrier and Frontier, I leave to thinking men, and conſidering Politicians to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; beſides the difficulties and diſcouragements laid in the way of ſuch as would Import themſelves, and the ready and ſhorteſt way to promote Deſerters from thoſe Provinces.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit a true, and <hi>ſtrange Story,</hi> I lately heard of, that during the Impriſonment of theſe two <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> either to find out a <hi>Crime,</hi> none being ſpecifyed in the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> or to aggavate their imaginary fault: An Order was given to Major <hi>Sandford</hi> of <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey,</hi> to put ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry perſons upon Examination, and their Oaths, to diſcover what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe they had with ſundry of their friends, at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Jaſper Crane</hi> in <hi>New-York</hi>-Town in <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Samuel Melyen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crane</hi>

               <p>If the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>Liberty,</hi> my Lord, had directed us to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons in Authority for Licence, we would readily have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame; but we cannot find any directions in ſaid <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> therefore could not take notice thereof.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I humbly conceive, it is not a <hi>limited</hi> nor <hi>local</hi> Act, and am well aſſured, it extends to other Plantations of the Queens Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, which is evident from <hi>Certificates</hi> from <hi>Courts of Record</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi> certifying we have complied with ſaid Law.</p>

                  <hi>Yes, it is</hi> Local <hi>my Lord, and producing an Argument for it,</hi> further ſaid, <hi>that all the</hi> Paenal Laws <hi>were</hi> Local, <hi>and</hi> limited, <hi>and did not extend to the Plantations, and the</hi> Act of Toleration <hi>being made to take off the edge of the</hi> Paenal Laws; <hi>therefore the</hi> Act of Toleration <hi>does not extend to any Plantations?</hi>

               <p>We preſume my Lord, our Certificates do extend as far as the Law extends; for we are directed by the <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> to qualifie our ſelves in the places where we live, which we have done; and the ſame Law directs us to take <hi>Certificates</hi> of our <hi>qualification,</hi> which we have accordingly done; and theſe Certificates are not to Certify to ſuch as behold us taking our Qualification, being performed in the face of the Country, at a publick Court; but our Certificates muſt be to ſatisfie others abroad in the World, who ſaw it not, nor heard any thing of it, otherwiſe it were needleſs.

            <p>There are ſundry things obſervable in this Warrant of Commitment; which is not uſual in Warrants granted in <hi>England.</hi> 1. That it is Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Signed by the Supream Authority, and not by any Sworn Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, appointed and authorized by Law, for Commitment of Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: And the Supream Authority of <hi>England,</hi> have not put any ſuch power into practice, without a Special Act of Parliament, impowring them ſo to do; and that only upon neceſſity and emergent occaſions. 2. Here is no mention of the Queens Name, or Authority, which muſt be acknowledged a novelty not eaſily underſtood. 3. There is not the leaſt ſhadow of a crime or ſuſpicion of a crime alleadged, which is but a ſlender cauſe of Commitment. 4. This Mittimus is erroneous in Concluſion, which ſhould be, until they are delivered by due courſe of Law, and not until further Order, which is condemned by Law and Lawyers as inſufficient.</p>
            <p>And finding themſelves Impriſoned, and put under an unlimited Confinement, they addreſſed Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> by the following Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition, preſented to his Lordſhip, by the Hands of <hi>Ebenezer Wilſon,</hi> High Sheriff.</p>

                  <p>The Attorney General for the Queen moves to know, if they would allow a Copy of the Queens Inſtructions to the Governour, Signed by his Excellency, to be brought into Court, in Evidence at the Tryal, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Excellency, who had the Originals, was then in the <hi>Jerſeys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Defendant replied, they could admit of no Copies, ſeeing there was time enough to have produced the Original; or Mr. Attorney might have compared the Copy with the Original, and might have been able to give his Affidavit to the truth of ſaid Copy; but perceiving if that Copy was not allowed of, the Queens Attorney would put off the Tryal till another time.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Mr. Attorney General for the Queen, &amp; Mr. <hi>William Nicoll</hi> for the Defendant, agrees, that the Copy of ſuch Inſtructions from Her Majeſty to the Governour, as ſhall be produced by the Attorney General, and Signed by the Governour, ſhall be admitted on Tryal, to be the ſame in Evidence, as if the Original Inſtructions were produced. <hi>F.

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001300_0023_0FB27B5E5C3AEDC0"/>
what Service theſe Inſtructions which were no Law, could do to Mr. Attorney, ſeeing the Preſentment run upon Statutes and Acts of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and they expected to have a Tryal before a Court, who were Judges of Law, and not of private Inſtructions.</p>

                     <p>As ſoon as I determined to Preach, leave was asked, tho' not by me; for it was the peoples buſineſs, and not mine, to provide a place for me to Preach in: And I would have been admitted to Preach in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church, but they were affraid of offending Lord <hi>Cornbury;</hi> And Mr. <hi>Anthony Young</hi> went to the Governour, to have his leave, or permiſſion for my Preaching in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church; tho' all this was done, without ſo much as my knowledge: But my Lord oppoſing and denying it, I was under a neceſſity of Preaching where I did, in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houſe, tho' in a publick manner with open doors. Mr. Attorney in pleading, firſt read over the Indictment which the Grand Jury found, and endeavoured to prove the ſeveral parts thereof, by giving a large and full account of ſundry Statutes of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, aſſerting and eſtabliſhing the Supremacy of the King over all Eccleſiaſtical Perſons and Affairs, in his Dominion of <hi>England.</hi> And from thence aſſerted the Queens Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, and over Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick perſons; which Supremacy was by a Delegation lodged in his Excellency our Governour, which he is ſworn to exerciſe; and this is ſignified to him by Her Majeſties Inſtructions, which were read in Court. Then he proceeded to produce, and read as much as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, of thoſe Statutes of Qeean <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>For Uniformity of Worſhip according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>and the Paenal Laws againſt Conventicles:</hi> And enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his pleadings on theſe points; he turns to the Gentlemen of the Jury, and ſays, the matter of fact is plainly confeſſed by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and I have proved it to be repugnant to the Queens Inſtructions, and ſundry Acts of Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> Therefore did not doubt, but the Jury would find for the Queen, and againſt the Defendant.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ja. Reignere,</hi> Attorney for the Defendant, pleads againſt Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney for the Queen, as followeth: The Indictment charges three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſeparate facts as Crimes againſt the Defendant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he, a pretended Proteſtant Miniſter, endeavouring to ſubvert the Queens Supremacy, Juriſdiction and Authority in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs; did privately and unlawfully Preach and Teach, at <hi>William Jackſons</hi> Houſe, diverſe Subjects, privately and unlawfully, to above five in number, without Licence had according to Law, in derogation to the Royal Authority and Prerogative, to the evil example, &amp; <hi>cont.

                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001300_0026_0FB27B6645E59CF0"/>2. That he did aſſemble diverſe unknown, and unvoluntarily, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully uſe any other Rites and Forms of Worſhip, then are in the Common-Prayer and Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England: Cont. Form. Stat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That being not qualifyed by Law to Preach and Teach in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or Meeting not allowed by Law, in other manner then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the practice of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> at which Meeting were five perſons, or more aſſembled, <hi>Cont. Form. Stat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Indictment, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> that the Defendant did not Preach privately, nor the perſons aſſemble privately, <hi>i. e.</hi> with doors lockt, barr'd or bolted; nay, it appears by the Evidence, and agreed to the contrary by Mr. Attorney General: that the people met unlawfully, muſt appear by the violation of ſome known Law or Statute, in force here, by which ſuch Meeting and Preaching is forbidden; that is to ſay, the Preaching above five.</p>
                  <p>I take this Colony, as a Dominion of <hi>England,</hi> to be governed by, and ſubject to theſe three ſorts of Laws: 1. The Common Law of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> 2. The expreſs Statutes mentioning the Plantations, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as are for publick good (as the Chief Juſtice was pleaſed to ſay in this Court, in the Caſe depending between <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Davis</hi>). 3. By the Laws of this Colony, and thoſe are to be as near as may be agreeable to the Laws and Statutes of <hi>England;</hi> and the Judges of this Court (I dare ſay) will examine and determine no fact, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mode and rule of ſome of thoſe Laws.</p>
                  <p>That Preaching without Licence, and aſſembling above five is a Crime at Common Law, I never read, and it is not alleadged to be againſt any Statute; it muſt be an offence againſt ſome Law of this Province, which as yet I never ſaw, and deſire I may now ſee it; and if ſuch does not appear, then undoubtedly <hi>where there is no Law, there can be no tranſgreſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to what is offered by Mr. Attorney, that the Queen, as Supream Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> hath power to make Ordinances, and puniſh for breach thereof; that this power is delegated to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who is bound by Oath to Execute them.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing and admitting all this; yet nothing like an Ordinance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears: for the Inſtructions produced by Mr. Attorney cannot have the force of a Law or Ordinance, eſpecially againſt perſons to whom they were never communicated; what they may be to thoſe to whom they were given, who alone hath the Cuſtody of them, and conceals them from publick view.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:001300_0027_0FB27B67881D1E30"/>As to the two Articles in the Indictment; <hi>Cont. Form. Stat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there are diverſe Statutes made in <hi>England,</hi> which enjoin a due obſervance of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the 1ſt of <hi>Eliz.

                  <p>Mr. Attorney has been entertaining us with ſome Hiſtory from the Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. And it is fit we ſhould entertain him with ſome Hiſtory alſo, more ancient, and from better Authors, and that is from the Acts of the Apoſtles; for we do find, that Teaching, or Preaching, or Speaking in it ſelf, or by the Common Law, was never found a Crime; for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> Preached a very new Doctrine to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> which was an ancient Commonwealth, and was not Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or Impriſoned for it, but they were curious to hear again, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. concerning the new Doctrine of the Reſurrection; but we find, when the ſame Apoſtle began to inſiſt on any Doctrine which tended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the gain of the Silver Smiths, who <hi>Act.</hi> 18. made Shrines for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001300_0029_0FB27B7243090DC8"/>
                     <hi>Diana,</hi> the Goddeſs of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> they were enraged, and made an uproar againſt him, ruſhing into the Theatre; but it was no Crime, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Corinth</hi> or <hi>Athens,</hi> where no man was hurt by the Doctrine it ſelf, neither was obſtructed by, nor any offence to the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And it is plain, it was no offence at Common Law, but was made ſo by the old Statutes of 5 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4 <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. But all theſe Statutes being repealed by 1 <hi>El.</hi> 6. and by Act; of <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was ſtill no tranſgreſſion, but remains as it was, no crime at Common Law.</p>
                  <p>And the four Statutes againſt Conventicles in <hi>Cb.</hi> 2. are all local, and in expreſs words, limited to <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Berwick</hi> on <hi>Tweed,</hi> ſo have no relation, to, nor reach to any of the Plantations.</p>
                  <p>And this is further manifeſt, from the Conſtitution of the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being as it were ſettled by National Conſent, for thoſe whoſe thoughts in Religious Affairs could not ſquare with the Publick Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in Church Government, Diſcipline and Ceremonies, as <hi>New-England</hi> for Independants and Presbyterians, <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> and <hi>New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys,</hi> and we may add <hi>New-York,</hi> for the ſeveral ſorts of Diſſenters in general; <hi>Penſilvania</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi> for Quakers &amp; Papiſts in particular.</p>
                  <p>And this being the firſt that was proſecuted in this nature in the Plantations, is made the more remarkable, ſo long after the news of thoſe harſh Statutes of <hi>Cb.</hi> 2. have been cut by the Statute of 1. <hi>William</hi> &amp; <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is already evidently proved, that the Acts of Aſſembly of <hi>New-York;</hi> allow Liberty of Conſcience, with freedom of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to all but Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>What was offered on the other ſide, by Mr. Attorney, as being againſt the Queens Prerogative in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, was foreign, and not at all to the purpoſe; for all the Statutes relating to that matter, being to aſſert the Queens Empire, and Juriſdiction over Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, as well as Lay-men, in oppoſition to the Claim and Uſurpation of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> to exempt the Clergy, or Church-men, from the Civil and Secular Power.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Queens Inſtructions, they are not, neither can have the force of a Law; beſides that, theſe two Inſtructions produced in Court, are no way againſt us, but rather for us.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>David Jamiſon,</hi> Attorney for the Defendant, appears next to plead in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Reignere,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicol,</hi> Attorneys on the ſame ſide, having offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many and large Arguments, have left but little room for new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be offered, without enumerating what was offered upon the three heads of the Indictment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:001300_0030_0FB27B7A05C6A728"/>As to the firſt, which was Preaching and Teaching without Licence, againſt the Queens Supremacy and Prerogative in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. We did not come here to oppoſe, or call in queſtion the Queens Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative or Supremacy: but were willing to pay all due reſpect &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thereunto; but we cannot ſee, that theſe Inſtructions from the Queen to my Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> of which Mr. Attorney has produced a Copy, and which he alleadges to be the Law we have broken by Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, contrary to the Queens Inſtructions, which are not a Law to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body elſe, but to his Lordſhip, who is directed by them, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the Queen, if he do not obſerve them. Her Inſtructions are private directions to himſelf, and can be no Law to others: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation is that which gives the finiſhing ſtroke to a Law. Nor do I ſee how his Lordſhip ſhould become guilty of breach of Oath, as Mr. Attorney was pleaſed to offer, by not ordering the proſecution of this Gentleman, for Preaching without his Licence; altho' he be Sworn to obey and obſerve his Inſtructions, becauſe the very Inſtructions produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, give Liberty of Conſcience to Proteſtant Diſſenters, and are in two diſtinct Paragraphs; the firſt ſeems to me wholly to agree with our Act of Aſſembly of this Province, is to the ſame purpoſe, and very near the ſame words; the other Paragraph is negative: <hi>You are not to permit any Miniſter coming from</hi> England, <hi>to Preach in your Government, without a Certificate from the Right Reverend, the Biſhop of</hi> London; <hi>nor any other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter coming from any other Part, or Place, without firſt obtaining leave from you our Governour.</hi> And a Diſſenting Miniſter Preaching here without the Governours knowledge, could be no breach of his Oath, becauſe it was done without his knowledge, and conſequently without his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>To the Second, as to the Statutes of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> 2. againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, they were limited and local Acts or Statutes, and could not any way reach theſe Plantations; for here in <hi>New-York</hi> we have no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Religion for the whole Province. On the Eaſt-end of <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,</hi> or <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> were, and always have been Independant Miniſters, the <hi>French</hi> had their own way and Miniſters, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the very <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> have the free Exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and there is not one Form of Worſhip Eſtabliſhed for the whole Province. The 16th. as well as 22 of K. <hi>Charles</hi> 2. are limited to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Twe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> and therefore the uſing of any other Form of Worſhip in this Province, then what is contained in the Common-Prayer, cannot be a Breach of thoſe Statutes. Then again the 16 of <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. for ſuppreſſing
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001300_0031_0FB27B7B98F538A0"/>
Conventicles, makes the third default Baniſhment, for ſeven years into the Plantations (<hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>Virginia</hi> excepted;) And how can it be ſuppoſed, that the Plantations the places to which the defaulters were to be Baniſhed, can be underſtood to be comprehended within the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and penalty of that Statute; that did continue in force, for little more time than four years. The other of the 22<hi>d.</hi> did ſupply its room, and had much more mild penalties.</p>
                  <p>As to the third, which is that he Preached without being qualifyed, that is laid againſt the Act of Toleration. I did offer, that this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute likewiſe was not, nor is in force in the Plantations generally, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in this Province, altho' there be no locality expreſsly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, and that for theſe Reaſons. The title and whole deſign of it is Toleration; now Toleration is an exception from ſome reſtraint; and ſince the Paenal Laws are not of force here by conſequence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Act of Toleration of force, here is no Eſtabliſhed Church for the whole Province; from which we ſhould be tolerated. We have had liberty of Conſcience another way, and by an Act of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which was made in the beginning of the Reign of K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> during the Government of Col. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> not yet formally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed. Then again conſider the Preamble of the Act of Toleration, to the end that all our Proteſtant Subjects, may be united in intereſt and affection; the wiſdom of the Nation did at that time combine, to put an end to all Perſecution on the ſcore of Religion. Our Aſſembly was much of the ſame mind, deſigning to prevent it, and ſo are all good men: when we did ſet about erecting a Church of <hi>England</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Town, and obtained a Charter for the ſame, of Governour <hi>Fletcher;</hi> altho' we were deſirous to have the National Worſhip amongſt us, yet was it the care of theſe Members, who promoted it, to get ſuch Clauſes inſerted in it, as ſhould ſecure the Liberty of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Congregations from our Succeſſors; and in an Act of Aſſembly made ſince, for its encouragement, the like care and precaution was had; which are ſtill to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>This Province has not been much more than forty years in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and is made up chiefly of Foreigners, and Diſſenters; and Perſecution would not only tend to the diſuniting us all, in intereſt and affection, but depopulate and weaken our Strength, and diſcourage all ſuch Adventurers for the future. Therefore as this Proſecution is the firſt of this nature or ſort, ever was in this Province, ſo I hope it will be the laſt.</p>
                  <p>The Defendant prayed, he might have liberty to ſpeak for himſelf,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001300_0032_0FB27B7E8B0BBE58"/>
which was granted; and he pleaded in his own defence, the following Arguments, which I publiſh in his own words.</p>

                     <speaker>F. M.</speaker>
                     <p>I am amazed to find Mr. Attorney ſo much changed in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; for when I was before my Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> who told us, the Act of Toleration was limited and local, and extended not to the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And Mr. Attorney being pleaſed to confirm it, by aſſerting the ſame thing, and went a little further, by producing an Argument to ſtrengthen his opinion, That the Paenal Laws of <hi>England,</hi> did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Plantations, and the Act of Toleration was made to take off the edge of the Paenal Laws; Therefore the Toleration does not extend hither; but we find ſoon after by an Indictment, both the Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws and Toleration reaches hither, and all their penalties too.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>The Honourable Chief Juſtice, <hi>Roger Mompeſſon</hi> Eſqr. interrupted the Defendant, by ſaying: Gentlemen, <hi>Do not trouble the Court with what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe paſſed between you, before my Lord, or at any other time, but ſpeak to the point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>F. M.</speaker>
                     <p>May it pleaſe your Honour, I hope to make it appear, it is to the point; and what was Mr. Attorneys argument then, is now mine: For whatever opinion I was of, while an abſolute Stranger to <hi>New-York,</hi> and its Conſtitution; yet ſince I have informed my ſelf tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly with the Conſtitution of this place, I am intirely of Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys opinion, and hope he will be of the ſame ſtill.</p>
                     <p>And as to the Indictment, to return to the particulars thereof; and firſt, I am charged with contemning, and endeavouring to Subvert the Supremacy of the Queen in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. As to the Queens Supremacy about Eccleſiaſtical perſons and things, we allow and be-believe, She has as large a Supremacy, as in the Word of God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to any Chriſtian Kings and Princes in the World; and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, which will compare with any in the World, and is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally known to the Chriſtian World, is very full in that matter; a part whereof is judged neceſſary to be inſerted here, for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of many.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>And in all which Mr. Attorney has offered concerning the Queens Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, I cannot learn one argument, or one word, from all the quoted Statutes, that Preaching a Sermon, is the leaſt contempt, or overthrow of the Supremacy. And I hope it is not now unknown to any, that the Oath of Supremacy, has been aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Law, ever ſince the Revolution, and conſequently the Subject muſt be delivered from ſome obligation thereby: and how far this will be conſtructed to extend, I leave to the Judges to determine.</p>
                     <p>And as to my Preaching without Licence firſt obtained from Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> which is aſſerted to be againſt Law; I cannot hear from any Law yet produced, that Ld. <hi>Cornbury</hi> has any power or directions to grant a Licence to any Diſſenters, or that any of them are under any obligation, to take Licence from his Lordſhip, before they Preach, or after Mr Attorney pretends no Law, unleſs he concludes the Queens Inſtructions to be a Law, or have the force of a Law: That they have no force of a Law, has been abundantly proved already; neither am I any way culpable even from the Queens Inſtructions, which are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Court; for they conſiſting of two parts, or rather two diſtinct Inſtructions, not relating at all to the ſame perſons: <hi>In the firſt,</hi> his Excellency is required to permit a Liberty of Conſcience to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons except Papiſts. And this is the Liberty is allowed to Diſſenters and which we claim, by virtue of this Inſtruction: and here is no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001300_0034_0FB27B8392619100"/>
mentioned and required; for permiſſion is a negative act, and implies no more but this; you ſhall ſo allow it, as not to hinder, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt or diſquiet them, but rather protect them in it: And Papiſts being particularly expreſſed, it cannot be applied to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> therefore Diſſenters are intended by this Inſtruction, and no other; and if this permiſſion is granted us, according to the expreſs words thereof, we deſire no more. And it cannot be eſteemed by any, that impriſoning and puniſhing of us at ſuch a rate, for Preaching one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, is a permitting us Liberty of Conſcience. <hi>The other</hi> diſtinct <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph,</hi> or rather, the other Inſtruction, which tho' joined together in this Copy, are at a conſiderable diſtance from one another in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; as we really found it ſo, in a Copy of Inſtructions to a former Governour: And as the former concerns Diſſenters, ſo this is intended for the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for the words of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as you have it above, are theſe: <hi>You are not to permit any Miniſter coming from</hi> England, <hi>to Preach in your Government, without a Certificate from the Right Reverend, the Biſhop of</hi> London, <hi>nor any other Miniſter coming from any other part or place, without firſt obtaining leave of you, our Governour.</hi> Here is another Inſtruction, which ſhould not be produced or improved againſt Diſſenters; for all mankind, and thoſe of the meaneſt capacity muſt conclude and determine, that this concerns only the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who by their Conſtitution, are under ſtrict obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to take Licence, or Certificate from their Ordinary, and ſuch as come to the Plantations, acknowledge the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> as ſuch; and no Diſſenter, either in <hi>England,</hi> or any where elſe in the Queens Dominion, ever took, or ever was under any obligation to take any Licence from the Queens or Kings of <hi>England,</hi> or any other Perſon or Perſons whatſoever; until a method &amp; practice has of late been erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and forced into practice at <hi>New-York:</hi> For if our Liberty either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on a Licence or Certificate from the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> or the Governours of <hi>America,</hi> we ſhould ſoon be deprived of our Liberty of Conſcience, ſecured to us by Law, and repeated Reſolutions of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Soveraign, and Gracious Queen, inviolably to maintain the Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which She is pleaſed to ſignifie in Her Royal Inſtructions to all Her Governours abroad; which we are the more aſſured of, from the Inſtructions produced in this Court. So that as the firſt clauſe of this latter Inſtruction, cannot be applied to any other Miniſters, but of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſo the latter clauſe can be underſtood of no other but the ſame ſort, or ſpecies, as thoſe who came from <hi>England</hi> with Certificate from the Biſhop of <hi>London:</hi> And it is well known, there are
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001300_0035_0FB27B8499153BF0"/>
Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who may come, and do come not directly from <hi>England,</hi> but from ſome other place, as from ſundry Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>America;</hi> as Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> now Chaplain at <hi>Fort-Anne,</hi> came not directly from <hi>England,</hi> but from <hi>Maryland:</hi> And I muſt confeſs, he being a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and enjoyes a conſiderable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice thereby, was obliged to comply with the Conſtitution of his own Church, and take a Licence from Ld. <hi>Cornbury,</hi> if none could be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> But all this is foreign to us, and not at all required of any Diſſenter in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>America.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if there had been any thing in theſe Inſtructions requiring Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters to take any Licence, or empowering Governours of the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to grant them, which we do not find; Preaching a Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch Licence, cannot be judged a Crime, deſerving ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement and Proſecution as we have met with; for it has been already made appear, that thoſe Inſtruction cannot have the force of a Law, to bind the Subject to Obedience, or render him culpable for Diſobedience, ſeeing Promulgation, which is the Life of the Law, and renders all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inexcuſable, never as yet have accompanied theſe Inſtructions: So if this be Mr. Attorneys Law we have broke, by not obtaining Licence before Preaching, I hope, you Gentlemen of the Jury cannot but find, we are no way culpable hereby, being neither inconſiſtent with the Queens Inſtructions, and not againſt any Law.</p>
                     <p>And as to the laſt part of the Indictment, concerning the Paenal Laws, or the ſundry Statutes againſt Conventicles, they never were deſigned, nor intended by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Legiſlators for <hi>America,</hi> or any of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations thereof; for they are limited &amp; local Acts, all of them reſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> as is manifeſt from the expreſs words of ſaid Law; neither have been ever put in execution in any of the Plantations, until now; yea, have not been executed, even in <hi>England, Wales</hi> or <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> for which they were Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made, theſe twenty years paſt: And when they were put in the moſt ſtrict and rigorous Execution in <hi>England,</hi> which was about the laſt of the Reign of K. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. The Diſſenters of <hi>America</hi> lived very quiet, and even in ſuch Plantations where the Church of <hi>England</hi> has a full and formal Eſtabliſhment. But which is more, even <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who are excluded from all benefit of the Act of Toleration in <hi>England;</hi> yet cannot be touched in <hi>America,</hi> by theſe Paenal Laws; for it is matter of fact known to all, and I appeal to Mr. <hi>Reignere</hi> if Papiſts have not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the exerciſe of their Religion, without moleſtation from Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws, and even in <hi>Maryland,</hi> where the Church of <hi>England</hi> has a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001300_0036_0FB27B86CBEBF0E0"/>
formal eſtabliſhment by Laws made there: And it is manifeſtly known, the Aſſembly of <hi>Maryland</hi> made a late Act againſt <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> and tho' it was never executed, not being approved of by the Queen, yet it is a plain demonſtration, if the Paenal Laws of <hi>England</hi> originally and principally deſigned againſt <hi>Popiſh Recuſants</hi> had extended to the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there would have been no need for ſuch an Act of Aſſembly to be made againſt them in <hi>Maryland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a further argument the Paenal Laws never did extend to the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, becauſe it was a penalty in ſome of them, that perſons after ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and ſo many convictions, are to be baniſhed or tranſported to the <hi>American</hi> Plantations, as places removed beyond, and free from the laſh of Paenal Laws; for to what purpoſe would their baniſhment be, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a removal from their Native Land, they ſhould be laſhed, or ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afreſh by the ſame Paenal Laws.</p>
                     <p>And if the Penal Laws of <hi>England</hi> do not extend to theſe Plantations, where the Church of <hi>England</hi> has a legal and formal Eſtabliſhment, it cannot be imagined, they can take place where there is no particular Perſwaſion eſtabliſhed by Law; and conſequently all Perſwaſions there are upon an equal bottom of Liberty, as I find to be the Caſe with <hi>New-York,</hi> where there is not one Act of Aſſembly, wherein the name or manner of Worſhip as it is in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſo much as expreſſed: And where there is no legal Eſtabliſhment or any penalties or reſtrictions on the Liberty of any Diſſenters, there is no room for, or need of any Toleration; for where no penalty, what muſt we be tolerated from; but pure nullities, or nothings, which ſeems inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the thing it ſelf: Therefore in <hi>New-York</hi> Government all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions there are upon an equal level, and bottom of liberty; and this confirmed to all Diſſenters, except Papiſts, and allowed by an Act of Aſſembly, already read in open Court.

                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:001300_0037_0FB27B8845062DB8"/>Mr. Attorney replied, it was impoſſible for any man to anſwer all which was offered, there was ſo much delivered, and by ſo many.</p>
                  <p>The Defendant told Mr. Attorney, he verily believed it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Mr. Attorney to anſwer what was ſaid, and that it was a great truth Mr. Attorney aſſerted.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Attorney proceeds to anſwer, and ſays: Theſe Gentlemen on the other ſide aſſert all the Paenal Laws of <hi>England</hi> are local &amp; limited to <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed;</hi> but I ſhall produce one that is not ſo, but extends to all the Queens Dominions; and that is the Act of Uniformity, made the firſt of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which is demonſtrated from the very words of ſaid Law, <hi>or other place within this Realm of England, Wales, and the Marches of the ſame,</hi> and <hi>other the QUEENS Dominions:</hi> And flies to the Inſtructions again, and endeavours to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and vindicate the Supremacy, and ſays, the Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> Enjoin and Command their Governours to grant Licences; and it has always been cuſtomary, and an univerſal practice to take Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences from Governours: And thoſe Miniſters who come from other places, muſt be the ſame that my Ld. is to allow Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto.</p>
                  <p>The Defendant begged leave to anſwer the Attorney as to his laſt Argument, as to the firſt of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which is the Act of Uniformity; we acknowledge it was extenſive to the Queens Dominions in general, and not limited to <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> only; yet I hope to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, this Act does no way affect the Plantations, and far leſs affect Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters; therfore is altogether foreign to our preſent purpoſe. For 1. That Act of Parliament was made in the firſt year of the Reign of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and conſequently before any Plantation had a being, or was thought of, and ſo could have no relation to them at all, they being pure non-entities at that time. 2. All over the Act, and in ſundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, it is directed to Miniſters, Parſons or Vicars in Cathedrals, Pariſh-Churches, Private Chappels, or Oratories; and not a word in the whole Act of Diſſenters or Conventicles. For 3. At that time, when this Act was made, there were not ſtrictly and properly ſpeaking, any number of Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> who held Separate Meetings from the Publick and Eſtabliſhed Worſhip; for tho' there were thoſe in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who always from the beginning of the Reformation ſcrupled the uſe of all the Common Prayer, and omitted ſome Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which was, and is to this day, the grounds of the Separation; and it was to oblige ſuch to an Uniformity in Publick Worſhip. And as ſoon as the Act was made, and put in Execution, with all its penalties,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001300_0038_0FB27B89C6C3CFC0"/>
many were diſcouraged, others Caſt out of the Church, for Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; and this really made the Separation, and all the miſchiefs of the Separation are originally owing to this Act; tho' as ſoon as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was made, they could not touch Diſſenters by the penalties of this Act, therefore were under a neceſſity of making new Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the following Reigns, for puniſhing Separated Diſſenters; all which were limited and local in expreſs words; and never deſigned to purſue Perſecuted Perſons to an <hi>American</hi> Wilderneſs. 4. I am able to make it appear, if this Act of Uniformity were ſtrictly put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the moſt of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> would fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its laſhes and penalties; for none of them are to uſe any other Rite, Ceremony, or open Prayer, but what is mentioned and ſet forth, in the ſaid Book of Common-Prayer. And it is well known, the moſt valuable men in that Church uſe another Publick Prayer, then is in Common Prayer, and all ſuch perſons are ſo far Diſſenters, and being in Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are only liable to be Proſecuted upon this Statute.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Queens Inſtructions, which Mr. Attorney inſiſts ſo much upon, it was, and is obvious to every man, they were two diſtinct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; and tho' we have them placed ſo near in this Copy, they have no affinity one to another; and it is not fair for Mr. Attorney to take the latter clauſe of one Inſtruction, and join it to another, which was before; this is a Curtailing the Queens Inſtructions: whereas thoſe who compoſed them, knew better how to join them together, then Mr. Attorney does.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Mr. Attorney affirms, that giving and taking Licence was very common and univerſal; I am well aſſured there never was, neither is to this day any ſuch practice in any Plantation of <hi>America;</hi> and there were but few perſons, as yet in <hi>York</hi> Government that had Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences; for beſides the two <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters, who differ upon <hi>Long-I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland,</hi> and it is ſaid Licences are the cauſe of their difference; there is but one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nonconformiſt Miniſter, in all the Government, who has taken a Licence, and it is as certain, Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> and ſundry others of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches has no Licence, neither will ſubmit to any ſuch as are granted.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Attorney perceiving how matters then ſtood, moves that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould bring in a ſpecial Verdict, and the Judges inclined thereunto; for ſays Mr. Attorney, the matter of fact is plainly confeſſed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, as you have heard, and you are to bring it in ſpecially, for you are not Judges of Law.</p>

                        <hi>Theſe Gentlemen acknowledge, and ſay, the Miniſters of the Church of</hi> England <hi>are to take Licences, and obliged ſo to do; and if ſo, the Diſſenters ſhould alſo, otherwiſe they muſt expect more favour and liberty then the Miniſters of the Church of</hi> England.</p>

                     <p>I muſt confeſs, the Caſe is very different; for it is the opinion and conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that notwithſtanding their Ordination, they are not to Preach or Officiate as Miniſters, until they procure, or have a Licence from their Biſhop, or Ordinary, which no Diſſenting Miniſter is concerned with; and they voluntarily and freely bring themſelves under an Oath of Canonical Obedience, to obey their Ordinary; and if he require them to take Licences, or any thing elſe they muſt, they are ſworn to ſubmit thereunto.

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001300_0040_0FB27B8FC2E397F0"/>
ſubmit to Licence, but we are not; becauſe it is only <hi>bare liberty</hi> which Diſſenters have; but they have not only <hi>Liberty,</hi> but a conſiderable <hi>Maintainance</hi> alſo; without which, I never knew any of them value Liberty only; and Diſſenters having liberty only without any Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from the Government, are not at all under obligations, neither is it required of them to take Licences of any.</p>

                  <p>The Jury is called, and finds the Defendant Not Guilty.</p>
                  <p>The Court begun to enquire Reaſons for the Jury's Verdict, but the Chief Juſtice told the Jury, they might give Reaſons if they would, &amp; they might chooſe whether they would or not give any Reaſons for their Verdict.

            <p>The next thing to be taken notice of in this Poſtſcript, is a Copy of Mr. <hi>Makemies</hi> Certificate from a Court of Record in the Dominion of <hi>Virginia;</hi> which was produced to, and read by Ld. <hi>Cornbury,</hi> before Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001300_0049_0FB27BAC2D4591B0"/>
Certificate was writ under a Hedge, which no doubt influenced them to have no regard thereunto: Yet if the Act of Toleration, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this Certificate had come in play at the Tryal, he was armed with an Exemplification from the Government, ſigned by the Praeſident, and the Seal of the Colony annext, to prove the truth and validity of this Certificate, and vindicate it from Forgery.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing is an account of the Expences, of not only a perſon who is innocent, but for doing good, as was determined by the Tryal; and in complying with the moſt ſolemn obligations of duty, both to God, and the Souls of men. To which, beſides loſs of time, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from his Family and Concerns, he might have juſtly charged <hi>Twelve Pounds</hi> more Money, by being neceſſiated to make his Eſcape, both by Land and Water to <hi>New-England,</hi> from Office with new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, whereby a whole Sabbath was prophaned, in ſeeking to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him; for which ſome muſt be accountable.</p>
            <p>But it is plain and undeniable, that the Proſecution of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon in the world at <hi>New-York</hi> is more expenſive, then if Mr. <hi>Makemie</hi> had been guilty of all the Paenal Laws muſtered up, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment againſt one Sermon, if proſecuted in <hi>England,</hi> even while P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
