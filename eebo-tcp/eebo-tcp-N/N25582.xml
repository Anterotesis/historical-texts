            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The very manner in which deſtruction is to come upon them ſhows their continual danger. For, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>ſurely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery places, and thou caſtedſt them down into deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their ſtate is the more awful, as they are expoſed to ſudden and unexpected ruin. If a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>enture on ſlippery ground, he is not only liable every moment to fall, but when his foot does ſlide, it is inſtantaneous, and he falls without warning. The reaſon why they have not already fallen is becauſe God in mercy hath held them up. But in due time their foot <hi>ſhall</hi> ſlide. When they ſhall have proceeded in the commiſſion of crime after crime againſt God and human ſociety, till the meaſure of their iniquities be full, then the moſt high God, will in his providence, no longer hold them up in their walks upon ſlippery ground, where they never had any leave to venture, but let them ſink under the weight of their ſins into merited contempt and miſery.</p>
            <p>In order more fully to illuſtrate this truth, that impenitently
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033979_0006_0FF9F3DDE8A4B190"/>
wicked, and immoral men will be detected and puniſhed, let me propoſe the following things for conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. There is no want of power in God to begin the infliction of that puniſhment upon ſuch perſons, which they deſerve, at any time, when he pleaſes. Feeble mortals can make no reſiſtance againſt an omnipotent arm. Though earthly princes have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found it difficult to ſubdue a rebel when he has fortified and made himſelf ſtrong; yet no fortreſs nor numbers can avail any thing againſt almighty God. If hand join in hand, and ever ſo many in malevolence combine againſt him, they are eaſily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and deſtroyed. They are like a rope of ſand,—feeble as the chaff before a driving ſtorm;—the drieſt ſtubble in the field, is not more eaſily conſumed by the raging of an uncontroled fire. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the ballance.</hi> However eaſy it may be for us, to cruſh the worm, which crawls under our feet, upon the ground, or to cut the thread by which any thing is ſuſpended in the air, ſtill with infinitely more eaſe, the Almighty can deſtroy his enemies. What is man, that he ſhould preſume to think of reſiſting God, at whoſe rebuke the earth trembles, and before whom the mountains are levelled.</p>
            <p n="2">2ndly. Another conſideration which ſhows that impenitent, diſobedient men, will be overtaken in their career of vice, and puniſhed, is, that this they deſerve. Such are their crimes againſt God and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that they deſerve, and have reaſon to expect this, as a reward for their evil deeds. That juſtice to which a holy God muſt always have a ſacred regard, will not ſtand in the way; nor be any objection to his executing vengeance upon them. But deſerving puniſhment, juſtice will rather demand that they ſhould ſuffer. To every tree in the garden, which bringeth forth the fruit of Sodom and Gomorrah, the language of juſtice, is, <hi>cut it down; why cumbereth it the</hi> ground? Being under the ſentence of condemnation, the ſword of juſtice already hangs over their heads. The law of God, which he has eſtabliſhed as a rule of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, condemns them; for <hi>he that believeth not is condemned already.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3rdly. It is a conſideration of importance that impenitent, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient men, are now under the very ſame <hi>kind</hi> of divine diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as God exerciſes towards thoſe whom he puniſhes in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ns of deſpair. The reaſon why, by human laws they are not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tected, and condemned, is not becauſe God is unoffended at their crimes: The reaſon why they do not immediately ſink down into miſery, is no proof of their innocence. Perhaps the divine being is now more diſpleaſed with them, than with ſome, who for thouſands of years have been ſuffering in <hi>the place of torment.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:033979_0007_0FF9C93A30C1EF00"/>

               </gap>y: and though God's diſpleaſure will be made much more manifeſt in the future than in the preſent world, yet, his diſpleaſure is always in proportion to the creature's criminality.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding there are ſome hardened perſons who think themſelves ſafe in continuing a vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that they may now be much more criminal than ſome who have long ſince periſhed, and therefore are under the greater diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God.

            <p n="4">4thly. Still further to illuſtrate the truth, that impenitent, vicious men muſt fall in due time, let me ſuggeſt, that they have nothing on which to depend for ſafety, protection, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. If the thief, the murderer, the man of lewdneſs, or any other ſinner, ſhould ſee nothing which is likely in his opinion, to be the means or his detection and puniſhment: this however is no evidence but there are means now operating which will ſpeedily bring his works of darkneſs to light, unto his utter confuſion and ruin. It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that as God has appointed the end, he has alſo appointed the means. If a man walk on ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ground, he muſt be blind, not to ſee his danger and the means which are likely to effectuate his fall. To bring this to paſs, there is no need of a miracle, or that any thing extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould take place. It is in vain that they cry peace, and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for the higheſt authority has long ſince aſſured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Their own care, cunning and ſecret artifice, or the moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent precaution and vigilance of others can be no certain ſecurity to them.

But if they hearken not to Moſes and the Prophets, neither would they be perſuaded, were one to riſe from the dead, and preach the very ſame truths, hold out the very ſame threats, and offer the very ſame promiſes of pardon and felicity, which have already been preſented to them by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt being the chief-corne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ANTHONY: it is by your requeſt that I ſpeak on this occaſion and this is the laſt addreſs which I ſhall ever make to you. From the ſentence pronounced upon you by the court, and from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations with which you are ſurrounded, you muſt ſee that you have but a very, <hi>very</hi> ſhort time to live. Your ſituation is truly deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

It muſt have been known to you, as you were educated and have lived in a chriſtian land, that the crime of which you are convicted, was a violation of the law of God and man.

            <p>Before I conclude, let me entreat you, my hearers, to pity, and pray for this poor criminal, that God would be pleaſed to grant him repentance and the remiſſion of his ſins.

Believing it conſiſtent with the plan of divine mercy in the redemption of men, for God to ſave him, if truly penitent, you can pray for him as his diſtreſſing condition requires. Go not to the place of execution merely to ſee an awful, unuſual exhibition, and to gratify vain curioſity; but whatever injury the criminal may have done you, or others, now pity and forgive him: leave him indeed to fall a vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
