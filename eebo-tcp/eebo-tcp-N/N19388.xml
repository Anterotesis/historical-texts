            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>AN</hi> Authentic Account, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SOME years ago an Engliſh Gentleman, by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular providence, had occaſion to be in North America, where, among other adventures, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtance occurred to him, which is related in his own words.</p>
            <p>"Every day's obſervation convinces me that the children of God are made ſo by his own eſpecial grace and power, and that all means, whether more or leſs, are equally effectual with him, whenever he is pleaſed to employ them for converſion.</p>
            <p>"In one of my excurſions, while I was in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New York,</hi> I was walking by myſelf over a conſiderable plantation, amuſed with its huſbandry, and comparing it with that of my own country, till I came within a little diſtance of a middle-aged negro, who was tilling the ground. I felt a ſtrong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, unuſual with me, to converſe with him. After aſking him ſome little queſtions about his work, which he anſwered very ſenſibly, I wiſhed him to tell me, whether his ſtate of ſlavery was not diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to him, and whether he would not gladly exchange it for his liberty. "Maſſah, (ſaid he, looking ſeriouſly upon me) I have wife and children; my maſſah takes care of them, and I have no care to provide any thing; I have a good maſſah, who teach me to read; and I read good book, that make me happy." I am glad, replied I, to hear you ſay ſo; and pray what is the good book you read? "The Bible, maſſah, God's own good book." Do you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand friend, as well as read this book? for many
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:025244_0003_0FCCE9142DD5FE58"/>can read the words well; who cannot get hold of the true and good ſenſe. "O maſſah, ſays he, I read the book much before I underſtand; but at laſt I felt pain in my heart; I found things in the book that cut me to pieces." Aye, ſaid I, what things were they? "Why maſſah, I found that I had bad heart, maſſah, a very bad heart indeed: I felt pain, that God would deſtroy me, becauſe I was wicked, and done nothing as I ſhould do. God was holy, and I was very vile and naughty; ſo I could have nothing from him but fire and brimſtone in hell." In ſhort, he entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a full account of his convictions of ſin, which were indeed as deep &amp; piercing as any I had ever heard of; and what ſcriptures came to his mind, which he had read, that both probed him to the bottom of his ſinful heart, and were made the means of light and comfort to his ſoul. I then enquired of him, what miniſtry or means he made uſe of, and found that his maſter was a Quaker, a plain ſort of man, who had taught his ſlaves to read, but who had not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ever converſed with this negro upon the ſtate of his ſoul. I aſked him how he got comfort under all this trial? "O maſſah, ſays he, it was Chriſt gave me comfort by his dear word. He bade me come unto him, and he would give me reſt, for I was very weary and heavy laden. And here he went through a line of the moſt precious texts in the bible, ſhewing me, by his artleſs comment upon them as he went a long, what great things God had done in the courſe of ſome years for his ſoul. Being rather more acquainted with doctrinal truths, and the anal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy of the bible, than he had been, or in his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could eaſily be; I had a mind to try how far a ſimple untutored experience, greaciouſly given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſual means, could carry a man from ſome ſpeculative errors; and therefore aſked him ſeveral queſtions about the merit of works, the juſtification of a ſinner, the power of grace, and the like. I own
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025244_0004_0FCCE91669F52278"/>I was as much aſtoniſhed at, as I admired, the ſweet ſpirit and ſimplicity of his anſwers, with the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom that God had put into the mind of this negro. His diſcourſe, flowing merely from the richneſs of grace, with a tenderneſs and expreſſion for "beyond the reach of art," perfectly charmed me. On the other hand, my entering into all his feelings, together with an account to him, which he had never heard before, that thus and thus the Lord in his mercy dealt with all his children, and had dealt with me, drew ſtreams of joyful tears down his black face, that we looked upon each-other, and talked with that inexpreſſible glow of chriſtian affection, that made me more than ever believe, what I have often too thoughtleſsly profeſſed to believe, <hi>the communion of ſaints.</hi> I ſhall never forget how the poor excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent creature ſeemed to hang upon my lips, and to eat my very words, when I enlarged upon the love of Chriſt to poor ſinners, the free bounty and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy of God, the frequent and delightful ſenſe he gives of his preſence, the faith he beſtows in his promiſes, the victories this faith is enabled to get over trials and temptations, the joy and peace in believing, the hope in life and death, and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expectation of immortality. To have taken off his eager, delighted, animated, air and manner, would have been a maſterly-piece for a <hi>Reynolds.</hi>— He had never heard ſuch a diſcourſe, nor found the opportunity of hearing it before. He ſeemed like a man who had been thrown into a new world, and at length had found company. Though my converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laſted, at leaſt, two or three hours, I ſcarce ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er enjoyed the happy ſwiftneſs of time ſo ſweetly in all my life. We knew not how to part. He would accompany me as far as he might; and I felt, for my part, ſuch a delight in the artleſs, ſavory, ſolid, unaffected experience of this dear ſoul, that I could have been glad to ſee him often then, or to ſee his
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025244_0005_0FCCE917E17D1AD8"/>like at any time now. But my ſituation rendered this impoſſible. I therefore took an affectionate adieu, with an ardor equal to the warmeſt and the moſt ancient friendſhip, telling him, that neither the colour of his body, nor the condition of his preſent life, could prevent him from being my dear brother in out dear Saviour; and that, though we muſt part now, never to ſee each other again any more in this world, I had no doubt of our having another joyful meeting in our Father's home, where we ſhould live together, and love one another through out along and a happy eternity. "Amen. Amen, my dear maſſah; God bleſs you, and poor me too, for ever and ever." If I had been an angel from heaven, he could not have received me with more evident delight than he did; nor could I have conſidered him with a more ſympathetic regard, if he had been a long known chriſtian of the good old ſort, grown up into my affections in the courſe of many years."<note place="bottom">IT is written in the ſcriptures, and fulfilled in the experience of real chriſtians, <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God,</hi>

               </gap> this anguiſh of ſpirit, and dreadful bondage of ſoul, I found relief in a manner moſt unexpected.</p>
            <p>After I had ſaid myſelf down on my bed, my mind was led to a moſt delightful and realizing view of the entire ſafety of truſting in the Divine Power and Mercy; that there was ſuch a fulneſs in God, of that which I needed for relief and comfort, that my heart within me was conſtrained to rejoice, and could not but roll my burden upon the Lord. At this time the words of the Pſalmiſt, in which he ſays, Thou haſt brought my feet up out of the miry clay," &amp;c. were to my ſoul ſweeter than honey or the honey comb; and alſo the 16th Hymn of the third book of Doctor WATTS" Hymns, was to my ſoul like a feaſt of fat things, and of wine upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For ſome conſiderable time after this, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, almoſt without any intermiſſion, a moſt ſweet and refreſhing ſenſe of the beauty and glory of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine objects. But not underſtanding the treachery of my own heart, and the deceitfulneſs of ſin, I was allured away by degrees, into a forgetfulneſs of God, and from a cloſe walk with him, through an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that I might innocently indulge myſelf in joining with young people in what is uſually term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed civil merriment; and which I was induced to do more eſpecially and principally that I might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> ſtate of ſenſible guilt and darkneſs, I continued
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025244_0008_0FCCE91C6853AF48"/>like one forſaken of God, and ſhut out from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, till the firſt day of laſt July, when I was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with convulſions, which came upon me with ſuch violence that it appeared to myſelf and others, that my animal frame muſt yield to the force of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and my life ſoon come to a period.</p>
            <p>She continued in this ſituation till the night of the eleventh of July, when ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized with a moſt violent cramp in her ſtomach, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch agony and diſtreſs that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared impoſſible for her to live from one hour to another. In this ſituation ſhe continued till the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing night, when the cramp in her ſtomach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to ſuch a degree, that the conſtant wreck and agony of body conſtrained her to a continual rolling and tumbling on her bed, during which time, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſpeechleſs, but appeared to have her ſenſes; for when any ſpoke, ſhe would take them by the hand and intimate that ſhe underſtood what they ſaid. All hopes of life were now at an end in the view of the family, and neighbors, who had come together at the houſe on this occaſion. But after having contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this extremity of diſtreſs, till about midnight, ſhe appeared to be more eaſy; upon which the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors retired to their ſeveral homes. But ſoon after this ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized again, and ſuppoſed by the family to be dead; and accordingly the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors were called together to the houſe, with the tidings that POLLY was dead.</p>
            <p>Upon the arrival of the neareſt neighbor, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that ſhe lay ſtretched out on her back, with her eyes about half open, and the ſight of her eyes turned up into her head — She appeared at firſt ſight to be entirely lifeleſs; but upon trial, he found for once, ſome motion in her pulſe.—After lying in this poſture for an hour or more, ſhe ſuddenly fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a long ſigh, and opened her eyes, and related as</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:025244_0009_0FCCE91DDFDC5F40"/>
I have ſeen hell naked before my eyes, and fully expected to plunge into it. The ſight was diſmal beyond all diſcription. It was a region of moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal darkneſs and ſmoke. In the midſt of theſe dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhades appeared to my view a perſon whom I knew; and after having had ſight of him, he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſink down into the darkneſs and ſmoke of the horrible pit. I heard the groans of the damned ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which indicated that agony and diſtreſs which is beyond all utterance or conception. In the utmoſt extremity of danger, and when I appeared to myſelf to be ready to plunge into the diſmal gulf of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſery, my Saviour took me by the hand, and told me to follow him. Upon which he led me thro a place reſembling the moſt diſmal miry clay; and from thence thro a hideous wilderneſs; after paſſing which, every object which opened to my view, appeared to be cloathed with an inexpreſſible beauty. My Saviour addreſſed me, and ſaid, he had brought my feet out of the miry clay, and had ſet them upon a rock; and he himſelf appeared to be the rock up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I ſtood. I was admitted into the heavenly world, where the Lord looked upon me, and ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and told me I muſt return and warn a wicked world for a ſeaſon: but ſhould, in a ſhort time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again. He told me I ſhould be much more ſick than I had been, but ſhould wholly recover, and be well for a ſeaſon. I ſaw thouſands of the heavenly hoſt cloathed in that beauty which cannot be uttered; and heard thoſe ſongs of praiſe, the melody of which is beyond the power of language to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>Upon her having declared to the by-ſtanders theſe diſcoveries, ſhe remained for the ſpace of three days and three nights without food or ſleep: during the whole of which time ſhe was almoſt inceſſantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in praying and praiſing GOD, and warning others to prepare for death. After this ſhe gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025244_0010_0FCCE91F68C56C78"/>recovered to ſuch a degree of health, as to be able to walk about the houſe; and, at times, to walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. In this ſpace ſhe frequently ſaid that ſhe ſhould be much ſicker than ever ſhe bad been; but ſhould certainly recover to a better ſtate of health than ſhe had enjoyed for four years paſt. She fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pointed out the week in which ſhe ſhould be taken ſick, and reduced to ſuch a ſtate of extreme weakneſs and diſtreſs; and accordingly, on Friday of the ſame week ſhe had mentioned (which was the 27th of July) ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized with a moſt violent cramp convulſion, which was ſoon accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a profuſe diſcharge of blood from her ſtomach; in which ſituation ſhe continued till the 18th of Auguſt; during which time ſhe was reduced apparently to the laſt extremity, and all viſible proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the poſſibility of her living was now at an end.</p>
            <p>For the ſpace of ſixteen days ſhe was not known to turn herſelf in the bed except once. From Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night to the Saturday night following, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained intirely without food or drink, except for once ſhe took down a little water, and upon her having for once ſwallowed a morſel of food, her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach immediately rejected it. She was ſo weak that it was with diſſiculty, and very ſeldom, ſhe could make any one underſtand her by whiſpering in their ear. On Saturday ſhe was tho't to be dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but as ſhe had all along intimated to thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her that ſhe ſhould certainly recover, ſo ſhe now continued to intimate the ſame by ſigns, to the by-ſtanders.—In this ſituation ſhe continued till about eight o'clock in the evening, at which time, to the ſurprize of the by ſtanders, ſhe ſpoke out in plain and audible words, and ſaid, "Stand by, and let me get up." Immediately upon which ſhe ſprang up from her bed, and walked the room with an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing nimbleneſs and alacrity, praiſing GOD'S and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025244_0011_0FCCE920E62C3B68"/>calling on the by ſtanders to join with her to praiſe that bleſſed Saviour, who had appeared for her in that wonderful manner. But they ſtood like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons over whelmed in aſtoniſhment, to ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of GOD'S power diſplayed in ſuch a manner, in reſtoring one to health and ſtrength in a moment, who had been reduced to ſo low a ſtate by extreme ſickneſs.</p>
            <p>Upon this recovery, ſhe related that ſhe faw one ſtanding in white, who ſaid to her, "If you will get up, you ſhall be able to walk; and you muſt go up to SCOTT'S;" (which was one mile diſtant from her houſe) and accordingly, that evening ſhe rode to Capt. Scott's, and tarried ſome hours, and returned home; and having retired to bed, a little after day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſhe aroſe early on the morning, and before ſun-riſe, was on her way to meeting at <hi>Corniſh,</hi> to the diſtance of five miles, from whence ſhe returned home on the ſame day.</p>
            <p>From the time of her recovery, ſhe has enjoyed, hitherto, a much better ſtate of health, than for four years paſt; and is now as well as is uſual for a female of a delicate conſtitution; and remains an evident monument of the Divine power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>The above mentioned POLLY DAVIS, requeſts that her moſt affectionate love may be preſented to every reader; and aſks leave to teſtify, That a ſenſo of GOD'S love in the heart, is better than wine; and that all things which can be deſired, are not to be compared to it. Under a ſenſe of this, ſhe aſks liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to call upon every reader to come and taſte that the LORD is gracious; and that her fellow youth, in ſpecial, would remember him in their early days, and regard his glory as their governing object. She does intreat them, in ſpecial, to forſake the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world, and pride of life. And if they
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025244_0012_0FCCE922BB6F1298"/>would walk with GOD, ſo as to enjoy the light of his countenance, and have comfort in their ſoul, they do ſacredly abſtain from, and forever abandon, that kind of fooliſh talking, and jeſting, and that recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and merriment, which generally paſſes, even amongſt many profeſſors of Religion, for <hi>civil and innocent.</hi>—She certainly knows by what ſhe has found upon trial, that theſe things, in their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be like wormwood and gall to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Under a ſenſe that we are called with an high and holy calling, ſhe affectionately intreats every one to conſider, what manner of perſons we ought to be, in all holy converſation and godlineſs; looking for, and haſtening unto, the day of GOD, that we may be found of him in peace at his appearing, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be received into his eternal kingdom.</p>
