            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following ſermon was firſt delivered to the people of my charge, at an evening lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, upwards of nineteen years ago. Many earneſt ſolicitations that it might be printed, have been withſtood; and it would have ſtill ſlept in oblivion, had not the practice inveighed againſt been revived, and attended to, in a fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick manner, at a time when every thing in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is calling us to different exerciſes. The judgments of God are now ſpread over our land, and the inhabitants ought to learn righteouſneſs. The alarm of war—the clangor of arms—the garments rolled in blood—the ſufferings of our brethren in the Northern States, and of others in a ſtate of captivity; together with the late dreadful conflagration in this town, are ſo many loud calls to repentance, reformation of life, and prayer, that the wrath of God may be turned away from us: Inſtead of which, we are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in pleaſure and diſſipation. It will hardly be credited, that the fire was ſcarce extinguiſhed in <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> before we had Balls, Aſſemblies and Dances in every quarter: and even in ſome of thoſe houſes which miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly eſcaped the flames. And who can believe that our youth are now taught to act plays publickly on the ſtage, while the theatre is crowded with ſpectators? Is it thus we requite
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015848_0003_0F9A2DB1500BA698"/>the Lord for our deliverance? The monumental ruins of this town, will riſe up in judgment againſt the inhabitants, and condemn them for ſuch impieties. The ſons and daughters of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure may ſcoff at ſuch ſerious hints, but God will not be mocked. I am no prophet, nor the ſon of a prophet, and yet will venture to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, that other, and perhaps greater judgments will yet light upon us, unleſs we repent.</p>
            <p>With regard to the following diſcourſe, I have only to ſay, that it is preſented to publick view, at the deſire of many friends, and the call of Providence; and that I have thereby borne my teſtimony againſt, what I look upon as a <hi>ſinful diverſion:</hi> and ſhall now ſubmit it to the bleſſing of God, and the candor of thoſe who may read it.</p>
            <p>But I cannot conclude without expreſſing the grateful ſenſe I feel, of my obligations to the many Gentlemen, who, without my knowledge, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, have ſo liberally contributed towards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying the expence of this publication; that little or nothing is left for me to do, ſave pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the copy for the preſs. They may be aſſured that their benevolence and generoſity will not be forgotten by</p>

            <p>THE bare reading of my text hath, I doubt not, occaſioned a ſtrange emotion of ſpirits in many of my hearers; by ſome I may be pitied for my folly, by others, deſpiſed and ridiculed. Be this as it may, it gives me little or no concern. If I had not been willing to endure the ſcoff of the world, I ſhould never have made an open profeſſion of the religion of Jeſus; much leſs ſhould I have become a preacher of his much-deſpiſed goſpel. He, however, who ventures to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack vice, in a public manner, ought to be poſſeſſed of ſome degree of fortitude and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; for ſin is a monſter of more than a thouſand heads; ſhould he ſlay ſome, there will be many yet remaining, and he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be attacked on every ſide; eſpecially if he ſhould dare to level at ſome popular darling vice; one that hath been much ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed, and that too by the more polite part
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015848_0005_0F9A2DB37B157530"/>of the world: in this caſe, there will be a mighty uproar among the people. The whole city, or country, will be filled with wrath, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his aſſociates were, when they cried out, "Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>" Or, as <hi>Micah,</hi> when ſtripped of his idols, and exclaimed, <q>Ye have taken away my gods, and what have I more?</q>
            </p>
            <p>However, leaving the event to God, I am determined, in faithfulneſs to my truſt, to maintain an open and vigorous war with all the vices and ſinful diverſions of the age. Were I to act otherwiſe, my own conſcience would condemn me, and the world might juſtly reproach me, for my unfaithfulneſs. This therefore may juſtify me, for entering on ſuch a ſubject; which I ſhall introduce by making ſome remarks on the context; in which <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to be at a loſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the diſpenſations of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with regard to the proſperity of the wicked. The friends of <hi>Job</hi> were far from comforting him, as they propoſed, under his afflictions, and which they might have done by obſerving to him, that one event often happeneth to the righteous and to the wicked; ſo that no man can certainly judge of love or hatred, by all that is done under the ſun; and that chaſtiſements are ſo far from being poſitive tokens of divine wrath, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rather indicate love; for whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and rebuketh every
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015848_0006_0F9A2DB38FFF1BA8"/>ſon whom he receiveth. Such hints as theſe might have afforded <hi>Job</hi> ſome conſolation, under his heavy trials. But his three friends took a contrary method, which wounded, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of comforting him. The doctrine which they laid down, and endeavoured to maintain was this, that wicked men <hi>only</hi> are ſeverely afflicted in this world. Hence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of comforting <hi>Job,</hi> as an afflicted ſaint, they cenſure him as a vile ſinner, and an hypocrite. <hi>Job</hi> labours to refute their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and maintain his own innocence. He affirms that the wicked often flouriſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich and great in the world; when the righteous, on the other hand, are greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and ſtripped of all their worldly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. He inſtances in his own caſe, and then proceeds to point out the proſperous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the wicked, together with their vain and impious practices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark me,</hi> ſays <hi>Job,</hi> conſider my preſent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous condition, <hi>and be aſtoniſhed,</hi> at the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God with me. Can you juſtly charge me with any groſs and impious practices, which according to your hypotheſis ſhould bring down the judgments of God upon me? You cannot; therefore <hi>lay your hand upon your mouth.</hi> Try no more to vindicate your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when you have a living inſtance, in oppoſition to it, before your eyes. As for my own part, <hi>even when I remember</hi> my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer flouriſhing circumſtances, and conſider
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015848_0007_0F9A2DB48F63B280"/>how I am ſtripped naked and bare, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with the moſt painful and loathſome diſorders, <hi>I am afraid</hi> of thoſe judgments of the Almighty, <hi>and trembling taketh hold on my fleſh;</hi> not being able to account for my being thus afflicted, while the wicked go on unpuniſhed. Tell me, if you can, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</hi> How doth this coincide with your opinion, that God will ſurely take vengeance on the wicked, in this life? The reverſe of this ſeems to be the caſe, for <hi>their houſes are ſafe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</hi> They are not afflicted, or plagued like other men. They ſwim in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and roll in pleaſure; there is no end to their wealth. And with their riches, their families increaſe, ſo that they ſhall not want heirs. <hi>Their ſeed is eſtabliſhed in their ſight, and their offspring before their eyes.</hi> They live to ſee their childrens children, a numerous progeny, around them. So that <hi>they ſend forth their little ones like a flock,</hi> for multitude; they going before them, like a ſhepherd; not to the houſe of God, to engage in ſolemn devotion; rather to balls, aſſemblies and the play-houſe, where <hi>they take the timbrel and harp,</hi> and ſuch like inſtruments of muſick, with which they play, <hi>and their children dance.</hi> Thus merrily they go on, regardleſs of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate, or eternal judgment. <hi>They ſpend their days in wealth,</hi> which they ſquander up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015848_0008_0F9A2DB510B603E0"/>their luſts and pleaſures, in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, although they can ſpare little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the poor, or any other pious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. After they have thus run their race— <hi>in a moment they go down to the pit.</hi> Without any apprehenſion of danger. The wicked have no bands in their death. Their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal concern in life is to gratify their corrupt inclinations; <hi>therefore they ſay unto God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us: for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> The thoughts of God are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to them, and his ways, which are the ways of holineſs, they cannot endure. Like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> they know not the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they obey him. <hi>What is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that we ſhould ſerve him? And what profit ſhould we have, if we pray unto him?</hi> Thus fullneſs of riches, honour and pleaſure ſwell mens minds with pride, and beget in them mean, abſurd and atheiſtical notions of the Deity. They look upon him as a mere idol, as nothing in the world; and therefore conclude that they can derive no advantage from praying unto him.</p>
            <p>This is the character of the wicked, as drawn by <hi>Job;</hi> a perfect and upright man, who feared God and eſchewed evil. In the midſt of which deſcription, and as a part of it, ſtands that very polite, and much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practice of <hi>dancing.</hi> A diverſion, which in all ages hath had its admirers and votaries. To oppoſe it, will be to incur the cenſure of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015848_0009_0F9A2DB5D01CAA10"/>all the gay gentry; and, with them however, to forfeit all pretenſions to polite breeding, and good manners. I am willing to riſque greater conſequences than theſe, that I may maintain a conſcience void of offence, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and towards man. Bear with me then, while I bear my teſtimony againſt a practice, which I look upon as ſinful, and oppoſed to the chriſtian character. And which <hi>Job,</hi> in our text, certainly ſpeaks of as conſtituting part of the character of the wicked. <hi>And their children dance.</hi> Obſerve, it is <hi>their</hi> children, <hi>i. e.</hi> the children of ſuch wicked parents as he was deſcribing. By <hi>children</hi> we do not always underſtand children as to <hi>age;</hi> ſometimes it intends thoſe who have deſcended from ſuch or ſuch parents, although they themſelves may have arrived at mens or womens eſtate. And if we take the word <hi>children</hi> in our text, in this ſenſe, the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> appears evidently to be this, that the families, or poſterity of wicked parents, give into this practice. Would to God that none of the deſcendants of pious parents, ever imitated their bad example: and that it might never be ſaid of any but wicked parents—<hi>And their children dance.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. I am to ſtate the argument, by giving a ſcriptural definition of the word <hi>dance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dancing, according to the ſcripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, is ſometimes to be taken in a good ſenſe; and then it is expreſſive of the inward ſpiritual joy of the heart, which was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted by a comely motion of the body:—attended with ſongs of praiſe to God, for ſome deliverance obtained, or mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Thus was dancing attended to, or practiſed by the good people of old, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious way. When their ſongs were ſpiritual, and the muſick, as alſo the motion of their bodies, were ſuited thereto. Agreeable to which are the words in Pſal. cxlix. 3. <hi>Let them praiſe his name in the dance: let them ſing praiſes unto him with the timbrel and harp.</hi> It was thus <hi>David</hi> danced before the ark, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vi. 16. And in this manner moſt of the dances, which the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had, were attended to; as you may ſee by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the paſſages in Scripture, where they are recorded. As for inſtance, when the Lord had deſtroyed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his army in the Red ſea, the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> women ſung and danced. See <hi>Exod.</hi> xv. 20, 21. <hi>And Miriam the propheteſs, the ſiſter of Aaron, took
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015848_0011_0F9A2DB74E94D578"/>a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her, with timbrels and dances. And Miriam anſwered them, ſing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſly; the horſe and his rider hath he thrown into the ſea.</hi>—Such a ſong as this becomes a rational mind, and is ſuitable to the taſte of the greateſt ſaint in the world. But it would not be ſo agreeable to our modern dancers; were it to be ſung in their aſſemblies, it would be to them as ſmoke to the eves, or vinegar to the teeth. Unto ſuch muſick and dancing our Lord alludes, in the parable of the prodigal ſon. Such kind of dancing was lawful and holy, and by no means to be condemned.</p>
            <p>But there is another ſort of dancing ſpoken of in ſcripture, which conſiſts in a motion of the body, ſeemly, or unſeemly, ſtirred up by natural or carnal joy, to pleaſe or ſatisfy our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others: without any view to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, or the benefit of ſouls. Thus that fine young lady, the daughter of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> danced, on <hi>Herod</hi>'s birth day; it ſhould ſeem that ſhe opened the ball, and performed ſo well as to fill the king with raptures of joy; whereupon, in a courtly dialect, he promiſed the young lady whatſoever ſhe ſhould aſk, even to the half of his kingdom. She, being afore inſtructed by her mother, very modeſtly aſked no greater a reward, than the head of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt in a charger. Thus, as a reward for dancing, the harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015848_0012_0F9A2DB81050C200"/>of Chriſt loſt his life. Enough, one would think, to cauſe every ſerious perſon to abhor the practice for ever. It is this profane kind of dancing that is intended in our text; the ſame with what is now in vogue; and which, if it were ſet in a proper light, would not appear altogether ſuch an innocent diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as is generally imagined. I proceed therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To prove that dancing, according to the common, modern mode, is abſolutely ſinful.</p>
            <p>Some may be ready to think that this is a ſtrange undertaking, and that I ſhall certainly fail in the attempt. It will be but fair, and therefore I have a right to expect, that you ſhould ſuſpend your judgment, until I have done; hear with candour, then weigh the arguments in the ballance of the ſanctuary; and if they prove too light, or inſufficient to prove the point, reject them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, I argue that dancing, according to the modern mode is ſinful, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes nothing to the chief end of man, nay, is contrary to it. You know that the chief end of man is to glorify God. And this ought to be our principal aim in every thing we do. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 31. <hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> Now I would aſk our advocates for dancing, what tendency that practice has to glorify God? Can you ſay that you have any view
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015848_0013_0F9A2DB8D012CEA0"/>to the glory of God in it? I am perſuaded you will not dare thus to give your conſcience the lie. And if it ſhould be proved, as I preſume it will, that dancing contributes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to promote the intereſt of Satan than the glory of God, it follows that the practice is directly contrary to the chief end of man. Only give this one argument its proper ſcope, and due weight, and dancing will ſoon ceaſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A corroborating argument may be drawn from <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 23. <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin:</hi> but dancing is not of faith, therefore it is ſin. But perhaps ſome may query, "What has this text to do with our diverſions, or any of our trivial concerns?" I ſhall anſwer in the words of a learned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor. "This is a general rule, or axiom, which is not only applicable to the preſent caſe, but to any other, whether of a natural, civil, moral, or evangelic kind; whatever is not agreeable to the word and doctrine of faith ought not to be done; whatever is done without faith, or not in the exerciſe of it, is culpable, for without faith nothing can be pleaſing to God." Therefore, until it can be proved that dancing is of faith, you muſt excuſe me if I inſiſt that it is a ſinful practice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whatever action in life we cannot pray for a bleſſing upon, muſt be unlawful and ſinful; and ſuch an one is dancing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be avoided. Will any ſay "we are not bound to ſeek the bleſſing of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015848_0014_0F9A2DB9922F78C8"/>God upon our ordinary concerns?" I will confront them with the words of <hi>Solomon. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths. Prov.</hi> iii. 6. Such univerſal piety may not indeed ſuit the taſte of frolick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and dancers; but it well becomes the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of all the profeſſed diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt. But ſhould any query, "Why may we not pray for a bleſſing on our dances?" I anſwer, you may nor, becauſe God has never promiſed to give a bleſſing to ſuch practices; therefore ſuch a prayer would be ſin. Nay, you cannot do it, becauſe it would be a profanation of the deity, and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences will not admit of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The injunction which is laid upon us to redeem the time, prohibits our miſpending it in ſuch practices. Time is a precious jewel, put into our hands to improve for eternity; and thoſe who trifle it away, are (in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture account) very fools. <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 15, 16. <hi>See then that ye walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe,—redeeming the time.</hi> Can it with truth be ſaid, that the time which is ſpent at balls, aſſemblies and dances is redeemed? No ſuch thing. It is ſquandered away—it is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered—it is conſumed on our luſts; and how our dancers will be able to anſwer to God, for all the time they have thus ſhamefully miſimproved, another day will determine.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It occaſions an extravagant waſte of money; with which great good might be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015848_0015_0F9A2DBA500F05E0"/>done. After enough hath been thrown away upon a child, at the dancing ſchool, to have educated two or three poor children, then truly miſs muſt be dreſſed cap-a-pee to make a ſhining figure at the ball; which expends enough to relieve a virtuous family in diſtreſs, or cloath half a dozen orphan children. If this is to be good ſtewards of our money, I confeſs I am very much miſtaken. And <hi>ſtewards</hi> we certainly are, and <hi>only</hi> ſtewards of all we poſſeſs; and muſt be accountable unto God for the ſpending of our ſubſtance. I am apprehenſive our dancers think but too little of this. Sirs, you would do well to conſider, that in a little time the Lord will ſay, "Come, give an account of thy ſteward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for thou mayeſt be no longer ſteward."</p>
            <p n="6">6. The thoughts of having thus ſquander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our precious time, muſt occaſion very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy reflections on a dying bed. Unleſs the conſcience ſhould then be aſleep, which would avail but for a little while; for at death the illuſion muſt vaniſh, and then it would be ſtill more terrible to awake in hell. However, thoſe diverſions, which were ſo pleaſing to the carnal mind, while in health and ſtrength, can afford no comfortable reflections in a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hour. The dancer will then be ready to ſay, "Wretch that I was, thus to ſquander away my precious time, my health, ſtrength and eſtate upon my idle diverſions! How much better might I have improved the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015848_0016_0F9A2DBB0E7B3EB0"/>which Providence beſtowed upon me? How much might I have done for God and my own ſoul? But, alas, they were objects, too much neglected! How ought I to have redeemed my time, in preparing for death and eternity? But, fool that I was, I ſpent my life in vain mirth, and ſinful pleaſures. O, for thoſe precious moments which I have loſt! But they are gone—they are loſt for ever; and I am afraid my God, my heaven, my ſoul are loſt too! Pity, and pray for me, O my friends; and let my late repentance be a warning to you. O guard againſt thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diverſions on which my poor ſoul hath been ſhipwrecked." Such a ſcene might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one of our dancers, and for a little time make him ſerious. But how ſoon do ſuch impreſſions wear off? And then the libertine returns to his folly.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It behoves us to live each day and hour, as we would wiſh to die; and not to engage in any thing that would alarm us, in caſe death ſhould overtake us in the act. The truth and utility of this aſſertion none will deny. Let me then aſk, would you be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meet with death at a ball, or a dance? You would not. And how do you know, when you venture on the inchanted ground, that you ſhall come away alive? And is this to hold yourſelves in readineſs? Think, O my friends, how you would look—how you would feel, ſhould this ever happen. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015848_0017_0F9A2E0792B30C60"/>would faſten on your countenance,— trembling ſeize every joint and nerve, and the convulſive pangs of conſcience would be more intolerable than the tortures of the bloody in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. You would probably uſe the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a fair lady, in a dialogue with death,
<q>
                  <l>"I little thought you would have call'd ſo ſoon:</l>
                  <l>"And muſt my morning ſun go down at noon?</l>
               </q> O, dreadful! To be cut off, in the midſt of my pleaſures—to be hurried from a ball to the bar—without any time to repent, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for eternity! But perhaps you will ſay, "Would you have us always on our knees, waiting for death? I anſwer, no. You may boldly meet death when engaged about your ſecular concerns, or any of the duties of life. I remember to have read, I think, in the life of Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale,</hi> that at the time of ſeſſions, while one of the attornies was pleading, there came on a moſt terrible thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtorm, which ſilenced the attorney; upon which the Judge ſaid to him, Sir, why don't you go on? Go on, my Lord, ſaid the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, don't you ſee how black the heavens are, and the lightning rolling on the ground, while the thunder roars as though the laſt day were come?—And ſuppoſe it is, ſaid his Lordſhip, are you not in the way of your duty? I am here about my buſineſs, and I am as willing to go from hence to judgment,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015848_0018_0F9A2E085187A008"/>as I ſhould if I were on my knees in my clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. The way of duty is the way of ſafety, and while thus engaged we have nothing to fear; but who could manifeſt ſuch fortitude at a dance?</p>
            <p n="8">8. The converſation at dances is inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with chriſtianity; I will appeal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of thoſe who frequent ſuch places, whether or no flattery, lying, ribaldry and nonſenſe doth not abound there? Little, I fear, is to be heard, that hath any tendency to reform the manners, or improve the mind; much leſs, to miniſter grace to the hearers. There may be enough to corrupt the morals and viciate the taſte of both ſexes. Is it not from hence, at leaſt in part, that we have ſo much obſcene, vulgar and profane converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt us? Our merry gentry, who delight ſo much in frolicking and dancing, would do well to conſider how they will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for all their filthineſs, fooliſh talking, jeſting and ſuch like things; when they come to ſtand at the bar of God.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Again, Many dances are extremely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt, and incentive to uncleanneſs. This is acknowledged by Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> although an advocate for dancing. "As for country dancing, ſaith he, it muſt indeed be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the great familiarity between the two ſexes on this occaſion, may ſometimes produce very dangerous conſequences." But modeſty bids me be ſparing here, otherwiſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015848_0019_0F9A2E090F423830"/>more might be ſaid. My ſoul, come not thou into their ſecrets, and unto their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, mine honour, be not thou united.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Farther, The muſick which leads the dance, is often very obſcene; the tunes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adapted to the moſt vulgar and filthy ſongs; which have a tendency to pollute the imagination, and to raiſe unchaſte thoughts in the mind. Thus the heart becomes a ſink of uncleanneſs—a cage of all manner of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and filthy luſts.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Moreover, The practice we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, cannot be endured in a miniſter. And why ſo? If there is no harm in it, and if it may be attended to with advantage, why muſt miniſters be prohibited the practice? The thing ſpeaks for itſelf: people are conſcious that it is an evil, and therefore, although they will indulge themſelves in it, they will not allow it in thoſe who have the care of their ſouls. As for my own part, I think indeed a dancing parſon, is an odd character; and a dancing chriſtian, is not much better. And our advocates for dancing would do well to conſider, that the Almighty hath no more allowed them a diſpenſation in this caſe, than their miniſters.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Once more, This practice renders per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the moſt unlike to Chriſt, our great pattern and exempler. Did Jeſus ever indulge himſelf in mirth? No. Frequently did he mourn over ſuch impieties, but never did he countenance
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015848_0020_0F9A2E09CF368030"/>them, in any way whatever. The doctrines, precepts and examples of Chriſt, all prohibit vain mirth—idle and ſinful diverſions. Thoſe who indulge themſelves in theſe, act diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to the religion of Jeſus; which enjoins temperance, mortification, ſelf-denial and the like virtues.</p>
            <p n="13">13. In fine, The greateſt, and beſt of men have ever bore a teſtimony againſt the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of dancing. I ſhall quote ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from ſeveral authors, which I ſhall do in their own words; hoping that their ſentiments may make ſome impreſſion upon your minds. We ſhall begin with the obſervations of that truly great and good man, Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> upon our text and context.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their children dance,</hi> that is, ſaith Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> they are inſtructed and taught the art of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and dancing; or there is rejoicing among them; this is proper to the age and ſtate of children. Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks as if this were the trade of children. <hi>Matt.</hi> xi. 16. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhall I liken this generation? They are like children ſitting in the market place.</hi> What do they there? Are they buying or ſelling? Are they bargaining or trading? No, that is the buſineſs of men. What do the children there? They call to their fellows and ſay, <hi>We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented.— They take the timbrel and the harp.</hi> They live in pleaſure; hence obſerve, worldly men
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015848_0021_0F9A2E0A8F360330"/>breed their children vainly. Here is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of their education; they are ſent forth as a flock in a dance, playing upon the timbrel, &amp;c. Here is all the knowledge and literature they are brought up to; here is all their religion, all the catechiſm that they are taught. The Lord giveth this report of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> who had a numerous family, <hi>I know him that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> Gen. xviii. 19. Abraham did not teach his to dance. Here was education in the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus far are the words of Mr. <hi>Caryl.</hi> The pious Mr. <hi>Henry,</hi> upon the place, ſaith,</p>
            <p>They are merry and live a jovial life. They have their balls and muſick meetings, at which <hi>their children dance;</hi> and dancing is fitteſt for children, who know not how better to ſpend their time, and whoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency guards them againſt the miſchiefs which commonly attend it. Their children do not pray, or ſay their catechiſm, but dance and ſing, <hi>and rejoice at the ſound of the organ.</hi> Senſual pleaſures are all the delights of carnal people; and as men are themſelves ſo they breed their children.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add the words of the learned and judicious Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> in his expoſition of the text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And their children dance,</hi> either in an inar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial way, ſkip and friſk, and play like calves and lambs, and ſo are very diverting
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015848_0022_0F9A2E0B50BE3D58"/>to their parents, as well as ſhews them to be in good health; which adds to their parents happineſs and pleaſure: or in an artificial way, being taught to dance; and it ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it is <hi>their</hi> children, the children of the wicked, and not of the godly, that are thus brought up; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> did not train up his children, nor <hi>Job</hi> his; no inſtance can be given of the children of good men being trained up in this manner, or of their children dancing in an irreligious way.</p>
            <p>This is the teſtimony of the great Dr. <hi>Gill.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaking of dancings, revellings and idle diverſions, interrogates thus,</p>
            <p>Doſt thou not know that thou haſt higher delights to mind? And are theſe toys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a noble ſoul, that hath holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly matters to delight in? Doſt thou not feel what a plague the very pleaſure is to thy affections? How it bewitcheth thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooleth thee, and maketh thee out of love with holineſs, and unfit for any thing that is good? Again, Is it ſport that thou needeſt? Doſt thou not more need Chriſt, and grace, and pardon, and preparation for death and judgment, and aſſurance of ſalvation? Why then are not theſe thy buſineſs? Farther, Haſt thou not a God to obey and ſerve? And doth he not always ſee thee? And will he not judge thee? Alas! thou knoweſt not how ſoon. Though thou be merry in thy youth, and thy heart cheer thee, and thou walk in the ways
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015848_0023_0F9A2E0C0F11F8A0"/>of thy heart, and the ſight of thine eyes, yet know thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee into judgment.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this head with a paſſage from <hi>Moreland</hi>'s hiſtory of the evangelical churches of the vallies of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> Here I would obſerve, that theſe were the only pure churches in the world, for ſeveral centuries. When the world wandered after the beaſt, theſe people adhered ſtrictly to the religion of Jeſus. They were remarkable for piety, and endured the moſt cruel perſecutions for the cauſe of Chriſt. In the tenth article of their diſcipline, which treats of balls and dances, they ſay,</p>
            <p>A ball is the devil's proceſſion, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever entereth there, entereth into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. The devil is the leader, the middle, and the end of the dance. So many paces as a man maketh in a ball, ſo many leaps he maketh towards hell. They ſin in dancing ſundry ways, firſt, in walking, for all their paces are numbered; they ſin in touching, in their ornaments, in hearing and ſeeing, in ſpeaking, in ſinging, in lies and vanities. A ball is nothing but miſery, ſin and vanity.</p>
            <p>They obſerve that the dancing of a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, cauſed <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt's head to be cut off; and that the dancing of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> cauſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to break the two tables of the law. They alſo prove that the ten commandments are violated by balls. They
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015848_0024_0F9A2E0CD0B3F0A0"/>cite a paſſage from St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> wherein he ſaith, "The miſerable dancer, knoweth not, that ſo many paces as he maketh at a ball, by ſo many leaps he draweth nearer to hell."</p>
            <p>Thus have I offered ſome reaſons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which have determined me againſt dancing; which I have enforced by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſeveral great and good men; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the whole hath ſufficient force to prove the unlawfulneſs and ſinfulneſs of the practice, muſt be left to the candor of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minds.</p>
            <p>After all, it may be thought that my work is but half done, unleſs I can anſwer whatever may be brought in ſupport of this favourite, and fallely called, polite diverſion. And this brings me,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To reply to the moſt popular argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed in favour of dancing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One of the moſt popular arguments (or rather excuſes) for this practice is, "I can ſee no harm in it, therefore it can be no crime in me." Poor creature.—You can <hi>ſee</hi> no harm in it.—This is of as much force, as if a blind man was to tell us that he could neither diſtinguiſh colours, nor ſee the light. We may pity your unhappineſs, but cannot give you eyes. But you conclude, it cannot be a crime in you, becauſe you do not view it in that light. If we are not cognizable for ſins of ignorance, <hi>Saul</hi> was not chargeable with guilt, when he perſecuted the church,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015848_0025_0F9A2E0D8F4CCF20"/>and yet, for this reaſon he accounted himſelf the chief of ſinners. But it may be you are wilfully blind. You might be better inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if you would. Let me therefore adviſe you to pray to God for inſtruction, in this matter, laying yourſelf open to conviction; and I am perſuaded you will ſoon ſee an evil in dancing, for which you muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be ſaid, "Dancing is a part of good breeding, without which we are not qualified for company, but ſhall appear ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and be laughed at."</p>
            <p>Perhaps cuſtom may have induced the world to look upon dancing as a branch of good breeding, rather than any excellency in itſelf. However, to give this plea all its force, I will grant that ſome advantages might be derived from the dancing ſchool, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly managed; and poſſibly may as it is, ſo far as it teaches a graceful mein, an eaſy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and a genteel behaviour. But theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages will by no means compenſate for the diſadvantages which attend it. For firſt, miſs who is educated at the dancing ſchool, ſoon ſwells with pride and ſelf-importance, looks down, with an air of diſdain, on thoſe who are not as well accompliſhed, as herſelf, and but too much copies the deſcription in <hi>Iſai.</hi> iii. 16. <hi>The daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with ſtretched forth necks, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton eyes, walking, and mincing as they go.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:015848_0026_0F9A2E0E50E7A300"/>However, the young lady's fine acquirements, are not to be buried, in thoſe avocations which induſtry inſpires; therefore in the next place, immenſe ſums are expended to equip her for public view. And ſo, ruſtling in her ſilks, powdered a-la mode and ſtudded with brilliants, ſhe makes her appearance at the ball; where ſhe is introduced into fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany—gets a taſte for pleaſure and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which often ends in the deſtruction of ſoul and body. <hi>The woman who liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe liveth.</hi> 1 Tim. v. 6.</p>
            <p>And now, ſuppoſe you are not qualified for ſuch company, what is the loſs? <hi>The friendſhip of the world, is enmity with God.</hi> James iv. 4. And our greateſt danger lies in our becoming too familiar with it. But you ſay that you ſhall be ſingular and laughed at. This indeed may be mortifying; but are you as careful not to be ſingular in religious ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Perhaps when there, you have nothing to ſay, yet this gives you no concern. As to your being laughed at, it need give you no pain; for if you will ſhun vice and purſue piety, you ſhall endure the laugh of the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you ſhould behave ever ſo well.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To vindicate dancing, it is ſaid that "it unbends the mind, and recreates the body." —This plea can ſuit none but ſuch as live a ſtudious, ſedentary life; and there are many exerciſes, leſs expoſed to temptation, that will anſwer thoſe ſalutary purpoſes, equally as well.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015848_0027_0F9A2E0F0FCCAD80"/>Walking, riding, or manual labour may be as profitable and efficacious. Beſides, it doth not appear that dancing hath ſuch a benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent tendency, as alledged. Strange, that being deprived of natural reſt—expoſed to night damps and inclement air, in a profuſe ſweat, ſhould be ſo ſalutary. The truth is, the reverſe is the caſe; and many have danced themſelves into eternity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But perhaps we ſhall meet with ſome champion in the cauſe of dancing, who comes forth, <hi>Goliah</hi> like, bidding defiance to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and hath the effrontery to aſſert, that "the lawfulneſs of dancing may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſcripture." Can it indeed? If ſo, our buſineſs will be done for us, and we will promiſe to give up the point. Why, ſays this hero, "did not <hi>David</hi> dance?" Yes. We know, as well as he, that <hi>David</hi> danced; but then it was religiouſly, before the ark. I have already ſhewn in what ſenſe we are to underſtand <hi>David</hi>'s dancing; and it is inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as well as perverting of ſcripture, to bring this paſſage to ſupport our irreligious, modern dances. But, ſays this champion, "<hi>Solomon</hi> tells us <hi>there is a time to dance.</hi>" True, and <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us alſo, <hi>there is a time to die.</hi> If our dancers thought more of this, they would find leſs time for that. But let it be proved, if it can, that <hi>Solomon</hi> intends dancing according to the common mode: and ſuppoſe he ſhould, all that can be drawn
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015848_0028_0F9A2E0FD1679CB8"/>from hence is, that there is a time, in which numbers will be profane enough to dance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another plea for dancing, often made uſe of is this, "We may ſpend our time a great deal worſe." I reply, it always indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates a bad cauſe when one vice is ſubpoenaed to vindicate another. Nothing therefore, need be ſaid to ſhew the weakneſs of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, only, that we may ſpend our time a great deal better, themſelves being judges.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some have endeavoured to plead for this practice, by quoting the example of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. "There are ſuch and ſuch, ſay they, who are profeſſors of religion, and whom we believe to be good people, who will go to heaven, and yet they can dance as well as any body."—More is the pity, that they ſhould lay a ſtumbling block in the way of others. Often they are heartily deſpiſed by the people of the world, for their ſinful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances. However, all profeſſors are not chriſtians. Some who have <hi>Jacob</hi>'s voice, have <hi>Eſau</hi>'s hands. And even the beſt are liable to err. Therefore follow none, unleſs they follow Chriſt. It will be no excuſe in the day of judgment, that you ſaw profeſſors go to balls and aſſemblies, and therefore you thought there could be no harm in ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions.</p>
            <p>Thus, having given a ſcriptural definition of the word dance; and proved that dancing, according to the modern mode, is ſinful and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015848_0029_0F9A2E1090A3B460"/>attended with bad conſequences; alſo replied to the moſt popular arguments, in favour of dancing; I now come, in the laſt place,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To make ſome improvement of the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From what hath been ſaid, we may ſee the folly of thoſe parents who put their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the dancing-ſchool, and ſpend ſuch immenſe ſums of money, to bring them up in pride, gaity and all the vanities of life. Is this to bring up our children in the fear of the Lord, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did? Is it to train up a child in the way he ſhould go, as <hi>Solomon</hi> directs? Would it not be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to devote our money to pious and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſes? Do ſuch parents take as much care of their childrens ſouls? Do they inſtruct them in the principles of the chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and warn them againſt ſin and vanity? I fear they do not. Look to it parents; you have the charge of your childrens ſouls, as well as of their bodies; and a much weightier charge it is. Think, how dreadful it will be to have the blood of your dear childrens ſouls, crying againſt you, in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How awful would it be, to have a child thus to addreſs you, on that day. "Oh! cruel parent; you were the inſtrument of my being, or I ſhould not have exiſted, to have been thus miſerable. You cared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for my body, but why did not you care for my ſoul, and labour to make that happy?
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015848_0030_0F9A2E114EE7A4B0"/>You might, and you ought to have reſtrained me, when purſuing vanity and folly. But inſtead of that, you placed me in the way of temptation; yea, you went with me yourſelf, to the devil's ſeminaries; where I was taught to practiſe ſinful pleaſures. And now, alas! I am to reap the fruit of our doings, to all eternity." Is the thought ſhocking? O! give no occaſion for the dolorous complaint.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What hath been ſaid, reproves thoſe who are attached to, and engaged in the practice of frolicking, dancing, and ſuch like ſinful diverſions. I ſay, <hi>ſuch like</hi> diverſions; for you would do well to conſider, that the arguments againſt dancing, will generally hold good againſt gaming, horſe racing and all ſinful diverſions. My dear friends, you are highly reprovable; but I rather chuſe to addreſs you in ſoft language. Let the time paſt ſuffice you, to have gone on in ſin and folly. Forſake the fooliſh and live, and walk in the way which leads to eternal life. You are ſurely making work for repentance. God grant that it may be in time.</p>
            <p>If after all that hath been ſaid, you ſtill remain unconvinced, and can ſee no harm in theſe things,—ſuffer me to adviſe you to pray earneſtly, that you may be enabled to ſee things in a proper light; and particularly, that you may have a diſcovery of the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of your own wicked and deceitful hearts. Then ſeriouſly aſk yourſelves theſe
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015848_0031_0F9A2E1211232948"/>following queſtions.—For what was I made? Do I anſwer the end of my being? Is God glorified by all my actions? Is living in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to live like a chriſtian? Muſt I not ſhortly die, and give an account of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God? Have I any time to ſpare from tranſacting buſineſs for eternity? If this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice were univerſally regarded, we ſhould hear no more of balls, aſſemblies and dances; inſtead of which, our temple gates would be crowded, and the general cry would be, Lord, what ſhall I do to be ſaved? May God ſend us the happy day, and to his name ſhall be all praiſe. AMEN.</p>
