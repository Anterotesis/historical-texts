            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Seaſonableneſs and Coincidence of Diſcourſes of the Grace of God, with the preſent workings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the great deſigns of Grace towards us Men, that the Soveraign Lord of all purpoſeth to put in Execution in theſe latter Dayes, together with their tendency to animate and excite unto a Co-opperating with Him therein are not uneaſily diſcerned; And would Men, eſpecially the Princes and Great Men of the World, ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded to work with Him therein, and put their hands unto an advancement thereof, as in other ways, ſo by putting Men into Publick Poſts and Stations; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Work of the Miniſtry, and Encouraging and Supporting them therein, that are qualified and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited hereunto, as they would manifeſt their truely Noble and Heroic temper, and in the beſt manner that may be, conſult their own Intereſt &amp; Honour; ſo it would be an happy Omen, and attended with <hi>God's dwelling amongſt Men, the Earths yielding her Increaſe,</hi> and all manner of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Proſperity. Wherefore it is much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
<pb facs="unknown:001839_0004_0FB9180DDA69DB28"/>
and heartily implored, that Men would give over their petty contrivances and doings, to (chiefly and in the firſt place) ſet forward their own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and ſatisfactions, as if they were ſo many <hi>Deities,</hi> and apply themſelves principally unto this Deſign. The Author of the following Short Tract, ſuppoſed that perhaps others, that are more adorned with both Natural and Acquired Endowments may thereby be jogged in their Eſſays this way. And if there are ſome hints therein, at a various hypotheſis concerning the Spirits carrying on the work of His Grace in Men, from what ſome Great and Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſonages have fallen in with, yet it is in it ſelf ſuch as is ſo far from clouding the Glory that He aims at in theſe His doings, as that by His working in the way herein pointed at, His Wiſdom, Power and Mercy are more diſplayed, than they would be in Operating in the other. And he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that all that may be oppoſed againſt it, may be eaſily Anſwered. But yet it is onely ſuggeſted hypothetically and ſubmitted; it being one of the Artifices of Folly &amp; Satan to confound laudable Deſigns, by throwing Men into vain janglings about means and leſs Eſſential matters leading to the End. May the God of all Grace by His Diſpenſations and Love &amp; Kindneſs to us <hi>transform us into His Likeneſs</hi> &amp; make us <hi>to be Holy.</hi> Which is the Prayer of your Unworthy Servant.</p>

            <p>THE Apoſtle in this and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter lays before us the Original and Fountain, and the Meritorious cauſe of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are brought thereunto, and God's end in ſaving of us; that the ſpring and firſt riſe thereof lies in the free <hi>Election</hi> of the Father, that we are ſaved through the <hi>Redemption</hi> that is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that the way wherein we are brought to Salvation is by the Lord's <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting us,</hi> and that his <hi>End</hi> in ſaving us is the <hi>Praiſe &amp; Honour of His Glorious Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:001839_0006_0FB9181259BEA320"/>Theſe Words lie in that part of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that gives an account of the way wherein we are brought to participate in the bleſſedneſs purchaſed for us by Chriſt the Lord. And for the more full underſtanding this clauſe, theſe things may be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That by Grace here, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>the free favour of God.</hi> This word is uſed in Sacred Writ principally in two No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Very generally it ſignifies as much as free and undeſerved favour. I ſhall mention only two Places, wherein it is uſed in this ſenſe, namely, Gen. 6.8. <hi>But Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord,</hi> that is, he found favour in the Lords Eyes, and He freely ſet His love upon Him. The other is, Tit. 2.7. <hi>That being juſtified by his Grace</hi>; that is, of His Free and Sovereign Mercy we are Juſtified, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding <hi>Context</hi> undeniably ſhews. But then ſometimes we are to underſtand by it, the fruits of the Mercy and Sovereign Grace of God. In this acceptation the word is uſed, Heb. 12.28. <hi>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom, which cannot be moved, let us have Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may ſerve God acceptably,</hi> that is to ſay, let us have the holy Inclinations &amp; Diſpoſitions enabling &amp; diſpoſing to ſerve God acceptably. See alſo, 2 Cor. 8 6. <hi>Inſomuch that we deſired Titus that as he had begun, ſo he would alſo finiſh
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001839_0007_0FB91814AB2D19C0"/>
in you the ſame Grace alſo</hi>; that is, we deſired <hi>Titus</hi> that as he had begun to further you in your charitable Contributions, ſo he would promote, excite, direct and perfect you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and the reaſon why theſe and ſuch things as theſe are called by this name, and have this Denomination put upon them, is becauſe they are the fruits of the Grace and unmerited Mercy of God. It is the former notion that the Word is here uſed, and when the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved,</hi> his meaning is, that our Salvation is the fruit of God's Rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Sovereign Love, as you may ſee if you read the <hi>Context,</hi> and particularly the Fourth, and the preceding part of this Verſe. <hi>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he loved us, even when we were dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins hath quickened us together with Chriſt,</hi> (<hi>by Grace are ye ſaved.</hi>) His ſaying here <hi>by Grace are ye ſaved</hi> is an inculcation and repetition of what he had ſaid in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Words, of their quickening, its being an effect and fruit of the rich Mercy and great Love of God to us.</p>
            <p>But 2ly. We may take Notice what is meant by the <hi>Salvation</hi> here ſpoken of. <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved</hi> The Apoſtle has an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reſpect herein, unto that part of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, lying in our recovery and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001839_0008_0FB91818E257A428"/>
from under the tyranny and dominion of Sin whereof he had been treating in the words immediately preceding, and which he had declared to come from the love of God: But he has alſo an eye therein unto the whole of that Deliverance and Bleſſedneſs that we have, and obtain by Chriſt in this mortal eſtate, and after this Life. And this Word <hi>Salvation</hi> is very commonly uſed in this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. As for Inſtance, <hi>Tit</hi> 2.11. <hi>Heb</hi> 2.3, 10. And the reaſon why he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats what he ſaid juſt before, and had ſo plainly in general taught in the foregoing Diſcourſe, and pointed at, was becauſe he was deeply affected with this matter, would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon us an abiding ſenſe of it, that our Salvation in every part of it, is of Grace, and that the Lord might have the whole honour of our Salvation, and be Glorious in the eyes of Men and Angels, for ever, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count hereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Argument</hi> or <hi>Concluſion</hi> that we propoſe from the Words thus opened is this,
<q>That our Salvation is of Meer Grace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is of no ſmall Importance and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon many accounts, that we believe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001839_0009_0FB91819DB9ED0E8"/>
this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and grow and increaſe in our aſſurances of the truth thereof. Wherefore ſundry things will be propoſed and laid down that may ſubſerve unto that end.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Conſideration</hi> that may be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Evidence of the Truth hereof is, That all we do until we are actually brought into an eſtate of Grace or intirely ſaved, <hi>is Sin.</hi> Not but that many, that are not in an eſtate of Salvation, behave themſelves orderly and well, and live vertuous lives. Multitudes of the periſhing Perſons that live in places of Goſpel Light are very cleanly in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, as they abſtain from ſcandalous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, ſo they are conſiderably and in more then a few inſtances obedient unto the Precepts of the Law, and that in part from principles of Conſcience. Yea as to many duties of Morality they exceed, &amp; go beyond ſome that are made Partakers of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And the ſame will hold with reſpect unto many of the Heathen. Hiſtory informs us, that amongſt the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> there were many wiſe, temperate, juſt, and publick ſpirited Perſons, that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Perſons and Eſtate &amp; Honour for the good of their Country. It was ſaid of <hi>Sulpitius</hi> the Roman,
<q>That one might ſooner ſtop the Sun in his courſe, then <hi>Sulpitius</hi> in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001839_0010_0FB9181B5BB045A8"/>
his courſe of Juſtice.</q>
And <hi>Ariſtides, Cato,</hi> and a great many others are commemorated in ancient Hiſtory as being vertuous, and living well according to the light that they had. And many of the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day are juſt, honeſt and ſober Perſons, and this partly from fear of a Deity, and to obtain His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And Morality is a fine Ornament and Praiſe worthy, but theſe Conceſſions not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it is certain that onely thoſe that are in an eſtate of Grace do any <hi>actions that are good,</hi> and all that other Men do, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very action that they put forth <hi>is Sinful or a Sin.</hi> And when we thus ſay, we would not be underſtood in any other but a plain &amp; fair meaning, and not as ſpeaking under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of <hi>Scholaſtick Diſtinctions,</hi> &amp; various ſenſes</p>
            <p>And theſe things may be propoſed in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the laſt end in unconverted Men's eye and that which is principally upon their hearts in their vertuous deportment, is <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> It is well enough if we ſeek our ſelves, I know of nothing that can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be objected againſt it, if we have ſome regard to our ſelves in every thing that we do. <hi>Self love</hi> is born with us and ought always to move, (but in its own <hi>ſphere</hi>) but ſuch is the tranſcendent Excellency, the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001839_0011_0FB9181DAB521680"/>
Power, Truth, Mercy and Goodneſs, and other <hi>Perfections</hi> in the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> and ſuch our dependence upon Him, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto Him, that His Honour and Glory ought to be neareſt unto our hearts, &amp; ſhould be principally aim'd at and deſigned by us in all that we do, as Men; and when any other <hi>chief End</hi> is ſet up and advanced, the <hi>God of Glory</hi> is ſo far <hi>Dethroned,</hi> and His Royalty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded. and our doings are a vile inſurrection againſt Him. Yea, let His eſſential Glory be conſidered abſtractedly from the dependence that we have upon Him, and the infinite Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that He has laid us under by Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and this Honour of our thus ſeeking His Glory either vertually or intentionally in all that we do, is His indefeazable right and prerogative; and ſo far and ſo much as we ſeek our ſelves ultimately, we ungod Him, (as far as we are capable thereof) and make War upon him. Now that we ſay is this, That the <hi>Laſt End</hi> of ſuch as are not in an Eſtate of Grace, <hi>is ſelf</hi>: Not but that they may have, and many of them have a regard to Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and imagine that the Lords intereſts are uppermoſt in their deſign, <hi>Joh</hi> 16.2. But ſuch imaginations are the fruit of ſelf flattery; and there never was an Unbeliever in the World, that deſigned God's Honour principally,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001839_0012_0FB91821C4960E98"/>
or as his Laſt End in any Service that he did for Him, or act of Obedience that he put forth.</p>
            <p>And this may be made out two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) They may be Convinced hereof, by an impartial Examining their own hearts, and Conſulting their own Experiences. Such of them as carry on a Form of Godlineſs, and do much in Religion, will, if they enter upon this Scrutiny and Search, find, that they have really and truly an Eye unto the Lords Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts and Honour: So had thoſe Jews of whom the Apoſtle bears record: <hi>Rom</hi> 10.2. That, <hi>They had a zeal of God.</hi> And ſo might thoſe, in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Chap</hi> 66. <hi>v</hi> 5. that ſaid, when they Excommunicated their Godly Brethren, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified</hi>: but it is one thing to ſeek Gods Honour to ſerve an End, a <hi>Self-End,</hi> to quiet a Mans Conſcience, to obtain Outward Bleſſings, Gods Favour, or that a Man may obtain Eternal Life, and another thing to ſeek <hi>God's Honour</hi> from a <hi>Sincere Love to Him,</hi> becauſe He hath Saved him from Eternal Death; and the adorable Excellency of his Nature diſplayed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Scriptures and in His Works: it is the former only, and not the latter, that Unbelievers attain unto; and this they will
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001839_0013_0FB9182305791F80"/>
find, if they impartially Examine and Search, what the Motives are that they act upon, and what they deſign in their being Religious and Obedient. And here-unto correſpond the Experiences of thoſe that believe, they know, at leaſt, ſuch of them as are wiſe, that while they were in their Unbelief, this was the higheſt they did or could attain unto.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That which gives power and ability here-unto, <hi>is a ſound belief of the declarations and reports in the Goſpel concerning the Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, and eſpecially the Mercy, Grace and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God diſplayed in the Myſtery of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> By our woful <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> we have loſt the knowledge of Him; and becauſe of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the World is and has in all Ages been full of, and our deſperate guiltineſs in His ſight, and that inaptitude that is upon us, and the like, to be concerned with Divine Things; we either decline concernment with Him, and give up our ſelves to the making our ſelves as happy as we can, in the enjoyment of the Creature, as the Pſalmiſt hints: Pſal. 4.6. <hi>There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us any good. i. e</hi> Seeking it in this and the other, and a great variety of Creatures. And we read to the ſame effect, <hi>Rom</hi> 6.3, 4, 5, 6. Or, if this doth not happen unto us, but we are raiſed up into, and act in a ſomewhat higher
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001839_0014_0FB918257A0CB7C0"/>
Orb, and more Manly Sphere, and tranſact with our Maker about His and our own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, through any Conceptions, Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Illuminations or Ideas concerning Him, that we may by any means attain unto, that fall ſhort of that knowledge of Him that we are ſpeaking of, we are not broken off there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from our natural channel &amp; path of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves ultimately, but go on therein, until the Lord bringeth us in ſuch ways, as it pleaſeth Him, more or leſs gradually, to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel.</hi> And this is that, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that gives power, to a loving of Him above the Creature, and to be holy. This may be ſeen by, Act. 26.18. <hi>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God</hi> Our eyes muſt be opened, to <hi>behold the Glory of God in the Goſpel,</hi> before we can live holily. See alſo, 1 Joh. 4.19. <hi>We love Him becauſe He firſt loved us</hi> And porportionably to our belief and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſuch things as theſe, will be our Holineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all our Works are Dead Works and Sinful, until we are brought into an eſtate of Salvation, is plentifully taught in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> The <hi>Texts</hi> that are alledged by <hi>Divines</hi> as ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this effect, are almoſt innumerable. Two or Three only ſhall be quoted and they
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001839_0015_0FB918269AEE8BE8"/>
are thoſe, Prov. 21.4. <hi>An high look, &amp; a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked is Sin</hi> Rom. 8.7. <hi>Becauſe the carnal mind is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be</hi> Gal. 3.22. <hi>But the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſame might be made out by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Arguments.</p>
            <p>And this is a thing that Men are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (I ſuppoſe) convinced of in one way or another, before they believe unto Salvation. And becauſe of our pertinacious and obſtinate adhering unto and <hi>depending on our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> which we are not eaſily brought off from, without a Conviction hereof; it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> indeavour to convince their Hearers, that all Unbelievers are verily the Servants of Sin, after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſundry of the Divinely inſpired Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers upon Sacred Record. And it is worth our ſerious conſideration, whether neglects hereof and unskilfulneſs herein, be not one great cauſe and reaſon that Chriſtianity flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth no more in the World.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that we offer to Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in believing, that our Salvation is of Meer Grace is, That <hi>all our Outward Bleſſings are freely beſtowed upon us</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Are we Fed and Cloath'd? It is of the Lord's Mercy we are ſo. Are we preſerved out of the hands of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001839_0016_0FB918281A0FD830"/>
and are Wicked Men kept back from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus &amp; ſo injurious unto us? We muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it unto the Grace of God. Are we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from Sickneſs? It is becauſe the Lord is Gracious. Are our Lives preſerved when our Acquaintance, Friends &amp; Kindred are cut off by the Sword, Diſeaſes or fatal Accidents? It is becauſe <hi>the Lord is Gracious to whom He will be Gracious.</hi> All the outward and common Mercies that are dealt out unto us, of what kind, denomination or ſort ſoever they are, flow down unto us, from the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Fountain of the Grace and Mercy of God. And this is true not only with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to Mankind, in general, but alſo of ſuch of the Children of God as are moſt Loyal, Dutiful and Obedient unto Him. His giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Joſeph</hi> favour, in the eyes of the Keeper of the Priſon, is aſcribed to His Mercy, <hi>Gen</hi> 29.21. And His recovering <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> from his dangerous Sickneſs is attributed unto the ſame cauſe; Phil. 2.27. <hi>And indeed he was Sick nigh unto Death, but God had mercy on him</hi> And the Truth is, the more holy any Man is the more thankful is he for, and the more does he admire the Grace of God, in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common, and more ordinary Bleſſings upon him.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001839_0017_0FB9182C5EA42590"/>3. <hi>Chriſt's working out the Means of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is an act of Grace</hi> He has born the penalty that was due for our Sins. This is ſpoken of under a great variety of Phraſes, and Expreſſions in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> It is called a bearing of our Sins in His Body on the Tree. 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bear our Sins in his Body on the Tree.</hi> And it is called therein a dying for our Sins. 1 Cor. 15.2. <hi>How that Chriſt dyed for our Sins.</hi> And this is implyed when He is ſaid, to have <hi>Offered himſelf a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God for us,</hi> Eph. 5.2. And we are taught the ſame Truth, when He is called, <hi>The Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sins of the World.</hi> And this was foreſhewn by the Multiplied <hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the Law. And as He has undergone the Penalty that was due and belonged to us for our Sins; ſo alſo He has Obeyed the Law, and wrought out Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for us, <hi>Math</hi> 3.19. <hi>Rom</hi> 5.19. Both theſe things were neceſſary that ſo we might be Saved. It was not only ſuitable &amp; conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that if Man rebell'd and caſt unparalled diſhonour upon the Soveraign Lord of all things, that he ſhould be caſt out of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and not be admitted into it again, and inherit life, unleſs his Honour were repaired by the offender, or his Surety underwent a puniſhment, that would bring as much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001839_0018_0FB9182E5796AA70"/>
to Him, as the offences committed ſhould detract from His honour, or diſparage Him: but the Soveraign &amp; inviolable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Heaven ordained and eſtabliſhed, that Man ſhould not be Saved unleſs His ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour were in this way repaired; this is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in that Law mentioned, Gen. 2.17. <hi>For in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi> And as Man could not be Saved, unleſs his Sins were ſatisfied for, ſo neither could he obtain Life without a perfect, ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and unblemiſhed Righteouſneſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt Jeſus has done both, the one and the other of theſe things for us; He has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the Law for us, and ſuſtained and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone that puniſhment, which our Sins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And His accompliſhing theſe things for us, His obeying and ſuffering, were acts of wonderful, and <hi>aſtoniſhing Grace.</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers chooſing Him to this Service, was an act of ſelf moving Mercy and Love. And Chriſts taking upon Him to do, and His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them for us, were fruits of rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and His being <hi>full of Love to us,</hi> Eph. 3.18, 19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His <hi>Converting us</hi> is the fruit of free Grace. There are that ſuppoſe, that the Lord when He Converts us, and turns us unto himſelf, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates</hi> in our Souls new qualities, habits, powers,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001839_0019_0FB9182F9C144350"/>
inclinations and diſpoſitions; taking the word <hi>Creation</hi> in its more proper &amp; reſtrained ſignification, and as denoting, Making <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of nothing</hi>; and in that ſenſe which it is uſed, in Gen. 1.1 <hi>And God Created the Heaven and the Earth</hi>: Meaning that He made them originally out of Nothing; and that which they ſupport this their opinion by, is principally that conſideration, That this work of the Spirit is frequently, and very often, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scriptures a <hi>Creating, Quickening</hi> and <hi>making Alive</hi>; and a like manner of Speaking is uſed concerning it therein; as in <hi>Eph</hi> 2.1, 10. <hi>Chap</hi> 4.24. and elſe-where. But there are others, who have other thoughts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter; they readily grant, that it is not effected &amp; brought about by the helps that remained and were left unto Man in the ruined eſtate that the Fall brought us into, and by the aſſiſtances and aids that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that eſtate; but God, ſay they, upon our Apoſtacy in His Soveraign Grace, ſet up and Erected a <hi>New Diſpenſation,</hi> and Publiſhed the <hi>Goſpel</hi> unto the World, in ſuch ways and manners, as in His Wiſdom it ſeemed good unto Him; until that after the Revolution of more than Four Thouſand Years, the World is bleſſed with that perfect rule of Faith and Manners, contained in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001839_0020_0FB918311CE3D020"/>
other helps &amp; advantages directed unto, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and appointed therein; and that it is in the way of His alwiſe managing this <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,</hi> and the concernments thereof, and giving forth <hi>Aſſiſtances becoming the ſame,</hi> that Men are brought over from a truſting in, living upon, and unto, and ſeeking reſt and contentment in the Creature, unto the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the life of God.</hi> And they look upon it proper ſpeaking to call <hi>Converſion</hi> a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural work, and fruit of ſupercreating Grace, but that God does in propriety of ſpeaking, <hi>Create</hi> any thing in Men when He Converts them, they do not diſcern, but ſuppoſe rather, that this Change is accompliſhed by a wiſe and powerful conducting and managing and adapting Providences to the eſtate of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and giving their powers and faculties an aſſiſtance proper unto the particular, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Diſpenſations, that they are under. And they ſay, there is nothing in the <hi>Experiences</hi> of thoſe that believe, but what exactly agrees with this <hi>Scheme</hi> of things; and to refer events unto miraculous operations, when it can be ſhewn they may come to paſs, in a more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, tho' ſpecial way of working, is vain. And they underſtand thoſe and ſuch like Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, as were juſt now mentioned, as ſpeaking <hi>Metaphorically</hi> and <hi>Figuratively,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001839_0021_0FB918335A72A140"/>
what, ſay they, is more uſual then for them to ſpeak <hi>popularly,</hi> and after this manner of <hi>Works of Providence,</hi> that are no way miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but common and ordinary. See, <hi>Pſal</hi> 104.30. <hi>Iſai</hi> 54.16. <hi>Ezek</hi> 28.13, 15. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.13 <hi>Pſal</hi> 71.20. <hi>Pſal</hi> 119 20. Much leſs need it ſeem ſtrange, if this <hi>ſpecial work</hi> of God's Spirit be thus expreſſed. And they ſay, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this matter in a due light, would abate the prejudice that many, both ſecret and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Enemies of the Proteſtant Religion, have drank in againſt it to the damage of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts thereof, and the hazard of their Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls; as if it's Doctrines did not correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Experience.</hi> But be theſe things as they are, that our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is of Grace, is plain. See, Tit. 2.4. <hi>But after that the kindneſs of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he hath ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> Act. 18.27. <hi>Who when he was come, helped them much, which had believed through Grace</hi> And the <hi>Church</hi> Prays for it as being unworthy of it, and a <hi>Gift of Grace,</hi> Pſal. 80.3, 7, 19. And the longer Chriſtians live, and the more they grow in Sanctification and Holineſs, the more are they affected with and thankful for, and the larger
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001839_0022_0FB918376B5961B0"/>
views have they of the Grace of God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in this benefit, as is obſerved by all, that are well converſant in ſuch matters, and eſpecially the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtle Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Our Perſeverance in Faith and Holineſs,</hi> is alſo from the Meer Grace &amp; Mercy of God. This will appear from theſe two things laid together,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It cannot be imputed unto our ſtrength, power, and ability or any creature helps. We watch againſt Temptation indeed, and the means that we make uſe of, namely <hi>Prayer, Self-Examination, Meditation, Hearing the Word Preached, Baptiſm,</hi> the <hi>Lords-Supper, Faſts</hi> and <hi>Thankſgivings,</hi> and the like, have a direct and natural tendency to further and help us in well doing; but means, helps and our power to uſe them are of God, and if infinite Power and Wiſdom be not in us and them, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and managing of both, our Faith and Well-doing will quickly be at an end. Let never ſo wiſe <hi>States-men</hi> ſit at Helm in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Province, unleſs the Divine Preſence be in and with them, conducting and ruling them, and the Governments over which they preſide, all things will run to ruine, and the ends of Government will not be obtained. And ſo if the moſt <hi>Skilful Phyſicians</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Medicines are in a place, if they and the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001839_0023_0FB918399FDBC6E8"/>
People, Air and Seaſons, <hi>&amp;c</hi> be not under a Gracious and Powerful and All-wiſe Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Diſeaſes will break out, that will carry away both them and the People amongſt whom they are, as a Flood. And thus it is in the caſe under conſideration, whatever our ſtrength may be, and however proper, and ſuitable the means are that we enjoy for the Promotion of our <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> our Religion will vaniſh and come to nothing, if the Lords Gracious Preſence and Powerful and All-wiſe Conduct be denyed. Upon the whole then, the Gracious and Indwelling Preſence of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> is the Principal Efficient cauſe of our Perſeverance. This is attributed unto Him, Col. 1.8. <hi>Who alſo declared unto us your love in the Spirit</hi> It was the Spirit of God that perpetuated their Love and other Graces. 2 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>Becauſe God hath from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, choſen us unto Salvation, through Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit.</hi> Their initial and progreſſive Sanctification was by the SPIRIT, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Efficient cauſe thereof. Which things are not ſo to be underſtood as if by the light and taſtes given unto Men in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they are not, after a ſort, indiſſolubly faſtened unto Divine Objects, nor as if the Efficiency and Operation of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to promote our Perſeverance, were ordinarily
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001839_0024_0FB9183BC8D569E0"/>
miraculous and beyond the Sphere of His acting to produce other effects and events in their ſeveral kinds, that are wrought by Him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It muſt be added, that the Lords cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us to Perſevere is a Gratuitous and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Part in Him. 1 Theſ. 5.23. <hi>And I pray, your whole Spirit, Soul &amp; Body be preſerved blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> And it has been the way of the Godly in all Ages to go unto the Lord, as unworthy Suppliants for help in this reſpect. How often does <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> implore His Mercy in this regard. I ſhall quote only one <hi>Text,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he Prays for this Mercy, as moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it. And that is, Pſal. 139.23, 24. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart, and try me and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> And let it be conſidered, how that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Glory of His Perfections, the right that He has unto their Service upon the account of the Relation that they have unto Him, as Creatures, His taking them into an eſtate of Grace, the endearing Obligations He lays them under in the courſe of His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, their Love to Him is ſo very ſmall and imperceptible, their Humility and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Submiſſion ſo defective, and in general their Converſation and Deportment towards
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001839_0025_0FB9183D1A52D888"/>
God and Man really ſo Carnal, however lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable it may be in appearance, that were it not for their more ſenſible actings of <hi>Faith,</hi> they would call their Sincerity God-ward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Queſtion; and what is the deſert of the leaſt Sin, and it muſt be acknowledged, that it is from aſtoniſhing Grace &amp; infinite Depths of Mercy and Kindneſs that He does not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abandon them and ſuffer them to go down into endleſs Miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The <hi>Scriptures</hi> of both the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> ſo aſcribe and refer the whole and every part of our Salvation, and all the concernments thereof, as our <hi>Election, Vocation, Juſtification, Peace of Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Glorification,</hi> unto the Love, Rich Grace and Undeſerved Kindneſs of God, and eſpecially the <hi>New,</hi> and remarkably the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the great <hi>Apoſtle of the Gentiles,</hi> who manifeſts himſelf even aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed thereat, and was mightily carried out to diſplay the glory thereof; as that if there were not a wonderful diſlike of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the hearts of Corrupt Man, and Men were not beſotted with empty fading Vanities; and Hell did not uſe all it's Artifice and Skill to conceal it, it would never have been ſo detracted from, and clouded by Men of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Minds, in various degrees and manners, and ſo little believed in the World; as it has
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001839_0026_0FB9183E9ACD86C8"/>
been in all Ages, and particularly, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live. I ſhall only cite Three <hi>Text,</hi> wherein the whole thereof, and Two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome particular parts of it (which the <hi>Cunning craftineſs of Men,</hi> hath endeavoured by various Sophiſms &amp; other Wicked devices to perſwade and make us believe, that they come, at leaſt, in part from other cauſes,) are aſcribed, and the glory of beſtowing them is given over unto the Grace of God, in full and very expreſſive terms; And they are theſe, <hi>Pſal</hi> 116. <hi>throughout</hi>; where the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſpeaks both of <hi>Temporal,</hi> but Principally of <hi>Eternal Salvation,</hi> and he refers all to the <hi>Grace and Mercy of God.</hi> See alſo, Tit. 3.5. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he hath ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> Eph. 2.8, 9. <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God, not of works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt</hi> And our Juſtification is in a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable and declarative manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, aſcribed to God's Mercy. Rom. 3.24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that is in Jeſus Chriſt</hi> And the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, of our Converſion, 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001839_0027_0FB918429667AFF0"/>
according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt, before the world began</hi> Wherefore theſe things being ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Goſpel way of Salvation is contrary to the now Natural Inclination and choice of Man</hi> Not but that, ſhould the darkneſs, that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Mind, and Natural to him in that eſtate that Sin, and the Curſe of God have caſt him down into, be removed; and ſhould things be ſet before the eye of his Mind &amp; he helped to view them as they are, he would, the Lord giving him ſuch an aſſiſtance as is proper to ſuch an illumination fall in there-with. He ever more does ſo. So far forth as <hi>the Glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt is</hi> revealed to us by the Goſpel, and we believe it in ſuch degrees do we fall in therewith. 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>But we all with open face beholding, as in a glaſs the Glory of the Lord are changed into the ſame image, from Glory to Glory. 9. d</hi> As our proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect into the Glory of the Lord by the glaſs of the Goſpel advanceth; ſo our taking of him and accepting him in Chriſt, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Portion; and our Sanctification is furthered. But our Natural condition is an eſtate of darkneſs, and until we are brought out of it, we Sacrifice and burn Incenſe unto and ſerve that greateſt Idol in the World,

               <hi>Self</hi>; even all People, Nations and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and hate and abhor all that tends to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found its intereſts, ſpoil it of its honour and bring it to nothing; which the Doctrine of Salvation by free Grace does, as effectually, as can be imagined Wherefore it is not to be wondered at, if the <hi>Patrons</hi> thereof are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented, and perſecuted, the Preaching of it diſliked, and the affairs thereof diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced; and that even by thoſe that wear the honourable Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly amongſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in very ſenſible degrees.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It will be bootleſs and we ſhall come off with fruſtration, and diſappointment, if we go about to ſeek Salvation, partly by our own righteouſneſs</hi> None of Mankind that are concerned in their Spirits about Salvation, are ſo deſtitute of right apprehenſions and convictions of the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of their Lives, the deſert of Sin, and the Holineſs of God as that they dare venture the Eternal well-being of their Souls upon that ſingle plea of their own goodneſs, or obeying and ſuffering in Gods cauſe; but they all have ſome dependance upon the Grace and Mercy of God: but they generally ſeek it partly by their own righteouſneſs. This way go the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and all other <hi>Heretical Sects</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and this is the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001839_0029_0FB918455A610D40"/>
path that vaſt numbers of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> go on in; however they profeſs to ſeek it meerly by Grace; they ſeek it partly by works, in an higher or lower degree: tho' Alas! for them, they are ſo unhappy as not to diſcern it and thus they go out of the World, and never obſerve that Error until it be too late to mend it. And this comes to paſs, as from many other cauſes and reaſons, ſo eſpecially from a want of a due Examining into, and ſearching the temper and frame of their own Spirits, and their not being well taught the Doctrine of the Grace of God, with what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs there unto; and were they well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in theſe things, this unhappineſs would be in part prevented.</p>
            <p n="3">3 From theſe things we may learn, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go and repair, for the Perſonal, Private and Publick Mercies &amp; Salvations; whether Spiritual or Outward, that we, our Country, the Church of God, or the World want.</hi> We muſt repair unto the free Mercy of God, for them. Few or none well inſtructed Proteſtants, plead in words, their own righteouſneſs in their Prayers, but it is common for them to plead both their own Poſitive, but eſpecially their Negative righteouſneſs in the Secret receſſes of their hearts. See, the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and

               <hi>Publican, Luk</hi> 18. And believers themſelves may have too much of ſuch a Spirit. Matth. 19.28. <hi>Then anſwered Peter, and ſaid, Behold we have forſaken all, and followed thee, What ſhall we have therefore?</hi> But when ſuch workings of heart cannot be charged upon us, yet through the prevailings of ſottiſhneſs and unbelief, we fail of truſting and hoping in, and repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto Gods Mercy as we ought. The way to obtain what we deſire, is under a view of the excellency and greatneſs of His Loving Kindneſs, by Faith and Prayer to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs our ſelves to Him for them.</p>
            <p>And let it be ſuggeſted as <hi>Motive</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>That one of the great deſigns, that the Lord our God hath upon His heart is to Glorify Himſelf in His Goodneſs and Kindneſs towards Sinful Man.</hi> As He magnifieth and rendereth illuſtrious His Wiſdom and Power, in the Works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> and He does and will Glorify His Juſtice and Holineſs in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that He inflicts upon the World for their Sins and the ruine that befalls the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the <hi>Apoſtate part of fallen Angels,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the other World; ſo it is upon His Heart to render Glorious, and get large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of Honour and Praiſe unto His <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> by being Good, Gracious and

Kind unto us vile and abominable Men; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, Eph. 2.7. <hi>That in the Ages to come he might ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding riches of his Grace in his kindneſs towards us by Chriſt Jeſus</hi> And there are certain ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and times, wherein this His Projection and Deſign, puts forth it ſelf and bloſſometh, in an eſpecial manner. As there are <hi>Periods</hi> wherein He remarkably chaſtiſeth the World or great Parts thereof, for their Wickedneſs, ſuch as that when the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Forces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and ſubdued, and brought under their Yoke, and miſerably Slaughtered the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Moabites, Ammonites, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> and the other Nations in thoſe parts of the World; And that when the <hi>Goths, Huns</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> and other Northern Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made irruptions into the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and occaſioned its overthrow and ruine; ſo alſo there are <hi>certain Seaſons,</hi> wherein the Lord by Peace, Health, Plenty, and other common Bleſſings, as alſo by Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, allures Men unto a good Opinion and Serving of Him, and there is an hopeful appearance, that we are entering under ſuch a Diſpenſation, and He may be about to try what good effect kindneſs will have upon that part of the World wherein we are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerned. Wherefore, if we now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair

unto His Mercy for Bleſſings for our ſelves and others, its not unlikely we ſhall come in a <hi>good Day</hi>; and that we ſhall have occaſion to ſay, in the iſſue, in <hi>an acceptable time he has heard, and in the day of Salvation, he has helped us.</hi> Onely we muſt always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that when we draw nigh unto Him, and make our Supplications and Addreſſes to Him, for the Communication of the Effects of His Grace, we muſt do it in an humble manner, and after the Example of the <hi>Publican,</hi> Luk. 18. Namely, <hi>Hanging down our heads &amp; ſmiting upon our breaſts,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>God be merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us Sinners</hi>; and to encourage our ſelves hereunto by thoughts of His <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Is it ſo that all our good things and our Eternal Salvation come down from the Free Grace of God? <hi>We have the greateſt reaſon to Love, to be very Thankful unto, to walk holily before, and to be to the Praiſe of the Lord</hi> His Superlative Excellency and Native Glory, and our dependence on Him exact and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand theſe things at our hands, and had He refuſed to caſt the leaſt Eye of Pity towards us, the neglect of loving Him above all things, even with all our Heart and Soul and ſerving Him with utmoſt Chearfulneſs, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, Humility and Thankfulneſs, had been
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001839_0033_0FB9184F38B1AFE8"/>
monſtrous Wickedneſs and unaccountable Injuſtice, as well as madneſs and folly: But by His freely ſaving us out of the depths of Miſery that we had plunged our ſelves down into, and by beſtowing upon us the common good things of this Life, we are under doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Obligations to be to Him and for Him. To do then as has been counſelled is that which all ſhould fall in with.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, this Advice is verily good and what is propoſed is highly reaſonable, but how ſhall we attain to follow it, and be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Exhortation? In Anſwer to this Enquiry, only theſe things may be offered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we would hearken thereunto, <hi>We muſt get and keep and live under a permanent, and an abiding, powerfull and cloſe Conviction of our ineffable Sinfulneſs and the deſert of Sin.</hi> Our Sinfulneſs not only before, but alſo after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is ſo great, as that thoſe Words of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Eccl. 1.8. concerning the Labour, that is under the Sun, <hi>ſcil. Who can utter it,</hi> may with an Emphaſis be applyed thereunto, and is more remarkably true of this then that. Our Tranſgreſſions are for Number like the <hi>Sand upon the Sea ſhore,</hi> Pſal. 40.12. To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001839_0034_0FB91850ADA02D00"/>
of the heinous nature of them, and the inhauncing and aggravating Circumſtances that do attend them. And the deſert of the leaſt Sin, <hi>is Death,</hi> as we may be ſenſible, if we conſider who it is that is thereby diſhonoured; and eſpecially this is taught by the Death and Sufferings Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went to make Expiation for Iniquity. Due apprehenſions of theſe things would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive unto our hearkening unto this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and without them a compliance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with cannot be expected, however uneaſy ſome may be under them, and whatſoever ſome may fancy to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt believe, and grow &amp; encreaſe in our knowlege and belief of the <hi>Doctrine of the Grace of God.</hi> It is fit and very well that a great many other Arguments, Motives and Conſiderations be uſed to perſwade Men, thus to glorify God and comply with their Duty; but let the moſt accompliſhed <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi> uſe the beſt of their skill; let them ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all their faculties and powers, and uſe the moſt flowing Metaphors and charming and enſnaring figures and forms of Speech, and argue from Intereſt, Honour and Juſtice, in the moſt affecting taking and obliging

manner, that the wit of Men and Angels can invent, they will not be able to make ſo much as one Convert; all that their Oratory &amp; Skill will be able to compaſs, is to make Men ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and well dreſt Hypocrites. But let a Man well believe the Love of God to us, and the adorable and aſtoniſhing actings thereof for us, paſt and to come, and this will unhinge him from his natural bottom, and melt down his frozen and ſtupid heart into a loving of Him above himſelf, and humble thankfulneſs unto Him, and make him cry out with <hi>David, Truly I am thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, I am thy Servant</hi>: and the greater our acquaintance is to theſe things, the more do we love Him and are enlarged in the way of His Commandments, and therefore it was that the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in their day, ſo Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and dilated and inſiſted upon the Love, Grace and Kindneſs of God in their Writings and Diſcourſes, and Sermons unto the People. If then we would get and grow in our love to God, &amp; walk acceptably before Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and abound therein, we muſt believe the Love of God, and increaſe in our belief thereof. And as other Expedients are to be uſed that we may be thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, ſo the Lord Himſelf is to be in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility

Eph. 2. 8, 9, 10. <hi>For by Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the Gift of God. Not of works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt, for we are his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good works</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.3. <hi>We are bound to thank God alway for you Brethren, as it is meet, becauſe your Faith groweth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi>
