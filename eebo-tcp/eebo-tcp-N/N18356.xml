            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MARTIN, the conſtable. A warrant came into my hands to arreſt Sweeting the priſoner, at the bar; on the way to his houſe we met Quimby and two more men ſhaving ſhingles—we had rum with us—we drank with them—they aſked, if we wanted more people; and they went with us. As we were on the way a man met us, and I ſaid, he had been and given Sweeting warning. In the evening as I went towards his houſe a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

We made no anſwer, but proceeded to his houſe, and found the doors ſhut—I demanded en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and his wife opened the door, and ſaid Sweeting was not there. I lit a candle, but not finding him, ſaw by the ſnow he had gone out at the back door into a piece of wood near by—we follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I ſaw him ſtanding upon a rock—I made up towards him, behind him, and ſtruck at him, and ſaid you are my priſoner; but it being dark and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

He jumped off the rock—I called for help—he was ſoon caught, they fell down, and I fell on them: He ſaid I will give up. I bound him, we found Quimby was wounded—he was brought into the houſe and laid down. Sweeting ſaid if the man is hurt? I hurt him with my fall: I would not have hurt him had I known it was Quimby.

all the people preſent. Court, was Quimby wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when you made Sweeting a priſoner? Anſ. I can't tell—I called for aſſiſtance—I did not call on Quim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in particular. Court, did the priſoner know that you was an officer? Anſ. I can't ſay. Court, was you then in the diſtrict of which you was choſen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable? Anſ. I don't know. Court, look at the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, if it is the ſame you took him upon? Anſ. Yes, Court, what time in the evening was it? Anſ. About eight o'clock. Court, did the priſoner know you had a warrant againſt him? Anſ. I don't know. Court, how happened it you had ſuch a number? Anſ. The plaintiff who took out the warrant againſt the priſoner, ſaid he would get a number to go along with me. Court, did you agree theſe men ſhould go with you? Anſ. In anſwer to the plaintiff, I ſaid very well. Court, was it dark, how could you know Sweeting; did he ſay any thing when he met you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you went into his houſe? No. I knew him by a frock he had on. Court, when you made him a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner did you tell him on what account? No. How long did he ſtand on the rock? Anſ. He went of immediately. Queſt. How long was it before Quim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and the priſoner were clinched! Anſ. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. Queſt. When they fell which way did their heads full? Anſ. Towards the rock Court, did the priſoner retreat when you touched him on the rock? Anſ. He jumped off immediately. Queſt.

Withey, Martin deſired me to go with him at the time that has been mentioned. Queſt. Did he acquaint you with the buſineſs? Anſ. He ſaid he was going to take Sweeting for ſtealing. On com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near his houſe, we met a brother of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the road—we had a ſcuſſle with him—then went to his houſe—finding the doors ſhut, we threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to break the door—we went in but did not find him—I ſaw him before he was on the rock. Court, what then happened? Anſ. I heard Martin ſay, he was his priſoner. Did you ſee Martin touch him? Anſ. No. I ſaw them living on the ground or ſnow. Court, had the priſoner any thing in his hand? Anſ. I ſaw not any thing. Court, what words did Martin uſe when he made him a priſoner? Did he ſay, <hi>In the name of the people of the ſtate of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York,</hi> he was his priſoner? Anſ. I can't ſay I heard any more, than that he was his priſoner. Queſt. How many perſons were preſent round the rock? Anſ. I think four. Queſt. Did you ſee Sweeting run? Yes. I ſaw him running towards the road.</p>
               <p>Waterman, I was with them going towards the houſe, and heard ſomebody hail, Who comes there? by the time I came up, they had juſt got up out of the ſnow. Queſt. Did you ſee any man touch Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the rock? No. I did not. Queſt. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons were preſent? Anſ. Four.

I think not, but made towards the road, when Quimby came up and ſeized the priſoner, they both fell and Martin on the top—I thought I ſaw the arm of the priſoner move backward and forward as if ſtriking the deceaſed. The priſoner declared he heard Martin was coming to ſearch for ſtolen goods—that Baily had been and given him notice that they were coming.</p>
               <p>Magee. That when we met them on the road. Court, Relate the matter reſpecting the taking the priſoner.

unwilling to hurt their characters with ſuch a bad cauſe, and therefore abandoned me in the moment of ſurprize, and left it to my own management as to making my defence.</p>
               <p>I conceive the providence of God over-rules even in the ſmalleſt tranſactions if men in this world, and that it is to be my fate to die in this way, as a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment for my ſins and a warning to others. My counſel, tho' eminent and learned, did not make the defence which I expected.

It can't then be ſtrange to ſuppoſe that God now over-rules the affairs of men.</p>

Would it not have deſerved a moment's thought whether a party of men having a lawful warrant and though cloathed with the authority of law, getting drunk and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a riot, ought not to leave a doubt on the mind whether full faith and credit ought to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon their teſtimony in a cauſe of life and death; and of the truth of ſo many circumſtances related by them, happening in their heat and zeal; fomented by many extraordinary circumſtances, and plentiful draughts of rum, which they ſaid they had with them?

You are ſenſible of the failure of human nature, and that mankind may be actuated by prejudice. If you bring me in guilty I conceive you will not do me juſtice.—I had no intention to hurt any man—I was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and my intention in taking weapons was only to frighten them—I knew not why they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after me—I knew not of any warrant—I feared they would do miſchief.

good man.—I will relate the ſtory; I heard a number of men were coming after me; I got my brother to ſtay with me, at my houſe, and they not coming in the evening, my brother propoſed going to the next houſe, on the way toward where they were; I was loath, but complied: the ſnow being deep and but little path he went firſt and I after him; we heard men coming, making a great noiſe, he called to them, I ran back to the houſe, and through the houſe, and back into the woods, they found my track and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued me. I was ſtanding on a rock, and finding by the noiſe I was almoſt ſurrounded, and thinking I had one way to eſcape, there appearing a vacancy that way, I jumped off from the rock and made for that way, but the unfortunate Darius Quimby met me, both fell, a number had hold of me and had me down ſome time in the ſnow: when they let me get up, Quimby ſaid he was wounded.</p>
                  <p>THIS is about the ſubſtance of what I ſaid to the court: being agitated in mind, and not expecting, I ſhould be called to ſay any thing, I forgot a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of circumſtances, which I think would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated in my favor. One of which is, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it had been given in evidence, that I ſaid, if I had known it was Quimby, I would not have hurt him, I would as ſoon have killed my own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I added at the ſame time, I would not have killed him, <hi>nor any other man,</hi> ſooner than I would have killed my own brother. Which laſt words, "nor any other man," were wholly left out of the evidence; and I conclude, that ſaying, I would not have killed him, led the court to believe I meant to kill ſome one: &amp; by the teſtimony delivered in court, it ſeemed &amp; was held up, &amp; I ſuppoſe legally proved to the court and jury, that I intended to murder ſome one: but as I am now a dying man, and view myſelf on the borders of eternity, and know that in a few days my naked ſoul muſt appear at the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous bar of a ſin-hating GOD, I can now appeal to

him for the rectitude of my intention, at that time, and declare, I had not the leaſt intention of killing any man; and if malice is neceſſary, to conſtitute the crime of murder, I never have, nor do I at this time conſider myſelf guilty of murder, though I have moſt earneſtly begged of GOD, that if I was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of murder, he would be pleaſed to convince me thereof. I know the teſtimony was ſuch as led the court and jury to believe I intended to kill ſome one; therefore killing one whom I did not intend, was conſidered a killing by malice. I have not related this with a view to caſt the moſt diſtant reflection on the honorable court, it being far from my intention to caſt any reflection on the court, jury, or witneſſes, though I have ſaid the whole truth has not appeared by the witneſſes; but it may be it was according to the beſt of their knowledge and belief: If it was not ſo, I from my heart forgive them, and my earneſt prayer is that they may find forgiveneſs with God, through the complete and perfect ſatisfaction of the Redeemer.</p>

               <div type="charge_to_jury">
                  <head>The following is the ſubſtance of the charge delivered by the hon. Chief Juſtice Yates, to the jury.</head>
                  <p>Gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the priſoner at the bar charged with the murder of Darius Quimby. It has been given in evidence to you, that the conſtable had a lawful warrant to apprehend the priſoner, in an action of treſpaſs; that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner fled from juſtice into the woods, and placed himſelf upon a rock; and being purſued, and nearly ſurrounded, the conſtable came behind him, ſtruck at him, and ſaid he was his priſoner—But whether the conſtable touched him, or not, it being dark, he is not certain, but thinks he did—The conſtable gives you no account how the ſtroke was given; but anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er witneſs ſays that while the priſoner and Quimby were clinched together, lying in the ſnow, he ſaw the arm of the priſoner move backward and forward as if ſtriking the deceaſed. Another witneſs ſays, that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023814_0011_0FC13996ABDA5180"/>
the priſoner while ſtanding on the rock ſaid he would kill the firſt man that ſhould touch him. From theſe witneſſes you are to determine the crime of murder, charged againſt the priſoner.—I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you what is the crime of murder, it is a killing with malice expreſſed or implied. Implied by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wait to kill—by intending to kill one, but in fact killing one whom he had no intention to, is murder.—With reſpect to the officers of juſtice, it is by law declared it an officer is killed, doing his duty, it is murder, if it be known he was an officer: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting an officer is unlawful—It is alſo murder if committed on thoſe called to aſſiſt an officer, in the execution of his office. A man has been killed, aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an officer in executing a lawful warrant, which warrant has been before you, and no ſuggeſtion of it being illegal.—it remains with you then to conſider whether there was a warrant—an officer—and an aſſiſtant by the orders of the officer—whether the man killed, was killed aſſiſting the officer, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the officer—and whether the priſoner at the bar is guilty of the murder laid to his charge—If you are convinced in your conſciences he is guilty, ſay ſo—If he is not guilty, ſay ſo.</p>
                  <p>I was found guilty—and afterwards being called to the bar, was aſked by the honorable Chief Juſtice what I had to ſay why ſentence of death ſhould not be pronounced againſt me, and not replying,
<hi>The Chief Juſtice proceeded, in ſubſtance, as follows:</hi>
You, Sweeting! It appeared on your trial, that you knew an officer had a warrant againſt you—you ſled from juſtice, which it is a crime to do—you gave out high threatning words, that you would kill the firſt man that ſhould touch you.—The officer was in the lawful execution of his office—the men aſſiſting him were acting the part of faithful, good citizens.—If a man lifts his hand againſt another, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to kill him, and kills ſome boſom friend, it is murder. If a man reſiſt an officer before he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023814_0012_0FC139985129BCE0"/>
and death enſue, it is murder.—Let this be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to correct a wrong idea that is entertained by people, that they may reſist officers, doing their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Officers doing their duty are under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the law. You ſaid you ſhould not have killed him whom you killed (had you known him) ſooner than you would have killed your own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This indicates that you intended to kill ſome one among them. Your crime is not only againſt the laws of man, but directly againſt the laws of the Supreme Being. The apoſtle Paul ſays, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that be, are ordained of God, and whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.—You did not ſubmit to the lawful authority—you reſiſted till death enſued, and a murder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon one of your neighbors—You ſhed his blood, and by the divine law he that ſheddeth man's blood by man ſhall his blood be ſhed. You are a murderer, and you are condemned by this court.—Under the law there was a city of refuge, to which the man-ſlayer might flee; but alas! for you, there is none, in this world; your only hope muſt be through the great atonement and the blood of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to which I earneſtly exhort you to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for pardon; and may you obtain forgiveneſs. Nothing now remains, but (however painful,) to pronounce the ſentence of death upon you. We are, by your crime, now conſtrained to deprive your wife of a huſband, your children of a parent, and your aged parents of a ſon. Your ſentence is, That you be taken back to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, and there to be hanged by the neck until you are DEAD, and that your body be delivered to the ſurgeon for diſſection—and the LORD have MERCY on your poor SOUL.</p>

trouble, as I have found by ſweet experience, to the comfort of my ſoul, in the moſt diſtreſſing hour when all and every other reſource of comfort failed. I intend to lay before you the reaſons of my being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſentence of death, and the feelings I have had, and now have of the ſolemn approach of death. I intend likewiſe to drop a word to thoſe who deny the offices of Jeſus Chriſt, and have the hardneſs to conſider the Saviour of ſinners, an impoſter, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion a mere notion. I think I can do this moſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, for I freely couſeſs, I entertained the ſame principles, and maintained them by works natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally following from ſuch corrupt ideas. Which led me into ſin, and if I had not been by grace prevented, they would have led me to death—not only the death of this body, but to the death of the ſoul, or ſecond death—for the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. But now, I hope I may ſay, that the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the law of ſin and death, and that I am a new man—that I am born not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible feed, but of incorruptible and by the Word of God that liveth and abideth forever. I now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh my laſt farewel to my earthly parents, with ſome remarks, likewiſe, to my brothers and ſiſters by nature, and thoſe of my brethren in the Lord, who know that they have paſſed from death unto like becauſe they love the brethren.

And now, Oh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, be pleaſed to grant that in me may be found an excellent ſpirit of wiſdom, directed by thee, the true ſource and fountain of wiſdom; that the ſword of the Spirit may awaken convince, convert, and break the rocky hearts and cauſe them to fall at thy feet in humble brokenneſs of ſpirit, and that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine fruit, of faith and repentance may ſhine thro' their life and converſation; that they may break off

               <p>As to my being under ſentence of death, it is the wages of ſin that has brought me into this condition—as I lived in ſin, in the neglect of God, his Son, his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, neglecting the viſitation of the Spirit, trampling on his law and authority, and adventuring as it were on the thick boſſes of his buckler, and even bidding deſiance to Omnipotence, as every careleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned ſinner does, that lives without God in this world, how little ſoever they lay it to heart—for ſtraight is the gate and narrow the way that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to life, and few there be that find it; but broad is the way that leadeth to death, the death of the ſoul, and many there are, with the ſwifteſt velocity, running and entering in thereat, without ever turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moment's thought upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

nothing permanent can be found; and to point out to them the pearl of great price, which if the viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine grace operating on their hearts leads them ſufficiently to diſcover, receive and obey, they will fell all, all the vanities of this ſading world, for the purchaſe of this ineſtimable jewel, which, I hope I have done, and know it muſt be done by all true followers of Jeſus: for, ſaith he, if any man love the world the love of the Father is not in him; and if any man love father or mother, wife or children, houſes or lands more than me, he is not worthy of me. Can it be an unreaſonable command, that we forſake and leave all, for one who hath done ſo much for us? for one who hath left the boſom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, laid aſide his majeſtic robes of glory, left the realms of bliſs and happineſs, for a ſtable, a manager, to be a man of ſorrow, and wear a thorny crown—in a word, a God by whom all worlds were created, and on whoſe ſhoulders hangs the government of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal nature, who by his almighty power, holds all the worlds in their order, and prevents their tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling into confuſion, to condeſcend to ſacrifice his precious life for the redemption of fallen-men? Oh grace, grace! free grace, from the foundation to the top-ſtone! God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only Son to die for it, that whoſoever believeth on him might not periſh, but have everlaſting life. And as this life is to be attained only by faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and a holy life, let me now, knowing the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Lord, perſuade you to the real belief, and practice of thoſe virtues, and to come to Chriſt for the gracious influences of his Spirit to enable you both to will and to do: for, faith he, come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt—and whoſoever cometh unto me, I will in in no wiſe caſt out—and he that believeth ſhall be ſaved. Should it be ſaid, how ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a preacher? and how ſhall they

And may I, with the apoſtle, wiſh them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuch as I am except thoſe iron bands. As to the great affairs of my death, my views of it are changed, I can now ſay, for me to live is Chriſt, but for me to die is great gain: And though the fleſh ſometimes ſeems to have a kind of natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, the ſpirit quickneth and I conſider death a kind meſſenger of peace; and when I look on the gilded ſirmanent, and conſider the abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the expanded heaven; the city of the new Jeruſalem, and of the living God; which I hope to obtain through the merits and perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Redeemer. I feel my heart raviſhed, with ſuch joys as to baniſh the terrors of death, and to ſay, Oh death! where is thy ſting? and Oh grave! where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law; but thanks be to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that I am no more under the law, but under grace.—When I was called before the bar for trial, for my life, I feared I ſhould not receive my ſentence in ſuch a frame of heart as to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the will of God. I therefore betook myſelf to ſecret earneſt prayer to God, that he would be pleaſed to pour out on me his divine Spirit, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me to ſubmit to his providential dealings with me, in regard to my ſentence; and I can ſay, that I feel the rays of divine grace in my ſoul, and that inward peace that the world giveth not: and that I had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to God with ſtrong crying. My dear friends, let me tell you it is a great thing to have union and communion with a God before whom angels and arch angels vail their faces, being unable to behold his glory. Many may ſay, let the will of God be done, but perhaps at the ſame time they ſay his will be done, they have a ſecret reſerve, if it be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their wills—making their own wills the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. Chriſtian reader! try yourſelf and aſk your own heart, if you would willingly reſign your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be burnt at the ſtake, rather than deny the bleſſed JESUS. It is an eaſy matter, under the ſmiles of Providence, to be reconciled, but in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, when inſtead of the ſmiles of Providence we are called to bear afflictions, if we do not ſubmit with patience we ought to doubt our ſtate—we ought to remember it is through much tribulation we muſt be made meet for, and be ſitted and prepared for the kingdom of heaven. Thoſe who are not chaſtified are not ſons, but baſtards. And though the would are all againſt you, and tho' they kill the body, yet you ought to rejoice, when under the ſentence of death. I can ſay, on my receiving the ſentence of death, I was not terrified, yet to heart of the <hi>diſſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of my body, ſeemed diſagreeable to nature, at firſt, but I was ſoon calm'd by ſerious reflection, which calm has continued with me ever ſince; my mind being impreſſed, with a ſerious contemplation of the bright manſion of the realm of bliſs, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory. My dear reader! if you are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impreſſed with my ſolemn hiſtory, let me now for a moment, requeſt your ſerious attention to your own diſſolution. Death, relentleſs death, will ſoon arreſt you, as well as me, and ſhould it ſeize you at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy moment, while in your career of ſin and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it will then be too late to think of heaven, and the glories you might have attained, had you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the golden ſeaſon of grace, now forever loſt to you; you, like the fooliſh virgins, ſleep too long.

Alas! you are now too late, your ſhocking ſentence is not the death of the body, but the death of the ſoul: the ſecond death. Will you ſwallow the ſweet morſels of ſin and yet flatter yourſelf you can with confidence meet God. Remember though ſin ſeem ſweet in the commiſſion, yet it will bite like a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and ſting like an adder. Remember that if you are ever renewed you will mourn with heart break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the commiſſion of all which you falſly call little ſins, while in the love and practice thereof. Theſe reflections are applicable to my wicked life, before I was the cauſe of the death of that poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate young man; what a ſcene of mourning and lementation to his parents, his brothers and ſiſters, for their ſon, and their brother. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he left home well, and at his return is a life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs corpſe! Can tongue expreſs the anguiſh of your hearts! then extend your view, and ſee my body hanging between heaven and earth as a public exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, my poor aged parents, with the moſt keen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of heart, and tears flowing like rivers from their eyes—my dear wife made a widow, my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fatherleſs, mourning and refuſing to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. All this is the wages of ſin. Sinners, are you not as it were thunder-ſtruck and reſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to forſake ſin! Since the beginning of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are ſo dreadful, are you not determined now to flee to the Bock of ſafety, where all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſin and blaſphemies will be forgiven, on your application for pardon. (the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt excepted) Come then to Chriſt and plead his blood and his perfect righteouſneſs; come without money—bring nothing to purchaſe a pardon by way of merit. I confeſs I was much ſtumbled with the ſubject of coming to Chriſt, till by divine inſpiration of the Spirit of God, my mind was wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, to diſcover the connection, beauty and harmony of the glorious goſpel, which the natural man knows not, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:023814_0024_0FC139CFAA3C06E8"/>
I will then attempt to expreſs my ideas of the work of coming to Chriſt, or believing on him, on which depend the ſalvation or damnation of every mortal under heaven. It is ſaid by the Saviour "No man cometh unto me except the Father, who hath ſent me, draw him;" and it is by man, aſſigned as a reaſon for not coming, becauſe they are not drawn. But by the ſame authority it is ſaid, if I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me, and they ſhall be all taught of God; every one therefore, that heareth and learneth of the Father cometh unto the Son. All men are then drawn, and none but thoſe wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blind and rebellious are left in darkneſs. A mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the divine Spirit is given to every man, that cometh into the world. I am not that light ſaid John; but faith he of Chriſt, this is the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world:—and faith Chriſt, I am come a light into the world, that whoſoever followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life. This light, I conceive means his divine Spirit, which all have that will follow its teaching; thoſe who will not, it is taken from them, and they are left in hardneſs, darkneſs; and in the words of the apoſtle, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; not that they were reprobated by a kind and merciful God from eternity, but by their inattention to his calls. Behold, faith the loving Jeſus, I ſtand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in; moſt clearly then, it belongs to ſinners to open the door, and all will open the door of their hearts and receive the King of glory in, or bar the door of their hearts againſt him, to their final and everlaſting diſtructon. I have ſaid much about the divine quickning Spirit, and in order to lead you further into the knowledge of this myſtery, which is denied by many, though po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively expreſſed in the ſacred oracles, let me turn your attention to the original ſtate of man, as he came from the forming hand of his Creator.—He was
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023814_0025_0FC139D14044B5D8"/>
made holy and fell by diſobedience. In the day thou eat thereof, thou ſhall aſſuredly die. In the ſame day he did die, not a natural, but a ſpiritual death; that principle of divine life was immediately eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the ſoul, and man left in a ſtate like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; without God and without hope; had it not been for the merciful interpoſition of the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity, who, I conceive reſtored to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam and all his poſterity, a principle of divine light, or a portion of his bleſſed Spirit, which, if believed in, and hearkened to, is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, convert, ſanctify, and bring them to glory. Therefore thoſe that find in themſelves any of this divine light, or reſiſtance againſt the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may attribute it to ſovereign grace: it is of God, it is not ourſelves; it is not from nature's gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that corrupt root; but thoſe who have no remains of this divine principle, which was purchaſed and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by the Saviour, have had it, and loſt it. If this is not the caſe, how can it be ſaid, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life, and that Chriſt taſted death for every man. Is every man then ſaved by his death? No. If then he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all that their neceſſities required, he is a complete Saviour. If he has not, where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the angels addreſs to the ſhepherd, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of joy to all people? It can be no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of joy to thoſe for whom Chriſt did not die, nor to thoſe who are not the ſubjects of his ſpecial call; and if they are not included in the great things Chriſt has done for the world, how can it be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that light is come into the world, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never reached them—they not being included in that light. The tidings of ſalvation therefore can be no matter of joy to them. And the ſacred ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſay, they are damned for not believing on the name of the only begotton Son of God. If he did not die for them, and they are damned for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him, they are damned for not believing
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023814_0026_0FC139DFB60A1758"/>
a lie. I find the ſcriptures both of the old and new teſtament, hold up to view that all mankind may obtain ſalvation if they will: But ſay ſome, it is God that gives the will—and as a ſoveriegn, he gives to ſome and not to others—I conceive he gives to all power, liberty and ability, and leaves it to their choice to obey and be happy, or to diſobey, and be miſerable; or why are ſuch pathetic expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to obedience, uſed, as, Take heed and obſerve, for, it is for your life: Oh that they were wiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their latter end! and, How often would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing, and ye would not: And ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life: Do not theſe texts imply that all bars in the way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners coming to Chriſt are removed. What means this coming to Chriſt? I humbly conceive it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the viſitations of his divine Spirit, which knock at every heart, and in receiving the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meſſenger, and being lead, guided and governed by the dictates thereof—and in conforming our lives to the perfect pattern of the ſacred oracles. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be a vain hope, to expect heaven and live in ſin. "My ſheep know my voice and follow me." What is it to follow Chriſt, but to follow him in the way of holineſs, and to pattern after his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect example. "Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I ſay?' Should it now he ſaid, I expect to obtain ſalvation by my works; I ſay I do, but not <hi>for</hi> my works nor on the ground of merit. I do not think ſo little of the joys of ſpending an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duration in beholding the face of a reconciled God, as to conceive ſuch an ineſtiamble bleſſing can be purchaſed by a few good works; but they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to thoſe that yield obedience to God, and do his will, and to none but ſuch. A queſtion here will ariſe. "What is the will of God?" I conceive it is that principle of goodneſs flowing from the divine perfection and ever promoting holineſs agreeable to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023814_0027_0FC139E1C15E20D0"/>
his moſt holy nature; for if God is holy, nothing but holineſs can flow from him. As is the fountain, ſo is the ſtream: it being the height of abſardity to ſuppoſe a holy God the author of ſins, or of our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious propenſities to evil; and where it is ſaid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'s there evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it? it means natural evil, and not moral, The exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, Be ye holy for I am holy. Should we adopt the other principle, the injunction muſt be inverted thus, Be you unholy for I the Lord your God am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy. But ſay ſome, if every thing does not take place according to the will of God, then he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely croſſed by ſin, and the moſt miſerable of all beings. But if it is acknowledged, that moral evil is in its nature infinitely contrary to the law of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and government of God. we may ſay by the ſame mode of reaſoning. he is fruſtrated pained and grieved by ſin; viewing it in its nature, as that he chuſeth it: and is pleaſed with it, viewed in its conſequences. Does not God ſay he is grieved at his heart for ſin and that it is his will to have <hi>all</hi> men ſaved; not his efficient will, but his <hi>permiſſive</hi> will. He hath done all for man, that he could do, conſiſtant with his plan of government, and his terms are, <hi>obey</hi> and live. he ſcripture reſolves our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our non- attention and diſobedience. Witneſs the fooliſh virgins, the feed ſown and the talents: he to whom <hi>one</hi> talent was given was not condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had not five, but for not improving his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but hiding it in the earth. So the carnal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned ſinners hide their talent (meaning, as I conceive, their meaſure of the holy Spirit) in the earth; they bury it in things of this world to their everlaſting deſtruction.

And now, my dear parents! let me as a dying child give you a word of advice. which may turn to your comfort. If you are already in Chriſt, let this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be improved by you, to bring you, and keep you ſtill nearer him; and be a means of weaning your affections from this vain and unſatisfying world, and placing them on things above, and of kindling the fire of love to Jeſus, whom may you receive into your hearts, by a true and living faith. But ſhould it be the caſe, that you, or either of you, have been till this time ſtanding idle, who knows but this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is ſent of God to call you, at the eleventh hour, into his vineyard? And ſhould you neglect, perhaps this may be the laſt call to you; if you now diſobey, may it not be ſaid to you, Theſe many years I came ſeeking fruit, and found none; cut them down, why cumber they the ground? Lord, grant that this may not be in vain, and that they may bring forth fruit unto everlaſting life. And now my heart and hand muſt bid adieu to earthly parents, and cloſe an eternal union with my heavenly Father, who, by his divine Spirit, has quickened and prepared me therefor, and witneſſeth with my ſpirit that I am a ſon of God, and heir Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, my dear parents! wipe all tears from your eyes, weep not for me, but for yourſelves, if you have not been born of the Spirit. I can wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death with all its horrors, and lift my ſoul on the wings of faith, and ſay. Oh death, where is thy ſting Oh grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be to God who hath given me the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>As theſe are my laſt words to you, let them be impreſſed on your hearts. The firſt thought that occurs to my mind, is the following queſtion, <abbr>viz</abbr> "Suppoſe ye that thoſe Gallileans, whoſe blood Pilate mingled, were the greateſt ſinners? I tell you may, but except ye repent, ye ſhall likewiſe periſh." If you, or any of you, are deſtitute of the Spirit, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and reigning in your hearts, and are not led by the Spirit of Chriſt, you belong not to him, for only thoſe that art led by the Spirit of God belong to God: and if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his. If you, or any of you, find yourſelves out of Chriſt, or that Chriſt, the only ſure hope of glory, is not in you. Oh give not ſleep to your eyes nor ſlumber to your eye-lids, while remaining in your lamentable ſituation! Come to Jeſus, enter while there is room, before the door be ſhut, and you in vain ſay "Lord, Lord, open unto us," Alas, alas! too late, the ruin of thouſands, waiting till their day of grace is paſt, till the everlaſting door is ſhut, for ever ſhut againſt them. Oh place no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on work, for juſtification, yet expect not ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without practiſing every Chriſtian virtue: vain will be your hope of heaven if ye live in ſin: do not take conviction for converſion, depend not on your converſion, for unleſs you are ſanctified and cleanſed from ſin you belong not to God, as he that committeth ſin is of the devil; and whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not. Should you, ſay, the ſame apoſtle ſaith, If we ſay we have no ſin we are liars; I ſay we have ſin remaining in us, or there could be no warfare, no croſs, no fleſhly luſt to mortify; but if we watch and pray; take the ſword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Spirit will bear rule: it is not the having ſin remaining in us, but committing ſin that will prove our ruin. It is in vain to believe election will ſave
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:023814_0039_0FC13A11E73C2C98"/>
you, for none are elected but through ſanctification: do not believe that any thing leſs than receiving the Spirit and attending to its influence till it becomes the ruling principle in the heart, &amp; conquers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrones corruption can ſave you. Reſt not then in ordinances; reſt in nothing ſhort of true holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.—I hope ſome of you are with me in the Lord: that we are born into one Spirit. Oh ſtrive to perſerve, &amp; make your calling and election ſure; which you may do: if you are faithful unto death, you ſhall receive the crown of life; you muſt dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in you. If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die; and if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live: if ye love me, ſaith Chriſt keep my commandments, and if any man love me and keep my ſayings, the Father and I will come in unto him, and make our abode with him: if we but hearken to the voice of God's Spirit, it will bring us to love God: if we love God it will induce us to keep his commandments; and keeping his commandments will bring you within the reach of this promiſe, to make his abode with you. Here then, is the beginning of true religion, <abbr>viz</abbr> an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive receiving, due hearkening unto, and cloſing with the moving of the Spirit, which is offered, and if received is nouriſhed and ſtrengthened, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth till it perfecteth every thing lacking in you, and maketh you meet for glory. Let me exhort you that have named the name of Chriſt, that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from all iniquity: Shun the very appearance of evil.—And grant, O Lord! that peace and love may ſlow into the hearts of thy children, while in a militant ſtate here, and that they may experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſome of the love of the church triumphant,&amp; at laſt to be ſeated at thy righthand. I muſt now take my leave of you, and bid you farewel, commending you to God, and begging that he would keep you in
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023814_0040_0FC13A1D3B9A77F8"/>

ſoul to him for his bleſſing—My earneſt deſire is, that you may cloſe a more endearing union with the bleſſed Jeſus; then it will not be long until we may again be united, never more to part, and our union will be more dear than that in this world has been. And let me, with the words of a dying man, requeſt that you never reſt ſatisfied until you are aſſured that you dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in you, by the Spirit which he hath given you.</p>
               <p>And earneſtly hoping I may be enabled, by my own experience, to add ſomething (by way of queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anſwer) that may be for your benefit and that of my dear children, I leave what follows, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is meant by conviction?</hi> Anſ. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſubſtance of conviction conſits in being ſenſible of ſin, and of the dreadful puniſhment which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the inevitable conſequence thereof.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What are the mooing cauſes of conviction?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. I conceive they are both external and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: The external cauſes are many, and may be judgments, affictions, diſappointments, death of friends, or perhaps ſometimes bleſſings, mercies, &amp;c. ſometimes reading, hearing the word, &amp;c. operating variouſly on different perſons—all which judgments or mercies, ſerve either to harden their hearts, and drive them farther from God, or to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their hearts and bring them nearer to God; and leave them proper ſubjects to be operated upon by the Spirit; for while they have their attention en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed with the vanities of this world, there is no room for the Spirit, any more than nouriſhment on a rock, for ſeed ſown upon it; and the devil (like the fowls in the parable) is plucking up the good ſeed ſown.—And though the Spirit, in its nature is always drawing towards God, yet the effects are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, according to the different natures of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; as the ſun by its enlivening beams has diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent effects; it will ſoften wax, and harden clay; though its influences and nature is always the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:023814_0043_0FC13A26B1F60618"/>
Queſt. <hi>What is the internal cauſe of conviction?</hi> Anſ. I conceive the internal cauſe is the divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a meaſure of which is given to every man; yet, though the light ſhineth in darkneſs, the darkneſs comprehendeth it not, until by ſome external cauſe operating with the ſtrivings of the divine Spirit, the powerful attraction of corrupt nature is weakened, and corrupt principles ceaſe acting, and then it is that the Spirit begins to take hold of the heart, and ſtrives for admiſſion therein.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the courſe of ſinners under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction?</hi> Anſ. They by praying, reading, ſtrong crying, &amp;c. ſtrive to recommend themſelves to God by their works; and flying from one phyſician to another, till, like the woman with the bloody iſſue, they have ſpent all; and finding their own works fall far ſhort, their rebellious nature ſubmits to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the doors of their hearts, which they had kept barred, and to let the divine Spirit take peaceable poſſeſſion; dethrone fatan, ſanctify and cleanſe the heart, and make it a ſit temple for the Holy Ghoſt to dwell in; and when this full ſurrender is made, the work of converſion or regeneration is performed.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What will be the effect of this great change of conviction?</hi> Anſ. If it is a ſaving conviction, it will begit an univerſal hatred to all ſin, and a determined reſolution againſt it, without the leaſt reſerve; turning to God and the ways of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; a love to God and his people; a ſupreme regard to Jeſus Chriſt, as the great foundation of eternal happineſs; it will take the affections from this vain world; eternal concerns will be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; the mind will be enlightened in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſacred ſcriptures, by an internal ſenſe of the important truths they contain, which will then be a ſtandard to prove the Spirit which is in us to be of God, (not of Anti-Chriſt,) witneſſing with our ſpirits that we are the children of God. The ſacred oracles to the natural man are a ſealed book;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023814_0044_0FC13A30A2DD5AA0"/>
though he knows the letter, he can't ſee the beauty, harmony, and connection thereof until by the divine Spirit they are opened to him and divine light is let into the underſtanding.</p>
               <p>But my dear wife and children, I muſt leave you in the hand of a kind and merciful God, who hath ſtiled himſelf the widow's God and a Father to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs children humbly begging him to keep you and them as the apple of his eye; and clothed with the perfect righteouſneſs of the dear Redeemer, and waſhed in his blood, to preſent you and them falut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs before his throne with exceeding joy: where eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the heart of man to conceive the things that God hath prepared for thoſe that love him: Where God of his infinite mercy grant we may again meet never, never more to part.

to come with the joys of our Lord; and believing, although our natural union here is paſt, yet a far more laſting one may be joined in the realms above, where I hope we may receive the reward of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joy.—And grant, Almighty God! that they may perſevere in the way of holineſs, that they may be faithful unto death, and receive the crown of life; that we may be admitted to join the choir of angels and arch angels, and the ſpirits of the juſt, in ſinging the wonders of redeeming love for ever, and ever: which is the earneſt prayer of your ſon-in-law,</p>

What will it profit you, to gain the whole world, and loſe your immortal ſouls?—Lay up then your treaſure in heaven, that when this earth and the works therein ſhall be no more, you may have a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of refuge ſafe from the ſtorm of almighty wrath—Which to do, be aſſured, there is but one way, that is by receiving Chriſt—to receive him is to open the heart, to receive his Spirit, for this is a part of his purchaſe: and if you are not led by his Spirit, you deny him, and own him not in his true character, and remaining in that ſituation, you are ſo far from receiving any advantage by his great and glorious purchaſe, that you are meriting an aggravated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>

               <p>SINCE writing the foregoing as I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by many of dying with a lye and the moſt malicious murder, which I have not confeſſed and of which I have not repented: I now ſay, I think I can in cool calm reaſon, and the moſt ſincere reflection, appeal to the Court of Heaven for the truth of what I have ſaid and am now ſaying—and in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner declare, before that God before whom
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023814_0050_0FC13A446C6E9E58"/>
my naked ſoul will ſoon be called to appear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſentence, that it is the truth relating to ſaid murder—In the firſt of the evening as I was ſitting by my fire, with my little lovely family in peace, Stephen Bailey knocked at my door, and ſpoke to this effect to me; You had beſt take care of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for there is a party of men, I overheard ſay were coming after you; I got by them; I heard Mr. Eaton rangling with them; they were in high blood: I adviſe you to go to your father's. When he ſaw the men they were about a mile ſouth of my houſe. I never heard who they were not the name of Martin, or any officer; nor any warrant mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor did I know any againſt me—I being frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at hearing a number of men were coming after me in ſuch an uncommon manner, loſt no time, but went immediately to my father's, fearing they would come before I could get away. When at my father's, knowing my wife to be a timorous woman, fearing ſhe might be frightened or ill uſed, I aſked my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go with me and ſpend the evening at my houſe. As we went, each took a club, not knowing what to expect from a drunken mob, as I conceived them. We found none at my houſe, and my wife ſaid they had not been there. After ſupper my brother pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed going to Withy's, where was another brother, and intimated, that ſaid company not coming by that time, Bailey was miſtaken; only hearing the name of <hi>Sweeting</hi> mentioned, it was my brother they were after and not me. I was loath to go, but knowing my brother had that day been taken by execution, which had been paid, and been obliged to pay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and fearing ſuch kind of difficulty. I thought gratitude obliged me to go. My brother went firſt, and I followed. We had not gone far before he hailed ſome people who were coming towards us—they ruſhed on and took him and had him down; yelled and hallowed beyond deſcription.—I ran to the houſe and went in at the fore door—but was ſo
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023814_0051_0FC13A45738C6D28"/>
frightened at that time, I can't relate only what I have been informed ſince by my wife—ſhe ſays I ran about the houſe as if I had been diſtracted, and went to faſten the back door, but could not, and ſaying what ſhall I do, ſhe anſwered you had beſt run into the woods; I made for the woods, from the back door; having got but a few rods before they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the houſe, with the ſame hedious yelling, more like drunker ſavages than like Chriſtians, and demanded entrance: I had got over a fence and ſtood ſtill the ſnow being deep, and a cruſt that would not bear, moving forward would make a noiſe which I feared would diſcover me. I expected they would all go into the houſe, &amp;c. then I would, if poſſible, get away undiſcovered: but a few only went in, and took a candle, by which they found my track in the ſnow, and ſaid there he is gone. I then ran as faſt as I could from them and towards a road; having a club and knife in my hands. I fell over a rock, and found by their noiſe they were near me; and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I could not get away; I got on a rock and told them to ſtand off; I had a great knife and a club, and would kill the firſt man that ſhould touch me; but I had no intention of killing any one, and ſaid it only to firghten them, and if poſſible deter them from coming nearer; but finding they paid no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to what I ſaid, and coming toward me with the ſame hideous yelling, I obſerved one way that I might poſſibly eſcape; I ſprang from the rock, to get through between two of them that ſeemed at a conſiderable diſtsance; Quimby being one of the two, young man, ſprang and caught me round the body—we both fell and he on me, I ſtruggled to get away; the reſt flew on me inſtant;y, how many I know not, ſome had me by the throat and head which they jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the ſnow. I conclude I held faſt the knife in my fright; but I now ſay that from firſt to laſt, I had no intention to kill any man, my intention was
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023814_0052_0FC13A4C65B07FA0"/>
to make my eſcape. I heard nothing of the words you are my priſoner till after they flew on me and, Quimby. There was ſuch a noiſe by yelling and confuſion and I believe they were warm with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous liquor, that there was none of the company who have been able to give any direct account of the matter; as they had been drinking that day and had rum then with them after the accident happened. I never did diſpute the man's being killed with the knife in my hand, but how I know not; perhaps he might receive the firſt wound by ſpringing againſt me, and the ſecond in falling on me or when the company were pulling and halling me in the ſnow. I heard no complaint of any wound till after Quimby was up—whether he was taken off from me, or got off himſelf I know not. It has been ſaid the warrant againſt me was a lawful warrant, I don't ſay to the contrary; but I never had any dealing with the plaintiff who prayed out ſaid warrant. It has been ſaid the warrant was on account of a ſuſpicion that; had poſſeſſed myſelf of an iron kettle, the property of the plaintiff. I had ſold a large kettle—the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff claimed it, and took it away; the perſon from whom he took it, brought a ſuit and recovered da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: then the plaintiff who had taken out his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant againſt me, as I have been informed, brought the ſame ſuit or cauſe before another juſtice for ſaid kettle, and brought his father and brother to ſwear to the identity of the kettle, which they determined by a ſmall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and truth and juſtice perverted to the detriment both of ſoul and body—and I now ſay the ſin that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the greateſt weight on my conſcience is, inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ſolemnity of oaths; and as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been called to ſwear before courts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> held by juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the peace, I fear I did not conſider, and weigh the dreadful conſequences of calling the great God to witneſs to the truth, when I have had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret reſerve by way of evaſion; and I think I have often ſeen it done by others.—I have my fears that the witneſſes that ſwore againſt me when on trial for my life, did not fully conſider the ſolemnity of the oaths they took, to deliver the whole truth; but if they did not, and gave the tranſaction any falſe colouring, I forgive them, and pray that they may obtain forgiveneſs of the God againſt whom they have ſinned.</p>
               <p>Oh my friends! let a dying man earneſtly exhort all witneſſes in future, not to forget the nature of the oaths they take; and let them weigh well the ſenſe of what they deliver, and ever let it be the whole truth reſpecting all circumſtances, without the leaſt kind of falſe colouring, and without the leaſt kind of prejudice; remembering, perjury may in ſome inſtances be committed by ſpeaking truth, and in holding back a part of the truth, which would have placed the whole tranſaction in a different point of light.</p>

               <p>THE day but one before I was to be executed, my wife and children and other friends took their laſt farewel of me, in this world—the tears and heart-breaking ſorrows of parting, I cannot deſcribe. It having been propoſed that my wife and friends ſhould apply to the doctor to whom my body had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for diſſection, and beg it might be delivered to them for burial; which they did and being refuſed, it ſo exceedingly affected them, that I could not help taking a part in their extreme ſorrow on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and having been adviſed to try to make my eſcape, I attempted, and effected it; and with my irons on got ſome diſtance; but was ſoon taken and brought back.—I now ſay, I am ſorry that I gave way ſo much to nature, as to try for an eſcape; it is what I ought not to have done; I ought not to have reſiſted the Divine will, in dying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor giving my body to be uſed for the benefit of mankind—I ought to have been a diamond in the crown of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who hath done and ſuffered ſo much for me—I am humbled in the duſt, and hope it will be a means of bringing me nearer my Saviour.</p>
               <p>I HAVE been attended by a number of the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the everlaſting Goſpel, and I thank them for their kind repeated viſits, prayers and inſtructions—they endeavored to impreſs me with the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſin of not owning malice, and urged my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, my anſwer has been, that to pleaſe man I ought not to confeſs a lie to God, and thought it was juſt in God to take my life in this way, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his pleaſure yet he knew I had no malice nor intention to kill any man. I expect there were ſome
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:023814_0055_0FC13A5BD0E7C240"/>
of the clergy to whom my anſwers were by no means ſatiſfacory as to the murder, and alſo ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples I believe, that they deny; one of which is that Chriſt only died for a certain number, elected from eternity, which will be ſaved, and that others are reprobated to damnation: I can entertain no ſuch ideas of Divine goodneſs, as to believe that he has doomed any part of mankind to eternal miſery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affording them every thing neceſſary to eſcape therefrom: but that his divine character and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are the ſame as he hath revealed them in the ſacred ſcripture; and that they are not given by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration to deceive us, which I humbly conceive would be the caſe if this doctrine was true—for God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved. If then he did not die for the world, the world through him could not be ſaved—the purpoſes of God then are not anſwered, but totally defeated: and when I mentioned that God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. One of thoſe Rev. gentlemen anſwered, that the world meant the elect—To which I replied, if the term world means elect, in this place, then the text will read thus: God ſo loved the elect, that he gave his only Son that whoſoever of the elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him, may not periſh. If this be the ſenſe then it implies, that part of the elect may not believe—I read Chriſt taſted death for every man; that the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life: and it ſeems as if every man and all men, muſt in fact, mean all men under heaven. I read of thoſe denying the Lord that bought them; if they were not bought by him, how could they deny him, that bought them: This, to me is unanſwerable and unaccountable. An obſervation was made that Chriſt did not pray for the world, but them that the Father had given him: this to me is far from prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:023814_0056_0FC13A5CA12F0E60"/>
Chriſt did not die for the world, becauſe he did not pray for the world: for Chriſt I conceive could pray for nothing but what would be granted if then Chriſt were to pray for all the world, they muſt all be ſaved: for ſaid he I can pray to my Father and he will give me more than twelve legions of angels. From this I conclude the prayers of the Son are all granted. I aſked if Adam loſt every thing good, they agreed he did. I then aſked what it was in us that gave us a check when we did wrong and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for having ſo done? They anſwered, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience. I confeſs I know not what that is as they hold it. I can find no ſuch principle in nature, and believe there is none in man, while his day of grace laſts. For in Adam we loſt every good, where then can ſuch a principle ſpring from: I can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of but two principles <abbr>viz.</abbr> from God; or, from the devil. If this principle is from God, it is not natural, but ſpiritual. I hold that in Adam we loſt the laſt ſpark of life, light and inclination to holineſs virtue or any thing good, more than the devil, have. What they conceive natural conſcience, I conceive a ſupernatural principle, purchaſed by the Redeemer; repreſented in ſcripture, by the light that lightneth every man that cometh into the world, in many places called the Spirit, a meaſure of which is given every man to profit withal, and that all both elect and reprobate have it: The elect improve it, and it is increaſed; to him that hath ſhall be given. The reprobate do not improve, but reſiſt till it is taken away. They who are called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate are not made ſo by an eternal decree of the greateſt and bell of Beings but having reſiſted till the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This principle, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive clearly expreſſed in thoſe words of the apoſtle, Examine yourſelves, know your ownſelves that Chriſt is in you except you are reprobates.—If eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that cometh into the world has that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

ple, then thoſe reprobates have had it, and have loſt it; they by their egregious and ever to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed folly have loſt it paſt recovery.</p>
               <p>Another queſtion has been put to me reſpecting the ſtate of infants: to which I ſay that, I am far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that there are of thoſe in hell not more than a ſpan long as ſome have had the boldneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to aſſert. I believe the purchaſe of the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extends to all and every infant born; and that talents, or a meaſure of the divine Spirit, are giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them, according to their day; and that thoſe of them, that are taken out of the world before actual tranſgreſſion, the divine ſpirit ſanctifies and cleanſes from original ſin. I conceive the declaration of our Lord confirms the truth of this: faith he, of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven; and except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. It has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to me, that, in Adam we loſt all our moral abilities, but not our natural. I find no propriety for this diſtinction, as they make it; for all natural abilities lead towards the prince of darkneſs; and it is ſpiritual abilities that lead, towards the Prince of light. If we have any thing reſtored by Chriſt, it muſt be ſufficient to place us in a ſtate of probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſomething above nature; and fully adequate to the purpoſes for which it was purchaſed and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given.</p>
               <p>There has alſo been held up to me, a diſtinction between common and ſpecial grace a diſtinction which I conceive conſiſts in imagination only hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no foundation in the ſacred ſcripture. Say they, God gives his common grace to all; but his ſpecial grace to none but the elect, I believe his ſpecial hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, like a grain of muſtard ſeed is given all, without exception. I do not believe ſpec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some queſtions were alſo made about foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It ſeemed as if thoſe divines had an idea, that, if it was from eternity known by God that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam would ſin; then it followed, that Adam could not help it. To which I anſwered, if Adam could not help it, then he could not be blameable—he could incur no guilt. What man endowed with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ever thought a man to blame for what he could by no means prevent? I believe every thing is known by God from all eternity, that ever hath or ever can or will exiſt, and that it will come to paſs exactly in the manner foreknown; but not merely becauſe foreknown, any more than becauſe afterknown: knowledge does not canſiſt in power, or agency. In all inſtances thoſe things foreknown as neceſſary, are foreknown as neceſſary, and thoſe contingent, as contingent.—I believe that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God is not an efficient in evil, and that nothing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ever was, will, or can be brought into exiſtence by him. I believe every thing foreknown, and ſome thing, foredetermined to be brought about by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency. I believe where it is ſaid, I will harden Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roh's heart, means no more than that he having ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out his day of grace while under the operation of the Spirit, it was withdrawn from him, and that muſt be hardneſs ſufficient: His temper and diſpoſition was then the ſame as Adam's would have been after ſinning without the interpoſition of the Saviour. The ſame may be ſaid of Judas in betraying his Lord; the devil entered into him, and ſo he does every one when their day of grace is paſt, and the Spirit is withdrawn; they are then under the power of the devil and fill up the meaſure of their days in his ſervice.</p>
               <p>It was obſerved by ſome of the divines that the day of grace laſted through a man's life. In ſome inſtances it may be ſo, in others not. I can't believe
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023814_0059_0FC13A68B5643680"/>
it true in the inſtances juſt mentioned of Pharaoh and Judas: therefore ſailing in any inſtance, it can be no rule to be depended upon.</p>
               <p>Another of the clergy obſerved, that if Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all then all muſt be ſaved or his power is not ſufficient to ſave all, which degrades the Redeemer. I anſwer, firſt: that Chriſt, I conceive, did not die to exert his Almighty power to ſave one ſoul, but to ſatisfy the vindictive juſtice of God for all, and place all on a footing to accept his terms, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his purchaſed bleſſing; otherwiſe I ſee no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in his commands and exhortations to choſe, turn, believe and live. All mankind are in ſcripture conſidered and treated as <hi>free agents,</hi> as rational be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and are all called, invited and drawn by the Spirit. The Spirit and the Bride ſay come—Behold I ſtand at the door and knock; that is at the heart. It belongs to us to open the door, and receive the King of Glory in; if we will not open, he will not force; if we bar, he will never brake. He hath done all things neceſſary; what more could I have done, that I have not done: ſaid he, not that he hath exerted his Almighty power, but hath done all that belonged to the work of redemption, and conſiſtent with the undertaking. Secondly, I ſay, tho' Chriſt died to ſatisfy divine juſtice for all, yet it is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to him not to ſave all, becauſe he never undertook it, only conditionally, and that condition on their part never has been performed. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary principles, I conceive, holding that Chriſt did not die for the whole world, is diſhonoring God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading the Saviour, diſcouraging ſouls, and the greateſt detriment to the progreſs of true religion.—It appears to diſhonor God, by diſbelieving his ſacred declaration ſo often made in the ſcripture, <hi>that he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſpecter of perſons.</hi> It degrades the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Chriſt by denying the firſt neceſſary ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſalvation, <abbr>viz.</abbr> A light, to lighten every man; and that by means of his purchaſe, this
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:023814_0060_0FC13A726AB549E0"/>
light is actually given, and that it is ſufficient. If we believe the ſacred oracles, we muſt believe it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the great purpoſe or ſalvation, and that all mankind have it. If it is not ſufficient it may be conſidered worſe than nothing, and a means of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating the condemnation of a conſiderable part of mankind; and the Saviour of ſinners has done them no favor, but the greateſt injury and rendered their ſituation infinitely worſe than before. The doctrine of perſonal election from eternity has a tendency to exalt ſelf, &amp; appears far from that humble ſpirit of love and good will to all men recommended in the goſpel. It is diſcouraging to ſouls under conviction; for they from ſuch principles conclude ſeeking and ſtriving are to no purpoſe: for if they are not elected it is not in the power of all worlds to ſave them—and damned to all eternity then they muſt be. Many in ſuch a ſituation go into deſtruction, and I have heard of many under ſuch diſcouragement putting an end to their days by taking their own lives, and where is the inconſiſtency of ſuch conduct upon the belief of ſuch principles; for they are taught the longer they live in an unconverted ſtate they are adding ſin to ſin—and they, conſidering they are not elected and cannot be ſaved, believe the ſooner they die the leſs ſin they will have to anſwer for.</p>
               <p>I conſider it detrimental to religion, to hold forth the terms of ſalvation in a myſterious metaphyſical light, and the Divine Character in a different view from what it is held forth in the word written by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Spirit. Thoſe principles fix on the ſcriptures ſo many contradictions, as to create a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of their being from God or any thing more than human invention; and lay a foundation for DEIS<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. While on the other hand, the principles for which I contend are moſt fully ſet forth in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and in the moſt expreſſive and moving manner—they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

free grace; appear perfectly reaſonable, and plain to the weakeſt capacity, ſo that the that runs may read and underſtand the literal ſenſe; but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſe can be unſolded by nothing leſs than the divine Spirit of inſpiration, by which they were wrote; operating in the heart and witneſſing with the written word. Some ſcriptures are ſpoken to particular perſons—ſome to churches, and ſome to kingdoms and nations. Such I conceive is Paul's to the Jews, in the ix chapter of Romans, mourning the fate of the Jews; and not the election and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of particular perſons, which I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive does not apply to prove any thing concerning election as commonly contended for—Jacob have I loved and Eſau have I hated, is a quotation made by the apoſtle, from Gen. xxv, 23, and Mal. i, 2, 3. His laying waſte the heritage of Edom for the drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the wilderneſs, is a different thing from his appointing the perſon of Eſau to eternal miſery, by a mere act of ſovereignty, without any thing done by him to deſerve it.</p>
               <p>The apoſtle is ſpeaking of the two nations, and ſhewing the Jews how without any good works done by them, and long before they were born, they were choſen a peculiar people, not elected to everlaſting happineſs, but a people whom it pleaſed the Supreme Being to raiſe above any other people and to work miracles innumerable: all to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the great and glorious event, to wit, the birth of the Saviour of the world, long before promiſed; which when the apoſtle wrote had been brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to exiſtence; and they having abuſed thoſe great and glorious privileges, God in his providence was about to beſtow them on the Gentiles—And that God as a ſovereign diſpoſeth the fate of kingdoms and nations, the times and ſeaſons according to his pleaſure.—In conſidering this chapter in any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er manner, it contradicts and deſtroys the apoſtolic and other writings, and even the whole tenor of ſcripture, of the old and new teſtament. What I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by the elect is ſuch as are converted unto

They are ſuch as are choſen through ſanctification of the Spirit, and muſt be ſanctified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are elected; and though it is ſaid God from the foundation of the world hath elected us in him; ſo it is ſaid of Chriſt, the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world; but brought to paſs not two thouſand years ſince: ſo election, form the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, I conceive, means holy perſons that are in time converted unto God and continue in his love; and that God appoints obedient believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto ſalvation not without, but according to his fore-knowledge of all their works from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. And God, who is unchangeable, hath fore-ordained all diſobedient unbelievers unto condemnation; not without but according to his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of all their works from the foundation of the world.—Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

not: Said Chriſt my ſheep know my voice, and I know them and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand. My ſheep hear my voice: much depends on this part of the ſentence. Hearing in ſcripture conveys a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant idea, on which our eternal all depends. In this place then they that are meant by hearing his voice, are they that hear, receive, obey, and walk in all the commandments of their Lord: thence none can pluck them out of his hand—But if that ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart my Lord delayeth his coming, and be drunken: The Lord of that ſervant will cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion where is weeping, wailing and knaſhing of teeth,—Saith Paul, Romans, viii, 38. I am perſuaded, that neither death, life, angels principalities nor powers, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. This they conceive a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable proof of perſeverance, and it does effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prove it to thoſe characters to whom he wrote; and they were ſuch as were mentioned in the verſe juſt before, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That neither tribulation, diſtreſs, perſecution, peril or ſword could deter or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade from following the voice of the lovely Jeſus: and thoſe that were ſuch, nothing could ſeparate from his love. And as it is at this day, to theſe who continue in his love, they are his diſciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and none but ſuch.</p>
               <p>Another teſt, to prove their aſſertion is, that whom he loveth, he loveth unto the end. What end—the end of their continuing in his love, or the way of holineſs? Some are mentioned as being kept by the mighty power of God through faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation. If any are kept in or through faith it is by the mighty power of God. But that all that have faith, keep it unto ſalvation, can't be proved from ſcripture. Adam had it and might have kept it; ſo it is with others at this day; this mighty power of God is ſufficient, if we keep ourſelves in it: if we forſake him, he will forſake us. Saith the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:023814_0064_0FC13A7D8E201AA8"/>
keep yourſelves in the love of God. This is our part; God gives it to us; it belongs to us to keep it. "If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him:" but we are not of that number, that draw back unto perdition. This does not prove, that I myſelf, and you my dear reader! are not of the number that draw back: nor will our having once believed prove it; nothing leſs then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chriſt in the ways of holineſs, and feeling the internal evidence of grace within ourſelves, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with our ſpirits to the ſacred ſcriptures, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding there with can give as any ſolid ground of comfort: paſt experiences are not ſafe to truſt upon. The great and important queſtions are, What do we experience this preſent moment? not, what have we experienced—Are our lamps ſtill burning, and is the light within us increaſing?

               <head>A ſhort account of the life, converſation, parting advice, and execution of Whiting Sweeting—by Wm. Carter.</head>
               <p>I Beg leave to inform the public, that I have been intimately acquainted with Whiting Sweeting, the writer of the foregoing and that I have been preſent when he was viſited by a number of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the goſpel, to examine into the ſtate of his
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023814_0066_0FC13A8D4E6FD8B8"/>
ſoul, and adviſe and pray with and for him, and have often heard him give an account of his former wicked life, before he was made a priſoner, and of his conviction and converſion, while he was confined in the gaol—A ſhort account of which I expect will be pleaſing to his friends and relations, and perhaps entertaining to ſome readers.</p>
               <p>WHEN he was firſt made priſoner, he appeared an exceedingly ignorant man, in the knowledge of ſcripture, and one that had never applied himſelf to the ſtudy thereof; and for ſome time his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance looked rough and diſagreeable. He ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to diligent reading and ſtudying the ſcriptures, meditation and prayer; and ſeemed an earneſt ſeeker of the great things of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace. At a certain time, one Sunday, about the laſt of January now paſt, after prayer and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (as he expreſſed it) he felt an extraordinary change, in the powers and faculties of his mind, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any feelings he ever had before; he felt calm and peaceable in his mind; had new views of God, of Chriſt, of the ſacred ſcriptures; the truth of ſcripture confirmed, and opened new views of God as the greateſt and infinitely the beſt of Beings—as a Being infinitely lovely and worthy of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt love and adoration of all creatures; as a Being at an infinite diſtance from all ſin, and poſſeſſed of perfect holineſs and his law ſuch, that he could not forgive the leaſt ſin without perfect ſatisfaction; that all mankind were guilty, and unable to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his juſtice for one, even the leaſt ſin; that the Son of God had undertaken to make ſatisfaction, and had brought in an everlaſting righteouſneſs, for all that would give up themſelves to him, to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſolely on account of his merit; and that the terms were to give up all for the Pearl of great Price: He felt himſelf drawn to God, and the ways of holineſs, and reſigned to God his deareſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſaid he was willing to be to do and to ſuffer juſt what God pleaſed: and if it was the will of God to take his life, (tho' he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:023814_0067_0FC13A91B8F25E80"/>
himſelf a murderer) he was willing to die, and could not ſay he had any deſire to live, tho' there was ſomething ſhocking to nature in death: yet it was a cup all muſt drink.—About this time there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a viſible change in his countenance, which was obſerved by ſeveral that viſited him: he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared calm, compoſed, pleaſant, affible, and ever after ſo remained till his execution.</p>
               <p>He ſpent his whole time in reading, praying and in converſation on divine things.—He made ſurpriſing progreſs in the knowledge of ſcripture, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if he was able to unfold any myſterious paſſage in the plaineſt manner.—He was much diſappointed in hearing the witneſſes againſt him at his trial: and after the witneſſes were heard, ſome of his friends who ſeemed to have ſome knowledge of the unhappy affair, obſerved to him ſomething about perjury, he ſaid don't mention ſuch a thing: I hope they are not perjured wilfully, if they are I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them; they have not hurt me; I am willing to die. And when ſome of his relations ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about a reprieve, he ſaid no, they need not give themſelves any trouble about it; it was the will of God to call him out of the world in that way, and he hoped it would be to the glory of God, and the good of precious and immortal ſouls.</p>
               <p>I was preſent when his father, mother, brothers and ſiſters and his wife came to take their laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of him; which ſcene was truly affecting, and ſufficient to melt the hardeſt heart, but eſpecially the parting with his wife; he in the moſt preſſing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſet before her the joys to be obtained, and the miſery to be avoided by a ſtrict attention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and coming into the terms of ſalvation; which he opened and explained, urging a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and as an engaging motive, (their affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great for each other) that then they ſoon again ſhould meet in thoſe happy regions where no ſin nor ſorrow can enter, to diſturb their happineſs, throughout <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſhe would find an admiſſion into thoſe realms of bliſs, into which in a few hours he was going. He added, I am a dying man; you have been a kind wife; I muſt leave you in the hands of a merciful God; farewel, till we meet again in a better would never to part.</p>
               <p>When the ſheriff came to call him to execution, he ſeemed calm as he had been before.</p>
               <p>It was with much difficulty that he wrote the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going pieces (his hands being in irons) and as they could not eaſily be read, he deſired me to copy them, and requeſting alſo, that I would add his dying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the audience, at the gallows. He alſo left with me a few lines, in verſe, to be added to his laſt and dying words.</p>
               <p>As to what he ſaid at his execution, as I was not preſent, and no perſon took notes of it, I have it not in power to give it at length—but from a paper found in his pocket after he was executed, which contained the heads of his laſt and dying words, it appears to have been a kind of abridgment of what he had wrote—earneſtly preſſing an attention to religion as the great thing needful urged from various conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations—alſo the great propriety of chuſing good magiſtrates, obeying them when choſen, and the incumbent duty of every citizen to be obedient to the laws; and cloſed with a ſervent prayer, well adapted to the ſolemnity of the occaſion—the laſt words of which were LORD JESUS! into thy hands I commit my ſpirit.—And I think it may with truth be obſerved, that, as in his converſation he ſeemed to live in the lively expectation of a happy eternity—ſo to all appearance, he died.</p>
               <p>In his laſt converſation with his relations, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the great and glorious doctrines of the goſpel were not held forth in their true light; but were by ſome of the preachers of the goſpel ſo cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obſcured by metaphyſical reaſonings, as to render them hard, if not impoſſible; to be underſtood and received in the true ſenſe held forth in the world; and often earneſtly wiſhed might it be in his power
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023814_0069_0FC13A9438C5F368"/>
to communicate his internal ſenſe there of; which he had not received from man, by tradition and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from God, by the influence of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and earneſtly directed them to have recourſe to the Spirit within their own hearts together with the ſacred ſcriptures, and in that way by earneſt ſeeking they could not fail to find: and that the way of ſalvation would be opened clear and plain to them. And that following Chriſt, by keeping his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is the way in which he is to be found; for, ſaith he, John viii, 12. I am the light of the world, he that followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſs;—vii. 17. If any man do his will he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God;—xiv. 23. If a man love me, he will keep my words and my Father will love him, and we will come in unto him and make our abode with him.—He often obſerved that he did not believe that the ſoul of man came immediately from God, as ſome ſuppoſe, and when joined with the body was holy and clear of any ſin: he believed that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſpirit of man that goeth upward; xii, 7. Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth as it was and the ſpirit ſhall return to God who gave it.—Hebrews iv, 12.

For what man knoweth the things of a man, five the ſpirit of man which is in him; even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.—The ſoul of man and the ſpirit he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two very different things; by the ſpirit, a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural principle purchaſed by the Saviour, and given for further improvement; repreſented by the good ſeed, the leaven, the grain of muſturd ſeed, the

talents, &amp;c. And that this divine principle is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to every man that cometh into the world; &amp; that as many go out of the world, at or near the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of their coming into it, then if all have it they muſt have it a ſoon as they come into the world, if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And though this divine principle is in every heart yet to many it is of no uſe, becauſe they bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it in the earth, and though like a live coal of fire wholly buried and covered under the aſhes, when found and ſtirred up, begins to burn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo this divine principle becomes the ruling power; but if it is not found and improved the powerful principle of corrupt nature grows ſtronger, the divine principle is buried deeper and deeper till it is wholly taken away—And that thoſe who never were favored with the light of outward revelation, have this divine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple operating on many of them to their ſalvation. <hi> Rev. v, 9. For thou waſt ſtain and haſt redeemed us unto God by thy blood, out every kindred, tongue, people and nation. And I ſaw a great multitude which no man could number of all nations, kindreds, people and tongues before the throne and before the Lamb, cloathed with white robes, and palms in their hands, crying ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>He often expreſſed that if he could while under his conviction have received any ſuch directions, as he hath been giving in his writing, he ſhould have found great benefit therefrom: and from ſuch conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wiſhing to promote the good of immortal ſouls and lead them from their own works to the Spirit in the heart, and to induce them to attend to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teachings, and to convince them that ſalvation is no where elſe to be found, and in no other way to be obtained—induced him to ſpend ſo much of his ſhort time in writing—having not began writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till after he received ſentence of death. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerved that having in his confinement been furniſhed with a piece on election and reprobation wrote by Mr. George Whitefield, in which he ſays, that they who believe in God's dooming men to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſting burning, alſo believe that God looked on
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:023814_0071_0FC13AA1D8146208"/>
them as fallen in Adam, and that decree which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the puniſhment, regarded the crime by which it was deſerved; he could not believe mankind were doomed to eternal miſery without any preceding fault other than the ſin of Adam, and that infants did not as ſoon as born, deſerve damnation for a fault committed thouſands of years before they were born, which they could not foreſee nor prevent; and though he believed original ſin in the fulleſt ſenſe, yet he believed none were damned for it without actual tranſgreſtion; original ſin being anſwered, and a new principle being reſtored by the Redeemer—he could not believe that a covenant was made between the Father and Son, that the Son ſhould in time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from heaven to earth, to redeem a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number, called the elect, and leave all others by far the greater part of mankind reprobated from all eternity: and he ſaid after reading ſaid au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's aſſertions and ſtudying the ſame, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to earneſt prayer to God to ſhew him the truth, and ſoon after had the fallacy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of thoſe principles moſt plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him, and in the moſt preſſing manner he intreated his wife not to be led away with thoſe principles (tho' faſhionable at this day) ſo directly contradictory to the whole tennor of both old and new teſtament, and obſerved that if all the men on earth were to tell him he was wrong, they could not ſhake his faith; for the had that which the world could neither give nor take away; <abbr>viz.</abbr> the internal evidence, the witneſs of the Spirit of God, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing with his ſpirit, and agreeing with the ſcriptures and opening them clearly to his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding—and that on theſe important truths he was willing to venture his immortal all; not in the leaſt doubting, but in a few hours he ſhould be admitted to join in the happy and never-end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praiſes of redeeming love, to HIM that hath waſhed us in his blood, and made us kings and prieſt unto our God, that we might reign with him for ever and ever.</p>
