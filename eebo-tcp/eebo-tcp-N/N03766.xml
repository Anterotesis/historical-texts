            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN the Jews returned from the Babyloniſh Captivity, they (according to the direction and commandment of Cyrus the King of Perſia) laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the houſe of God at Jeruſalem, when ſome greatly rejoiced and others wept, as you may ſee in <hi>Ezra 1ſt and 2d Chapters.</hi> But the Samaritans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were mortal Enemies to the Jews, by hiring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors and bribing ſome principal Perſons at the Perſian Court, greatly retarded the work:
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004621_0003_100DAD492AC7B0D0"/>
So that from laying the foundation, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> up by the Prophets Haggai and Zechariah, and encouraged by the decree of Darius in their favour, the work went on again. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it ſeems as if the obſtruction and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they met with from their enemies was not the only Reaſon of the works ceaſing ſo long as it did.

            <p>There are three things more eſpecially which the Prophet ſets before the Jews to excite them to this work. As,</p>

better. They were blaſted and the work of their hands not bleſſed. <hi>Ye have ſown much</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>and bring in little, ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye cloathe you, but there is n<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Ye looked for much, and lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home I did blow upon it; Why? ſaith the Lord of hoſts, becauſe of mine houſe that is waſte, and ye run every man unto his own houſe, &amp;c.</hi> Chap. 1. ver. 6, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He promiſes them God's aſſiſtance and bleſſing, Chap. 1. ver. 13. <hi>I am with you, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And Chap. 2. ver. 19 <hi>From this day will I bleſs you.</hi> That is from the day they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged vigorouſly to carry on the work of God's houſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He encourages them to this work, by aſſuring them that the glory of this Houſe ſhould be greater than that of the former. They might be under diſcouragement, when they conſidered how far this houſe which they were about to build, would fall ſhort of the firſt Temple in beauty and glory. Ver. 3. of Context, <hi>Who is left among you that ſaw this houſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It was this that made the ancient men weep then the foundation of this latter houſe was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

But to remove this difficulty and diſcouragement, he aſſures them that the glory of this latter houſe ſhould be greater than of the former, <hi>in our Text.</hi> But how this could or ſhould be is the Queſtion For the former houſe certainly exceeded the latter in Riches, magnificence of Building and external Ornaments, as well as divers tokens of the divine Favour, which the latter houſe was deſtitute of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Queſtion admits an eaſie Solution from our Text &amp; Context; and is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly this, <hi>That Chriſt the deſire of all Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould during the ſtanding of this ſecond Temple or latter Houſe, come and honour it with his Preſence</hi> Ver. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land And I will ſhake all nations, and the deſire of all nations ſhall come, and I will fill this houſe with glory ſaith the Lord of hoſts.

This Houſe is beautiful and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent; much Labour and Coſt has been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon it: But unleſs Chriſt's gracious Preſence be with us here, its all loſt and to no purpoſe.

               </gap> Chriſt with us here.</p>
            <p>And for this purpoſe be directed,</p>

Its not enough to Aſſent to the truth of the Revelation that is made of him in the Goſpel, as the Saviour of the world; but you muſt Conſent to Accept of Him as your Saviour: Not only as a Prophet to teach you, as a Prieſt to make atonement and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for your acceptance; but alſo as a King to rule &amp; govern you. Here the inſincerity of many, in the acceptance of &amp; ſubmiſſion to Chriſt, appears; Tho' they are willing to be ſaved by him, yet they will never ſubmit to be ruled and governed by him: His Diſcipline is too ſtrict, the Obedience he requires is too exact for them. They ſtrangely delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with hopes of being ſaved by him, tho' they are never govern'd by him But if ever you would have his gracious Preſence here, or his glorious Preſence hereafter, now receive and ſubmit to Chriſt.

               </gap>hen have his Preſence with us in this Houſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us endeavour to Engage Chriſt's Preſence with us here, by Meeting here in his Name.</hi> We are aſſured, That <hi>where two or three are gathered together in Chriſt's Name, he will be in the midſt of them,</hi> Mat 18 20 Let us therefore when we come here to Worſhip come in Obedience to Chriſt; Let us come with a view &amp; aim to glorify him; to do honour to this our Lord and Maſter, Then may we expect his gracious Preſence. Its not meerly our coming here that does ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto Chriſt. Such as come only out of a vain curioſity of hearing or ſeeing ſome new thing, conſult not the honour of Chriſt, nor the good of their own Souls: and are not likely to contribute any-thing towards engaging the Preſence of the bleſſed JESUS with us here.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We ſhould earneſtly Pray for Chriſt's Preſence with us here.</hi> Our hearts deſire and prayer to God, ſhould be for the gracious Preſence of Chriſt with us in this place; That by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we may be enabled to Worſhip in an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manner; and that by the Influences and Operations of it, his Word may be made Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for the Awakening the Secure, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Unconverted; that the Doubting may be Reſolved, the Weak and heavy laden

and humble Behaviour will recommend us to the Eſteem and entitle us to the kind Regards of the bleſſed JESUS, and invite his <hi>gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> among us.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Is it Chriſt's Preſence in a Houſe of publick Worſhip, that renders it truly glorious? We ſhould <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> very careful then that we do nothing to prevent our being favoured with his gracious Preſence in this Houſe, or that may cauſe him to withdraw it from us.</hi> If the glory of this Houſe conſiſts in our having the gracious Preſence of Chriſt in it, then let us do nothing that may tend to prevent or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of this Favour. The things that tend to prevent or deprive us of it, and which we ſhould therefore endeavour that they may not be found with us, are ſome ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Unbelief &amp; hardneſs of Heart.</hi> When per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons repeatedly refuſe an offer'd Saviour; when they will not believe in him; tho' they have greater Evidence of his being the Meſſiah and Saviour of the world, than they would have ſhould one riſe from the dead and tell them ſo. When they will not believe his Promiſes nor Threatnings, nor his power to Renew, Sanctify and Save them. This cauſes him to with-hold or withdraw the gracious &amp; powerful Influence and Efficacy of his Spirit from them. He does not think fit to continue it where its ſo ſlighted &amp; diſregarded. Thus we find that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Unbelief, that Chriſt did not many
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004621_0013_100D83C951954438"/>
mighty works in his own Country, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 58. He did not think it fi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting to beſtow his pains upon ſuch perſons, or to continue his gracious Preſence in ſuch places where they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hardned in Unbelief.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing that tends to prevent or deprive us of Chriſt's gracious Preſence, and which we ſhould therefore be careful that it be not found with us, is, <hi>An Unpeaceable &amp; Contentious, ſpirit.</hi> Chriſt is a Prince of peace, and has taught his followers to be at peace amongſt themſelves, To ſtudy to be quiet, and to do their own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But yet if they are Unpeaceable, Wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; Contentious; live in Envy, Variance, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice &amp; Hatred: And eſpecially if they diſcover ſuch a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emper &amp; behaviour in the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God's Houſe it will be highly diſpleaſing to Chriſt, and may provoke him to withdraw his Preſence from them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another thing of the like unhappy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, &amp; which we ſhould be watchful againſt, is, <hi>A ſpirit of I difference about, Careleſsneſs, Levity and Rudeneſs in God's Houſe in times of publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> When perſons are indifferent &amp; careleſs about the publick Worſhip, are little concern'd whether they attend it or no, it diſcovers want of love to Chriſt and a low eſteem of his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preſence: And when in the Houſe and at the times of publick Worſhip, their behaviour is irreverent &amp; rude; when they indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004621_0013_100D83C951954438"/>
in ſporting and play, they deſerve to be treated in the manner that Chriſt treated them that bought and ſold in the Temple, when making a ſcourge of ſmall cords he drave them out of it. For by ſuch behaviour they defile the Houſe of publick Worſhip &amp; provoke Chriſt to withdraw his <hi>gracious Preſence</hi> from it Let us then be very careful that we don't by any of theſe things prevent <hi>Chriſt's gracious Preſence</hi> coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Houſe, nor provoke him to withdraw it if once he vouchſafes to favour us with it.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>From what has been ſaid, we may learn in what manner every one may be Inſtrumental in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring this Houſe glorious; and that is by their ſincere and conſtant Endeavours to engage the Preſence of Chriſt in it.</hi> It's that (as we have heard) that will render it truly glorious. They at whoſe Expence it has been Set up and rendred ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the publick Worſhip to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in, have done well, and God will, no doubt, think upon them for good according to all they have done for him; He will remember them concerning this, and not wipe out their good deeds that they have done for the Houſe of their God. But in this Expence every one has not been Equally intereſted: But in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to render this Houſe truly glorious, the Poor may do as much as the Rich, the Low as much as the High, the Young as much as the Old; all Ages, Sexes and Ranks may here unite
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004621_0014_100DAD6229CADE28"/>
in their ſincere Endeavours to engage the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the King of Glory here, whoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence will be its greateſt Ornament and Glory.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>From what has been ſaid we learn, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Houſe in outward reſpects, be much more beautiful &amp; glorious than the former Houſe, in which we and our Fathers before us, were wont to Worſhip God, Yet unleſs Chriſt's Preſence be with us in this, it will be far leſs glorious than that.</hi> It doubtleſs affects us with ſome degree of pleaſure &amp; ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to ſee how much this latter Houſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the former in External beauty &amp; glory; and may ſerve to wipe off the Reproach which ſome have been ready to caſt upon us, <hi>As Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the Law more than the Goſpel;</hi> by reaſon of the decayed and ruinous ſtate in which the Houſe of God for a long time lay. But yet if Chriſt be not with us here, the glory of this Houſe will be far leſs than the glory of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: For we have heard with our Ears and our Fathers have told us, how Chriſt was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly Preſent with them there. Tho' they built that Houſe in troublous times, When labouring under the preſſing difficulties that a howling Wilderneſs expoſed them to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when encompaſſed with numerous &amp; barbarous Enemies: Yet there they found Chriſt was with them in his Houſe and Ordinances, and in thoſe Eminent Lights that ſhone among them, whoſe Praiſe is yet in the Churches. It ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004621_0014_100DAD6229CADE28"/>
be our ambition and care, above all things to Engage the Preſence of Chriſt with us here, as it was with them; leſt it be ſaid, <hi>That the glory of the former Houſe was greater than that of the latter.</hi>
