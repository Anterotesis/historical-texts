            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THREE years have now almoſt elapſed ſince I publiſhed an account of the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made with the nitrous fumigation on board the Union hoſpital ſhip, and of the ſimilar trials made at the ſame time on board ſome ſhips of the Ruſſian ſquadron.</p>
            <p>The accurate and candid narrative of this buſineſs, given by thoſe gentlemen, who undertook the conducting it, proved in the cleareſt and moſt unequivocal manner, to every unbiaſſed mind, not only the power of the nitrous vapour in deſtroying contagion, but the ſafety with which it might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: ſuch, however, is the force of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, as to render doubtful even the evidence of our ſenſes. A conſiderable increaſe in the number of deaths, amongſt the Ruſſians, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:036328_0007_1008E3532776A940"/>
in the month of January, a rumour was immediately propagated that this mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity was occaſioned by the nitrous fumigation, which, though it might ſeem harmleſs in the beginning, poſſeſſed ſome latent deleterious quality that in the end proved fatal.</p>
            <p>Hearing of this by accident, and knowing how difficult it is to remove impreſſions that have once laid hold of the public mind, I made application to Lord Spencer, and to the other Lords Commiſſioners of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, requeſting that they would have the goodneſs to appoint proper perſons to inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate this matter fully, and to report to their Lordſhips the reſult of their inquiry. My requeſt was complied with, and the report of thoſe gentlemen proved in the moſt ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory manner, that the rumour was a direct miſrepreſentation of the fact; that the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality amongſt the Ruſſians was owing to different cauſes unconnected with the fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; that thoſe who had been longeſt
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:036328_0008_1008EC32CCEAD2E0"/>
expoſed to it enjoyed the beſt health; and that not a ſingle inſtance could be adduced of any bad conſequence which could fairly be imputed to the nitrous vapour, during the three months it had been employed.</p>
            <p>This objection being removed, another ſtill preſented itſelf. It had been ſaid, and ſaid with truth, that the vitriolic acid, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrated ſtate (commonly called oil of vitriol) was a dangerous article to be taken on board of ſhip, as there had been inſtances of ſhips ſet on fire by it; and that this accident actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally happened to two tranſports of Admiral Chriſtian's ſquadron. The fact could not be denied; but the ſame objection applied, and with ſtill greater force, to the uſe of fire, of gun-powder, and of ardent ſpirits; all of which are, without doubt, extremely hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the hands of ignorance or of raſhneſs; but which, when their effects are known, with the proper means of obviating them, may be employed with as much ſafety as air or water.
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:036328_0009_1008EC3459C8B540"/>
To do away, however, every poſſible objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this head, I had proper caſes made, one for the mineral acids, and another for the purified nitre, with the inſtruments neceſſary for the fumigation. The mineral acids were firſt put into ſtrong glaſs bottles, fitted with ground glaſs ſtoppers, ſecured with wire; theſe were placed in a caſe lined with copper covered with an amalgama of tin and lead, with diviſions of the ſame; the interſtices of the diviſions were afterwards filled up with ſaw-duſt: by this means the bottles were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from breaking, and even if that ſhould happen, the acids could not eſcape, nor affect the lining of the caſe; ſo that every danger which could poſſibly ariſe was completely foreſeen and prevented. A caſe ſimilar to the former, but entirely of wood, with diviſions of the ſame, was made for holding the nitre: the nitre was put into four ſtone or earthen jars, adapted to four diviſions in the caſe, which had a fifth diviſion alſo, the whole
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:036328_0010_1008EC364C92FE80"/>
width of the caſe, for containing the pipkins, cups, meaſures, and other inſtruments neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the fumigation. Theſe caſes I ſent to the Admiralty for the inſpection of their Lordſhips, and as they met with their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, their Lordſhips ordered ſimilar caſes to be made and ſent on board every ſhip in his Majeſty's ſervice; and that the materials neceſſary for the nitrous fumigation ſhould be ſent alſo to the different naval hoſpitals and priſons. I need hardly add, that the greater part of the experiments and trials which I have now the honour to lay before the public, are the reſult of this order of the Lords Commiſſioners of the Admiralty.</p>
            <p>Many of thoſe communications have been ſent to me, as will preſently appear, by the Board for ſick and wounded ſeamen; but for ſeveral, by far the moſt important, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the friendſhip of Dr. Johnſton, one of the Commiſſioners of that Board, a gentleman whoſe humanity and active zeal in
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:036328_0011_1008EC37D801FB18"/>
the ſervice of his country are well known, and whoſe character ſtands too high in the public opinion to receive any addition from my praiſe. He was fortunately one of the extra-Commiſſioners at Portſmouth, when ſome of the firſt trials were made with the nitrous fumigation, and from the happy effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by it, became a warm advocate in its behalf; a circumſtance which firſt introduced me to the honour of his acquaintance.</p>
            <p>As for the gentlemen themſelves who have made the trials with the nitrous fumigation, I ſhall only obſerve, that they cannot be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, in the reports or opinions they have delivered on this ſubject, to have been influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by any partiality to me; as, excepting Captain Lane of the navy, I had not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſlighteſt acquaintance with any of them; and ſeveral, though they had heard of the experiment on board the Union, had never read a word I had written on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. It appears, however, very evident from
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:036328_0012_1008EC3CE02A5830"/>
their letters, that there are amongſt them men of obſervation and experience, and if we may judge from the important ſtations in which ſome of them are placed, they are men of high and reſpectable characters in the ſervice. Reſpecting their obſervations, I may fairly ſay, that in general, they carry with them the internal evidence of truth. But I ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this ſubject more particularly, after having preſented the public with the letters and communications of the authors.</p>
            <p>Of the Introduction I have only to remark, that it contains thoſe general obſervations on the jail and other putrid contagions, with the uſual means of obviating theſe, formerly publiſhed in the Treatiſe on the Fever at Wincheſter; and now republiſhed, from a wiſh to make them more generally known, eſpecially to thoſe perſons who are likely to be placed in ſimilar ſituations, or engaged in ſimilar enterpriſes. It does not fall to the lot of every ſurgeon, or even phyſician, to the
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:036328_0013_1008EC3E6BDE4D08"/>
navy or army, to have turned his attention to this ſubject in the manner I have done, nor to have had the ſame means or opportunity of information. The chief object of my life has been to render my profeſſion, and the exerciſe of it as beneficial as poſſible to mankind; my endeavours, however, to bring to perfection, and into general uſe, the preſent diſcovery, have been chiefly animated, and I am not aſhamed to confeſs it, by the deſire of render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an important ſervice to my country. She, as the great maritime power in Europe, is the moſt likely to derive, and I flatter myſelf, will derive the moſt eſſential benefit from my labours.</p>

               <head>Reſpecting the Nature of the Contagion, which gives riſe to the Jail or Hoſpital Fever.</head>
               <p>THAT we may be able to form a more accurate judgment of the nature of the contagion, which gives riſe to this ſpecies of fever, we ſhall examine it in four different points of view.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, how it is generated; 2dly, in what manner it is propagated, with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances more or leſs favourable to its communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; 3dly, its effects on the human body; and, 4thly, the means of weakening its virulence or of entirely deſtroying it.</p>
               <p>Whoever has conſidered contagious fevers with that attention which the importance of the ſubject demands, muſt have obſerved, that they are of two very diſtinct kinds or<note n="*" place="bottom">This diſtinction ſeems ſo extremely obvious, that we ſhould hardly ſuppoſe it could eſcape the obſervation of any one who had at all reflected on the ſubject, and yet I do not know any medical writer who has made it</note> claſſes. The firſt may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough be called <hi>ſpecific contagions,</hi> as they do not ariſe from any general quality, or proceſs of nature, with which we are acquainted; and, as they have a peculiar origin, they excite diſeaſes of a peculiar kind; differing in many reſpects from every other, but in nothing more remarkably, than in this, that the peculiar diſeaſe can only take place once in any individual: and there are ſome perſons,

in whom this contagion never can produce any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid ſymptom. The number of thoſe peculiar or ſpecific poiſons is not yet aſcertained; but the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox and meaſles are evidently ſuch to man, and there are others peculiar to certain animals.</p>
               <p>The ſecond claſs of contagious fevers, may be named <hi>general contagions,</hi> as they ariſe from a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe; or they may be named <hi>putrid,</hi> as they will be found, in every inſtance, to be the reſult of putrefaction, one of thoſe general fermentative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, to which water as well as all vegetable and animal ſubſtances, under certain circumſtances, are liable. That the contagion, or miaſma, of the jail or hoſpital fever derives its origin from this ſource, admits of every ſpecies of evidence which a matter of fact and of obſervation can do.</p>
               <p>It is well known, that this diſeaſe is conſtantly produced where a number of people are ſhut up together in a cloſe place, without the greateſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to cleanlineſs, and a renewal of air. That all the excretions of the human body have made a certain advance or progreſs towards putridity, and when placed in circumſtances favourable to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſoon become highly putrid. That of all the human excretions, none is more highly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſed, or more ſuſceptible of becoming putrid, than the perſpiration or vapour iſſuing from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the body and lungs. That even the perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of vegetables, confined under ſimilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, becomes putrid, and in a high degree noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to man: <hi>a fortiori</hi> then, we may conclude, that animal perſpiration will more quickly undergo a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar alteration, and muſt prove ſtill more noxious.</p>
               <p>We obſerve, that the contagion, reſulting from animal perſpiration, ſhews its baneful effects more ſuddenly, and more forcibly, in proportion to its
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036328_0020_1008EC4C35E49D98"/>
quantity, and to its being placed in circumſtances the moſt favourable to putrefaction; conſequently, in proportion to the ſize and cloſeneſs of the place, the temperature<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been alledged in objection to this, that the jail fever is more frequent in our priſons in winter than in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The fact I can neither confirm nor deny, but admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in its fulleſt extent, it by no means invalidates the opinion I have endeavoured to eſtabliſh. The cold of our winters is ſeldom ſo ſevere, at leaſt for any length of time, as to freeze the moiſture of the atmoſphere, eſpecially with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-doors, and therefore, I run no riſk of contradiction, when I affirm, that in general, the moiſture or water diffuſed in the atmoſphere, is much greater during the winter, than during the ſummer months; but the cold, though not in general ſufficient to dry the air, is ſufficient for thoſe confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the cells of priſons to endeavour to exclude it, although by excluding it, they muſt prevent the renewal of the air, and breathe more their own baneful atmoſphere. Cold has alſo the effect of making people in their ſituation, leſs atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to cleanlineſs, and of inducing lazineſs and debility; all of which circumſtances, when taken into the account, will be ſound greatly to counterbalance the difference of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature.</note> and moiſture of the air, and the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or acceſſory putrid matter with which it is combined.</p>
               <p>We obſerve, likewiſe, that the formation of this contagion is prevented by cauſes that renew the air, and carry off the perſpiration, or prevent its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to putrefaction.</p>
               <p>And, it may be mentioned as an analogical proof, that a contagious vapour, differing only in degree of virulence from the human miaſmata, is conſtantly produced from water alone, or from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mixed with vegetable and animal matters, when expoſed in ſufficient quantity and under circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces favourable to putridity; but the ſeptic nature of the jail contagion will be farther illuſtrated, by what we have to notice of its effects on the human

               <head>Of the Manner in which Contagion is communicated.</head>
               <p>EVERY perſon knows that contagious fevers, whether <hi>ſpecific</hi> or <hi>putrid,</hi> are uſually propagated by an immediate communication with the ſick, either by contact or contiguity. How far the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious atmoſphere extends, is impoſſible to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as this muſt admit of <hi>conſiderable</hi> latitude<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſubject the reader will find treated more fully in two Letters addreſſed to Dr. Percival, of Mancheſter.</note>, according to the virulence of the diſeaſe, ſituation of the ſick, ſeaſon of the year, ſtate of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, &amp;c. My ingenious and reſpectable friend Dr. Haygarth is of opinion, and indeed has ſhewn, that in the ſmall-pox it is much more limited than was apprehended. But it is not only from a direct communication with the ſick that contagious fevers are propagated; unfortunately, the perſons and clothes of thoſe who remain long in a contagious atmoſphere, and the excretions of the ſick, are capable (even when conveyed to a great diſtance, or preſerved for a length of time) of producing the ſame miſchief as an immediate communication with the ſick themſelves. Of this fact the examples are ſo numerous as to put the matter beyond the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a doubt. Here again, the opinion of my friend Dr. Haygarth differs from the opinions formerly entertained by phyſicians. For, though he admits, that the variolous matter, and the more ſenſible excretions of the ſick, are capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the diſeaſe, and, if cloſe ſhut up, of retaining that power for a long time, he does not think, that the contagious vapour, immediately
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036328_0022_1008EC5135FEB548"/>
ariſing from the ſick, can be retained by the clothes of thoſe confined in the variolous atmoſphere, or by the furniture in the chambers of the ſick, ſo as to communicate the diſeaſe to ſuch as have not themſelves been immediately expoſed to it. No one can have a greater reſpect for the opinions and obſervations of Dr. Haygarth than I have, as no perſon is better acquainted with his candour and accuracy. I readily agree with him, that the dread of thoſe terrible diſeaſes, and the natural fears of men, have poſſibly magnified the danger beyond reality; that the riſk of propagating the contagion in this manner is by no means ſo great as had been ſuppoſed; and that phyſicians, or even apothecaries, are ſeldom ſo long expoſed to this atmoſphere, as to be in great danger of conveying the contagion elſewhere; but I cannot go ſo far as to believe that the perſons, and eſpecially the clothes of nurſes or aſſiſtants, who are conſtantly confined in the chambers of the ſick, ſometimes not very well ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated, will not imbibe the contagious vapour to ſuch a degree, as to be capable of communicating it, eſpecially where they have a direct or immediate intercourſe with a perſon ſuſceptible of the diſeaſe. But, putting the ſmall-pox and other <hi>ſpecific conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> out of the queſtion, that the jail diſtemper and other <hi>putrid contagions</hi> are frequently conveyed in this manner, cannot be denied. Indeed, wherever a vapour can be diſtinguiſhed by the ſmell, we have the demonſtration of our ſenſes for what a length of time, not only clothes, but furniture, and even the boards and walls of houſes will retain it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in reſpect to the contagion of the jail or hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital fever, we may ſafely affirm, that it affects not only thoſe who are immediately expoſed to the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal atmoſphere, but that this contagion may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be communicated by the clothes of perſons
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036328_0023_1008EC52C6296098"/>
who have for any length of time been confined in it; and, what is ſtill more ſurpriſing, even when the perſons themſelves have ſuffered no injury, nor had any diſeaſe in conſequence of ſuch expoſure.</p>
               <p>This fact being aſcertained, we cannot wonder if thoſe who are ſeized with the jail fever, owing to ſuch communication, ſhould during their illneſs generate a contagious vapour; but, however para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical it may appear, I have never obſerved that the ſick propagated the diſeaſe ſo readily, as the bodies and clothes of thoſe who, though well, had been long confined in the original atmoſphere. From my own experience alſo, I am led to conclude, that there is little riſk of receiving the contagion from dead bodies, even from diſſecting them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the ſurgeon does not cut himſelf during the diſſection, the conſequence of which has generally proved fatal.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other circumſtances, worthy of notice, that increaſe or diminiſh the facility with which contagion is communicated. Unleſs where contagion is very powerful, it is ſeldom propagated in the open air; I knew only one inſtance of this at Wincheſter. It is much more certainly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in a room, and eſpecially if there is a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of air, from the contagious perſon to others capable of being affected. A moiſt atmoſphere<note n="*" place="bottom">Moiſture appears not only neceſſary to the production of putrid contagion, but it would ſeem to be the medium alſo by which it is communicated; it is well known, that the plague ceaſes, in Syria and Egypt, during the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of certain drying winds; and its almoſt entirely diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing during the winter, at Moſcow, was probably owing to the ſame cauſe; <abbr>viz.</abbr> the dryneſs of the atmoſphere.</note> is alſo more favourable to the communication of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion than a dry one. A contagious perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes greatly more ſo, if his clothes are wet, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036328_0024_1008EC55A52EE008"/>
his body heated by exerciſe, ſo as to be in a ſtate of perſpiration. Thoſe moſt ſuſceptible of contagion are, young perſons, particularly if they come di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from a pure air into the infected atmoſphere; perſons whoſe minds are oppreſſed with fear or anxiety; or who have been weakened by previous illneſs; even thoſe who have been fatigued, or are faſting, more readily than others whoſe ſtrength has not been impaired, or which has been again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited with food. It has been farther remarked, that perſons who have iſſues are ſeldom affected by contagion.</p>

               <head>Of the Effects of putrid Contagion on the human Body.</head>
               <p>PUTRID matter, in whatever way generated, if in ſufficient quantity, has always ſome deleterious effect; or, in other words, acts as a poiſon upon the body. It is true, that the human ſtomach, and ſtill more remarkably, the organs of digeſtion of certain animals, have the power of counteracting the ſeptic tendency; but this power, in our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs at leaſt, is very limited; and when any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whether generated in the body or introduced from without, has acquired a degree of putridity beyond this, it occaſions nauſea, vomiting, purging, great oppreſſion at the region of the ſtomach, and often a fever, either of the intermittent, remittent, or more continued kind. Putrid matter, directly introduced into the ſyſtem by means of a wound, cauſes ſwelling and inflammation of the lymphatic glands, often terminating ſuddenly in gangrene, along with the ſymptoms of a fever, greatly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the hoſpital or jail fever: the ſame proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrength, tremors, anxiety, headach, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036328_0025_1008EC5755623A58"/>
delirium; with the ſame irregularity in the pulſe, and, if the diſeaſe continues, it induces thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of the ſkin, hemorrhages, and other ſymptoms, that indicate a relaxation of the ſolids, and reſolved craſis of the blood. The fevers that ariſe in conſequence of expoſure to putrid vapour or contagion, aſſume a variety of types and forms, according to the various circumſtances of combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, degree of putridity, ſeaſon of the year, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the patient, &amp;c. But they, as well as the preceding, will be found to have many ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in common, and ſimilar to the jail and hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fever: and in reality all the fevers of this claſs, from the ſlighteſt vernal intermittent to the true plague, are in my opinion only different ſhades or varieties of the ſame diſeaſe, and productions of one common cauſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> putrefaction. I ſhall not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, proſecute this ſubject farther at preſent, as I have treated it more fully in another work, which, ſhould I hereafter have leiſure to complete, I hope to render not altogether unworthy of the public eye.</p>
               <p>The contagion then of the jail or hoſpital fever, may juſtly be conſidered as one of the moſt ſubtil and powerful vapours of the putrid kind; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, its immediate and deſtructive effects upon the body, are not to be wondered at. In ordinary caſes of fever, the vital principle is rouſed into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Nature is commonly ſufficient of herſelf to remove the morbid cauſe; but here, as in the real peſtilence, the contagion introduced into the body, ſeems to act as a narcotic poiſon upon the heart and nervous ſyſtem, ſuppreſſing the principle of life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of rouſing it to the conflict. In this diſtemper therefore, where nature can do ſo little, and even art, unleſs immediately called to her aſſiſtance, is equally unavailing, it is of the moſt conſequence for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036328_0026_1008EC5D2966F7F0"/>
us to know whether the contagion cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or deſtroyed.</p>

                  </gap> destroying the Jail Contagion.</head>
               <p>As we are perfectly acquainted with the cauſes of the jail contagion, we could certainly prevent its formation, provided the means of doing ſo were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in our power; but as we cannot command theſe, our next object is to endeavour to correct, or deſtroy it, when formed. As a knowledge of the nature and origin of the jail contagion naturally led to the proper and effectual means of correcting or deſtroying it, ſo, on the other hand, the means that have been ſucceſsfully employed to deſtroy it, afford the moſt convincing evidence of its true nature.</p>
               <p>The various means hitherto employed for deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contagion, may be arranged under two diſtinct heads, or claſſes, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Phyſical and the Chemical.</p>
               <p>All contagions, whether ſpecific or putrid, are either checked or completely deſtroyed, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of heat and cold; and from a free expoſure to air and water, are ſo diluted or diſſolved, as to loſe their noxious quality. Heat and cold then, with air and water, may be looked upon as phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal agents, which, under certain circumſtances, are effectual in blunting or deſtroying contagion. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat, nearly that of an oven, is found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the complete deſtruction of contagion, but as this degree of heat is incompatible with ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life,<note n="*" place="bottom">A great heat, like that of an oven, ſuch as would prove deſtructive to all animal life, effectually deſtroys this infection in all ſubſtances which can be for ſome time expoſed to it. Vide Lind's Obſervations on the Jail Diſtemper, Ann. 1779</note> its application is ſolely confined to the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036328_0027_1008EC5EE8C6ACC8"/>
purifying of ſuch clothes, furniture, &amp;c. as cannot be injured by this treatment. But, although the degree of heat requiſite for the complete deſtruction of contagion can only be uſed for one particular purpoſe, heat and fire, judiciouſly managed, may, in various ways tend to leſſen the power, or to check the progreſs of this pernicious vapour: for as cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dampneſs are favourable to the production and ſpreading of contagion, drying and rarefying the air, by counteracting theſe, muſt, ſo far at leaſt, be proper antidotes. But, independent of thoſe effects of heat, an open fire, eſpecially where the fuel is burnt in a narrow flue, is of great benefit; for, by conſuming a portion of the air; it cauſes a more ſenſible renewal of it, and, in fact, is one of the beſt ventilators. In employing fire and heat, however, care muſt be taken not to increaſe the heat in the apartments of the ſick, as this would prove more hurtful to them, than the drying or renewing of the air could be advantageous.</p>
               <p>The degree of cold neceſſary to deſtroy contagion is probably, like the degree of heat, inconſiſtent with life; and, therefore, although we hear of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion having been checked or ſuppreſſed by cold, there are few inſtances, if any, of its being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely deſtroyed. Beſides, as it is not in our power to employ cold at pleaſure, the queſtion reſpecting its effect, of whatever importance it may be to the pathologiſt, is of little conſequence to the practical phyſician.</p>
               <p>That noxious vapours are hurtful only when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrated, and are harmleſs when diffuſed, are facts or data univerſally admitted; and it is upon this principle, that clothes, bedding, or other matters to which contagion adheres, are purified, or loſe their deleterious quality, by expoſure for a ſufficient
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036328_0028_1008EC608A7FE1A8"/>
length of time to the open air, or to a current of water; but, as the time requiſite for this mode of purification is uncertain, and as contagious clothes, goods, &amp;c. cannot always be expoſed in a proper manner,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Lind has very juſtly remarked, that no ventilation or admiſſion of air into priſons or hoſpitals, can remove or deſtroy contagion when once it is preſent. The ſame may be ſaid of water. But though neither one nor the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe circumſtances can deſtroy contagion, both may be uſefully employed in blunting its force, and in preventing the ſpreading of the diſeaſe.</note> we are commonly under the neceſſity of having recourſe to thoſe more expeditious means of purification which chemiſtry affords, and which I ſhall next examine.</p>

kingdom, the effect of which in deſtroying conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has been long eſtabliſhed; but as it affects, even in ſmall quantity, the reſpiration of animals, inducing ſuffocation and death, it can only be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for fumigating clothes, furniture, or empty apartments. When burnt with charcoal, in the common way, we obtain not only the ſulphureous acid, but alſo the carbonic, or fixed air, which, though it can have little influence on contagion, renders the common air leſs fit for reſpiration; a circumſtance hardly deſerving attention where the ſulphur is burnt in a fumigating room, or a place ſet apart expreſsly for the purpoſe of fumigation, but which is of great importance when ſulphur is burnt between the decks of ſhips, or in hoſpital or priſon wards, where men are ſoon afterwards to be lodged. The occaſional addition of arſenic ſeems to have been made by Dr. Lind, with a view of increaſing the deleterious<note n="*" place="bottom">It was an old and very generally received opinion, that contagious diſeaſes, as well as ſome infections, were cauſed by inſects, and therefore Dr. Lind might think, that the moſt deleterious vapour would prove the moſt effectual in deſtroying contagion.</note> quality of the vapour; but it appears unneceſſary, as the ſulphureous acid is of itſelf ſufficiently powerful for deſtroying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion; beſides, I doubt much, if the vapour of arſenic is not too heavy to riſe with the acid of ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036328_0030_1008EC68BAC6D060"/>
obtain, by deflagrating nitre, a portion of nitrous acid, as well as the dephlogiſticated nitrous air or oxygene; but a farther acquaintance with chemiſtry convinced me of my miſtake, and that the deflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nitre never produced any nitrous acid. It is therefore evident, that deflagrating nitre in the priſon and hoſpital wards at Wincheſter, could have no effect in deſtroying contagion, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effect in purifying them, but ſo far as it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed a quantity of oxygene, or air much purer than the common air of the atmoſphere.</p>

I might perhaps remark that ſome of theſe examples he had from perſons who were not ſuch accurate obſervers as himſelf; I ſhall not however call them in queſtion, as I think the advantage ſuppoſed to be immediately derived from the ſmoke of wood, may fairly be aſcribed to other cauſes. In the firſt place, the ſmoke of wood conſiſts principally of ſoot, or of inflammable matter unconſumed, with ſome carbonic acid, neither of which can have any effect on contagion; whilſt the ligneous acid is in very ſmall quantity, too ſmall certainly to be of much ſervice. But we know, that where there is ſmoke there is heat, and that where there is much ſmoke, in places where people are preſent, a free admiſſion muſt be given to the air; two circumſtances which have conſiderable influence in weakening the viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and in preventing the ſpreading of contagion.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036328_0033_1008EC70E699CE30"/>
though I believe it to be one of the moſt trifling means that has ever yet been employed. I have never once obſerved the ſmalleſt benefit from its uſe; and have known many fatal examples of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion having been communicated where it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly employed. But although the ſteam of boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vinegar can be of no advantage in deſtroying contagion, yet, as the ſmell of it is grateful to the ſick, it may for that reaſon be uſed about their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and when camphire is diſſolved in it, the ſmell is ſtill more agreeable and reviving.</p>
               <p>Waſhing the furniture, floors, walls, &amp;c. with vinegar, I conſider as little better than waſhing them with ſimple water. The ſame may be ſaid of white-waſhing, as the lime and ſize can have no particular effect. Oil painting, another mode of purifying apartments, has little advantage over the preceding; not to mention the expenſe and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience attending it.</p>
               <p>But enough has been ſaid to ſhew the general want of chemical knowledge, apparent in all the methods hitherto propoſed for deſtroying contagion, and more eſpecially, the inefficacy of the methods employed in places and ſituations from which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not be removed; I ſhall now proceed to a more agreeable taſk, and explain thoſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which a more accurate chemiſtry, and a long attention to the ſubject, have ſuggeſted to me, and relate ſome experiments which I made, with a view to aſcertain the efficacy of the nitrous acid, and the ſafety with which it may be uſed, where people are neceſſarily preſent.</p>
               <p>The mineral acids, particularly when in a ſtate of vapour, with the different gaſes or permanently elaſtic fluids produced by them, are probably, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting fire, the moſt powerful agents in nature,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036328_0034_1008EC74D289F4D8"/>
and the ſource of an infinite number of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forms of matter obſervable in the mineral king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and which are conſtantly undergoing freſh changes, from their various combinations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſitions. But their power is not confined to the mineral kingdom; they are known to have great influence likewiſe over putrefaction, and thoſe other ſpontaneous changes which vegetable and animal matter, deprived of life, undergoes; and therefore, if the jail contagion, as I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prove, is a vapour produced by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, there cannot be a doubt that the mineral acids will prove effectual in deſtroying it. So far we may reaſon <hi>a priori;</hi> but let us next conſult ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, a leſs fallible guide. From this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the volatile vitriolic or ſulphureous acid, the only one hitherto made uſe of, proves effectual in deſtroying contagion; although owing to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leterious quality, it cannot be employed, except in ſituations from which people can be removed. But, are the other mineral acids in a ſtate of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour equally dangerous with the ſulphureous? and, are they equally effectual in deſtroying contagion? To the firſt of theſe queſtions I can give a poſitive anſwer; to the ſecond I can give one that, at leaſt, is highly probable.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I can ſafely affirm, that the nitrous acid may be employed in very great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without riſk, and even without the ſmalleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience; and, that it is effectual for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of contagion, I have every reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not only from analogy, but from experience. I had frequently uſed the nitrous acid, as a fumiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in hoſpital wards, and in the private apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſick, without perceiving any unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant effect from it; but, to aſcertain with more
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036328_0035_1008EC7670D841D8"/>
preciſion a fact of this importance, I made the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing experiments; in the conducting of which, Mr. Hume of Long-acre, a very ingenious man, and an excellent chemiſt, was ſo obliging as to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me with his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>We put a mouſe, confined in a wire trap, under a glaſs cylindrical jar, capable of holding about 25 pints beer meaſure, or 881 cubic inches; the jar was inverted upon wet ſand, contained in a flat earthen trough or pan; it was then filled with the fumes of the ſmoking nitrous acid, introduced by means of a crooked glaſs tube, until the animal could not be very diſtinctly perceived. The mouſe was kept in this ſituation for a quarter of an hour, when the jar was removed, and the animal expoſed to the open air; it immediately ran about the wire trap, as uſual, and had not the appearance of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffered the ſlighteſt inconvenience from its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. After a few minutes, the mouſe was again put under the glaſs jar, which was now filled with the vapour of pure nitrous acid, detached from nitre by the vitriolic acid. It remained much about the ſame time as before, and when the jar was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, ſeemed perfectly well.</p>
               <p>We repeated the ſame experiments with a green-finch, only with ſome little variation in the manner. We placed, on a table covered with green baize, a brown earthen veſſel or pan, containing heated ſand; in this was put a glaſs ſaucer, with about half an ounce of ſtrong vitriolic acid; above which we placed the bird-cage, ſupported with ſome ſmall pieces of wood laid acroſs the pan; then, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a drachm or two of nitre, in powder, to the vitriolic acid, we covered the whole with the glaſs jar. The nitrous acid roſe in ſuch quantity, that, in a very little time, the bird ſeemed as if in a
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036328_0036_1008EC7A08C014F0"/>
cloud or fog. We kept it in this ſituation fifteen minutes, by which time the cloud had diſappeared, and the acid was in part condenſed on the ſide of the glaſs jar; during the whole time the bird nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther panted, nor appeared to ſuffer any uneaſineſs, from the atmoſphere in which it was confined. We made trial alſo of the marine acid, by adding common ſalt, inſtead of nitre, to heated vitriolic acid: during this experiment, the bird appeared to be, now and then, ſomewhat uneaſy, and opened its bill; but at the end of fifteen minutes, upon removing the jar, it hopped about as lively as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We then expoſed the bird to the fumes of ſulphur, burnt with an eighth part of nitre; it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gave ſigns of uneaſineſs, opened its bill, and ſeemed to pant for breath in ſuch a manner, that we were afraid to cover it with the glaſs jar. We likewiſe made trial, in the open air, of the ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ygenated marine acid;<note n="*" place="bottom">The oxygenated marine acid is a diſcovery of the famous Scheele, and has been recommended by Berthollet and Chaptal, two French chemiſts, for the purpoſe of bleaching. I am informed that it has alſo been lately uſed in France to deſtroy contagion, but the particular circumſtances, and manner of its application, I have not yet learnt.</note> for, as this is ſo extremely deleterious, we did not think it ſafe to expoſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the vapour of it in a room, nor did we venture to expoſe the bird to it in any other way but in the open air, and even there it appeared to ſuffer very much.</p>
               <p>Having made trial of the effect of the different mineral acids, in a ſtate of vapour, upon animals, we determined to render the experiment ſtill more concluſive, by trying what effect they would have on ourſelves. With this intention, we filled the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036328_0037_1008EC7D757FDCA0"/>
room<note n="*" place="bottom">The room in which we made the experiments was a ſmall parlour 13 feet by 10, and 8 feet high; or about 1040 cubic feet.</note> in which we were with the fumes of nitrous acid, (obtained by mixing nitre with heated vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic acid, in the manner already deſcribed) until the different objects became ſomewhat obſcure, by a kind of fog or miſt produced. The fire irons and ſteel fender, loſt their poliſh, and the vapour ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a bottle of aqua ammoniae purae, placed at ſome diſtance from the table, was evidently neutralized, as it iſſued from the bottle, by the vapour of the nitrous acid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hume and I remained in the room the whole time, without perceiving the ſlighteſt inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the fumes did not excite coughing, nor affect the eyes, in the way the ſmoke of wood commonly does, even when I held my head over the glaſs ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and breathed them immediately ariſing from it. We made trial likewiſe of the effect of the marine acid, which we found more pungent and ſtimulating than the nitrous; but, though it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited coughing, it did not cauſe that conſtriction of the windpipe, and tightneſs at the cheſt, with the ſenſe of ſuffocation, which is immediately induced by the volatile vitriolic or ſulphureous acid. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we were imprudent enough to try how far we could breathe this laſt, but I was inſtantly obliged to run to the window for air, from the ſenſe of conſtriction, and of ſuffocation, which it occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We likewiſe tried the effect of the mixed fumes of the marine and nitrous acid, a kind of volatile aqua regia, which we found more pungent than the marine acid by itſelf. As for the oxygen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated marine acid, perceiving the effect of it on the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036328_0038_1008EC7F07FEB508"/>
bird, and knowing how extremely dangerous it is, we did not venture to go very near it.</p>
               <p>From the preceding experiments, the different acid vapours, in reſpect to the ſafety with which they may be breathed, may be arranged in the following order:
<list>
                     <item>1ſt. The vapour of nitrous acid, ariſing from nitre decompoſed by vitriolic acid.</item>
                     <item>2. Ditto—of nitrous acid in its fuming ſtate, or when the nitric acid is mixed with nitrous gas.</item>

                     <item>6. Ditto—of ſulphur, burnt with charcoal.</item>
                     <item>7. Ditto—of oxygenated marine acid,<note n="*" place="bottom">The oxygenated marine acid is obtained, by diſtilling marine acid from manganeſe, but may alſo be procured in ſmall quantity, by putting manganeſe to heated marine acid, or by gradually adding a mixture of manganeſe and ſea-ſalt to heated vitriolic acid.</note> obtained by putting manganeſe to marine acid.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As the firſt vapour is perfectly harmleſs, in any quantity in which it may be required, it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt proper to be employed in all ſituations where people are neceſſarily preſent; and if it ſhould prove efficacious in deſtroying contagion, of which I have not the ſmalleſt doubt, it is the <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratum,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">A certain method therefore of deſtroying infection in places from whence perſons cannot be removed, is a <hi>deſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum</hi> not yet obtained in phyſic. I have propoſed and tried many things for this purpoſe without ſucceſs. Vide Lind's Obſervations on the Jail Diſtemper. Edit. publiſhed in Oct. 1779.</note> ſo much ſought after by Dr. Lind; but
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036328_0039_1008EC81DF15CB50"/>
which he confeſſes, with his uſual candour, he never could find out.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, though more pungent than the firſt, may I believe be employed with the greateſt ſafety; at leaſt, I have never obſerved any inconvenience from uſing it. But, as it cannot ſo eaſily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in conſiderable quantity, and is attended with greater inconvenience and expenſe, I have of late years only made uſe of the firſt.</p>
               <p>Our experiments likewiſe warrant us to affirm, that the third, or marine acid, though more ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, and more apt to excite coughing, than the nitrous, may be ſafely uſed, at leaſt in a moderate quantity, where people are preſent; and where ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre cannot be had, I ſhould have no heſitation in employing it.</p>
               <p>Of the fourth I can ſay but little, only that, in breathing it, I perceived it more pungent than the pure marine acid; and therefore, unleſs it ſhould be found to poſſeſs ſuperior efficacy in deſtroying contagion, I would not employ it where there are people preſent.</p>
               <p>As the fifth never can be uſed with ſafety where there are people preſent, its uſe muſt be ſolely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to fumigating empty apartments, clothes, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſixth ſhould never be employed, as the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonic acid may do harm, and never can have any effect on contagion.</p>
               <p>Of the ſeventh I have no particular knowledge, only that it is extremely deleterious, and I believe extremely powerful; but whether it has more effect
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036328_0040_1008EC8381C61DE8"/>
on contagion than the other mineral acids, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence only can determine.</p>
               <p>Having now fully proved that the nitrous, and poſſibly alſo the marine acid, obtained in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner already deſcribed, may be employed with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſafety in hoſpital and priſon wards, whilſt the people remain in them, I ſhall, in the next place, relate how far my experience goes to aſcertain the efficacy of thoſe acids in deſtroying contagion.</p>
               <p>From all the information I can procure, I do not find that any perſon had ever made uſe of the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous acid to deſtroy contagion but myſelf; for, as this acid is not produced by the deflagration of ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, or of gunpowder, the employment of theſe cannot be conſidered as an inſtance to the contrary. I formerly mentioned, that I had employed the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous acid in two different forms; either the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour ariſing from the yellow or ſmoking nitrous acid, which is a mixture of the acid with nitrous gas, or the more pure nitrous acid, detached from nitre, decompoſed by the vitriolic acid. In one or other of thoſe forms I have uſed it, both in hoſpitals and in private practice, for ſixteen or ſeventeen years paſt; and have had the ſatisfaction to obtain the moſt deciſive evidence of its happy effect, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the ſpreading, or farther communication of contagion.</p>
               <p>The moſt highly contagious fevers that occur in our hoſpitals, do not affect the patients in general lodged in the ſame ward, but only the nurſes, or thoſe patients who aſſiſt them, or thoſe who lie in the beds contiguous to the ſick; to ſuch perſons I have frequently ſeen the fever communicated, and have alſo repeatedly prevented the farther ſpreading of the diſeaſe, by placing gallipots, with the fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nitrous acid, between the beds of the ſick and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036328_0041_1008EC8795E9F470"/>
of thoſe who were not yet affected by the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And, in private practice, I can declare with truth, that where the nitrous acid has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſed as a fumigation, I have not known an inſtance of a contagious fever having been commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, even to a nurſe or an attendant.</p>
               <p>Theſe facts will, undoubtedly, be allowed to be very ſtrong evidence, with reſpect to the power of the nitrous acid to deſtroy contagion; ſtill, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they are liable to ſome uncertainty, and I will freely confeſs, that the effect of the nitrous acid, for this purpoſe, cannot be ſaid to be fully proved, until it has been tried in fumigating tainted clothes, &amp;c. and until its power has been found ſufficient to deſtroy contagion on board of ſhips, and in priſons and hoſpitals, where it exiſts in a much higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than I have had occaſion to ſee it, excepting at Wincheſter.</p>
               <p>It will probably be aſked, why I did not make a complete trial of it there? To this I anſwer, that with reſpect to fumigating infected clothes, bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp;c. I did not think myſelf warranted, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on an occaſion of ſo much importance, to make trial of an uncertain remedy, when a certain one was in my power. As to fumigating the priſon and hoſpital wards, it was evidently my intention to have employed the nitrous acid, but I was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the means I took to procure it, and have not ſince had a proper opportunity of repeating the experiment.</p>
               <p>The effect of the marine acid, in a ſtate of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, on contagion, I have not yet had occaſion to try, but have no doubt that it will be found of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient efficacy for deſtroying it; and, from the foregoing experiments, it is evident that, though not ſo mild or ſafe as the nitrous acid, it may be
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036328_0042_1008EC8B74897298"/>
uſed, in a moderate quantity, even where people are preſent. The only purpoſe to which I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it, has been, when properly diluted, to waſh the hammock poſts, bedſteads, and furniture; alſo the floors, and walls, of the apartments of the ſick:<note n="*" place="bottom">The waſhing the hammock poſts, walls, and floors of the priſon wards with the diluted marine acid, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of all clothes, bedding, &amp;c. proved completely effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual for deſtroying the contagion at Wincheſter; as it is now apparent, that the burning or deflagrating of nitre could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to the ſucceſs.</note> and I am perſuaded that, even in this way, it was extremely ſerviceable, certainly more powerful than the moſt concentrated vinegar.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now conclude this ſubject with a few prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical rules or obſervations, which may be looked upon as corollaries, or inductions, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding experiments.</p>
               <p>The well known efficacy of the ſulphureous acid, in deſtroying contagion, is a ſufficient reaſon for our continuing to uſe it as a fumigation for clothes, furniture, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The nitrous acid, being attended with no riſk or inconvenience to the reſpiration, and appearing, from our experience, of ſufficient efficacy to prevent the farther ſpreading of contagion, ſeems the proper antidote to be applied, in all ſituations where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are neceſſarily preſent, and is, in ſhort, the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideratum</hi> ſought after by the benevolent Dr. Lind.</p>
               <p>For purifying empty hoſpital or priſon wards, and ſhips, I ſhould alſo prefer the nitrous acid to the ſulphureous; as I believe it to be equally effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious; its vapour is more volatile and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and it does not leave the diſagreeable ſmell which ſulphur does. But, for this particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I think it would be adviſeable to make trial
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036328_0043_1008EC8D6D3B8F30"/>
alſo of the marine acid, and of the mixture of ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and marine acids, as I am convinced of the efficacy of all the mineral acids for deſtroying conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and our experience is not yet ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their relative advantages, and diſadvantages.</p>
               <p>To obtain the nitrous, or marine acid, in a ſtate of vapour, the method is extremely ſimple. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in decompoſing nitre, or common ſalt, by means of heated vitriolic acid, which may be done as follows:</p>
               <p>Put half an ounce<note n="*" place="bottom">As the quantity of vapour depends, in ſome meaſure, on the ſurface, I think it better to have the vitriolic acid put in a number of ſmall veſſels, than in one or two large ones; beſides, in this way, it has the advantage of being diffuſed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> in any given ſpace.</note> of vitriolic acid into a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or into a glaſs or china cup, or deep ſaucer; warm this over a lamp, or in heated ſand, adding to it from time to time ſome nitre or common ſalt: theſe veſſels ſhould be placed at twenty or thirty feet diſtance from each other, according to the height of the cieling, or virulence of the contagion. In hoſpitals, or priſons, the lamps, or veſſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining heated ſand, may be placed on the floor; on board of ſhips, it will be better to hang them to the cieling by waxed ſilk cords. The fumigating lamps, which I have ſeen at Moyſer's, in Greek-ſtreet, Soho, a great number of which I was told have been ſold to the navy, may be employed for this purpoſe; although they would anſwer much better, if the ſaucer was deeper, and if, inſtead of a place for a lamp, there was a box proper for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining hot ſand, in which the ſaucer might be placed.</p>
               <p>As fumigating with nitrous acid is attended with no inconvenience, and as the proceſs is ſo ſimple,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036328_0044_1008EC91A98C8920"/>
and the materials ſo cheap, it ſhould, as a means of prevention, be employed for ſome hours every day in tranſports having troops on board, and in crouded hoſpitals; and, if there is any appearance of contagion, the fumigation ſhould be executed with more care and attention, and the vapour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined for ſeveral hours at a time. Fumigating veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels or lamps, ſhould alſo be placed contiguous to the hammocks, or beds, of perſons affected with any contagious or putrid diſtemper, whether fever or dyſentery.</p>
               <p>By taking ſuch precautions, a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief would probably be prevented, and a ſtop put, in the beginning, to one of the moſt fatal calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<note n="*" place="bottom">The late dreadful mortality in the Weſt-India iſlands, occaſioned by a contagious fever imported from Boulam, has made too deep an impreſſion on the minds of the people of this country to be ſoon forgotten, and every exertion on the part of the executive government will no doubt be made to prevent a repetition of the ſame tragedy.</note> that ever afflicted mankind.</p>

               <p>This <hi>instruction,</hi> or <hi>memoire,</hi> is divided into three parts. The firſt related ſolely to the means of cleanlineſs; the ſecond to what are called the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical means; and the third to the chemical. The two firſt parts contain nothing new or intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the third is of the greateſt importance to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical ſcience, and particularly ſo to me, as it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes a proof of the accuracy of ſome of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding experiments, and is a complete confirmation of the opinions I have long entertained reſpecting the nature of contagion, and the power of the mineral acids to deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>The French phyſicians, inſtructed by that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent chemiſt <hi>Le Citoyen</hi> Guiton, better known by the name of Monſ. de Morveau, of Dijon, have lately made trial of the marine acid in their hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and have found it equally effectual in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contagion as the ſulphureous, and, as being more volatile, perhaps even preferable for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of purifying hoſpital wards. They alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked that, in a ſmaller proportion, it may be ſafely uſed in hoſpital wards, even when people are preſent.<note n="*" place="bottom">My experiments ſhewed the ſame thing.</note>. The French phyſicians however have
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036328_0046_1008EC95FA05BE98"/>
not employed the nitrous acid, nor made any trials of its effect on contagion; neither do they appear to have ſuſpected that the power of deſtroying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion was a quality inherent in all mineral acids; and probably, to a certain degree, in all acids, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der certain circumſtances. Although their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the effect of the marine acid, together with my obſervations on that of the nitrous, ſeems to eſtabliſh the fact beyond the cavil of ſcepticiſm it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Their method of obtaining the marine acid is the ſame that I took to procure the nitrous; they either employed the fuming marine acid, or the acid detached from its alkaline baſis by vitriolic acid, uſing a conſiderable degree of heat for that purpoſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader will find at the end an account of their proceſs.</note> They likewiſe, upon the ſuggeſtion of M. Fourcroy, recommend adding a ſmall quantity of the oxygenated marine acid; but, as they do not pretend to ſay that they have had any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſuperior efficacy of this, and as the common marine acid has been found to anſwer the purpoſe, I do not ſee any reaſon for making ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous an addition.</p>
               <p>Another chemical proceſs for purifying foul air in hoſpitals, recommended in this <hi>instruction,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our notice. It conſiſts in placing, at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſtances in the hoſpital wards, veſſels with lime water, for the purpoſe of abſorbing carbonic acid or fixed air. I am inclined, however, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that this advice is more the reſult of chemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal theory than of practical obſervation; for I do not ſuppoſe that carbonic acid is ever preſent, (where there is a free admittance of air,) in ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036328_0047_1008EC978C88D4F0"/>
quantity to prove hurtful; at leaſt, it can only affect the breathing, and has nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with contagious vapour.</p>
               <p>The French phyſicians appear to me to have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into a conſiderable miſtake on this ſubject, in taking the quantity of carbonic acid preſent,<note n="*" place="bottom">The method propoſed by the French phyſicians, for aſcertaining the quantity of carbonic acid preſent, is ſimple and ingenious. Take two phials; let one be filled with common water, the other with lime water. At the place where you want to try the purity of the air, empty the phial of common water, then, filling it half full with lime-water, and corking it, ſhake the phial for ſome time: the quantity of ſediment ſhews the proportion of carbonic acid. But, to render the preceding experiment concluſive, the height from the ground at which the air is taken ſhould be ſtated, otherwiſe we are liable to great fallacy.</note> in an hoſpital, as a teſt of the quantity or malignity of contagion, when, in reality, they are two things totally diſtinct from each other. The firſt, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonic acid, is a conſtituent part of the common or atmoſpheric air, which is greatly increaſed by the reſpiration of animals, and by burning candles, lamps, &amp;c. and, when in too great quantity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes flame, and animal life: the other has no relation with the compoſition of the atmoſphere, never affects reſpiration, but is produced by putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and excites fever.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE general opinion entertained of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in the high department, at the head of which you are placed, is the only apology I can offer for having taken the liberty to trouble you on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my late publication. The immediate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paid to this by your Lordſhip, and by the reſt of the Lords Commiſſioners of the Admiralty, is extremely flattering to me, as an individual, and claims my warmeſt gratitude; but it is of much more importance, my Lord, as holding out to the nation, a well grounded confidence, that no object which may be conducive to the public ſervice, or to the preſervation of thoſe brave men, the pride and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of their country, can long eſcape your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's notice. I have now the honor to lay before you, and the reſt of the Lord's Commiſſioners of the Admiralty, an account of the Experiment made
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036328_0052_1008ECA9DFEFCFD0"/>
on board the Union, at your Lordſhip's deſire, and likewiſe of thoſe trials that were made at the deſire of the Ruſſian Admiral, and with your Lordſhip's approbation, on board ſome ſhips of his ſquadron. I conſider myſelf, in executing this taſk, as only performing a duty I owe to your Lordſhip, and which I do with the greater pleaſure, as it may poſſibly be the means of making public a diſcovery which ſhould be univerſally known; and as the only way in my power to bring forward the merit of thoſe Gentlemen, to whoſe aſſiſtance I have been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly indebted for the fortunate iſſue of this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and from whoſe reports I am enabled to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent your Lordſhip with an account of the manner in which it was conducted, and of the particular ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it produced.</p>
            <p>Mr. Menzies, late Surgeon to his Majeſty's ſloop the Diſcovery, was the perſon who, at my requeſt, very obligingly undertook the management of the experiment on board the Union, and it is but doing him juſtice to ſay, that I could not have found a gentleman better qualified, in every reſpect, for executing ſo important a truſt. I ſhall therefore, my Lord, without farther preface, lay before you, and the reſt of their Lordſhips, Mr. Menzies's jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as affording a better deſcription of the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo long as he continued to conduct it, than any I can offer.</p>

            <head>REPORT OF THE EXPERIMENT FOR Stopping the Progreſs of Contagion, as executed on board the Union Hoſpital Ship, at Sheerneſs, by Mr. Arch. Menzies.</head>
            <p>DOCTOR James Carmichael Smyth having been requeſted, by the Lords Commiſſioners of the Admiralty, to ſend a perſon on board the Union Hoſpital Ship, laying at Sheerneſs, to make trial of the effect of a fumigation of the Nitrous Acid, and of other means recommended by him in a late publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, for deſtroying Contagion, I readily engaged, upon application being made to me by ſome of our common friends, in the execution of an experiment which I foreſaw might eventually be of much benefit to ſociety, and particularly to that ſervice, to which I have the honor to belong.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:036328_0054_1008ECB2939A8E00"/>
After having, therefore, received inſtructions, and obtained every neceſſary information on the manner of conducting the fumigation, I left London on the 24th of November, 1795, and arrived at Sheerneſs the ſame evening.</p>
            <p>Next morning I waited on Admiral Buckner, the commanding officer of the port, whoſe politeneſs and zeal to promote the object of my journey, were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſpicuous, and deſerves my moſt grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement.</p>
            <p>I afterwards went on board the Union, where I produced the orders of the Admiralty to Lieutenant Quarme, the commanding officer, and Mr. Baſſan, ſurgeon of the ſhip, who received me with cordiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and readily offered every aſſiſtance in their power to carry on the experiment, upon the event of which not only the ſafety of the ſhip's company, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, their own, in great meaſure, depended.</p>
            <p>On examining the ſtate of the hoſpital, I plainly foreſaw that freſh contagion would be daily pouring into it from the Ruſſian veſſels, under which diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous circumſtance, it would be difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide on the ſucceſs of our endeavours. The lower and middle gun-decks were divided into large apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or wards, by croſs partitions, with a free communication between each: they were extremely crouded, and the ſick of every deſcription lay in cradles, promiſcuouſly arranged, to the number of nearly two hundred; of which about one hundred and fifty were in different ſtages of a malignant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, extremely contagious, as appeared evident from its rapid progreſs, and fatal effects, amongſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants on the ſick, and the ſhip's company. For, from the beginning of September laſt, when the Ruſſian ſick were firſt admitted into the hoſpital; eight nurſes and two waſher-women had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:036328_0055_1008ECAE88F36990"/>
with this fever, and of theſe three had died. About twenty-four of the ſhip's company had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been ill of the ſame diſorder, and of theſe a ſurgeon's mate and two marines died. Upon the whole, however, the mortality had not been ſo great as there were reaſons to dread, from the virulence of the contagion, and malignity of the diſeaſe; which can only be aſcribed to the great care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Mr. Baſſan, ſurgeon to the hoſpital, whoſe conduct in ſo critical a ſituation does him the higheſt honor, and reflects luſtre on his profeſſional abilities, in the faithful diſcharge of ſo unpleaſant a duty.</p>
            <p>After I returned on ſhore from the Union, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the reſt of the day in collecting and ſending on board ſuch utenſils and materials as were requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for fumigating the ſhip; theſe conſiſted of a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of fine ſand, about two dozen quart earthen pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, and as many ſmall common tea-cups, together with ſome long ſlips of glaſs to be uſed as ſpatulas; the other materials I had brought with me from town, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the concentrated vitriolic acid, and a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of pure nitre in powder.</p>
            <p>On the forenoon of the twenty-ſixth, I went again on board the Union. I firſt ordered all the ports and ſcuttles to be cloſe ſhut up; the ſand, which had been previouſly heated in iron pots, was then ſcooped out into the pipkins by means of an iron ladle, and in this heated ſand, in each pipkin, a ſmall tea-cup was immerſed, containing about half an ounce of concentrated vitriolic acid, to which, after it had acquired a proper degree of heat, an equal quantity of pure nitre in powder was gradually added, and the mixture ſtirred with a glaſs ſpatula, until the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour aroſe from it in conſiderable quantity. The pipkins were then carried through the wards, by the nurſes and convaleſcents, who kept walking about
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036328_0056_1008ECB46A0FAF58"/>
with them in their hands, occaſionally putting them under the cradles of the ſick, and in every corner where any foul air was ſuſpected to lodge. In this manner we continued fumigating, until the whole ſpace between decks was, fore and aft, filled with the vapour, which appeared like a thick haze.</p>
            <p>I however proceeded in this firſt trial ſlowly and cautiouſly, following with my eyes the pipkins in every direction, to watch the effect of the vapour on the ſick, and obſerved that at firſt it excited a good deal of coughing, but which gradually ceaſed, in proportion as it became more generally diffuſed through the wards; this effect appeared indeed to be chiefly occaſioned by the ignorance or inattention of thoſe who carried the pipkins, in putting them ſometimes too near to the faces of the ſick, by which means they ſuddenly inhaled the ſtrong vapour, as it immediately iſſued from the cups.</p>
            <p>In compliance with Doctor Smyth's requeſt, the body-clothes and bed-clothes of the ſick were, as much as poſſible, expoſed to the nitrous vapour dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fumigation; and all the dirty linen removed from them was immediately immerſed in a tub of cold water, afterwards carried on deck, rinſed out, and hung up till nearly dry, and then fumigated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was taken to the waſh-houſe: a precaution extremely neceſſary in every infectious diſorder. Due attention was alſo paid to cleanlineſs and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation.</p>
            <p>As the people were at firſt very awkward and ſlow, it took us about three hours to fumigate the ſhip; in about an hour after, the vapour having entirely ſubſided, the ports and ſcuttles were thrown open, for the admiſſion of freſh air. I then walked through the wards, and plainly perceived that the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:036328_0057_1008ECB7474CFCF0"/>
air of the hoſpital was greatly ſweetened, even by this firſt fumigation.</p>
            <p>Next morning the ſhip was again fumigated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the lower deck, and the people employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being now better acquainted with the operation, were more expert, and finiſhed the whole in about an hour's time; in an hour afterwards, the vapour having entirely ſubſided, the freſh air was freely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the hoſpital.</p>
            <p>This day the ſand was made hotter, and the fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was of courſe much ſtronger, yet the patients ſuffered no other inconvenience from it than a little coughing, and even that was not near ſo general as the day before.</p>
            <p>Twelve pipkins were found ſufficient for fumigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lower deck, ten for the middle gun deck, two for the ſhip's company's bed-room, two for the marines' bed-room, and one for the waſhing place; in all twenty-ſeven pipkins. Conſequently, about fourteen ounces of the vitriolic acid, and as much nitre, were expended in the forenoon; but, in the evening, as every place was ſo cloſe, and the freſh air could not be afterwards ſo freely admitted, it was not thought neceſſary to employ ſo many pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins; ſo that little more than half the quantity of the fumigating materials uſed in the morning, was generally found ſufficient for the evening's fumiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The pleaſing and immediate effect of the fumiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in deſtroying the offenſive and diſagreeable ſmell ariſing from ſo many ſick crouded together, was now very perceptible, even to the nurſes and attendants. The conſequence of which was, that they now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to place ſome degree of confidence in its effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and approached the cradles of the infected with leſs dread of being attacked with the diſorder; ſo
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036328_0058_1008ECBA213115E8"/>
that the ſick were better attended, and the duty of the hoſpital was more regularly and more cheerfully performed. In ſhort, a pleaſing gleam of hope ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now to caſt its cheering influence, over that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſpondency which was before evidently pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in every countenance, from the dread and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror each individual naturally entertained of being, perhaps, the next victim to the malignant powers of a virulent contagion.</p>
            <p>On the twenty-eighth, the fumigation was repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed morning and evening, in the ſame manner as on the preceding day, and with the ſame pleaſing effect, deſtroying the offenſive ſmell, and purifying the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral air of the hoſpital. But there was, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places, a conſtant ſource of bad ſmell, which was not eaſily overcome, and which was occaſioned by the <hi>neceſſaries.</hi> Theſe were badly conſtructed, being placed within the ſhip, to the number of ſeven on the lower deck, and two on the middle deck, with ſmall funnels that pierced the ſides of the ſhip in a ſlanting direction, and generally retained the <hi>ſoil,</hi> unleſs where a perſon conſtantly attended to waſh it away, a very troubleſome and dangerous office, which chiefly fell to the lot of the nurſes, and doubtleſs tended to ſpread the contagion amongſt them.</p>
            <p>I mentioned this nuiſance to the commanding offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who told me that he viewed them in the ſame light, and that ſome alterations were making, which he hoped would remedy the evil. I therefore wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few days the event of theſe alterations, before I ſhould make any public report on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>For the following eight days I continued the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation on board the Union, regularly morning and evening, as already deſcribed, without obſerving any particular occurrence different from what is already

related, only that during this time, a conſiderable number of patients having been diſcharged from the hoſpital, all the ſpare cradles were ordered on deck, to be ſcrubbed and waſhed with the diluted marine acid, according to the particular directions of Dr. Smyth.</p>
            <p>On the ſeventh of December, I reſigned to Mr. Baſſan the further proſecution of the experiment on board the Union hoſpital ſhip, but before I leave her, I muſt ſay, that it has already produced the moſt evident and beneficial effects, as not one of the attendants on the ſick, nor any of the ſhip's company have been attacked with the diſorder ſince I began the fumigation, with the exception of one nurſe, who ſuffered a ſlight relapſe from ſome imprudence; an accident which Mr. Baſſan informs me was very frequent in the beginning. And as none of the ſick, who have been brought to the hoſpital ſince my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, have died, it would ſeem that the fumigation has not only leſſened the danger of infection, but alſo the malignity of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The proceſs of fumigating as already deſcribed, with the <hi>nitrous acid,</hi> is ſimple and eaſy, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the vapour is extremely powerful and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, the ſick of every deſcription were obſerved to bear it, with little or no apparent inconvenience, and to a much higher degree than I could have expected; and as it is found to purify the air from the diſagreeable effluvia, produced by ſo many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple crouded together in a confined ſituation, it will be peculiarly advantageous on board of ſickly ſhips, where the crew, their clothes, and the ſhip, may be fumigated at the ſame time without any riſk from fire.</p>

                        <p>On the ſixteenth of December, I again viſited the Union hoſpital ſhip, and found that the fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation had been hitherto carried on regularly twice a day, and with the ſame evident advantages, in purifying the air of the hoſpital, and leſſening the malignity of the diſorder, ſo that every nurſe and attendant on the ſick, went now cheerfully and confidently about their duty; without the leaſt dread or apprehenſion of the contagion, by which means the ſick were better taken care of, and the general ſtate of the hoſpital was in a much more proſperous way. It was therefore, from this time, deemed ſufficient to fumigate only once a day.</p>

                        <p>On viſiting the Union again on the twenty-third of December, I found the carpenters employed, from the dock yard, in making the alterations which I formerly propoſed in a letter to Dr. Carmichael Smyth, reſpecting the <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> and which I was happy to find, the Lords of the Admiralty bad ordered to be done upon his application.</p>
                        <p>My propoſal was to remove all the <hi>neceſſaries</hi> from the inſide, and have them rebuilt on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the ſhip, and by cutting down the lower edge of the ſame number of port-holes, to form entrances into them from the hoſpital, by which they would be equally eaſy of acceſs to the ſick, and the nuiſance would be totally removed. This I was happy to find the carpenters were now exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, and I am confident it will be attended with beneficial effects, by rendering the hoſpital much ſweeter, and conſequently more agreeable and healthy, both to the ſick and attendants.</p>

Mr. Menzies, as is already mentioned in his Journal, having, on the 7th of December, reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Mr. Baſſan, ſurgeon of the Union, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the experiment, I muſt refer your Lordſhip, for the further detail of this buſineſs, to extracts taken from his letters, ſome of which you have already ſeen, and which are now arranged according to the order of time in which they were written.</p>
            <p>Mr. Baſſan's conduct, my Lord, through the whole of this buſineſs, does him the higheſt honour, and cannot fail to recommend him to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's notice. When the contagion at firſt began to ſpread among the ſhip's company of the Union, he was importuned, by the warrant officers and others, to ſend them on ſhore to ſick quarters, which he peremptorily refuſed, ſaying, with the true ſpirit of a Britiſh ſailor: <q>It is better we ſhould all periſh, than have ſuch a contagious fever as this diſſeminated in our fleet.</q> He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly made application to the Commander in Chief, and not a man was ſent out of the ſhip. His humanity and care of the ſick, Mr. Menzies mentions in the warmeſt terms of praiſe, and his ſucceſsful treatment of them, is the beſt teſtimony of his profeſſional abilities. His zeal and attention, in conducting the experiment, I ſhall always recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect with gratitude. He and Mr. Menzies were both of them ſtrangers to me until this occaſion brought us acquainted; but I muſt ſay, that in the whole circle of my acquaintance, I could not have found two more liberal or candid men.</p>

                           <p>The fumigation is not attended with the ſmalleſt inconvenience to any one, the majority of patients being in bed when it is done, and all of them in the wards; the cabins of the nurſes, privies, &amp;c. are fumigated, as well as the apartments of the marines, and ſhip's company. For two months prior to the experiment, very few days elapſed without ſome of the attendants, or ſhip's company being ſeized with the fever; but ſince the 26th ultimo, the day on which Mr. Menzies began the fumigation, not one has been attacked with the diſeaſe; one nurſe only having relapſed, a circumſtance very common, and occaſioned by her not taking care of herſelf. I beg leave to inform you, that this day I began to take charge of the buſineſs, in the abſence of Mr. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies, who is on board the Pamet Euſtaphia to try the experiment, (ſhe having been the moſt ſickly ſhip) where I am certain he will take ſuch meaſures, as will do himſelf credit, and you honour.</p>

The ſick not only bear the fumigation exceedingly well, but aid us voluntarily every day, the convaleſcents carrying the pipkins about, and expreſſing their conviction of its keeping the wards ſweet, which certainly it does, and thoſe perſons who have hitherto eſcaped infection, are ſo much convinced of its efficacy, and have ſo much faith in its power, that I ſhould find it difficult to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the uſe of it, whilſt there is a ſick man on board. As a week has now elapſed ſince any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has been attacked with the diſeaſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we daily receive patients in the ſame putrid petaechial fever, from the ſhips lately arrived from ſea, I have every reaſon to expect our being once more a wholeſome ſhip. Be aſſured, Sir, that no pains ſhall be ſpared, on my part, to accompliſh ſo deſirable an object.</p>

I therefore now conſider the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment as complete, and can bring ſufficient evidence to convince any one that the contagion in the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, on board the Union, has, through Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, been deſtroyed by the fumigation you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended:

beſides, as the acid vapour keeps the ſhip ſweet, it is my intention to continue it for that purpoſe conſtantly, if I am permitted ſo to do.

            <head>REPORT OF THE EXPERIMENT FOR Stopping the Progreſs of Contagion, as executed on board ſome of the Ruſſian Men of War, by Mr. Arch. Menzies.</head>
            <p>SOON after my arrival at Sheerneſs, I had the honor of being introduced to his Excellency Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hannikow, Commander of the Ruſſian ſquadron at that port, on which occaſion he was pleaſed to expreſs a particular deſire of having the moſt ſickly ſhips of his ſquadron purified by the ſame proceſs of fumigation, as I was then carrying on, on board the Union hoſpital ſhip. This being made known to the Lords Commiſſioners of the Admiralty, they were pleaſed to declare their approbation, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting Admiral Buckner to confer with his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency on this ſubject: and on the twenty-eighth
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:036328_0071_1008ECE6D7647AC8"/>
of November, it was agreed between theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, that the fumigation ſhould be tried, under my directions, on board ſuch of the Ruſſian veſſels as were then moſt infected with the contagious fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which had already proved ſo fatal to many of their crews; and it is but juſtice to ſay, that his Excellency, on this occaſion, ſhewed a particular zeal for its ſucceſs, by offering me every aid and aſſiſtance, and by aſſuring me of a ready compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, with every means that might be ſuggeſted to accompliſh ſo deſirable an object, as the health and preſervation of thoſe under his command. But it ſo happened, that, on the day following, he was ordered, with part of his ſquadron, to the North Seas, and in this ſtate of hurry, not having time to conſider which was the moſt ſickly veſſel, he left orders for the trial to be made on board the Revel frigate; but on examining the hoſpital books on board the Union, the Pamet Euſtaphia, of 74 guns, appeared to claim our firſt attention, from her ſickly ſtate: I therefore waited on Admiral Buckner, to acquaint him with this circumſtance, and he very readily applied to Capt. Chechagoff, on whom the command of the remaining part of the Ruſſian ſquadron had devolved, and obtained his leave for the trial to be made on board of her, in preference to the other. After this, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable delay was occaſioned, in waiting for the materials, and collecting together the utenſils ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the operation.</p>
            <p>In the forenoon of the ſeventh of December, 1795, I went on board the Pamet Euſtaphia, and having ordered the ports, ſcuttles, and hatchways to be cloſe ſhut up, with the ſhip's company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween decks, we fumigated her for the firſt time, and continued it morning and evening on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:036328_0072_1008ECE99AFF06A8"/>
day, in the ſame manner that we had done the Union hoſpital ſhip.</p>
            <p>This ſhip has of late ſent more ſick with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fever to the hoſpital, than all the reſt taken together, of the Ruſſian ſquadron laying at this port, which her Commander, Capt. Sinavin, attributes in a great meaſure to her ſhingle ballaſt being chiefly compoſed of ſand, intermixed with a large portion of wet earth, that keeps up a conſtant moiſture and dampneſs below, in ſpite of every means of venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: add to this the putrid ſtench, ariſing in ſo cloſe and crouded a ſituation from the <hi>ſhubs</hi> or ſheep-ſkin great-coats, which are generally worn by the Ruſſian ſeamen, with the woolly ſide next their body, and which undoubtedly muſt aid to nouriſh the ſeeds of contagion, and increaſe its virulence.</p>
            <p>I repreſented to ſeveral of the Commanders of the Ruſſian men of war, the neceſſity there was of deſtroying, or at leaſt of ſuppreſſing theſe <hi>ſhubs</hi> in this country, for though they might be very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and anſwer pretty well in dry, cold, froſty weather, ſuch as is generally the caſe in long win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Ruſſia, yet they were by no means calculated for the chilly wet weather which generally prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this country; as in a damp ſtate they never fail to impregnate the air with offenſive putrid efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, that muſt be extremely hurtful to people's conſtitution where it is conſtantly breathed by ſo many crowded together in ſuch a confined ſituation.</p>
            <p>Early on the morning of the ninth, the Pamet Euſtaphia, with the Ratvezan of 66 guns, were removed up to Chatham, in conſequence of which it was not in my power to continue the fumigation, though I went there on purpoſe. And on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, the crew was ſo buſily occupied, in unrigging the ſhip, and clearing her of ſtores and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:036328_0073_1008ECEB26B27A98"/>
proviſion, to prepare her for going into dock, that no time could be ſpared to attend to the fumigation, until that duty was accompliſhed; which as it would take up ſome days, and as her people were then to be put on board a receiving ſhip, while ſhe was in dock, (a circumſtance I conſidered as very unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the experiment) I therefore came to London on the eleventh, to conſult with Doctor Carmichael Smyth, what plan was beſt to purſue; for as this was the only Ruſſian veſſel from which a fair eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate could be drawn of the utility and efficacy of the fumigation, I was anxious to continue it, in whatever manner might be thought moſt likely to ſecure ſucceſs in deſtroying the contagion, or leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its malignity.</p>
            <p>I returned to Chatham again on the fourteenth, with orders to fumigate as many of the Ruſſian veſſels, eſpecially ſuch as were moſt ſickly, as I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could; for though the experiment could not be regularly carried on, yet in this manner it might leſſen the virulence of the diſorder, and diminiſh the number of ſick ſent to the hoſpital.</p>
            <p>Next day I waited on Captain Chechagoff and Capt. Sinavin, and found that their veſſels were not yet cleared of their ſtores, &amp;c. ſo that I could not go on with either. Indeed, the Ratvezan was pretty healthy, her Commander, Cap. Chechagoff, being very attentive to every means of purifying his veſſel by ventilation and cleanlineſs, and by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuppreſſing the <hi>ſhubs,</hi> as far as he poſſibly could; for he told me, he could not do them away altogether, without giving the men other clothing <hi>in lieu,</hi> which muſt be done by an order from the Commander in Chief.</p>
            <p>Captain Chechagoff alſo informed me, that the Pimen, of 66 guns, was arrived at Sheerneſs, which
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:036328_0074_1008ECEE9938BDC8"/>
had ſome time ago been ſo very ſickly, that boats from other veſſels were forbid coming along-ſide of her, from a dread of the infection; he therefore expreſſed his deſire of having her well fumigated; and I immediately ſet out to execute his requeſt.</p>
            <p>On the ſixteenth of December, I fumigated the Pimen for the firſt time. Her crew, however, was nowiſe ſickly now, although on viſiting her between deck, before the fumigation, the ſtench produced by the <hi>ſhubs</hi> was very perceptible, and extremely offenſive; and it was pleaſing to obſerve the ſudden change produced by the powers of the nitrous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour in deſtroying it.</p>
            <p>When I went on board, on the following day, to continue the fumigation, I found the officers and crew attending Divine Service, and the Prieſts ſprinkling the decks with Holy-water, ſo I did not intrude; but left orders with their own ſurgeon, to fumigate the ſhip in the evening, if he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, which he did. As this was a holiday amongſt them, I alſo declined calling on board the Revel frigate till the next day, when, after fumigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pimen, I went on board the Revel, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt them to prepare for fumigating her. On viſiting this veſſel between decks, I found the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid ſtench from the <hi>ſhubs</hi> extremely offenſive and diſagreeable from the confined air, and want of ventilation; and I had great difficulty to make my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf underſtood, or give any particular directions for want of an interpreter.</p>
            <p>The nineteenth was ſo boiſterous that I could not get on board either veſſel, but the Surgeon of the Pimen was ſo good as to continue the fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as uſual. Captain Colokolſoff, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of this veſſel, was extremely civil, and well diſpoſed to promote my endeavours; and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:036328_0075_1008ECF21F77AA00"/>
officers were equally polite and ready to ſee my directions executed on all occaſions.</p>
            <p>Next day I viſited the Pimen, which was now quite free from ſtench or any offenſive ſmell, in conſequence of the fumigation having been regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued. I alſo began to fumigate the Revel frigate, and regularly attended both veſſels, for the three following days; after which I left the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials and utenſils on board them, with directions to their own Surgeons to continue it in the ſame way daily.</p>
            <p>From what information I could collect, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel had not been very ſickly, yet the few ſhe had lately ſent to the hoſpital, were malignant fevers, which clearly ſhewed that the contagion was lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on board her, though it did not ſpread with much violence.</p>
            <p>Being particularly anxious to reſume the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on board the Pamet Euſtaphia, ſhe being the moſt ſickly, and on that account claiming more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular attention, I came up to Chatham on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fourth, and found ſhe had been juſt hauled into dock, and her crew put on board the Prince Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward receiving ſhip, where they were very much crouded. On the following day I began the fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but as many of the ports and hatchways of the ſhip could not be ſhut cloſe enough to retain the vapour for a ſufficient length of time, a quick and ſtrong fumigation became more eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; which, however, I could not get them to execute, not being able to make them underſtand my meaning, for want of a ſufficient knowledge of their language.</p>
            <p>The fumigation was, notwithſtanding, continued regularly on board this ſhip for the four following days, although it was not in my power to prevail
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:036328_0076_1008ECF6833EDF20"/>
on them to do it ſufficiently ſtrong, to do juſtice to the trial,—and to inſure that ſucceſs we had already experienced on board the Union; their excuſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally was, that the fire was too much occupied to get a ſufficient quantity of ſand heated.</p>
            <p>But, as it was poſſible, that even this ſlight fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation might ſucceed by long continuance, and as their own Surgeon was now acquainted with the proceſs, and well diſpoſed to carry it on, I left the materials and utenſils on board; and, before my departure, waited on Captain Sinavin, who, at this time, lived on ſhore, and who (after being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the foregoing circumſtances) ſaid that he ſhould order it to be continued while his ſhip's company were anywiſe ſickly.</p>
            <p>The Ratvezan having likewiſe gone into dock; to prevent her crew becoming ſickly on board the receiving ſhip, I, at Captain Chechagoff's particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar requeſt, ſent utenſils and materials on board to fumigate daily.</p>
            <p>Having now put theſe Ruſſian veſſels in a fair train for continuing the fumigation; and finding that my preſence, on account of my ignorance of their language, could not be of any further ſervice; at the ſame time, ſome urgent buſineſs, of our late voyage, preſſing hard upon me, I returned to town on the thirtieth of December, leaving the further proſecution of the experiment, as above related, to be conducted by their own Surgeons; and I have the moſt pleaſing hopes that it will be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with beneficial effects to her Imperial Majeſty's ſubjects, not only in the preſent inſtance, but in every ſimilar ſituation hereafter.</p>

            <p>Having now, my Lord, finiſhed with the account of the experiment given by the two gentlemen who have been employed in conducting it, permit me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluding the ſubject, to call for a moment your Lordſhip's attention to ſome of the principal circumſtances, and to the concluſions which they afford.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, my Lord, it muſt be allowed that the preſent experiment fully juſtifies all I have ſaid reſpecting the ſafety with which the nitrous acid (procured in the manner deſcribed) may be employed as a fumigation. No one ſurely can ſay that I aſſume too much, when I conſider the ſafety of the fumigation as eſtabliſhed, after a trial of nearly three months, for an hour and a half or two hours, morning and evening, each day, on board an hoſpital ſhip, containing from two to three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons of different ſexes, and ages, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under different diſeaſes; without a ſingle inſtance of permanent inconvenience or bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ariſing from it: for the ſlight cough, which it at firſt excited, and which was evidently owing to the aukwardneſs and ignorance of thoſe who carried the fumigating pipkins, cannot be looked upon as ſuch, and no farther inconvenience has ever been felt by any one on board.</p>
            <p>Having eſtabliſhed then this important fact, that the nitrous acid is attended with no riſk to the health or ſafety of the people expoſed to it, let me next claim your Lordſhip's attention to the ſenſible and immediate effects of it.</p>
            <p>We are told by Mr. Menzies, that after the firſt fumigation, and ſtill more remarkably after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the air of the hoſpital was perceived to be purer, and free from any putrid or offenſive ſmell; theſe immediate effects of the fumigation, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:036328_0078_1008ECFB4D896C70"/>
repeatedly mentioned by Mr. Baſſan, the laſt of them indeed was too ſtriking not to be taken notice of by every perſon on board. That the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour of the nitrous acid ſhould be found to deſtroy an offenſive ſmell, the effect of animal exhalations, I was not ſurpriſed at, having myſelf had repeated experience of the fact; but that it would alſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the air purer and more proper for reſpiration, I was by no means certain, until I found the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obſervations of thoſe Gentlemen, confirmed by the evidence of Mr. Keir, of Birmingham, one of the firſt chemiſts in this country, or perhaps in Europe; an extract of a letter from this gentleman, whom I have not the honor to know perſonally, to a friend of his in town, I have ſubjoined for your Lordſhip's ſatisfaction, as it affords a convincing proof, from chemiſtry, of the truth of what Mr. Menzies and Mr. Baſſan obſerved in practice. Theſe two qualities, my Lord, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the rendering the atmoſpheric air purer, and conſequently fitter for the purpoſes of animal life, and the completely deſtroying the offenſive ſmell reſulting from animal effluvia or putrid matter, are, of themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantages, if no others were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or derived from the fumigation; but they are of ſtill higher importance, when conſidered as preſumptive evidence of the power of the nitrous vapour to deſtroy contagion; for whatever is found to deſtroy the ſmell of putridity, and at the ſame time to render the air purer, we muſt ſuppoſe more or leſs conducive to this grand object. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive evidence, on a ſubject of this importance, in which the lives of thouſands are involved, is not ſufficient to ſatisfy the mind; and happily for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the preſent experiment, inſtituted under your
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:036328_0079_1008ECFE2DBE3C50"/>
Lordſhip's auſpices, affords complete and direct evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the fact.</p>
            <p>But to bring this home to the underſtanding and conviction of all mankind, it is only neceſſary to look with attention, at the annexed Hoſpital Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; for by comparing the ſtate of health of the ſhip's company, with the progreſs and effects of the contagion, before and after the experiment was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, a clear and decided judgment may be formed of its effects, even by the moſt ignorant. They will in the firſt place obſerve, that from the 3d of September (the day the Ruſſians, ill of the fever, were firſt brought on board) to the firſt of October, there were nine perſons ſeized with the diſtemper, one of whom only belonged to the ſhip's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; the others were attendants on the ſick. That in the month of October, eight perſons more were attacked with the diſeaſe, and of thoſe three belonged to the ſhip's company. But, that from the firſt of November, to the 26th of that month, twelve perſons were attacked with the diſeaſe, among whom we find eight belonging to the ſhip's company. From this ſhort ſtatement it is evident, that the contagion which was at firſt chiefly confined to the hoſpital, affecting thoſe only who were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately employed about the ſick, had gradually ſpread over the ſhip, and been communicated to the ſhip's company; by which means the ſickneſs and mortality had increaſed: and the probability is, that had not a ſtop been put to it, it would have gone on increaſing in proportion to the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the contagion, and to the increaſing deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the people, who conſidered themſelves as ſo many devoted victims. The whole number of perſons ſeized with the diſtemper, during the firſt three months that it prevailed on board the ſhip,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:036328_0080_1008ED021FDAC130"/>
was thirty (beſides ſix children) which was more than one-third of all the people in the ſhip, who were only eighty-five, officers included. Of the thirty ſeized with the fever, eight died of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effects of it, a large proportion ſurely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not much leſs than one in three, and which ſufficiently marks the malignity of the diſtemper.</p>
            <p>Having taken a view of the ſtate of the ſhip's company, and of the progreſs of the contagion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the experiment, let us now, my Lord, turn to the other ſide of the picture, and ſee what was the ſituation of things after the fumigation was begun.</p>
            <p>On the 26th of November, the ſhip was fumigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the firſt time, and from that day to the 25th of December, not a perſon on board was attacked with the fever, their deſpondency was now chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into joy, and their fear into confidence; but as very great confidence is always dangerous, it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo in the preſent inſtance. On the 17th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, they imagined themſelves ſo ſecure, that they diſcontinued the cuſtom of fumigating the ſhip morning and evening, thinking that once a day was ſufficient; the trial, perhaps, was worth hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but on the 25th of December, one of the nurſes ſuffered a ſlight attack, and on the 26th, a marine, who for a week preceding had been in a ſtate of intoxication, was ſeized with the fever, of which he died. Theſe two accidents gave immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate alarm; they returned again to the practice of fumigating twice a day, and from that time to the end of the diſorder, there has not been an inſtance of a perſon ſuffering from contagion on board the ſhip. But the advantage of the fumigation was not felt by the ſhip's company and attendants alone, whom it preſerved from the baneful effects of the fever, the ſick and convaleſcents derived almoſt an
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:036328_0081_1008ED03AE95A4D8"/>
equal benefit from it. The ſymptoms of the diſeaſe (as Mr. Baſſan expreſſes it) were meliorated, and loſt much of their malignant appearance, and the advantage of a pure air, and free from ſtench, to convaleſcents, may readily be conceived.</p>
            <p>From the above relation, my Lord, it plainly appears, that whilſt the practice of fumigating the ſhip twice in the twenty-four hours was continued, there was no ſymptom of contagion or of diſeaſe, and that the only two accidents which happened from the commencement of the experiment, to the preſent hour, occurred on the 25th and 26th of December, nine or ten days after they had ceaſed to fumigate the ſhip, in the manner I had directed. The attack of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the nurſe, indeed, was but trifling, and I think it not improbable that the fever, as well as the death of the marine, were the conſequence of his own intemperance; at any rate ſuppoſing both the one and the other to have ſuffered from contagion, theſe caſes do not in the leaſt invalidate the general ſucceſs of the experiment, and only prove, that in a ſituation where contagion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly generated, it requires to be as conſtantly deſtroyed; otherwiſe it is ready at every inſtant, like the hydra, to rear again its peſtilential head.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, the ſucceſs of the experiment has not been confined to the Union, the power of the nitrous vapour to deſtroy contagion, has been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſplayed on board thoſe Ruſſian veſſels where it has been employed.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip muſt have obſerved, in Mr. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies's Journal, the many unexpected delays he met with in the execution of this buſineſs. The ſudden departure of the Ruſſian Admiral, with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of the fleet, before the ſhips, the moſt
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:036328_0082_1008ED0693F74C30"/>
proper for the experiment, were fixed upon; Mr. Menzies beginning, in conſequence of not being properly informed, with ſhips where the fumigation was not ſo immediately neceſſary; afterwards when he began to fumigate the Pamet Euſtaphia, which had ſent more ſick to the hoſpital than any ſhip of the fleet, ſhe was immediately ordered into dock, and the crew turned over into a receiving ſhip, a ſituation extremely diſadvantageous for ſuch an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment: not to mention the various difficulties and obſtacles ariſing from the difference of language, uſages, religious ceremonies, &amp;c. ſufficient to have diſcouraged a man of a leſs firm mind, or who was leſs zealous than Mr. Menzies in purſuing his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. He perſevered, however, for ſome time, but at laſt was under the neceſſity of returning to town, and of leaving the farther proſecution of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Ruſſians themſelves; and yet, my Lord, owing to the good ſenſe and proper conduct of their officers, who, convinced of the advantage of the fumigation, continued the daily practice of it; thoſe ſhips that have been fumigated, are free from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, and particularly the Pamet Euſtaphia which was the moſt ſickly, is now one of the healthieſt of the fleet, and has no appearance of contagion on board, nor a man ill of the fever; and ſo great is the opinion entertained by Admiral Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicoff, of the efficacy of the fumigation, that he lately ſent to town for materials for fumigating ſome more ſhips.</p>
            <p>Such, my Lord, has been the reſult of an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, by which ſome lives have been already ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and from which two important facts are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the power of the nitrous acid to deſtroy contagion; and the ſafety with which it may
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:036328_0083_1008ED0881D03FA8"/>
be employed in any ſituation, without inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or riſk of fire.</p>
            <p>It would be, perhaps, improper in me to detain your Lordſhip any longer on this ſubject, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to point out the importance and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive application of the preſent diſcovery; a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry equally applicable to every ſpecies of putrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, even to the plague itſelf; a diſcovery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in which all nations are more or leſs intereſted, but whoſe utility muſt be moſt ſenſibly felt by our own; where a commerce, extended to every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the globe, covers the ſea with our ſhips, whilſt our gallant navy ſtill maintains the decided empire of it.</p>

From the above return it appears, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons ill of the contagious fever, brought on board the Union, the two laſt months, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1795 and January 1796, were nearly equal to the number received the two preceding months, October and November. It alſo appears that for the firſt month, after the ſhip was fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, there were few fever patients who died. The increaſe in the number of deaths in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing month, may fairly be aſcribed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>I CONSIDER Dr. Carmichael Smyth's diſcovery to be very valuable. The fumes in his proceſs are quite different from the ordinary nitrous vapour in the diſtillation of aqua fortis, or from that which exhales in the ſolution of metals, by nitrous acid; the latter is highly ſuffocating and noxious, and may be called the phlogiſticated nitrous acid vapour. The fumes made in Dr. Smyth's manner (if there is no metal employed in the veſſel, &amp;c.) is highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlogiſticated or oxygenated nitrous vapour, and is alſo mixed with a large quantity of pure dephlogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticated air, which is extricated from the materials, and theſe fumes are not only not ſuffocating, but have a very pleaſant ſmell. If the diſtinction is not made between theſe two kinds of vapour, it is to be feared that ſome perſon, by accident, or in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of getting nitrous vapour more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly, may uſe the metal veſſels, or diſſolve me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in nitrous acid.</p>

               <head>Extract of another Letter from Mr. Keir, dated near Birmingham, March 3, 1796.</head>
               <p>The difference between the white nitrous acid, (called by Dr. Prieſtley, dephlogiſticated acid, and by the French chemiſts, acide nitrique;) and the red acid, called phlogiſticated, or acide nitreux, is well known, and was firſt particularly noticed by Scheele, who ſhews how the one may be ſeparated from the other by diſtillation. There is the ſame difference in the colour of the vapours from theſe two acids; and Dr. C. Smyth has himſelf obſerved, that the vapours, in the diſtillation of nitrous acid, were not noxious; which obſervation he has very happily and uſefully applied. In diſtilling the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous acid from very ſmall quantities of nitre and oil of vitriol, in glaſs veſſels, and when the materials are very pure, I have ſeen nothing but the white va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, ſuch as ariſe in Dr. C. Smyth's proceſs, but Scheele ſays, that at the end of the operation, ſome red vapours, riſe, and it may be the caſe when a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong heat is applied. But the very noxious red fumes which appear in the uſual proceſs of diſtilling aqua fortis, are occaſioned, as you mention, by the iron veſſels; and the manufacturers even put in old nails and ſmall pieces of iron into their pots, in order to give a high degree of red ſmoking quality to the acid. When you acquainted me of Dr. C. Smyth's diſcovery, it occurred to me, that as the common notion of nitrous acid vapours, is confined to thoſe that are red, ſome people might, in the firſt place, be prejudiced againſt it, from the idea of the vapours being noxious; as the red vapours are undoubtedly, and others might think that they made the proceſs more effectual, by adding to Dr. C. Smyth's mixture, metals, or inflammable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:036328_0091_1008ED1ACF8BF330"/>
in order to produce thoſe red vapours. I therefore thought it would be proper for Dr. C. Smyth, to point out the difference between the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours produced in his method, and the red nitrous fumes which are ſo well known; and alſo to caution the operators to avoid metal veſſels, or the addition of metals or inflammable ſubſtances.</p>
               <p>There is a good deal of vital air extricated from the mixture, but I cannot agree with thoſe who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the medicinal effect to it, we know little of this ſubject; but the analogy of the deſtruction of all animal and vegetable fermentation by mineral acids, which is well aſcertained, inclines me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the agency of the acid, in the deſtruction of the contagion. The matter of which is, I preſume, animal, in ſome vicious kind of fermentation.</p>

               <p>It has been obſerved that the fumigation, with the nitrous acid, introduced by Mr. Menzies on board the ſhip Pamet Euſtaphia, has produced, in a ſhort time, the beſt effect in ſtopping the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the fever and other evils, which were then evidently increaſing, for which reaſon it was not only regularly continued on board of that ſhip, even after Mr. Menzies's departure, but adopted on board of others, and always found uſeful. It is therefore my duty to certify by this not only the good conſequences that have been obſerved from that uſeful contrivance, but even the advantage that ariſes from its eaſy and ſure execution, in compariſon with other means of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migating the ſhips which requires greater atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the fire that muſt be made uſe of, and therefore cannot be effectuated in all the parts of the ſhip.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>LAST winter, while I had charge of Forton hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, although in the midſt of very fatiguing duty, and engaged, as I was, in making ſome favourite experiments of my own, yet, being extremely anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to acquire ſome practical knowledge of Doctor J. C. Smyth's nitrous vapour, I failed not, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving your authority, to put his fumigating plan in execution, as extenſively as it was poſſible; nor, at the ſame time, to note down the phaenomena, as they occurred, with as much accuracy as my leiſure time would permit. And now, in order that you may ſee, in the faireſt points of view, ſome of the effects of the vapour reſulting from that highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and very ſalutary proceſs; and alſo, with the view no leſs of doing juſtice to Doctor J. C. Smyth, than of rendering his nitrous vapour more extenſively uſeful, in the Navy, Army, &amp;c. I beg leave to communicate to you the contents of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages; which, ſhould they appear to you in any degree calculated to be ſerviceable, in promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the welfare of theſe realms, I humbly requeſt you will be pleaſed to lay them before the Right Honourable the Lords Commiſſioners of Admiralty.</p>
            <p>In purſuing my preſent plan, I ſhall, after giving you a ſhort, but not imperfect account of the method I followed in fumigating the wards of the hoſpital, ſtate, in a faithful manner, ſuch facts, whether of a general, or of a particular nature, as aroſe from the trials that were made; after which, by moſt humbly offering a few obſervations connected with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I ſhall conclude my letter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:036328_0096_1008ED2894CDAB18"/>
Every evening a certain number of wards were fumigated, each by means of three pipkins, for an hour; the gally-pot in each pipkin containing the quantities of pure nitre in powder, and concentrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vitriolic acid as directed by Doctor Smyth.<note n="*" place="bottom">For a more particular hiſtory of the proceſs Vide, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor J. C. Smyth's letter to the Right Hon. Earl Spencer, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. containing an account of the experiment made on board the Union hoſpital ſhip, to determine the effect of the nitrous acid in deſtroying contagion, &amp;c.</note> Three perſons, each carrying one fuming pipkin, went round a ward, following one another at ſome diſtance, and holding the pipkins under each bed, for a conſiderable time, as they went along; and they continued doing ſo as long as the fumigation laſted. The wards, by opening the windows and doors, were afterwards filled with atmoſpheric air.</p>
            <p>The vapour, proceeding from the decompoſition of the nitre, by means of the concentrated vitriolic acid, was in ſuch great quantity, that a ward 57 feet by 20, and 10 feet 6 inches high, was filled with it, by means of three pipkins, in the manner I have mentioned, in the ſpace of fifteen minutes.</p>
            <p>On the wards being filled with nitrous vapour, ſome of the patients who laboured under affections of the lungs were ſeized with fits of coughing; none of them, however, to any great degree. With little or no exception, the patients, in the wards that were fumigated, bore the vapour without feeling any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable effect from it. If, indeed, a pipkin was, accidentally, held very cloſe to the mouths of any of the patients, which, from awkwardneſs, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the caſe, coughing was immediately produced; and, in one inſtance, vomiting was occaſioned. Theſe circumſtances, however, did not prevent the patients from becoming, in a ſhort time, very fond
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:036328_0097_1008ED2A22A5DF80"/>
of the fumigating buſineſs. For my part, I frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remained in a ward during the whole time of the fumigation, often indeed with a fuming pipkin in my hand, without experiencing any diſagreeable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect whatever. The fume was to me pleaſant. When, during the fumigation, I remained in a ward, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wore black clothes, which, even, after being repeatedly expoſed to the nitrous vapour, were not in the leaſt either ſtained, or changed from black to a brown colour.</p>
            <p>In the mornings, particularly in dry weather, the wards that had been fumigated the preceding even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even although they had been waſhed early in the morning, and the windows kept open, had a very agreeable ſmell, much more pleaſant than that which was experienced during the fumigation. By this agreeable odour, in the mornings, I was able to judge whether or not due pains had been beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the preceding evening, in fumigating the wards.</p>
            <p>One dyſentery ward, one fever ward, and one ſurgery ward, containing the worſt kind of Ulcers, were, at firſt, the places filled every evening with the nitrous vapour; but, as the good effects reſulting from the fumigation were to me very obvious, I ſoon uſed it more extenſively. The patients, in general, who laboured under old dyſenteries, many of them contracted in the Weſt Indies, ſeemed to be greatly relieved;<note n="*" place="bottom">Ultimately, a great number of the old dyſenteries, where the patients were not far advanced in life, did well.</note> the fevers, which were of no uncommon genus, and which were in their nature very mild, ſoon diſappeared, without exhibiting any ſymptoms of typhus; and the ulcers, inſtead of further dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating or ſpreading, put on a favourable appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and healed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:036328_0098_1008ED2DB16829B0"/>
It is, I preſume, of no ſmall conſequence to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, excepting ſome marked caſes of dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, among the ſervants of the priſon and hoſpital, in the months of Auguſt and September, before the arrival of the priſoners from the Weſt Indies, and one caſe of typhus (in ward 18) with now and then a caſe of ſmall-pox, among the Weſt Indians, after their arrival, there was not any contagious febrile diſorder that made its appearance within the walls of the hoſpital, while I had charge of it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many ſources of contagion to which, in my opinion, all in and about it were expoſed. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt five months of my time, no fewer than 1686 patients were admitted into the hoſpital, as may be ſeen by the hoſpital books.</p>
            <p>The following table ſerves to ſhew, at one view, the higheſt number of patients in the hoſpital, the number diſcharged and dead, weekly, for four weeks before, and ſix weeks after the nitrous vapour was firſt uſed; <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the 16th of October, to the 26th of December, 1796. To include a greater ſpace of time would be improper; becauſe, before the 16th of October, there were but few patients in the hoſpital; and, becauſe, after the 26th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, there were a great number of extremely bad caſes of gangrenous feet, pneumonia, &amp;c. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into it, from Portcheſter hoſpital, and from the Vigilant and Captivity priſon ſhips.</p>

            <p>After theſe general obſervations on the nitrous vapour, I ſhall humbly beg leave to offer the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Caſes, in which it was, undoubtedly, uſed with very remarkable ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>CASE I.—Jean Louis, French priſoner, of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, eighteen years of age, from the Weſt Indies, was admitted into the hoſpital on the 28th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1796, for an ill-conditioned Ulcer on the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and interior part of the right leg. After he had been ſome time in the hoſpital, the ulcer began to put on a favourable appearance, and was ſoon conſiderably diminiſhed in its ſize, merely by means of ſimple dreſſings.</p>
            <p>On the 29th of November, however, the ulcer according to the common phraſe, became foul; and, by next day, it had ſpread to ſuch a degree, that it was nearly as extenſive again as it ever had been, attended with very acute pain, and with a very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious thin dark-coloured fetid diſcharge. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's pulſe, at this time, was 120, tongue clean; appetite impaired, belly open; ſleep much diſturbed.</p>
            <p>31ſt. From the 29th to this time, a common poultice, thrice a day, was the only application; but
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:036328_0100_1008ED3201FDAC90"/>
now, in addition to the poultice, the ulcer was dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the powder of Peruvian bark; a cooling medicine, with an opiate at bed-time, was ordered; and a vegetable diet with milk was enjoined.</p>
            <p>2d December. The ulcer ſtill more extenſive than it was on the 31ſt ult. It now extended from the Tarſus ſix or ſeven inches upwards, and from the Tibia more than half round the leg: it was ſtill in a ſloughing ſtate, with high, reflected edges. The other ſymptoms much the ſame as before. Finding that the plan hitherto purſued had not produced any good effect, either on the ulcer or on the ſyſtem, the whole of it, excepting the poultice, was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and the nitrous vapour adopted. The ward in general, and the bed of the patient in particular, were carefully fumigated, the ward once, the bed twice a day.</p>
            <p>3d. The ulcer had ſtopt ſpreading, and in ſome places looked clean. Such a ſudden change was to me aſtoniſhing. Pulſe now 110; tongue clean; bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open; ſlept better on the night of the 2d than for ſome time before, notwithſtanding the omiſſion of the opiate.</p>
            <p>4th. The ulcer was clean, and diſcharged good matter. The patient felt himſelf comfortable. Pulſe about 90.</p>
            <p>6th. The diſcharge continued to be good; and the ulcer had made conſiderable progreſs in healing. The patient felt himſelf perfectly eaſy, and his health was already very much mended.</p>
            <p>The fumigation was continued until the 26th of December; from which time, owing to a want of materials, it was diſcontinued until the 11th of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, 1797. The ulcer, during the time the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation was uſed, and even to the 1ſt of January, 1797, continued to heal kindly, and rapidly; but,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:036328_0101_1008ED35F03FE208"/>
at that period, it again became foul and ſloughing, and was ſoon as extenſive as before. The appetite was again impaired; pulſe 120, and ſmall; belly open; the patient much weakened and emaciated. Half a drachm of Peruvian bark, thrice a day, and eight ounces of wine in the twenty-four hours, were ordered; and the ulcer was dreſſed twice a day with the powder of common Peruvian bark and common poultice. An opiate was occaſionally allowed at bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. This treatment was preſerved until the 11th, when, having experienced no good effects from it, it was diſcontinued, and recourſe again had to the nitrous vapour, and common poultice, as on the 2d of December, 1796.</p>
            <p>12th. The ulcer had ſtopt ſpreading, and in ſome places had begun to clean. The pulſe was leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and more full; and the patient was, in every reſpect, better, and more comfortable. The nitrous vapour, &amp;c. were continued.</p>
            <p>13th. The ulcer was perfectly clean, with florid granulations, and with about the eighth of an inch of new ſkin round the edges. The plan was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
            <p>20th. The ulcer looked very healthy, and was contracting rapidly. The plan was continued.</p>
            <p>5th February. The ulcer had contracted more than one half. The plan was continued.</p>
            <p>12th March. The ulcer was nearly healed, (not ſo much as the breadth of a ſixpence being open) and looking healthy. On this day I finiſhed my duty, and, conſequently, my obſervations, at Forton hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital.</p>
            <p>I have here to obſerve, that about the 1ſt of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1797, all the ulcers in the ſame ward (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 14) with the above, were more or leſs in a bad ſtate; and that they all, about one and the ſame time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:036328_0102_1008E35968366B18"/>
to put on a favourable appearance; and alſo that, in a ſhort while, many of them healed. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was paid all along to cleanlineſs and ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>CASE II. La Granade, French priſoner, aged 26 years, from the Weſt Indies, was admitted into the hoſpital on the 16th of December, 1796, for chilblains. In the end of February 1797, an ulcer broke out on his left leg, which became very foul and ſloughing, and did not yield to common reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. On the 7th of the following March, the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous vapour was uſed, exactly in the ſame manner as in the preceding Caſe, and by the 12th the ulcer was perfectly clean.</p>
            <p>CASE III.—Elie Double, French priſoner, aged 22 years, from the Weſt Indies, was admitted into the hoſpital on the 28th of October 1796, for an ulcer on the anterior and middle part of his left leg. By the middle of February, 1797, the ulcer was cicatriſed, but with a conſiderable protuberance remaining over that part of the tibia, as if the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſteum and even the bone itſelf, had been in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed ſtate. About the end of February the cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix became inflamed, ſoon ſuppurated, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into a foul ſloughing ulcer, which, inſtead of yielding to any of the various applications, got worſe and worſe every day. From the end of February, (I cannot exactly tell the day,) cataplaſms of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kinds, myrrh, and Peruvian bark, were tried externally; and wine, Peruvian bark, opium, &amp;c. were adminiſtered internally. At the ſame time, great attention was beſtowed in keeping the ward extremely clean, and thoroughly ventilated. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only that no good effect was produced by any of theſe means, but even that the ulcer, the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:036328_0103_1008ED8E5193CD38"/>
ſound parts being ſtill in a mouldering ſtate, grew more and more extenſive, I came to a determination, conſidering myſelf ſufficiently authoriſed, from the experience I had had, to make trial, in this unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward caſe, of Dr. J. C. Smyth's nitrous vapour. Accordingly, on the 7th of March the fumigation was put in practice, in the ſame way as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going caſes; and, it is with heart-felt pleaſure I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, by the 12th, that was in five days time, and on the day I finiſhed my duty at Forton, the ulcer was perfectly clean and healthy.</p>
            <p>CASE IV.—Francois a negro French priſoner, age unknown, was admitted into the hoſpital on the 26th of January 1797, for a wounded little finger. On examining the wound, I found that the laſt bone and the ſurrounding liguments were the parts moſt materially injured. The bone was fractured, and the ſoft parts were contuſed to a very great degree, with a ſmall lacerated wound at the tip of the finger. Deeming it neceſſary, I immediately amputated the limb at the joint formed by the ſecond and laſt phalanges. The ſtump, the bone being well covered, and the ſoft parts looking healthy, had all the appearance of doing well, during the firſt fortnight; but, unfortunately, at the expiration of that period, it began to put on a very unfavourable aſpect. Inſtead of the diſeaſed parts being ſinuous, or having, what is perfectly underſtood in ſurgical language, a glaſſy appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which ſometimes indicate a diſeaſed bone, they became enlarged to a prodigious degree, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting very conſiderably, ſo as to reſemble a ball on the end of the ſtump; and, at the ſame time, appeared ſoul, diſcharging a dark thin fetid matter. In this ſtate, Peruvian bark, opium, &amp;c. were tried, as alſo cataplaſms, but to no purpoſe. In
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:036328_0104_1008ED3B9A0C3A68"/>
the end of February, recourſe was had to the nitrous vapour; and, by means of it, in ſix days time, the ulcer was perfectly clean.</p>
            <p>CASE V.—Baſtern, a negro French priſoner, age unknown, was admitted into the hoſpital on the 28th of January 1797, for an ulcerated toe. This caſe very ſimilar to the finger of which I have juſt taken notice, and, like it, after various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual applications, was cleaned, and put, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, in a healthy ſtate, by means of the nitrous vapour uſed according to the manner I have already related. The four laſt caſes were in the ſame ward, No. 4.</p>
            <p>Having, with reſpect to Dr. J. Smyth's nitrous vapour, agreeably to my promiſe, finiſhed the moſt important part of my experiments, with the phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena reſulting from them, in order to ſhew you that vapour, under proper management, is capable of producing very happy effects on the human frame, I ſhall now moſt humbly offer a few obſervations which appear to me to be connected with the ſubject.</p>
            <p>And, to proceed; I am in great hopes that the facts detailed in theſe pages, while they ſerve as ſo many proofs of the utility of Dr. J. C. Smyth's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migating plan, will, at the ſame time, anſwer the happy purpoſe of not only removing the ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fear of Dr. Trotter, and of convincing him, as well as thoſe who think as he does, that no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is to be apprehended from the combination of azote with the nitrous vapour; but, alſo, of conquering the prejudices of thoſe gentlemen who imagine (for ſome highly reſpectable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical practitioners have lately mentioned to me their apprehenſions) that that vapour, from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loaded with vitriolic acid, muſt be intolerable
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:036328_0105_1008ED3F2FD554B0"/>
to the lungs, and of courſe highly pernicious to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſubjected to its influence.</p>
            <p>With regard to the bad, or deleterious effects of the nitrous vapour, I cannot ſay, from experience, that I am acquainted with any of them. The trials that I made of that vapour were on a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of diſeaſed perſons, who, although crowded together within the walls of an extenſive hoſpital, and from that circumſtance, as well as others of at leaſt equal moment, expoſed to the influence of noxious effluvia, were obviouſly, in many inſtances, as already mentioned, benefited by its ſalutary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Many patients were cured; others were put in a fair way of being cured. And, I muſt add, for it is not, I preſume, altogether improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that by means of the nitrous vapour, with other no leſs important meaſures, which I adopted, and inceſſantly followed when in my power, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents who were under my charge, in Forton hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, were preſerved from the attacks of contagious fever. I have ventured to ſay with other no leſs important meaſures, becauſe I am well aware, as Dr. J. C. Smyth undoubtedly is, that, without the moſt ſtrict attention to cleanlineſs, and to the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of pure or atmoſpheric air, neither the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous vapour, nor any thing adminiſtered with ſimilar intentions, can prove ſo efficacious as we could wiſh, in preventing or putting a ſtop to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious fever, as well as other diſeaſes, though perhaps not ſo immediately, yet ultimately as fatal. I am here under the neceſſity of obſerving, having forgot to do it in the proper place, that the ſolitary caſe of Typhus, which, as before mentioned, was in ward eighteen, did not originate in the hoſpital, but in the Captivity priſon ſhip. What the nature of the diſorder had been primarily, I am at a loſs
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:036328_0106_1008ED41D5B2D328"/>
to ſay. The patient died, and, fortunately, ſo did the diſeaſe; for I ſaw not another fever of a ſimilar nature in the hoſpital.</p>
            <p>As no contagious fever (I mean typhus, or what ſome authors have called jail fever, others hoſpital fever, &amp;c.) prevailed, during my time, in Forton hoſpital, I cannot ſay poſitively that the nitrous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour ſolely prevented ſuch a fever from prevailing. All that I can ſay is only, that the circumſtance of no contagious fever having prevailed in Forton hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, during my time, may be conſidered as being of a very ſingular nature; more eſpecially when we take into our view the vaſt number of patients, in the moſt filthy ſtate, from the Weſt Indies, &amp;c. that were received. The very particular attention that was paid to the patients, on their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in ſtripping them of all their clothes, in bathing them, in ſhaving their heads, in burning all their clothes, and alſo in keeping the hoſpital, at all times, extremely clean, and thoroughly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated, may, it is probable, have contributed not a little towards preventing contagious fever. And, further, another circumſtance which, perhaps, had operated very powerfully in aſſiſting to obviate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious fever, and which deſerves to be very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly remarked, was the changing of the wards as frequently as it was poſſible, and that according to the nature of the complaints they contained; for inſtance, and by compariſon, wards that contained convaleſcents, and alſo thoſe that contained ſlight or chronic diſeaſes, were changed frequently; thoſe that contained febrile diſeaſes more frequently, and thoſe that contained very bad ſurgical caſes moſt frequently. By the changing of wards, I mean the removing of the patients from one that they
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:036328_0107_1008ED44B70C73F8"/>
had occupied for ſome time, to another that was perfectly purified.</p>
            <p>When a ward of whatever deſcription was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was firſt emptied, by the patients being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into another, and by its bedding being ſent to be baked, fumigated, or waſhed; and then it was without loſs of time fumigated by means of ſulphur; then white-waſhed; then its cradles cleaned, and waſhed with vinegar; then the floor of it thoroughly cleaned; and, laſtly, its windows on the one ſide, and its ſcuttles on the other, were kept open, always when the weather would permit, until it was again occupied by patients, which, if the ſtate of the hoſpital admitted, was not before eight days had expired. Such regulations as the above ought, in my humble opinion, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and very particularly obſerved, by all medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal men who have the immediate charge of hoſpitals for priſoners of war: many of them, I preſume, might, with propriety and utility, be obſerved in any hoſpital; and, in concluding this ſubject, I beg leave humbly to ſuggeſt to you that no hoſpital ought to be full, but, on the contrary, that there ſhould always be, in all, according to their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſizes, two, three, four, or more wards left empty, for the very ſalutary purpoſe of changing.</p>
            <p>Cleanlineſs, ventilation, and changing of the wards, whether with the view of obviating or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving diſeaſes, are, in all hoſpitals, as well as in all places where priſoners of war are confined, &amp;c. abſolutely neceſſary: where they are obſerved, medicines will become leſs needful; and when need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they will, in their operation, be more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; but, where they are neglected, the phyſicians and ſurgeons will be ſubjected to the very unpleaſant trouble of giving their attendance, and of preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:036328_0108_1008ED4963B78A18"/>
to very little purpoſe. Warmth ought alſo to be attended to.</p>
            <p>In ſuch eſtabliſhments as Forton, cleanlineſs, a free circulation of air, proper diet, &amp;c. ought, agreeably to the very particular orders which you iſſue, to be moſt rigidly attended to, from one end of theſe eſtabliſhments to the other. But, I am afraid, orders are not always rigidly executed. The unpardonable neglect of ſervants, in not executing, with promptitude and ſcrupulous punctuality, the orders with which they are entruſted, is to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, but, I fear, not to be, on all occaſions, either prevented or corrected. From what I know of the eſtabliſhments in queſtion, I ſhall venture to ſay, that, were they always to be properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the ſervants who have the immediate charge of them, we ſhould hear leſs frequently of the priſoners, &amp;c. falling a prey to contagious fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver than we have hitherto done. This is a ſubject, however, with which, at preſent, I ſhall not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concern myſelf, excepting to make the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſervation, which is, that while due care is not taken, in the firſt inſtance, to prevent conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from taking effect, the uſe of Dr. J. C. Smyth's nitrous vapour becomes, undoubtedly, the more particularly neceſſary: but I am extremely ſorry to think that Dr. Smyth's plan, as well as others equally well intended, ſhould not always be put in execution, but more eſpecially in caſes of emergency, with that facility, with that eagerneſs, with that candour, which duty, juſtice, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, continually require.</p>
            <p>Although I have, in the courſe of theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, laid very conſiderable ſtreſs on cleanlineſs, ventilation, changing of wards, &amp;c. yet I would not, by any means, wiſh it to be ſuppoſed that
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:036328_0109_1008ED4B29C17BD0"/>
I have done it with the view of ſuperſeding the uſe of the nitrous vapour: on the contrary, while on the one hand I am ſenſible that the nitrous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour cannot, without cleanlineſs, ventilation, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wards, &amp;c. be ſo efficacious as we could wiſh, in putting a ſtop to contagious fever; I am, on the other hand, no leſs ſenſible that that fever, when raging to a violent degree, cannot be exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by means of cleanlineſs, ventilation, &amp;c. without the aſſiſtance of ſome other means. With reſpect to hoſpitals, ſhips, priſons, &amp;c. where peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are crowded together, where the introduction of contagious fever is dreaded, or where it actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevails, the nitrous vapour, with due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cleanlineſs, ventilation, &amp;c. may, at once, I preſume, not only be conſidered the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, the moſt elegant, and the moſt ingenious, but alſo the moſt efficacious remedy for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of counteracting different ſpecies of contagion, that has yet been offered to the public.</p>
            <p>Further, although cleanlineſs, ventilation, and the changing of wards, very ſtrictly attended to, might, in a very great meaſure, prevent contagion from taking effect, or from ſpreading extenſively, yet, ſuppoſing them to be attended to as ſtrictly as, from the nature of things, it is poſſible, they could not, I am too much afraid, deſtroy contagion, when prevailing in an extenſive hoſpital, &amp;c. For example, let us ſuppoſe only five or ſix hundred patients confined in Forton hoſpital, and labouring under contagious fever; and let us alſo ſuppoſe it neceſſary, for the ſake of cleanlineſs, and of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſtop to the contagion, to completely ſhift all theſe patients once, perhaps many of them twice, and ſome of them even thrice, every day; how, give me leave to aſk, would it be poſſible to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:036328_0110_1008ED4E51360568"/>
ſuch a great number of patients ſo frequently with the clean things required? For my part, I am fully perſuaded that it would prove difficult; ſo extremely ſo, indeed, that it would amount even to an impoſſibility. With reſpect to ventilation, has it not been found, even when it has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to very particularly, to be, without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of other means, inadequate to the ſpeedy deſtruction of contagion? And, with regard to the changing of wards, were it ſufficient of itſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy contagion, might it not, I ſhall ſay ſometimes, from the number of patients received being equal, nay even more than equal, to all the wards of which the hoſpital conſiſts, be utterly impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Other examples, and other queries, to the ſame effect, were they not deemed ſuperfluous, might be advanced: then, conſidering the buſineſs in this point of view, does it not become a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on us to look out for, and to try other means more active, and more diffuſive, which, with the aſſiſtance of cleanlineſs, ventilation, changing of wards, &amp;c. may be employed for the purpoſe of more ſpeedily, and more effectually deſtroying contagion? and may not the nitrous vapour of Dr. J. C. Smyth, as I have already mentioned, be deemed, of all other remedies extant, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, the moſt elegant, the moſt ingenious, and the moſt efficacious for anſwering the wiſhed-for purpoſe, whether at ſea or on ſhore?</p>
            <p>The extraordinary effects which we have ſeen the nitrous vapour produce, in caſes of putrid ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, are facts of the utmoſt importance to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and certainly deſerve the moſt ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of medical practitioners. They not only ſhew, in the moſt ſatisfactory manner, the power of that vapour in ſuch caſes, but alſo point out, in my
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:036328_0111_1008ED510DD3A858"/>
humble opinion, the probability of its having, in a ſimilar way, as ſalutary a power in contagious fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and in many other diſeaſes proceeding from other ſpecies of contagion. This opinion may, perhaps, ſeem ſingular; but I ſhall endeavour to evince its conſiſtence with reaſon and experience.</p>
            <p>In hoſpital practice, it has been frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, not only by me, but by other medical prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, that all the ulcers of patients in the ſame ward have on a ſudden, and nearly at one and the ſame time, changed from, apparently, an healthy, to a foul, ſloughing, or putrid ſtate. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed conſiderable attention in obſerving this change; and, in the courſe of my practice, have been able to make the following remarks, which I ſhall here arrange as they ſtand among my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums.</p>
            <p>That, firſt, one ulcer degenerated, then another, and ſo on, until all the ulcers, in the ſame ward had taken on a ſimilar diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>That thoſe ulcers neareſt the one which firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated were ſooner affected than thoſe at a greater diſtance.</p>
            <p>That this lamentable change did not happen in all the ſurgical wards at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>That the patients, when their ulcers were in this degenerated ſtate, laboured, more or leſs, under ſymptoms of fever, ſuch as a frequent, ſmall pulſe, unnatural heat, ſometimes chillineſs, dry ſkin, loſs of appetite, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That common dreſſings, common poultices, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot poultices, turnip poultices, myrrh, Peruvian bark, applied to the ulcers, had no good effects.</p>
            <p>That Peruvian bark, wine, opium, given inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, had, I thought, inſtead of good, bad effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="unknown:036328_0112_1008ED54186A5208"/>
That, in one caſe, yeaſt was tried, both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and externally, but the diſeaſe evidently gained ground under the courſe.</p>
            <p>That the acetum nitroſum,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Paterſon on Scurvy.</note> whether uſed inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally or externally, ſeemed to have good effects.</p>
            <p>That the changing of the wards had always good effects.</p>
            <p>That the nitrous vapour, with the like attention to cleanlineſs and ventilation as was in common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, had, without changing the ward, as in the five caſes mentioned, as well as in many others, effects ſuperior to thoſe reſulting from the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ward, without the uſe of the nitrous vapour.</p>
            <p>That the nitrous vapour had not the like good effects, without cleanlineſs and ventilation, as with them.</p>
            <p>From theſe premiſes, I have thought it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable to draw the two following concluſions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſuch a degeneration of ulcers, in hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, from, apparently, an healthy, to a foul, ſloughing, putrid ſtate, can only be accounted for on the principle of contagion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the nitrous vapour, with due attention to cleanlineſs, ventilation, changing of the wards, &amp;c. is, ſeemingly, the remedy, of all others extant, beſt calculated for preventing, or ſpeedily deſtroying that contagion; and from this naturally ariſes the following query:</p>
            <p>As, under ſuch regulations, the nitrous vapour has ſuch great power in preventing or deſtroying one ſpecies of contagion, may it not, under the ſame regulations, be equally powerful in preventing or deſtroying other ſpecies of contagion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:036328_0113_1008ED56B6319C88"/>
I muſt here obſerve, that the ſecond concluſion does not exclude the uſe of other medicines. Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able remedies, both internally and externally, uſed at the ſame time with the nitrous vapour, will, no doubt, forward the cure. But, as theſe pages are intended for the purpoſe of pointing out ſome of the effects of Dr. J. C. Smyth's nitrous vapour, and not as a treatiſe on ulcers, I cannot, with reſpect to the latter, make, with any degree of propriety, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on either the indications of cure or remedies.</p>
            <p>On the preſent ſubject, I might, to what has been advanced, add many more medical obſervations, were I not of opinion that, after the experiments of Dr. Smyth,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Dr. J. C. Smyth's letter to the Right Honourable Earl Spencer, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</note> they would appear ſuperfluous; and I might, with equal propriety, have recourſe to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical reaſoning, were I not prepoſſeſſed with the idea that, conſidering what has been already ſaid, reſpecting Dr. Smyth's nitrous vapour, by that very ingenious chemiſt Mr. Keir, of Birmingham<note n="†" place="bottom">Vide Dr. J. C. Smyth's letter to the Right Honourable Earl Spencer, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Appendix.</note> it would be extremely preſumptuous.</p>
            <p>On the whole, and to conclude, I cannot help being of opinion, as well from the facts with which Dr. Smyth has favoured the public, and from what Mr. Keir has advanced, as from my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that very great benefit muſt reſult to mankind from the <hi>proper uſe</hi> of the nitrous vapour, on board of ſhips, in hoſpitals, in priſons, in all places where people may be crowded together, and even in private families, in preventing and in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſtop to contagion, as well as in mitigating and removing other diſeaſes, in which other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines would not perhaps have the like good effects.
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:036328_0114_1008ED5984B7BBB0"/>
And, therefore, I moſt ſincerely wiſh that the plan of Dr. J. C. Smyth may be univerſally adopted; and that it may, for the good of our navy and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for the honour of our country, and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of mankind, be practiſed by medical men, and others, without their conceiving any prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt either it or its ingenious Author.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>SINCE finiſhing the preceding letter, I have had an opportunity of making further trial of the nitrous vapour, in a diſeaſe of a ſingular nature. The hooping cough, which has been prevailing here all this ſummer, made its appearance in my family laſt month, this being a contagious diſeaſe, and a change of air having been found uſeful in removing it, I ſuppoſed that the nitrous vapour might not only operate in counteracting the contagion, but alſo have effects ſimilar to the changing of ſituation; and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:036328_0115_1008ED5C36F29AC8"/>
hence, that it might, providing the lungs of my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle patients could bear it, prove a convenient, an elegant, and uſeful remedy, on the preſent occaſion. It was from theſe conjectures, and knowing that it would have been extremely inconvenient for me to have ſent my children from home, that I ventured to make trial of Dr. Smyth's fumigating plan; the reſult of which I ſhall ſtate, as briefly as poſſibly, by ſketching the following caſes.</p>
            <p>My third child, a girl of five years old, was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſlight inflammation of the throat, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with hoarſeneſs, about the 6th of laſt month; and about the 10th with a cough on which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and hoarſeneſs went off, the cough for ſome days, ſeemed to be of a common kind, from cold; but by the 15th it aſſumed the appearance of hooping cough, accompanied with a ſlight degree of fever. By this time my ſecond child, a girl of ſix years, and alſo, my fourth or youngeſt, a boy of fifteen months, had begun to cough.<note n="*" place="bottom">My oldeſt child had the hooping cough about three years ago.</note>
            </p>
            <p>On the 17th, the third child had frequent and violent fits of coughing, with the hoop ſtrongly marked; and the ſecond and fourth, though not ſo ill, evidently laboured under the diſeaſe. In the evening of this day, I began the uſe of the nitrous vapour, I ſhut up my little patients, with a ſervant, in their bed-room ſixteen feet by twelve, and ſix feet nine inches high, myſelf ſuperintending the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. Inſtead of a pipkin for holding the hot ſand, I uſed an iron pot, in which was placed two galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, containing the concentrated vitriolic acid and nitre, according to the directions of Dr. Smyth. In about five or ſix minutes the room was filled with vapour, and continued ſo for an hour, without any
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:036328_0116_1008ED5FC7870468"/>
of the children coughing or ſhewing any ſigns of uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>18th, 19th, 20th. The fumigation was repeated every evening, and continued an hour, without coughing or any uneaſineſs occurring.</p>
            <p>21ſt. Now, all my little patients ſeemed better, the fits of coughing recurring leſs frequently, and the mucus being more eaſily diſcharged than before.</p>
            <p>14th September. From the 20th ult. to this time, the fumigation was repeated only ſix times, exactly in the ſame manner as before, without the children complaining of, or apparently feeling any diſagreeable effect from it; and now, on account of the mildneſs of the diſeaſe, the cough not being troubleſome even in the night, it was diſcontinued.—At this time the youngeſt child evidently labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under ſymptoms of teething; the cough, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, did not appear in the leaſt aggravated.—To the ſecond and third child, during the courſe of the nitrous vapour, no other medicine was given; but to the youngeſt, who was frequently conſtipated, a weak ſolution of antimon. tart. which always ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated downwards, and ſometimes upwards, was occaſionally adminiſtered.</p>
            <p>23d. The ſecond, and third child, continue well; and the youngeſt, though much diſtreſſed with teething, coughs but ſeldom, and very gentle.</p>
            <p>Now after having ſtated theſe facts, whether or not the nitrous vapour, had any effect in counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the contagion or otherwiſe rendering the diſeaſe mild, and of ſhort duration; or whether or not the diſeaſe would have naturally appeared mild, and have continued but a ſhort time, without the interference of art, are points which I ſhall not take upon me to determine. Further trials are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly neceſſary for the purpoſe of forming a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:036328_0117_1008ED6258564920"/>
It muſt be confeſſed, however, that, even the few trials which have already been made, ſerve, in the mean time, a very uſeful purpoſe; they clearly ſhew, that even young children labouring under a diſeaſe, in which there is always, more or leſs, a determination to the lungs, &amp;c. are capable of inſpiring the nitrous vapour without feeling from it any diſagreeable effects: hence there cannot, I preſume, be any objections to further trials of it being made in the hooping cough. Alſo theſe facts lead naturally to other important inferences, but as they muſt be to you ſufficiently obvious, I avoid making them.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>As Surgeon to the 88th regiment, I have for theſe laſt four years, been witneſs to the dreadful ravages of an infectious fever in different quarters of the world. In England, in the iſland of Jerſey, on the continent of Europe, during a voyage to, and in different iſlands of the Weſt Indies, this fever has been the ſcourge of the regiment to which I have the honour to belong, and after a trial of every mode of practice which I could learn, it proved extremely fatal.</p>
               <p>On my return from the Weſt Indies, having ſeen in Duncan's Annals of Medicine, an account of your work on fever, I determined to take the earlieſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of giving a trial to the mode which you recommended, of weakening and deſtroying conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>The 88th regiment, for nine months previous to their landing in Jerſey, had been in the moſt healthy condition; they landed on the 6th of June laſt, and continued in the ſame healthy ſtate till the middle of laſt July. On the 17th of July, the firſt caſe of a fever, which has ſince very generally prevailed, made its appearance. The perſon was ſeized with the worſt ſymptoms of low typhus fever, and died on the 5th day. Having four years before, in this iſland, in the courſe of ten weeks, loſt fifty men in the ſame
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:036328_0119_1008ED6690D280D8"/>
fever, I determined to give the fulleſt and faireſt trail to any thing recommended by you. I had every aſſiſtance from one of the ableſt commanding officers, Col. Bursford.</p>
               <p>To diffuſe the contagious poiſon, I ordered the men, on the firſt appearance of fever, to be moved from the barracks, (which are in an unhealthy ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation) to tents pitched at ſome diſtance, on a dry and healthy ſpot.</p>
               <p>To deſtroy the virulence of the contagion, where it evidently exiſted, I made my two mates regularly fumigate the barrack rooms and hoſpital with nitrous vapour, in the manner you direct, the event will ſhew the ſucceſs, of perhaps the firſt trial of your excellent invention, in the army.</p>
               <p>Of fifty-four caſes of this fever, which occurred from the 17th of July to the 24th of September, the firſt is the only one that I have loſt. The very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable effect of the nitrous fumigation, appeared from the great diminution of the number taken ill, after it was uſed. During the firſt week twenty-four caſes appeared, in the ſecond week, ten, in the third, ſeven caſes; and to this date,<note n="*" place="bottom">The 8th of October.</note> the number of caſes continue to leſſen.</p>
               <p>The effect of the nitrous fumigation, is evident, not only in the diminiſhed number of caſes, but alſo in their degree of virulence. The caſes that have of late appeared, have been gradually becoming milder, and are now what a late writer would call caſes of ſimple fever, having neither petechiae nor any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſymptom.</p>
               <p>As your work on fever has but lately fallen into my hands, I have been able, only in few inſtances, to follow the practice which you recommend; every thing indeed has been ſo completely effected, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:036328_0120_1008ED6A8C6241F0"/>
your manner of deſtroying contagion, that, in general, little has been left for me, but to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate debility.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould wiſh to make any uſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or ſhould favour me with any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regarding your truly valuable diſcovery, pleaſe addreſs for me to the care of our agent, A. M'Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> Pall-Mall court, London.</p>
               <p>In a Memoir which I tranſmitted to the Army Medical Board lately, after an account of the fever which appeared in the 88th regiment, I gave an account of the ſucceſs of your plan, and thought it my duty to recommend it to the attention of the Board.</p>

               <p>By a letter of yours of the 26th of October, with which I was favoured, I was happy to learn that my conduct had met your approbation.</p>
               <p>In September laſt, I ſent to my friend Dr. Garth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, a copy of my Memoir to the Army Medical Board on the fever that lately prevailed in the 88th regiment. At his deſire, I about three weeks ago, ſent him an abridged account of two memoirs on this fever, which, I believe he intends to tranſmit to Dr. Duncan, for the ſecond volume of the Annals of
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:036328_0121_1008ED6C6F183E70"/>
Medicine. Preſuming that it would be ſatisfactory to you to ſee them, I herewith incloſe you copies of my firſt memoir, and of the abridged account ſent to Dr. Garthſhore. I had nearly finiſhed a ſecond memoir, and hoped to be able to have concluded my <hi>statement</hi> of the fever, with an account of its extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; but a few more caſes have of late occurred. The appearance of theſe laſt caſes is however very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and eaſily accounted for, and the treatment of them adds a ſtill further teſtimony to the efficacy of the nitrous fumigation, and of the treatment for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly purſued.</p>
               <p>About the middle of October laſt, from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt total diſappearance of the fever, we relaxed conſiderably in the fumigation, the only caſes then in the fever-hoſpital, were convaleſcents from fever. About this time, the different encampments break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, we were obliged to admit a good many pneumonic and ſome dyſenteric caſes which crowded this ſmall hoſpital, (an old farm-houſe hired for an hoſpital) and I was alarmed to ſee the fever break out again with all the original ſymptoms in ſix or ſeven convaleſcents. By attention to the different circumſtances regarding fumigation, following the former treatment, and thinning the different rooms, matters are now brought to nearly the ſame good ſtate as before the re-appearance of the fever.</p>
               <p>The re-appearance of the fever, has however, not been entirely without its advantages, it has been the means of ſhewing me a fact, which eſpecially in military practice, I conceive to be of the firſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It has pointed out to me the efficacy of the nitrous fumigation in deſtroying dyſenteric contagion. I have often been witneſs to the rapidity with which the contagion of dyſentery flew through the wards of an hoſpital, and how apt convaleſcents from other
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:036328_0122_1008ED70585A7F40"/>
diſeaſes, and in particular from fever, were to be ſeized with this diſeaſe. Though thirteen caſes of dyſentery were ſent to the hoſpital, and ſome of them with very ſevere ſymptoms, I know only of two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances where the diſeaſe was communicated in the hoſpital, and with the exception of two chronic caſes, the cure in all, has been much ſpeedier than I have formerly ſeen it under the ſame treatment.</p>
               <p>Confident of ſucceſs, I wiſh much for opportunity of trying the fumigation in other contagious diſeaſes, particularly ſmall-pox. In two caſes of cynanche, attended with low fever, I uſed it, and both patients (officers) are now well. I ſhould be glad to hear if you have extended the trial to other diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Some other circumſtances regarding our fever, I think proper to mention to you.</p>
               <p>So ſanguine was I at one time, in my expectations from the fumigation, that in ſome caſes of the fever which I ſet apart, I truſted ſolely to nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly fumigating, but I ſoon ſaw that in theſe caſes I was rapidly loſing ground. I next in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the fumigation, followed Dr. Cullen's plan of treatment; this in every caſe protracted the cure, and in ſeveral inſtances, I was obliged totally to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the plan. Being in poſſeſſion of ſuch powerful means of deſtroying the contagion, as the nitrous fumigation, I ventured to take the opportunity of giving trial to, and comparing ſeveral of the modes of practice recommended in fever; but a compariſon of caſes as nearly equal as could be collected, gives the moſt decided ſuperiority to that recommended by Dr. Robertſon of Greenwich. But I think it likewiſe proper to mention, that under the type which fever lately aſſumed in this iſland, however proper the immediate exhibition of the bark was here, that it was by no means found ſo proper a remedy in other
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:036328_0123_1008ED71E254CD98"/>
ſituations. In the Weſt Indies, every trial given to the bark in the yellow fever during the paroxyſm, failed, and this not only with me, but in the hands of the phyſicians who had the charge of the largeſt hoſpitals their.</p>
               <p>I ſhall never ſufficiently regret my being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your diſcovery, while in the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and though doubtleſs it will for a time, meet with the fate of every other that has been made for the benefit of mankind; yet, if candid and liberal practitioners will but do their duty, and give it a trial, I am confident it muſt ſoon carry conviction, and that you will derive that credit from it, which you ſo juſtly deſerve.</p>
               <p>I have for ſome time been in the practice of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing journals of my caſes; every caſe of this fever that has occurred ſince its origin, has been regiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either by myſelf or by one of my aſſiſtants. The garriſon ſurgeon here, and his aſſiſtants likewiſe, have witneſſed the treatment: and the different facts mentioned in my memoir, are not unknown to ſeveral practitioners in the iſland. Any information which you may require from me at any time, regarding the trials of the nitrous acid, and the other means recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by you, I ſhall moſt readily give.</p>

Smyth.</p>
               <p>On the 17th of July laſt, a contagious fever of the typhus form, appeared in the 88th regiment in this iſland. In different ſituations, this regiment had ſuffered ſeverely for the laſt four years, from a fever of the ſame kind. In this iſland, three years ago, I had the misfortune to loſe, in the courſe of ten weeks, forty<note n="†" place="bottom">There ſeems to have been a miſtake here, as in his firſt letter to me, he ſtates the number to have been fifty.</note> men from this fever. Soon after our arrival in Jerſey, in laſt June, and but a ſhort time before the firſt caſe of this fever appeared, Dr. Smyth's work on fever came into my hands: I, therefore, on the firſt appearance of the fever, gave the fulleſt trial to the uſe of the nitrous acid, and as the reſult ſhews, with the beſt ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>The account which I here give, is extracted from two official memoirs, which I tranſmitted to the Army Medical Board on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>The fever had nothing remarkable in its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from typhus fever, as I have uſually ſeen it

occur, if I except the ſuddenneſs of the attack, often with delirium or epilepſy; a very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of debility; and a great proneneſs to relapſe. Two caſes had the ſcarlet eruption with angina, and the moſt of the firſt caſes, until they were ſent to camp, and were expoſed to a current of air, had petechiae. In moſt of the firſt caſes, the contagion could be clearly traced.</p>
               <p>On the firſt appearance of this fever, alarmed at the fatal iſſue of the firſt caſe, I myſelf not only carefully fumigated the hoſpital, the clothes, and bedding of the ſick, with nitrous acid, but my two aſſiſtants, Meſſrs. Bruce and Brown, likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fumigated the different barrack-rooms<note n="*" place="bottom">The rooms, by this proceſs, were rendered ſweet, and the men themſelves ſoon became ſenſible of the comfort of it.

               <p>Every man as ſoon as ſeized with the fever, was removed from the barracks, which are unhealthily ſituated, to tents pitched in a dry and airy ſituation, about a mile diſtant. The barracks were likewiſe thinned by encamping or removing from them, near half the regiment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>treatment</hi> in general was, by immediately exhibiting the bark after giving an emetic or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartic, and afterwards giving cordials, bliſters, &amp;c. as indicated. The lavatio frigida, in ſeveral caſes, ſeemed to anſwer exceedingly well.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> caſe, which appeared on the 17th of July, died on the fifth day, with ſymptoms which are uſually called highly putrid. This excited a very general alarm in the regiment.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here from my journal of caſes, and the copies of reports made to the Medical Board, give a ſtatement of the appearance of the caſes of the fever: nothing can afford ſtronger proof of the

               <p>From this time, till the ſick were removed from the tents, to a houſe where they were crowded, hardly another caſe appeared. At this period, however, about the 20th of October, the fever with the original ſymptoms again appeared among ſome convaleſcents and pneumonic caſes; but by putting in practice the nitrous fumigation, and thinning the wards of the hoſpital, the fever was again very ſoon got under.</p>

               <p>I have nothing at preſent to add to what Dr. Smyth has ſaid of the uſe of the nitrous acid; every trial which I have made hitherto, tends to confirm his experiments. I have ſet on foot a trial of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent other acids,<note n="†" place="bottom">We attempted, likewiſe, the extrication of the muriatic acid gas, but with great inconvenience, and it is obviouſly not ſo proper as the nitrous.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>HAVING with great pleaſure peruſed your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication on the fever, which prevailed among the Spaniſh priſoners of war at Wincheſter, and alſo, your account of the ſucceſs attending the nitrous fumigation, in deſtroying contagion on board the Union hoſpital ſhip, and on board a ſquadron of Ruſſian ſhips of war at the Nore; I determined to try its effects on board the hulks in Langſtone har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, near this town, the firſt opportunity that might offer.</p>
               <p>A fever of a contagious nature made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on board the ſaid hulks, in the month of July 1798, which ſoon became alarming, not from the number of ſick only, but from the rapidity with which it advanced to its laſt, or fatal ſtage. The number of patients continued increaſing from the 6th of July, to the 29th of Auguſt; in the former month ſixteen were received, in the latter ſixty-ſix. Upon my repreſenting to Mr. Dyne, contractor for the care of convicts on board the ſaid hulks, that I thought great benefit would enſue, if the method of fumigating recommended by you, was put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at Langſtone harbour, he with a liberal hand ſupplied the concentrated vitriolic acid and nitre, and humanely ordered that no expenſe might be ſpared in attempting to ſtop the progreſs of the fever.</p>
               <p>Pipkins, &amp;c. were procured here without loſs of time, and we began fumigating on board the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity hoſpital ſhip, on the 29th of Auguſt, 1798, at which time it contained fifteen very ill of fever, fifteen recovering from fever, (and three of other complaints left in July) thirty-one had returned to
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:036328_0130_1008ED84D0C15650"/>
the priſon cured, and five had paid the debt of nature.</p>
               <p>It was with extreme pleaſure I obſerved the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the vapour on many of the fever patients. I will ſtate them on one, which, with little vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, will ſerve for the reſt.</p>
               <p>Daniel Stowell, aged twenty-ſeven, was received into the hoſpital-ſhip on the 21ſt of Auguſt, where he had continued getting worſe till the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fumigation; he was then in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtate. A moſt ſevere and confuſed pain in his head, with intenſe heat on the ſkin, and inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thirſt; tongue rough and extremely dry, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing like a burnt cruſt, and of a blackiſh colour, inability to put it out of the mouth when deſired; teeth and gums covered with the ſame kind of fur as the tongue. Pulſe one hundred and thirty-one, ſmall and weak. The vapour made him cough very much, and he requeſted (his own words) <hi>to be ſmok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more;</hi> it was, however, repeated three times this day. Auguſt 30, Pulſe one hundred and one, and ſtronger, ſome moiſture on his tongue and gums, heat on the ſkin greatly decreaſed; head-ach much the ſame; thirſt not ſo intenſe: fumigated three times this day. Thirty-firſt, He was in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect better; continued the fumigation three times. September 1ſt, Pulſe ſeventy-nine, and ſtill ſtronger than the two preceding days; other ſymptoms much relieved: continued the fumigation. Second, Pulſe ſixty-eight, ſtrong and regular; his appetite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to take more nouriſhment than he had been able to do ſince his illneſs: from this day to the ninth, he continued getting better, and I now conſidered him in a ſtate of convaleſcence.</p>
               <p>It is proper here to remark, that this man had an ulcer on his right leg, extending from the outer
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:036328_0131_1008ED865C85C200"/>
ancle acroſs the anterior part of the tibia to the gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocnemius muſcle, at which part it was four inches broad and very deep, and diſcharged a thick ill-conditioned matter, which was very offenſive. Its length was rather more than ſix inches. After ſome days fumigating, I obſerved a change for the better in the appearance of the ulcer, and as I had tried a variety of methods to heal it, for many months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he became ill of the fever, without producing any good effect; I laid this change to the effects of the vapour. I now directed it to the ulcer itſelf, and continued its uſe till October the 30th, when his ulcer was cicatriſed; and I verily believe, to its efficacy is owing this poor man's cure. He is gone to New South Wales in the Hillſborough, which ſailed juſt before Chriſtmas laſt; I ſaw him the day before he embarked on board her, and the cicatrix was very firm: the ulcer was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of an old gun-ſhot wound.</p>
               <p>There is another caſe of ulcer which I think has mended greatly ſince I fumigated it; I am proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in the former caſe, and I have great reaſon to believe it will ultimately prove ſucceſsful. The only dreſſings uſed during the fumigation, or more correctly ſpeaking, after the commencement of the fumigation, were dry lint and ung. reſin. flav. over which was laid a rag of linen, conſtantly kept wet with aqua lytharg. acetat. diluted with water.</p>
               <p>Finding ſuch beneficial effects from the fumigation on board the hoſpital ſhip, in bringing the fever ſooner to a concluſion, by ſhortening all its ſtages, I determined to apply it to the ſource of the contagion; and accordingly the priſon-hulks, la Fortune and Ceres were fumigated every night from October the 15th to November the 20th, (except two nights, the ſervant who was ſent for the acid to town (Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea)
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:036328_0132_1008ED8919478EC0"/>
having ſtaid the firſt night at a public houſe, and did not arrive in time to fumigate the next night,) and I had the pleaſure of finding the ſick reduced to eight; and ſeven days had elapſed, and not one patient had been ſent to the hoſpital-ſhip. The fumigation was now diſcontinued.</p>
               <p>November the 21ſt, eight men were received from the Hillſborough Botany Bay ſhip, one of which number was in the laſt ſtage of a contagious fever, and two laboured under dyſentery. Several patients in a ſtate of recovery caught the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, and many attendants were taken ill with the diarrhoea and dyſentery; and as it was impoſſible to prevent communication with the priſon-hulks, the priſoners again became ſickly, and many died; ſome of whom were not ill three days before that awful event took place; and one man in particular died delirious twelve hours after he was received into the hoſpital-ſhip.</p>
               <p>The fumigation, which I conſidered as the anchor of hope, was again reſorted to November the 26th, and continued to the preſent time, January<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Smyth will be pleaſed to add three days more to the time which had elaſped on Sunday laſt (the 13th) without having received any patient whatever from the hulks into our hoſpital-ſhip—Poſtſcript of a Letter to Dr. Johnſton, dated the 16th of January.</note> 13th, 1799; and it is with ſuperlative ſatisfaction I add, that there has not been a patient received for the laſt eighteen days, neither is there a ſingle fever patient in the hoſpital.</p>
               <p>It is not my intention, neither is it neceſſary, to trouble you with a detail of my method of treating this fever; what I have to ſay relating only to the happy effects of the fumigation, and it is with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar pleaſure I aſſert, that the progreſs of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:036328_0133_1008ED8AC713AD10"/>
has been <hi>twice</hi> completely arreſted by perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in its uſe; it may, however, be neceſſary and proper to ſay a few words on its firſt introduction, and on its fatal effects on many who were its victims; I will, therefore, relate the caſe of one patient, which will ſhew inconteſtably the nature of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt perſon taken ill, was John Smith, a convict, who had been ſent from Newgate a ſhort time before. He informed me, July 6th, 1798, the day he was received on board the hoſpital-ſhip, that he had been ill of a fever in Newgate, and had not recovered his ſtrength when he was ſent to the hulks, at Langſtone harbour. The convicts having been remarkably healthy, previous to the reception of this man, and becoming very ſickly immediately after his admiſſion, I conſidered the fever as intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him. He complained this day, (July 6) of head-ach; pains in his back, loins, and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; his ſkin was very hot and thirſt great; tongue covered with a yellowiſh mucus; counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a yellow tinge, and great dejection of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; pulſe ninety-ſix, and weak. Seventh, All his ſymptoms ſeemed aggravated, his pulſe one hundred and ſeventeen. Eighth, He was delirious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, at leaſt, two attendants to keep him in his cradle; pulſe one hundred and forty. Ninth, He was covered with myriads of petechiae, and became extremely offenſive: I was now unable to reckon his pulſe. Tenth and Eleventh, His petechiae had run into each other ſo as to form large blotches. Twelfth, There was a great diſcharge from his noſe and ears, of a very dark colour and very thin. Thirteen and fourteen, The ſtench from him was offenſive in the extreme. On the fifteenth, he died univerſally convulſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:036328_0134_1008ED39E9FB6408"/>
The annexed table will ſhew the numbers taken ill before and after the commencement of the fumiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ninth and tenth of November were the days on which it was omitted, and it is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that although on the former day no patient had been ſent to the hoſpital, on the two ſucceeding days ſeven were brought each day.</p>
               <p>I have not, Sir, the honour of being known to you; but liberality and love of truth induce me to forward to you the above particulars, which I hope will be received as a token of that eſteem and regard with which</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>A friend of mine having informed me that you were preparing for the preſs ſome additional expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments to prove the utility of the nitrous acid fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation, in deſtroying contagion, I take the liberty of ſubmitting to your notice ſome facts which have occurred to me on this ſubject. If you will honour them with a peruſal, and think them of ſufficient importance, I ſhall feel myſelf highly flattered, ſhould they, through your ſanction, become more publicly known.</p>
               <p>From the 4th to the 12th of April, 1797, we were employed at this hoſpital in receiving priſoners infected with the jail-fever. Theſe men had recently arrived in ſome tranſports from Wales: They form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of a new regiment who had landed there, and who, previous to their ſailing from Breſt, had been releaſed from various priſons in France.</p>
               <p>This fever was generally attended with petechiae, and, in ſome caſes, the parotids were affected. From theſe ſymptoms, and from its being highly contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it was thought immediately neceſſary to fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate with the nitrous acid in greater quantity than we had hitherto done, and inſtead of <hi>three</hi> fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating pipkins in each ward, we increaſed them to <hi>ſix.</hi> This method appeared to have a very deſirable effect, for by filling a fever-ward with the vapour to ſuch a degree that the ſmalleſt part of it could not eſcape the influence of the nitrous gas, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed to render the air of that ward ſweet and refreſhing for ſome hours. Here I muſt beg leave to remark, notwithſtanding the prejudices that are abroad, that I never remember the vapour having appeared too powerful for any fever-patient to bear, and although phthiſically inclined myſelf I could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:036328_0137_1008ED96216E3E28"/>
ways bear it without inconvenience. If, however, ſome inconvenience ſhould occur, I conceive it only a ſecondary object of conſideration, when compared with the good effects to be derived from the fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, in checking contagion.</p>
               <p>The increaſed demand for the nitrous vapour, from the number of wards occupied in the hoſpital, occaſioned the conſumption of nearly three pints of the concentrated vitriolic acid, and a proportionate quantity of the purified nitre, each day. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of ſo increaſed a conſumption, if an object, is certainly over-balanced by the conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages reſulting from its uſe; for, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freſh contagion was every day brought into the hoſpital till the month of July, by means of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners received from the priſon-ſhips, we had the ſatisfaction to ſee the malignity of the fever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; and by the unremitted attention of the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of the royal hoſpital at Haſlar, with a due obſervance of cleanlineſs, we were authoriſed early in the month of Auguſt, to report to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for ſick and wounded ſeamen, that the jail fever which lately raged among the French priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at this port, exiſted no longer. The priſoners then, in proportion to their number, enjoyed an uſual ſhare of health, and which, previous to the introduction of the jail-fever, had been equal to the ſtate of health of any number of working men in the manufacturing towns of England.</p>
               <p>During the continuance of the jail-fever, <hi>very few</hi> of the eſtabliſhment of the hoſpital caught the diſtemper, conſidering the length of time it prevailed at Forton. Thoſe who received the contagion firſt, and were fond of drinking, either died, or had a very ſevere illneſs. Others, not ſo partial to liquor,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:036328_0138_1008ED98A0042AC0"/>
and who received the infection later, in general recovered.</p>
               <p>No putrid diſeaſe of any conſequence made its appearance again in the hoſpital until the 3d of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, 1798, when we received ſome priſoners from his Majeſty's priſon-ſhips, Fame and Portland. Theſe men, who had lately arrived in a tranſport from Falmouth, were affected with jail-fever; and on many of them petechiae appeared. I immediately acquainted the commiſſioners for ſick and wounded ſeamen of the circumſtance, who gave orders to the phyſicians of Haſlar hoſpital to viſit Forton, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to them accordingly.</p>
               <p>At this time the government of France had agreed to victual, clothe, and attend in ſickneſs, their own priſoners. The ſub-contractor in the medical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment did not, however, take charge of the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital at Forton, till the 11th of February following. We had, previous to that time, an opportunity of fumigating with the nitrous acid with apparent good effect. The buſineſs of the hoſpital from that time, came under the guidance of the French, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had two hundred and eighty-two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients put under their care, and upwards of one hundred of them affected with putrid fever, the acid vapour was totally diſcontinued for near five months. The ſtate of the hoſpital, from the 11th of February, was highly alarming, and extremely unfavourable to the health of the priſoners; the number on the hoſpital books increaſed daily, the wards were ſo neglected that they ſoon appeared dirty, and had an offenſive ſmell; the oeconomy of the buildings was not at all ſtudied for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ſick; fever and convaleſcent patients were not ſeparated, and in the courſe of twenty weeks two hundred and thirty-five priſoners died,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:036328_0139_1008ED9B376DDD78"/>
five hundred and thirty-ſeven remained ſick in the hoſpital; and the jail-fever was raging with great violence.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of May, Dr. Forzy, and Mr. Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, Surgeon, arrived here from France, who were appointed by the French government, inſpectors over their ſick and wounded priſoners in England. Theſe gentlemen were placed at this depôt to ſee that juſtice was done to the French priſoners. As they were verſed in the management of hoſpitals, they ſoon perceived the great inattention that had been paid to the ſick; and the irregular manner in which the duty of the hoſpital was carried on. They ſoon convinced Mr. Vochez of this ſituation of the ſick priſoners, who loſt no time in breaking the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and putting the management of the hoſpital into other hands, thinking it preferable to ſubject himſelf to the penalties of the law, than that one helpleſs priſoner ſhould ſuffer by the hand of inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able avidity and unfeeling neglect; a tranſaction highly honourable to Mr. Vochez, and the memory of which ſhould always remain ſtrongly impreſſed on the minds of thoſe who were, or might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by it.</p>
               <p>On the 1ſt day of July, Dr. Forzy and Mr. Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net commenced the management of this hoſpital in the medical department. Their chief object was to put the buildings into a general ſtate of cleanlineſs, and to fumigate the wards of the hoſpital with the nitrous acid. For this purpoſe Mr. Vochez very liberally purchaſed all that remained in the Engliſh ſtore, and likewiſe ſent down from London a large quantity of the concentrated vitriolic acid and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nitre. The acid vapour, together with the new ſyſtem of cleanlineſs, at the expiration of even ſo ſhort a period as ſeven days, cauſed a very ſenſible
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:036328_0140_1008ED9CCB325540"/>
change in the appearance of the patients, and the deaths, which during the previous week amounted to <hi>eighteen,</hi> were reduced to <hi>ſix</hi> the firſt week after the new adminiſtration took place. Every ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing week a more healthy aſpect preſented itſelf. At the end of the tenth, the hoſpital might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have nearly approached a ſtate of general convaleſcence. The number of contagious patients received from Portcheſter Caſtle, and the priſon-ſhips, were indeed conſiderably leſſened; yet the deaths which had occurred, were <hi>ſixty-nine</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although the patients in the hoſpital were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to two hundred and ſeventy-three. In the next enſuing ten weeks, the deaths decreaſed to thirty-ſeven; the number of patients was two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty-ſix. At this time all contagion had left us, and we had not received a patient with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid fever, from Portcheſter or the priſon-ſhips, for near three weeks; and I have great pleaſure in ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we have remained in the ſame healthy ſtate ever ſince, and have not more than three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſick in the hoſpitals of Forton and Portcheſter, though they contain the ſick of near ten thouſand priſoners at this port.</p>
               <p>I cannot help expreſſing the great praiſe that is due to Dr. Forzy and Mr. Brunet, for their very meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious exertions in forming ſuch ſalutary arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and putting the hoſpital into ſuch excellent diſcipline and order, and particularly for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common zeal, and the indefatigable pains they took to ſee the hoſpital well fumigated with the nitrous acid, which there cannot be a doubt was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtrumental in crowning their urgent endeavours with the deſired ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing ſtatement, I think no one can heſitate to beſtow the high encomiums that are
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:036328_0141_1008ED9F440EBA10"/>

               <p>IN anſwer to your favour of the 11th inſt. I have very little to add to what I have ſaid in my weekly reports, wherein the obvious difference of thirty the firſt week, and only three the next, being attacked with typhus, I in a great meaſure attribute to the nitrous fumigation, uſed in the way recommended by Dr. J. C. Smyth, from which it alſo appears, that of thirteen ill in this latter time, I had only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſend two to the hoſpital, and that the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo far ſubdued, that even nine got well on board, by the emetics, antimonials, &amp;c. uſed in the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, which I had not been able to accompliſh previous to the uſe of the nitrous fumigation; I muſt alſo add, that the keeping fires conſtantly burning, and the ſending thoſe to the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital who were firſt taken ill, might have ſome good effect; but the weather was ſo inceſſantly bad, we could not take advantage of wind ſails, and indeed laboured under every other inconvenience; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance's ſhips company at this time, being on board the Elephant (a ſeventy-four) as a hulk, in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:036328_0142_1008EDA2A8C604D0"/>
I imagine that the typhus fever was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the ſhip by women, two of whom I ſent on ſhore as ſoon as I diſcovered, one with a ſcarlet eruption, and certain degree of faetor—Both Dr. Lind and Dr. Hope, are of opinion, the fever was of a very dangerous and infectious nature, and from Dr. Hope's opinion, I was more particularly led to be very attentive in removing the ſick early to the hoſpital, but the nitrous vapour was ſcarcely uſed two days, when the ſymptoms abated, and has now entirely ceaſed.</p>
               <p>The method I uſed, was by holding the pipkins under the hammocks of thoſe with feveriſh ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and at night, eight were carried about the decks, when all the hammocks and people were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and this was attended with very little inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to thoſe in health. I have alſo uſed the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous vapour in the manner mentioned by Mr. Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ulcers and foul ſores, and I think, with obvious good effect, at leaſt the patients themſelves acknowledged it. I in general have a pot in fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, when I viſit the ſick in the cock-pit, which I really think, independent of the utility of applying ſores over it, tends to purify the air and diſpel faetor, its ſmoke is particularly pleaſant to me, and I often have it in my cabin, when the ſick are below. I ſhall be happy if theſe curſory obſervations appear to you at all ſatisfactory.</p>

               <p>AGREEABLY to the wiſh you expreſſed, of being informed of any obſervations I might happen to make on the effects of the nitrous acid fumigation, in checking or deſtroying contagion; I have for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time paſt, carefully attended to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that ſubject, eſpecially ſince I read Mr. Paterſon's ingenious letter addreſſed to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the Sick and Wounded Board: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have not been able to draw ſimilar concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with reſpect to its beneficial effects on patients afflicted with ulcers, it is becauſe I was leſs obſervant and attentive perhaps, to that point, not having pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed this gentleman's publication previous to my adopting a more ſucceſsful mode of treating ulcers, I hope than is generally practiſed or known.</p>
               <p>Whether the nitrous vapour has peculiar ſpecific powers for deſtroying contagion, is difficult to ſay. I have conſtantly fumigated the hoſpital wards three times a week, ſometimes oftener, and I have ſtrong reaſon to believe that the nitrous acid fumigation not only tends to prevent the ſpreading of contagion; but anſwers other ſalutary purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Among the various trials I had occaſion to make with the intent of aſcertaining its effects on putrid effluvia, a circumſtance occurred worthy of notice. The water cloſet adjoining the agent's office, became in the very hot weather of June and July laſt, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely offenſive, that Mr. Perrot and his clerks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that unleſs the faetor <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſome degree removed or mitigated, it would be impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue much longer in the apartment. It is a room of twelve feet ſquare: I ordered three pipkins in, and proceeded to fumigate for an hour, filling the place completely with the nitrous vapour. During
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:036328_0144_1008EDA8081D8F78"/>
this period, the door was unavoidably opened ſeveral times; but the agent, two clerks, and myſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there the whole time. It at firſt cauſed a little coughing; but in a few minutes that irritation ceaſed, and the vapour became rather grateful than otherwiſe. At the end of forty-five minutes, Mr. Gardner one of the clerks, declared he had felt for ſome time, an unuſual ſenſation of hunger, which at the concluſion was extremely importunate, and he that day ate, as he expreſſed himſelf, voraciouſly. Mr. Richards the other clerk, felt nearly ſimilar ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, though not ſo much expoſed to the vapour as the former, who kept ſtirring one of the pipkins frequently. As I did not feel ſenſations of a ſimilar nature at the time, I paid little attention to their obſervations; but on returning home, ſomewhat better than an hour after, my ſtomach became equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly importunate and craving for food, in ſo much ſo, that it was with the utmoſt difficulty I could refrain till the uſual hour of dining; and I may venture to ſay, that I ate nearly twice my ordinary quantity on that day.</p>
               <p>Ten days after this I had the wards more than uſually fumigated, in which I remained till the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the proceſs, and I felt equally affected with hunger, but although a more than common degree of flatulency attended it. I ought to mention that the agent's apartment was rendered perfectly ſweet and pleaſant, the faetor being wholly removed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Mr. Perrot was ſo ſenſible of the change, that he requeſted ſome days after, to have the fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation repeated, becauſe the ſmell had again become offenſive.</p>
               <p>Do not theſe facts evince the propriety of diffuſing the nitrous vapour copiouſly in the convaleſcent wards, where loſs of appetite, and want of tone in
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:036328_0145_1008EDAA73C403A0"/>
the digeſtive organs, often retard the perfect reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health?</p>
               <p>Another circumſtance well deſerving our regard, with reſpect to the effect of the nitrous fumigation on contagion, occurred. Some time ago we had nearly forty patients in the Dutch hoſpital dangerouſly ill with typhus fever; old men who had been recently captured in the Greenland ſhips, and who laboured under great dejection of ſpirits. They were taken ill in the priſons, ſhortly after their arrival at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Croſs, and although we had a great many pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents with ſlight complaints in the hoſpital, on the admiſſion of thoſe with typhus fever, yet not one of them, nor of the nurſes, caught the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>This was not the caſe in the priſons, for ſeveral of the old ſtandards there, were attacked with the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. During the continuance of the diſeaſe, we were unremitting in our attention to fumigate the wards of the hoſpital daily, with the addition of ſeveral pipkins more than were commonly employed.</p>
               <p>Are we not warranted then, in concluding that theſe prophylactic meaſures, prevented the contagion from ſpreading and infecting the patients in the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital; whilſt thoſe in the priſons not having equal advantages, were attacked with the fever?</p>
               <p>We were however fortunate enough to loſe no more than one patient, who died on the ſeventh day in a highly putrid ſtate; a clear proof of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant tendency, and contagious nature of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>I could enumerate a variety of other inſtances, where it appeared to me that the nitrous acid fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was attended with ſalutary effects; but what has been already ſaid is, I hope, ſufficient to ſhew that many benefits are likely to accrue from a more extenſive uſe of this medicine; and that it ought
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:036328_0146_1008EDAE262DF4D0"/>
almoſt on every occaſion, to have the preference to all other modes of fumigating, where contagion is prevalent.</p>
               <p>It might certainly be uſed with much propriety and advantage in the ſick births, and between decks, on board his Majeſty's ſhips of war. It is true, where great moiſture prevails, which is unavoidably the caſe in men of war, fires are abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; after which the nitrous gas ſhould be liberally diffuſed throughout the ſhip: but prejudice, which frequently warps the beſt underſtanding, prevents many from adopting ſalutary meaſures, becauſe theſe means had not been originally ſuggeſted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or becauſe they happen to militate againſt ſome preconceived and favourite opinion.</p>
               <p>But before gentlemen decide on any remedy held out to the public in a fair and candid manner, they ſhould firſt ſubject this remedy to actual experiment, and then determine for or againſt it, according to the unprejudiced reſult.</p>
               <p>I do not pretend to ſay that the nitrous acid ought to ſuperſede all other preventive remedies; on the contrary, ventilation and cleanlineſs muſt likewiſe be conjoined with it: but where contagious fever prevails, there is every reaſon to believe that theſe will prove the moſt effectual external means to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it.</p>
               <p>I thought it my duty to ſay thus much in juſtice to the ingenious inventor of the nitrous acid fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>

               <head>Extract of a Letter from JOHN SNIPE, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> formerly Surgeon of the Sandwich, now Surgeon to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Hoſpital at Yarmouth. Dated Yarmouth, June 17, 1798.</head>
               <p>ON the 9th of March, when I joined the Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, a contagious fever raged in that ſhip, there were daily ten, twelve, or fifteen men ſent to the hoſpital with fever and ulcerated legs. You are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acquainted with the ſteps that were taken to ſubdue this. Our ſucceſs I attribute to cleanlineſs, free ventilation, and the diffuſing daily the nitrous gas through every part of the ſhip, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that had that ſhip been fumigated three or four times a week, with the nitrous vapour, no ſuch fever would ever have been generated, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great number of men that were on board. Suffice it to ſay, that in three months, this ſhip was as healthy as any other of her claſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we never had leſs than 1000 and often 1500 men on board. During the laſt twelve weeks that ſhe was in commiſſion, I only ſent eight men to the hoſpital. When I firſt joined her, the ſmalleſt ſcratch rapidly degenerated into a foul ulcer, but after the febrile contagion was ſubdued, ſores heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as kindly as in any other ſhip.</p>
               <p>About three weeks before ſhe was paid off, an Italian cut one of the ſeamen in the thigh with his knife, the wound was about ſix inches long, and nearly two deep, it was ſtitched up, and a double-headed roller applied; it healed by the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which was a proof that no contagion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the ſhip.</p>
               <p>From ſome experiments I have made, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to think that febrile contagion, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral exhalations from the human body, are of an
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:036328_0148_1008EDB2214DFC58"/>
alkaline nature, and that the nitrous vapour equally ſubtile, penetrating into every crevice or corner, wherever it meets the former, deſtroys its peſtiferous qualities, and renders it as inactive as a drop of water. I have repeatedly condenſed the breath and perſpiration of patients in typhus fever, and upon adding an acid to it, an efferveſcence was viſible: the method I took to obtain a ſufficient quantity of liquid for the experiment, was to make the patients breathe on cold panes of glaſs, and to put the ſame under the bed-clothes, cloſe to the ſkin, when in a ſtate of perſpiration; in this way half an ounce may be procured in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>Fumigating with the nitrous vapour cannot be too ſtrongly recommended on board of all ſhips, in barracks, hoſpitals, priſons, cloſe cellars, and houſes that are not conſtantly inhabited. Some time ago I had occaſion to go to a ſtore room, that had not been looked into for three weeks or a month, it contained the bedding uſed by the Dutch priſoners before they were ſent to Holland, the whole of which had been fumigated, expoſed to the ſun for two days, afterwards waſhed and perfectly dried before they were put in ſtore; yet the room ſmelled very badly. I immediately ordered it to be fumigated with ſix pipkins, and next morning it ſmelled perfectly ſweet: for which reaſon I have, and mean to fumigate all the ſtore-rooms, every week.</p>
               <p>Laſt winter I tried the nitrous vapour with ſome of the worſt ulcers that perhaps were ever ſeen in any country; the pipkins were placed under the naked ſores. It gave ſome pain, and I could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any good effects from it, but I beg leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that this was not the fault of the remedy, but the untractable nature of the diſeaſe, for in many caſes, no internal medicine, nor external application,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:036328_0149_1008EDB40BE0B1F8"/>
had the leaſt effect, amputation alone ſaved the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's life. I mentioned this in a letter to Dr. Blane, at the time, but ſince then, I have found it of eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſervice in cleaning foul ulcers, buboes, and ſtumps; and I do not heſitate to give it as my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that if it is properly applied in time, it will be found to be of more ſervice than moſt of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal applications that are at preſent uſed. You are well aware that in many caſes, we have to lament the failure of every exertion.</p>
               <p>It is with heartfelt pleaſure I ſay, that I have loſt very few in fevers, ſince I have been at Yarmouth, although we have received a great number in the low typhus fever into the hoſpital<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor is there one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the contagion being communicated to the ſurrounding patients, which I attribute to the nitrous gas, cleanlineſs and free ventilation.</p>
               <p>When the wards were filled with the nitrous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, patients who had weak lungs, coughed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently at firſt, but they breathed more freely after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, eſpecially if the atmoſphere was thick and heavy, but I never obſerved any bad effects from it, even with patients in the laſt ſtage of conſumption. The nitrous vapour has a moſt aſtoniſhing effect in correcting the faetor in the wards, ariſing from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive bad ulcers: this alone is a great comfort both to the patients and attendants. I have ſo high an opinion of the nitrous vapour for deſtroying conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and as a corrector of foul air, that I have in the ſtrongeſt manner recommended the uſe of it to ſeveral of my friends, in the different factories in the Mediterranean.</p>
               <p>There are many navy ſurgeons prejudiced againſt the nitrous fumigation, beſides it gives ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which will at all times operate powerfully with the indolent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="unknown:036328_0150_1008EDB840A05EB0"/>
Much praiſe is due to the ingenious author of the nitrous vapour. I have not the honour of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, nor did I ever read a word he wrote (for which I bluſh) on the ſubject, but I ſhould be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in candour if I did not faithfully relate facts as I found them; and in my opinion, the nitrous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour tends greatly to deſtroy contagion, and is a moſt powerful corrector of foul air. Query, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not does it give an additional quantity of oxygen (pabulum vitae) to the ſurrounding atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, where it is diffuſed.</p>
               <p>I do not expect to have fewer patients in the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital than we have at preſent: there are fifty-three ſhips of war employed in the North Sea, and they never go to Sheerneſs but when in want of repairs. When the fleet comes in, I expect to get fifty or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty freſh patients, and they are weekly ſending in ſick by the frigates and cutters. There are only two men in the hoſpital that were wounded in Lord Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can's action, and the bad ulcers that were received laſt winter are moſtly gone, yet the number is ſtill kept up. There are more caſes of ulcer received into this hoſpital, in proportion, than into the two royal hoſpitals, ulcers as well as pectoral complaints being more frequent in the North Sea, than in the Channel. I have alſo remarked that thoſe who had the moſt obſtinate ulcers had been for ſome years during the war in the Eaſt or Weſt Indies, or in the Mediterranean.</p>
               <p>I have an ample field here for obſervation, but little time to put my obſervations on paper, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hoſpital, ſick quarters, and priſon, I am kept conſtantly employed.</p>

But we never had ſo long a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of that healthy ſtate, as while this vapour was uſed in the hoſpital; and it deſerves notice, that ſoon after it was diſcontinued, under the French ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, the typhus fever again made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with conſiderable ſeverity. No inſtance, to the beſt of my recollection, has occurred of that diſeaſe being communicated either to nurſe or patient, whilſt the nitrous fumigation was employed; whereas many inſtances occurred from time to time, previous to its uſe. The difference on entering a ſurgery ward, after uſing the fumigation, is more remarkable than any other, as it deprives thoſe wards of the ſmell peculiar to them. I have alſo remarked, that fewer patients, with extenſive ulcers, whilſt this was uſed, became hectic, than formerly. In regard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive patients, I am not at preſent qualified to ſpeak decidedly from any proofs I recollect of its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, but judging from analogy, I am induced to believe that patients of this deſcription are as likely to receive relief (in ſo far at leaſt as the nature of the complaint admits) as patients in any other diſeaſe; for whatever diſlodges from the air, or corrects the noxious particles accumulated from the effluvia of diſeaſed bodies, muſt mitigate the ſymptoms of this
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:036328_0152_1008EDBC8170D5E0"/>
diſeaſe. No arguments I am maſter of can induce the French ſurgeons to adopt it; they complain of its exciting cough, and injuring the catarrhal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. They content themſelves with burning a few pounds of juniper berries, daily in each hoſpital, notwithſtanding the effect of the diſcontinuance of the former practice, has been evident enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any unprejudiced perſon which deſerves the preference. On the whole, I infer, that the <hi>nitrous vapour</hi> is poſſeſſed of ſtrong antiſeptic qualities—is capable of being adminiſtered in every diſeaſe—can be procured with facility in all places—requires no extra information in the operator; and, in ſhort, is the beſt fumigation I am acquainted with, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed where the patients remain in the wards.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>HAVING been particularly engaged with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral for ſome days paſt, I have not been able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your letter before, otherwiſe I ſhould not have been ſo tardy in expreſſing the ſatisfaction I feel, in offering my teſtimony of the apparent advantages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from fumigating with the nitrous acid, in check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt, if not in ſtopping contagion. Had I ſuppoſed that the ſmalleſt doubt remained on the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:036328_0153_1008EDBF360D18E0"/>
ſubject, I ſhould have kept a very minute account of every experiment, but as I conceived the thing to have been uncontrovertibly proved before, I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied myſelf with having recourſe to it, whenever there was any appearance of occaſion for ſo doing, and I can with ſafety ſay, without ever having been diſappointed. On receipt of your letter, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent it to Mr. Harris, who has returned it to me, and who I find is exactly in the ſame predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as myſelf, having been prevented making any particular remarks, by entertaining the ſame opinion of its efficacy as I had, and having been equally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the reſult of his experiments.</p>
               <p>With regard to the comparative degree of ſickneſs between the priſons and ſhips, I muſt refer you to the weekly returns. I can however ſay, that when I firſt obtained Dr. Smyth's fumigating materials for the latter, a typhus fever was raging on board the <hi>Prudent,</hi> which in Mr. Harris's opinion, was ſo far alarming as to induce me to remove the people from her for a few days, during which time I had her twice fumigated and the decks white-waſhed, after which, the ſame priſoners were returned to her, and ſhe has ſince been as healthy as the other ſhips. When it is conſidered how hot the weather has been, and that I have at times been obliged to put as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as 600 priſoners in the ſixty-fours, I am induced to attribute the preſervation of their health, to the effect of the fumigation, which regularly takes place every Thurſday morning in all the ſhips when the weather permits, having long ſince eſtabliſhed a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to enſure its never being neglected in any of them. With reſpect to the priſon and hoſpital, I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Harris that whilſt he had the materials for the nitrous fumigation, it was made uſe of when wanted, and always with the deſired effect, but on
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:036328_0154_1008EDC2D96459D8"/>
the French government taking charge of the ſick, the fumigating materials were returned to the Royal hoſpitals along with the other ſtores.</p>
               <p>Sorry I am indeed not to have it in my power to be more particular, for nothing can be more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily proved in my mind, than the efficacy of Dr. Smyth's means of checking, if not of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contagion, and I cannot but congratulate that gentleman on a diſcovery which I certainly conſider as highly beneficial to mankind, as it muſt be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his feelings.</p>

               <p>As a fumigation for a ſick room, I conſider the <hi>nitrous vapour</hi> as an elegant, ingenious, and uſeful one. In the morning whilſt dreſſing the ſores, two pots are employed for fumigating them, the ſmoke or vaporous gas evidently ſweetens the air, and I do not obſerve that any particular irritation of the lungs is excited; I have two patients labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der phthyſis pulmonalis, they are commonly placed near to the perſons fumigating. I do not find that they cough more than uſual, unleſs they hold their heads over the fumigating veſſel. I commonly fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migate the ſick birth every night, and the people who ſleep there, ſay the place feels wholeſomer than

it does when not fumigated. As for its producing contagion, I have no reaſon to believe it does, at leaſt I have never as yet found correctors or ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of foul air, have that effect.</p>
               <p>Some of my brethren here declare that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſuch a heavenly diſcovery for the cure of ulcers of all kinds, as the fumigation with the nitrous gas; and that it poſſeſſes a ſingular healing power (in all habits) which never fails; if ſo, I am ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly unfortunate. I have heard of Paterſon's pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet ſent to the Captains and Admirals; I am pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a reading of it; I ſhall then be able to judge how far I have adminiſtered the vapour with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</p>

               <p>All the intermittent fevers and aguiſh complaints moſtly proceeded from the badneſs of the weather, and the lowneſs of, and dampneſs of the Unité, as the breathing of the people, and the wetneſs of the ſhip produced an infectious kind of air, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed to cauſe numbers to be taken ill, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the uſe of ſtoves, and conſtant fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation compoſed of vitriolic acid and nitre, which I found to be very uſeful, particularly in two caſes of putrid fevers, as by conſtantly fumigating the place where they lay, the infection did not attack any more of the ſhip's company; the exhalations, I think would anſwer better if the fumigating pots were of another conſtruction, which I refer to your determination.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I am now to acknowledge your obliging favour of the 17th of February laſt, to which I did not give an immediate anſwer, being engaged in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment on board the Union, which I undertook at the requeſt of the Lords Commiſſioners of the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:036328_0162_1008EDD6FB8B5CC8"/>
Admiralty, and the reſult of which I was deſirous to communicate to you, as the beſt and moſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory reply I could give to your letter. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Mr. Johnſon to ſend you a copy of my pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet on that ſubject, as ſoon as it was printed. Although I have been prevented from writing to you till now, owing to a variety of engagements and buſineſs, which it is needleſs here to explain, I can aſſure you I have not been forgetful of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent undertaking of your Board of Health, which reflects ſo much honour on the gentlemen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, and to which I ſhall be at all times happy to contribute any aſſiſtance in my power to give. The very limited ſphere of contagion is ſo well aſcertained, that I have occaſion to ſay little on the ſubject. In my book on the jail-fever, I have mentioned, after many year's experience as phyſician to an Hoſpital, into which more typhus fevers were admitted in proportion than into any other, that the moſt highly contagious fevers, that occur in our hoſpitals, do not affect the patients in general, lodged in the ſame ward; for we had no appropriate fever wards; nor did I ever ſee the neceſſity for ſuch, as the communication of infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in general eaſily prevented by the means I employed. I have alſo mentioned, that there is no, or very trifling riſk of contagious fevers being propagated in the open air, ſtill leſs from one room or ward to another; and that I never knew contagion propagated by a dead body, even from the diſſection of it, unleſs by inoculation. But, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently of all theſe obſervations, the fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the nitrous acid, if properly employed, not only certainly deſtroys contagion, but improves greatly the atmoſpheric air, by ſupplying a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of dephlogiſticated air, or oxygen gas; and it
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:036328_0163_1008EDD88ED610B0"/>
effectually deſtroys all offenſive ſmell. I alſo, as you muſt have obſerved, uſe the diluted marine acid for waſhing the floors, bedſteads, &amp;c. and put ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine acid in the pails of water uſed for immerſing the foul linen, &amp;c. In bed-chambers and private apartments I generally keep up, where there is a contagious diſeaſe, a conſtant fumigation; which can eaſily be done by means of a lamp, over which is placed a china cup or ſaucer, with oil of vitriol and nitre, an ounce and a half or two ounces of each being ſufficient for twenty-four hours. If you have any queries to put to me, I need hardly aſſure you, that I ſhall take a pleaſure in anſwering them, and at all times of convincing you of the regard and eſteem of, my dear Sir,</p>

                  <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I am this moment favoured with your letter of the 30th of July. I can have no objection to your making any uſe, public or private, of my letter to you. The accuracy of the facts I will be anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for; but as it was a private communication to a particular friend, I was little attentive to ſtyle or manner. Reſpecting the limited ſphere of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion I ſaid the leſs, as I conſidered it a matter ſo well aſcertained, and by ſuch a body of evidence, as required no additional proof. Mankind have been led into error, on this ſubject, by confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:036328_0164_1008EDDA79D079E0"/>
under the general name of contagious or epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, diſeaſes of very different natures and origin. But of all thoſe contagions, that are propagated from one diſeaſed perſon, or his clothes, to another perſon, the ſphere of the deleterious power is in general ſo extremely limited, that there have been, and ſtill are, ſome phyſicians, who believe they are only propagated by contact. At Wincheſter, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſtay there, one ſoldier only, whilſt doing duty on the priſoners in the airing-ground, was ſeized with the diſtemper; and very few of the military ſuffered, although the guard-room was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under one of the priſon-wards, and the ſentinels mixed with the priſoners even in the courts and paſſages of the king's houſe or priſon. And lately, on board the Union, none of the officers ſuffered, and few of the petty-officers; nor would the ſhip's company have ſuffered ſo ſeverely as they did, could their intercourſe with the nurſes and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants in the hoſpital have been prevented. But, independently of the limited ſphere of contagion, I will venture to enſure even the nurſes and hoſpital aſſiſtants, in any ſituation, if they will be induced to uſe the proper precautions, and if the hoſpital is properly fumigated; the wards ſprinkled with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted marine acid; the dirty linen, &amp;c. immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immerſed in pails, filled with cold water impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with marine acid; the chamber-pots, ſoil-tubs, &amp;c. quickly removed and waſhed with the ſame; the bedſteads waſhed every time they are empty with the diluted marine acid; and the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes fumigated with the nitrous vapour. In hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals crowded with ſick, in ſhips, priſons, &amp;c. it is neceſſary to fumigate completely every part of the ſhip, priſon, &amp;c. twice a day. But in common caſes, and in private practice, ſuch means are not
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:036328_0165_1008EDDE1F8D35A0"/>
neceſſary; and one, two, or three fumigating lamps, in which a conſtant fumigation is kept up, night and day, ſo as to paſs over the beds of the ſick, are perfectly ſufficient. In this manner I have not only ſtopped the common contagion in the hoſpital and in private, but I have equally ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is of great conſequence to be known, in preventing the ſcarlatina anginoſa, or putrid ſore throat, from being communicated to the reſt of the family, living under the ſame roof. Whether this will apply to the ſmall-pox, I cannot ſay from my own experience; but I have been told by Dr. Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, Surgeon to the Artillery, and Mr. Cruick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhank, Profeſſor Royal of Chemiſtry to the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that it deſtroys the <hi>miaſma</hi> of the ſmall-pox; and that of two quantities of matter, taken for the purpoſe of inoculation, one was expoſed to the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous vapour, the other not: the perſons inoculated with the firſt were not ſeized with the diſeaſe, whilſt the inoculation took the uſual effect, when performed with the ſecond.</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>WHOEVER reads the preceding pages with attention, muſt be ſtruck with the great conformity of opinion, obſervable amongſt the different indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, in regard to the principal object of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the power of the nitrous vapour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy contagion.</p>
            <p>But although the ſame ſentiment univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, I cannot help remarking, that whilſt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome gentlemen is founded on general obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation alone, the opinion of others is ſupported by ſuch an accurate detail of facts reduced to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of arithmetical calculation, as carry with them a conviction, little ſhort of demonſtration it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>The power of the nitrous vapour on contagion once eſtabliſhed, all its other effects can eaſily be underſtood and explained; one of the moſt obvious of theſe is its deſtroying putrid ſmell. Although I am far from imagining that putrid ſmell and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion are one and the ſame, on the contrary, am convinced that they often exiſt independent of each other, yet as they are of the ſame family, and ariſe from a common cauſe, we may fairly ſuppoſe from analogy, that what deſtroys the one, will prove effectual in deſtroying the other. I confeſs, that where there is a direct and poſitive proof, as in the
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:036328_0167_1008EDE30A4BAA78"/>
preſent inſtance, reaſoning from analogy is of little conſequence. The obſervation, however, is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf important, particularly for thoſe whoſe duty leads them to an attendance on the ſick, as the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive ſmell to which they are expoſed, conſtitutes not the leaſt diſagreeable part of ſuch an office.</p>
            <p>But beſides removing the offenſive ſmell of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals and priſons, another advantage of the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous fumigation is that of rendering the air purer and ſitter for the purpoſes of animal life; a fact which chemiſtry readily explains. From it we learn, that in the decompoſition of nitre by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolic acid, a certain proportion of vital air,<note n="*" place="bottom">In anſwer to Dr. Smyth's queſtion, What is the proportion of oxygen and nitric acid, diſengaged by add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half an ounce of oil of vitriol to half an ounce of nitre? I reply that I do not recollect any experiment which has been publiſhed to aſcertain the proportion of oxygenous air thus extricated, though the fact of its extrication is well known, &amp;c.—<hi>Extract of a Letter from Mr. Keir of Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham.</hi>
               </note> or oxygen gas, is let looſe; and phyſiology informs us, that this air, which conſtitutes a very intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of our atmoſphere, is neceſſary for the reſpiration of animals, at the ſame time that it is conſtantly conſumed by it.</p>
            <p>In a former publication I did not heſitate to give a decided opinion, (judging partly from experience, and partly from the ſimilarity of putrid contagions) that the nitrous vapour would be found equally an antidote to all,<note n="†" place="bottom">This fact becomes the more important, it being now clearly aſcertained, that the yellow fever, in America at leaſt, is produced by imported contagion. The advantage to a commercial country of being able to counteract all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of this kind, without ſubjecting the merchant to the expenſe and delay of quarantines, is hardly to be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</note> even to the plague itſelf. I have
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:036328_0168_1008EDE5AA284450"/>
now the ſatisfaction to ſee this opinion confirmed, in ſo far at leaſt, as relates to the dyſentery, a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid diſeaſe equally contagious with the jail fever, and in military hoſpitals, at leaſt, ſtill more fatal.</p>
            <p>The efficacy, however, of the nitrous vapour, as appears from almoſt the whole of the reports, is not confined to the deſtroying or preventing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of contagion; its ſalutary influence is no leſs remarkable on the ſick and on thoſe recovering from ſickneſs; but on this very important ſubject, I could wiſh the reader to conſult Mr. Paterſon's Table of the Weekly Returns at Forton Hoſpital, from which it appears, that during the ſhort ſpace of ſix weeks, in an hoſpital containing from 300 to 400 men, there was a difference, from employing the nitrous fumigation, of about 50 lives ſaved, and about 110 men reſtored to a ſtate of health fit for active duty; but if the reader is deſirous of forming an accurate judgement of the immediate effect of the nitrous vapour on thoſe ill of typhus fever, I would adviſe him to read with attention, what Mr. M'Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and Mr. Hill have written on the ſubject.—By Mr. M'Grigor we are told, that ſome years back, during the prevalence of a fever ſimilar to the one he deſcribes, in the ſame place, the iſland of Jerſey, the 88th regiment to which he belongs, in the ſpace of ten weeks, ſuffered a loſs of 40 or 50 men; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as during the preſent illneſs, when he employed the nitrous fumigation, of 64 men ſeized with the fever, he did not loſe a ſingle patient. He further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, that by uſing conſtantly the nitrous vapour, the malignant ſymptoms of the diſeaſe diſappeared, and that from a typhus it became a ſimple fever.</p>
            <p>But of all the advantages to be derived from the uſe of the nitrous vapour, none is more remarkable or likely to be of ſuch extenſive application as its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:036328_0169_1008EDE827257C00"/>
on ulcers, an effect firſt taken notice of by Mr. Paterſon, and which has been confirmed, upon every ſubſequent trial.</p>
            <p>That the nitrous vapour, by correcting the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and contagious air of hoſpitals, which is known to affect<note n="*" place="bottom">Having related the moſt diſtinguiſhing marks of this fever, I ſhall only add, that there are ſometimes ſlight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it hardly to be characterized; and which can only be diſcovered in full hoſpitals, by obſerving the men to languiſh, though the nature of illneſs for which they came in ſhould ſeem to admit of a ſpeedier cure. In ſuch caſes the only ſymptoms are ſlight head-achs, a whitiſh tongue, want of appetite, and other inconſiderable feveriſh ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. Vid. Pringle on the Jail or Hoſpital Fever.</note> more or leſs, all perſons confined in them, ſhould ſo far at leaſt prove ſerviceable to thoſe affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ulcers, and in general to ſurgical patients; we can readily believe, and indeed it is an induction to which we ſhould have been led, reaſoning as it called <hi>a priori.</hi> But the nitrous vapour ſeems to be not only uſeful in this way, it is found of efficacy alſo as a topic or local application; its operation, however, as ſuch, muſt have its limits; to ſuppoſe that it will prove a univerſal remedy for all ulcers, is an idea that cannot be entertained for a moment, by any one in the leaſt converſant with the animal oeconomy, or with the hiſtory of diſeaſes. Thoſe perſons who are too precipitate in general concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have commonly ſome ground to go back again.</p>
            <p>Were I to form a conjecture reſpecting the kind of ulcers in which the nitric acid, either in a gaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or liquid ſtate, is likely to be found moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable; I ſhould ſay, the ſloughy or ſphacelous, the ſcrophulous, and the ſcorbutic: but thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who are profeſſionally engaged in the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:036328_0170_1008EDEAA878D700"/>
of ſuch complaints, will look upon this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation more as a hint than an opinion.</p>
            <p>The preceding effects of the nitrous vapour are what have been obſerved by all or by many; but there is one which reſts as yet on the authority of Mr. Paterſon alone. He only has made trial of it, and with ſucceſs, in the hooping-cough. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on this ſubject, I muſt ſay, are extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, and open a wide field for the reflexion and experience of the practical phyſician.</p>
            <p>Having finiſhed the few obſervations I had to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, on the letters and reports which I have now the honour to lay before the public; the reader I hope will pardon me if I detain him a few minutes longer, to make one remark which relates principally to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It cannot have eſcaped his notice any more than it has done mine, that, as appears by ſeveral of the letters, there are prejudices entertained againſt the nitrous fumigation by many ſurgeons of the navy. At this I am by no means ſurpriſed; we are all children of habit, and unwilling to relinquiſh opinions which we entertained in early life: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, however, of the nitrous fumigation into the navy, has been oppoſed not by prejudice only, but by arguments drawn from chemiſtry. It would be no very difficult taſk for me to point out the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of ſuch chemical reaſoning, but to endeavour to refute by argument what is directly contrary to experience and obſervation, would be an abuſe of time, and an inſult to the public judgment. The only anſwer then that I ſhall give to ſuch philoſophers, is to addreſs them in the words of an author, whoſe opinion muſt be conſidered of high authority on ſuch a ſubject, as he was not only a phyſician of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but certainly one of the firſt chemiſts in Europe; the circumſtances and occaſions were perfectly ſimilar.
