            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The requiſite expenſe and time, however, for acquiring this information, are neither within the reach of every purſe, nor the leiſure of every reader.

                     <p>America is one of the four quarters of the world, probably, the largeſt of the whole, and is, from its late diſcovery, frequently denominated the <hi>New World,</hi> or <hi>New Hemiſphere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This vaſt country extends from the 80th degree of north, to the 56th degree of ſouth, latitude; and, where its breadth is known, from the 35th to the 136th degree weſt longitude from London; ſtretching between 8000 and 9000 miles in length, and in its greateſt breadth 3690. It ſees both hemiſpheres, has
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028963_0007_0FDDBD329AEB8A60"/>two ſummers and a double winter, and enjoys almoſt all the variety of climates which the earth affords. It is waſhed by the two great oceans. To the eaſtward, it has the Atlantic, which divides it from Europe and Africa; to the weſt, it has the Pacific or Great South Sea, by which it is ſeparated from Aſia. By theſe ſeas it may, and does, carry on a direct commerce with the other three parts of the world.</p>
                     <p>America is not of equal breadth throughout its whole extent; but is divided into two great continents, called <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>South, America,</hi> by an iſthmus 1500 miles long, and which, at Darien, about Lat. 9° N. is only 60 miles over. This iſthmus forms, with the northern and ſouthern continents, a vaſt gulph, in which lie a great number of iſlands, called the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in contradiſtinction to the eaſtern parts of Aſia, which are called the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next to the extent of the New World, the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the objects which it preſents to view, is moſt apt to ſtrike the eye of an obſerver. Nature ſeems here to have carried on her operations upon a larger ſcale and with a bolder hand, and to have diſtinguiſhed the features of this country by a peculiar magnificence. The mountains of America are much ſuperior in height to thoſe in the other diviſions of the globe. Even the plain of Quito, which may be conſidered as the baſe of the Andes, is elevated farther above the ſea than the top of the Pyrenees. The moſt elevated point of the Andes, according to Don Ulloa, is twenty thouſand, two hundred, and eighty feet, which is, at leaſt, ſeven thouſand, one hundred, and two feet above the Peak of Teneriffe, which is the higheſt known mountain in the ancient continent.</p>
                     <p>From the lofty and extenſive mountains of America, deſcend rivers with which the ſtreams of Europe, of Aſia, or of Africa, are not to be compared, either for length of courſe, or for the vaſt volumes of water which they pour into the oceans. The Danube, the Indus
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028963_0007_0FDDBD329AEB8A60"/>the Ganges, or the Nile, in the Ancient Hemiſphere, are not of equal magnitude with the St. Lawrence, the Miſſouri, or the Miſſiſſippi, in North America; or the Maragnon, the Oroonoko, or the Plata, in South Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. The rivers in the latter of theſe American conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents are like vaſt arms of the ſea.</p>
                     <p>The lakes of the New World are no leſs conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for grandeur than its mountains and rivers. There is nothing in other parts of the globe which reſembles the prodigious chain of lakes in North America. They may be properly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The luxuriance of the vegetable creation in the New World is extremely great. In the ſouthern provinces, where the moiſture of the climate is aided by the warmth of the ſun, the woods are almoſt impervious, and the ſurface of the ground is hid from the eye, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a thick covering of ſhrubs, of herbs, and weeds. In the northern provinces, although the foreſts are not encumbered with the ſame wild luxuriance of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the trees of various ſpecies are generally more lofty, and often much larger, than are to be ſeen in any other parts of the world.</p>

                     <p>WE will now turn our attention to the <hi>Aborigines,</hi> or natives of the New World. At the time when his great continent was made more generally known
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028963_0008_0FDDBD35AA3C58F0"/>to the Europeans by the diſcoveries of Chriſtopher Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, and of the illuſtrious navigators who imbibed the ſpirit and enthuſiaſm of that great man, it was found inhabited by various tribes and nations of men, who differed, in many reſpects, from moſt of the people in the three other quarters of the world. In their phyſical hiſtory, however, the greateſt peculiarity in the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans is their complexion, and the little difference which is obſerved, in this reſpect, throughout the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the American continent.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of the inland parts of South Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, where that continent is wideſt, and conſequently, the influence of the ſun moſt powerful, have never been accurately compared with thoſe of Canada, or more northerly parts, at leaſt as far as we know. Yet this ought to have been done, and that in many inſtances too, before it could be aſſerted ſo poſitively, as moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do, that <hi>there is not the leaſt difference of complexion among the natives of America.</hi> Indeed, ſo many ſyſtems have been formed concerning theſe ſingular people, that it is very difficult to obtain a true knowledge of the moſt ſimple facts, even from the beſt and moſt unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced writers.—If we may believe the Abbé Raynal, the Californians are ſwarthier than the Mexicans; and ſo poſitive is he in this opinion, that he gives a reaſon for it. "This difference of colour," ſays he, "proves, that the civilized life of ſociety ſubverts, or totally changes, the order and laws of nature, ſince we find, under the temperate zone, a ſavage people that are blacker than the civilized nations of the torrid zone."—On the other hand, Dr. Robertſon claſſes all the inhabitants of Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh America together with regard to colour, whether they are civilized or uncivilized; and when he ſpeaks of Californa, takes no notice of any peculiarity in their colour more than others.—The general appearance of the indigenous Americans in various diſtricts, is thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe who live in a high country are fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than thoſe in the marſhy low lands on the coaſt.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon red. Their frequent expoſure to the ſun and wind changes it to their ordinary duſky hue. The temperature of the air appears to have little or no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in this reſpect. There is no perceptible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in complexion between the inhabitants of the high and thoſe of the low parts of Peru; yet the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates are of an extreme difference. Nay, the Indians who live as far as 40 degrees and upwards ſouth or north of the equator, are not to be diſtinguiſhed, in point of colour, from thoſe immediately under it.</p>
                     <p>There is, alſo, a general conformation of features and perſon, which, more or leſs characterizeth them all. Their chief diſtinctions, in theſe reſpects, are a ſmall forehead, partly covered with hair almoſt to the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows, little eyes, the noſe thin, pointed, and bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the upper lip; a broad face, large ears, black, thick, and lank hair; the legs well formed, the feet ſmall, the body thick and muſcular; little or no beard
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028963_0009_0FDDBD3A39B4A8C8"/>on the face, and that little never extended beyond a ſmall part of the chin and upper lip. It may eaſily be ſuppoſed that this general deſcription cannot apply, in all its parts, to every individual; but all of them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo much of it, that they may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed even from the mulattoes, who come neareſt to them in point of colour.</p>
                     <p>The reſemblance among all the American tribes is not leſs remarkable in reſpect to their genius, character, manners, and particular cuſtoms. The moſt diſtant tribes are, in theſe reſpects, as ſimilar as though they formed but one nation.</p>
                     <p>All the Indian nations have a peculiar pleaſure in painting their bodies of a red colour, with a certainſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of earth. The mine of Guancavelica was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of no other uſe than to ſupply them with this mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial for dyeing their bodies; and the cinnabar extracted from it was applied entirely to this purpoſe. The tribes in Louiſiana and in Canada have the ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; hence minium is the commodity moſt in demand there.</p>
                     <p>It may, perhaps, ſeem ſingular, that theſe nations, whoſe natural colour is red, ſhould affect the ſame col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as an artificial ornament. But, it may be obſerved they do nothing in this reſpect but what correſponds to the practice of Europeans, who alſo ſtudy to heighten and diſplay to advantage the natural red and white of their complexions. The Indians of Peru have now, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, abandoned the cuſtom of painting their bodies: but it was common among them before they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by the Spaniards; and it ſtill remains the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all thoſe tribes who have preſerved their liberty. The northern nations of America, beſides the red colour which is predominant, employ alſo black, white, blue, and green, in painting their bodies.</p>
                     <p>The adjuſtment of theſe colours is a matter of as great conſideration with the Indians of Louiſiana and the vaſt regions extending to the north, as the ornaments
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028963_0009_0FDDBD3A39B4A8C8"/>of dreſs among the moſt poliſhed nations. The buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs itſelf they call <hi>Mactaher,</hi> and they do not fail to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all their talents and aſſiduity to accompliſh it in the moſt finiſhed manner. No lady of the greateſt faſhion ever conſulted her mirror with more anxiety, than the Indians do while painting their bodies. The colours are applied with the utmoſt accuracy and addreſs. Upon the eye lids, preciſely at the root of the eye laſhes, they draw two lines, as fine as the ſmalleſt thread; the ſame upon the lips, the openings of the noſtrils, the eye-brows, and the ears; of which laſt they even follow all the inflexions and ſinuoſities. As to the reſt of the face, they diſtribute various figures, in all which the red predominates, and the other colours are aſſorted ſo as to throw it out to the beſt advantage. The neck alſo receives its proper ornaments; a thick coat of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million commonly diſtinguiſhes the cheeks. Five or ſix hours are requiſite for accompliſhing all this with the nicety which they affect. As their firſt attempts do not always ſucceed to their wiſh, they efface them, and begin a-new upon a better plan. No coquette is more faſtidious in her choice of ornament, none more vain when the important adjuſtment is finiſhed. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſelf-ſatisfaction are then ſo great, that the mirror is hardly ever laid down. An Indian <hi>mactached</hi> to his mind, is the vaineſt of all the human ſpecies. The other parts of the body are left in their natural ſtate, and, excepting what is called a <hi>cachecul,</hi> they go entirely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028963_0010_0FDDBD3BADC529C0"/>from the waiſt upwards. This is the heraldry of the Indians; the devices of which are, probably, more exactly adjuſted to the merits of the perſons who bear them, than thoſe of more civilized countries.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe ornaments, the warriors alſo carry plumes of feathers on their heads, their arms, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Theſe, likewiſe, are tokens of valo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>, and none but ſuch as have been thus diſtinguiſhed may wear them.</p>
                     <p>The propenſity to indolence is equal among all the tribes of Indians, civilized, or ſavage. The only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of thoſe who have preſerved their independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is hunting and fiſhing. In ſome diſtricts, the women exerciſe a little agriculture, in raiſing Indian corn, and pompions, of which they form a ſpecies of aliment, by bruiſing them together: they, alſo, prepare the ordinary beverage among them, taking care, at the ſame time, of the children, of whom the fathers take no charge.</p>
                     <p>The female Indians of all the conquered regions of South America practiſe what is called the <hi>ur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>u</hi> (a word which among them ſignifies <hi>elevation.</hi>) It conſiſts in throwing forward the hair from the crown of the head, upon the brow, and cutting it round from the ears to above the eye; ſo that the forehead and eye brows are entirely covered. The ſame cuſtom takes place in the Northern countries. The female inhabitants of both regions tie the reſt of their hair behind ſo exactly in the ſame faſhion, that it might be ſuppoſed the effect of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual imitation. This, however, being impoſſible, from the vaſt diſtance that ſeparates them, is thought to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the ſuppoſition of the whole of America being originally planted with one race of people.</p>
                     <p>This cuſtom does not take place among the males. Thoſe of the higher parts of Peru wear long and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hair, which they reckon a great ornament. In the lower parts of the ſame country they cut it ſhort, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the heat of the climate; a circumſtance i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ck out their hair by the roots, from the crown of the head forwards, in order to obtain a large forehead, otherwiſe denied them by nature. The reſt of their hair they cut as ſhort as poſſible, to prevent their enemies from ſeizing them by it in battle, and alſo to prevent them from eaſily getting their ſcalp, ſhould they fall into their hands as priſoners.</p>
                     <p>According to Don Ulloa, the whole race of the American Indians is diſtinguiſhed by an uncommon thickneſs of ſkin, and by an hardneſs of their fibres; which circumſtances, in the opinion of this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spaniſh writer, contribute to that inſenſibility to bodily pain, for which theſe ſingular people are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. Our author adduces an inſtance, in ſupport of this inſenſibility, in the Americans, in the caſe of an Indian, who was under the neceſſity of ſubmitting to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ut for the ſtone. This operation, it is well known, ſeldom laſts above four, or five, minutes. Unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances, in his caſe, prolonged it to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common period of 27 minutes. Yet, all this time, the patient gave no tokens of the extreme pain, commonly attending this operation: he complained only as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon does who feels ſome ſlight uneaſineſs. At laſt, the ſtone was extracted. Two days after, he expreſſed a deſire for food, and on the eighth day from the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he quitted his bed, free from pain, although the wound was not yet thoroughly cloſed. The ſame want of ſenſibility, he ſays, is obſerved in caſes of fractures, wounds, and other accidents, of a ſimilar nature. In all theſe caſes the cure is eaſily effected, and they ſeem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>urying grounds, are of a greater thickneſs than that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It is natural to infer from hence, ſays Ulloa, that their comparative inſenſibility to pain is owing to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028963_0011_0FDDBD3D24D30080"/>coarſer and ſtronger organization, than that of other nations. The eaſe with which they endure the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of climate is, he thinks, another proof of this, The inhabitants of the higher parts of Peru live amidſt perpetual froſt and ſnow. Although their clothing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> very ſlight, they ſupport this inclement temperature, without the leaſt inconvenience. Habit, it is to be confeſſed, may contribute a good deal to this, but much alſo is to be aſcribed to the compact texture of their ſki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> which defends them from the impreſſion of cold through their pores. We muſt confeſs, however, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aſſertions and conjectures of an author ſo reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable as Don Ulloa, that we are not very confident, that either the ſkins, or the ſkulls of the Americans are thicker than the ſkins and ſkulls of many other nations of mankind. But we do not wiſh, in this place, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate on this ſubject, which can only be reduced to certainty by the inveſtigations of the anatomiſt or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt.</p>
                     <p>The northern Indians reſemble them in this reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The utmoſt rigours of the winter ſeaſon do not prevent them from following the chace almoſt naked. It is true, they wear a kind of woollen cloak, or ſometimes the ſkin of a wild beaſt, upon their ſhoulders; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it covers only a ſmall part of their body, it would appear that they uſe it rather for ornament than warmth. In fact, they wear it indiſcriminately, in the ſeverities of winter, and in the ſultrieſt heats of ſummer, when neither Europeans nor Negroes can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any but the ſlighteſt clothing. They even fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently throw aſide this cloak when they go a hunting, that it may not embarraſs them, in traverſing their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, where, they ſay, the thorns and undergrowth would take hold of it; while, on the contrary, they ſlide ſmoothly over the ſurface of their naked bodies. At all times they go with their heads uncovered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering the leaſt inconvenience, either from the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028963_0011_0FDDBD3D24D30080"/>cold, or from thoſe <hi>coups de ſoleil,</hi> which in Louiſiana are ſo often fatal to the inhabitants of other climates.</p>
                     <p>The Indians of South America diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by modern dreſſes, in which they affect various taſtes. Thoſe of the high country, and of the vallies in Peru, dreſs partly in the Spaniſh faſhion. Inſtead of hats they wear bonnets of coarſe double cloth, the weight of which neither ſeems to incommode them when they go to warmer climates, nor does the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental want of them ſeem to be felt in ſituations where the moſt piercing cold reigns. Their legs and feet are always bare, if we except a ſort of ſandals made of the ſkins of oxen. The inhabitants of South America, compared with thoſe of North America, are deſcribed as generally more feeble in their frame; leſs vigorous in the efforts of the mind; of gentler diſpoſitions, more addicted to pleaſure, and ſunk in indolence.—This, however, is not univerſally the caſe. Many of their nations are as intrepid and enterpriſing as any others on the whole continent. Among the tribes on the banks of the Oroonoko, if a warrior aſpires to the poſt of captain, his probation begins with a long faſt, more rigid than any ever obſerved by the moſt abſtemious hermit. At the cloſe of this the chiefs aſſemble; and each gives him three laſhes with a large whip, applied ſo vigorouſly, that his body is almoſt flayed. If he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>Their huts, or cabins, are made of ſtakes of wood driven into the ground, and covered with branches of trees or reeds. They lie on the floor, either on mats, or the ſkins of wild beaſts. Their diſhes are of timber, but their ſpoons are made of the ſkulls of wild oxen, and their knives of flint. A kettle and a large plate conſtitute almoſt the whole utenſils of the family.— Their diet conſiſts chiefly in what they procure by hunting; and ſagamite, or pottage, is likewiſe one of their moſt common kinds of food. The moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able furniture amongſt them is a collection of the ſcalps of their enemies; with theſe they ornament their huts, which are eſteemed in proportion to the number of this ſort of ſpoils.</p>
                     <p>The character of the Indians is altogether founded upon their circumſtances and way of life. A people who are conſtantly employed in procuring the means of a precarious ſubſiſtence, who live by hunting the wild animals, and who are generally engaged in war with their neighbours, cannot be ſuppoſed to enjoy much gaiety of temper or a high flow of ſpirits. The Indians, therefore, are in general grave, even to ſadneſs: they have nothing of that giddy vivacity peculiar to ſome nations of Europe, and they deſpiſe it. Their behaviour to thoſe about them is regular, modeſt, and reſpectful. Ignorant of the arts of amuſement, of which that of ſaying trifles agreeably is one of the moſt conſiderable, they ſeldom ſpeak but when they have ſomething important to obſerve; and all their actions, words, and even looks, are attended with ſome meaning. This is extremely natural to men who are almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually engaged in purſuits, which to them are of the higheſt importance. Their ſubſiſtence depends entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly only on what they procure with their hands; and, their lives, their honour, and every thing dear to them, may be loſt by the ſmalleſt inattention to the deſigns of

The moſt common motive of the Americans for entering into war, when it does not ariſe from an accidental rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or interference, is either to revenge themſelves for the death of ſome loſt friends, or to acquire priſoners, who may aſſiſt them in hunting, and whom they adopt into their ſociety. Theſe wars are either undertaken by ſome private adventurers, or at the inſtance of the whole community. In the latter caſe all the young men who are diſpoſed to go out to battle (for no one is compelled contrary to his inclination), give a bit of wood to the chief, as a token of their deſign to accompany him; for every thing among theſe people is tranſacted with a great deal of ceremony and with many forms. The chief, who is to conduct them, faſts ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral days, during which time he converſes with no one, and is particularly careful to obſerve his dreams; which the preſumption natural to ſavages generally renders as favourable as he could deſire. A variety of other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions and ceremonies are obſerved. One of the moſt hideous is ſetting the war kettle on the fire, as an emblem that they are going out to devour their enemies; which, among theſe nations, it is probable, was formerly the caſe, ſince they ſtill continue to expreſs it in clear terms, and uſe an emblem ſignificant of the ancient uſage. Then they diſpatch a porcelane, or large ſhell, to their allies, inviting them to come along, and drink the blood of their enemies. For with the Americans, as with the Greeks of old,
<q>
                           <l>"A generous friendſhip no cold medium knows;</l>
                           <l>"But with one love, with one reſentment glows".</l>
                        </q> They think that thoſe in their alliance muſt not only adopt their enmities, but that they muſt alſo have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment wound up to the ſame pitch with themſelves. And, indeed, no people carry their friendſhips or their reſentments ſo far as they do; and this is what ſhould be expected from their peculiar circumſtances: that principle in human nature which is the ſpring of the

The perſon who has taken the captive attends him to the cottage, where, according to the diſtribution made by the elders, he is to be delivered to ſupply the loſs of a citizen. If thoſe who receive him have their family weakened by war or other accidents, they adopt the captive into the family, of which he becomes a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But if they have no occaſion for him, or their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment for the loſs of their friends be too high to endure the ſight of any connected with thoſe who were concerned in it, they ſentence him to death. All thoſe who have met with the ſame ſevere ſentence being collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the whole nation is aſſembled at the execution, as for ſome great ſolemnity. A ſcaffold is erected, and the priſoners are tied to the ſtake, where they commence their death ſong, and prepare for the enſuing ſcene of cruelty with the moſt undaunted courage. Their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, on the other ſide, are determined to put it to the proof, by the moſt refined and exquiſite tortures. They begin at the extremity of his body, and gradually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the more vital parts. One plucks out his nails by the roots, one by one; another takes a ſinger into his mouth, and tears off the fleſh with his teeth; a third thruſts the finger, mangled as it is, into the bowl of a pipe made red hot, which he ſmokes like tobacco; then they pound his toes and fingers to pieces between two ſtones; they cut circles about his joints, and gaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the fleſhy parts of his limbs, which they ſear im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with red hot irons, cutting, burning, and pinching them, alternately; they pull off his fleſh, thus mangled and roaſted, bit by bit, devouring it with greedineſs, and ſmearing their faces with the blood, in an enthuſiaſm of horrour and ſury. When they have
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028963_0017_0FDDBD4ACFAFA3E8"/>thus torn off the fleſh, they twiſt the bare nerves and tendons about an iron, tearing and ſnapping them, whilſt others are employed in pulling and extending his limbs in every way that can increaſe the torment. This continues, often, five or ſix hours; and ſometimes, ſuch is the ſtrength of the ſavages, days together. Then they frequently unbind him, to give a breathing to their fury, to think what new torments they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and to refreſh the ſtrength of the ſuffere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The body is then put into a kettle, and this barbarous employment is ſucceeded by a feaſt as barbarous.</p>

In general, however, the offender abſents himſelf; the friends ſend compliments of condolence to thoſe of the perſon who has been murdered. The head of the family, at length, appears with a number of preſents, the delivery of which he accompanies with a formal ſpeech. The whole ends, as uſual, in mutual feaſtings, in ſongs, and in dances. If the murder is committed by one of the ſame family, or cabin, that cabin has the full right of judgment within itſelf, either to puniſh the guilty with death, or to pardon him, or to oblige him to give ſome recompence to the wife or children of the ſlain.

                     <p>The Cheerake are governed by ſeveral ſachems, or chiefs, elected by the different villages; as are alſo the Creeks, and the Chactaws.

Concerning the religion of the Indians much has been ſaid, and much that has no foundation. In general it may be obſerved that they all have an idea of a Supreme Being, whom they worſhip under different names, and with a great variety of ſuperſtitious rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.

                     <p>In general, the American Indians live to a great age, although it is not eaſy to know from themſelves the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act number of their years. It was aſked of an Indian, who appeared to be extremely old, what age he was of? I am above twenty, was his reply. Upon putting the queſtion in a different form, by reminding him of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain circumſtances, in former times, my <hi>machu,</hi> ſaid he, ſpoke to me, when I was young, of the Ineas; and he had ſeen theſe princes. According to this reply, there muſt have elapſed, from the date of his machu's (his grandfather's) remembrance to that time, a period of, at leaſt, 232 years. The man who made this reply, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be 120 years of age: for, beſides the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his hair and beard, his body was almoſt bent to the ground; without, however, ſhowing any other marks of debility, or ſuffering. This happened in 1764. This longevity, attended in general with uninterrupted health, is thought, by ſome writers, to be the couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in part of their vacancy from all ſerious thought and employment, joined alſo with the robuſt texture and conformation of their bodily organs. If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians did not deſtroy one another, in their almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual wars, and if their habits of intoxication were not ſo univerſal and incurable, they would be, of all the rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of men who inhabit the globe, the moſt likely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, not only the bounds, but the enjoyments, of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life to their utmoſt duration.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028963_0024_0FDDBD58F03051A8"/>they obſerved, that no perſon had the leaſt ſuſpicion of their deſign until the blow was ſtruck. One French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alone eſcaped, by favour of the darkneſs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the diſaſter of his countrymen. The compaſſion of a female Indian contributed alſo, in ſome meaſure, to his exemption from the general maſſacre. The tribe of Natches had invited the Indians of other countries, even to a conſiderable diſtance, to join in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy. The day, or rather the night, was fixed, on which they were to make an united attack on the French coloniſts. It was intimated by ſending a parcel of rods, more or leſs numerous according to the local diſtance of each tribe, with an injunction to abſtract one rod dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the day on which the laſt fell to be taken away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that fixed for the execution of their plan. The women were partners of the bloody ſecret. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of rods being thus diſtributed, that belonging to the tribe of Natches happened to remain in the cuſtody of a female. This woman, either moved by her own feelings of compaſſion, or by the commiſeration expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by her female acquaintances, in the view of the propoſed ſcene of bloodſhed, abſtracted one day three or four of the rods, and thus anticipated the term of her tribe's proceeding to the execution of the general conſpiracy. The conſequence of this was, that the Natches were the only actors in this carnage; their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant aſſociates having ſtill ſeveral rods remaining at the time when the former made the attack. An opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was, thereby, given to the coloniſts, in thoſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to take meaſures for their defence, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting a more extenſive execution of the deſign.</p>
                     <p>It was by conſpiracies ſimilar to this that the Indians of the province of Macas, in the kingdom of Quito, deſtroyed the opulent city of Logrogno, the colony of Guambaya, and its capital Sevilla del Oro; and that ſo completely, that it is no longer known in what place theſe ſettlements exiſted, or where that abundance of gold was found from which the laſt mentioned city took

The Peruvians, while they lived under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Incas, preſerved the records of certain remarkable events. They had alſo a kind of regular government deſcribed by the hiſtorians of the conqueſt of Peru. This government originated entirely from the attention and abilities of their princes, and from the regulations enacted by them for directing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their ſubjects. This ancient degree of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation among them gives ground to preſume that their legiſlatures ſprung from ſome race more enlightened than the other tribes of Indians; a race of which no individual ſeems to remain in the preſent times.</p>
                     <p>Vanity and conceit are ſaid to be blended with their ignorance, and treachery. Notwithſtanding all they ſuffer from Europeans, they ſtill, it is ſaid, conſider themſelves as a race of men far ſuperior to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors. This proud belief, ariſing from their pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ideas of excellence, is univerſal over the whole known continent of America. They do not think it poſſible that any people can be ſo intelligent as themſelves. When they are detected in any of their plots, it is their common obſervation, that the Spaniards, or <hi>Virochocas,</hi> want to be as knowing as they are. Thoſe of Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiana and the countries adjacent, are equally vain of their ſuperior underſtanding; confounding that quality with the cunning which they themſelves conſtantly practiſe. The whole object of their tranſactions is to over reach thoſe with whom they deal. Yet though faithleſs themſelves, they never forgive the breach of promiſe on the part of others. While the Europeans ſeek their amity by preſents, they give themſelves no concern to ſecure a reciprocal friendſhip. Hence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, ariſes their idea, that they muſt be a ſuperior race of men, in ability and intelligence, to thoſe who are at ſuch pains to court their alliance, and avert their enmity.</p>

                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:028963_0026_0FDDBD5BF88B1518"/>
Their natural eloquence has alſo been decried. The free tribes of ſavages who enter into conventions with the Europeans, it is obſerved, are accuſtomed to make long, pompous, and, according to their own notions, ſublime harangues, but without any method, or connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The whole is a collection of disjointed meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors and compariſons. The light, heat, and courſe of the ſun, form the principal topic of their diſcourſe; and theſe unintelligible reaſonings are always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with violent and ridiculous geſtures. Number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs repetitions prolong the oration, which, if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, would laſt whole days: At the ſame time, they meditate very accurately, beforehand, in order to avoid mentioning any thing but what they are deſirous to obtain. This pompous faculty of making ſpeeches is alſo one of the grounds on which they conceive themſelves to be ſuperior to the nations of Europe; they imagine that it is their eloquence that procures them the favours they aſk. The ſubjected Indians converſe preciſely in the ſame ſtyle. Prolix and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they never know when to ſtop; ſo that, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the difference in language, it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, in this reſpect, to diſtinguiſh a civilized Peruvian from an inhabitant of the moſt ſavage diſtricts to the northward.</p>

And, with regard to the worſt and leaſt equivocal parts of the American character, cruelty and revenge; it may be fairly queſtioned, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the inſtances of theſe, either in reſpect of their cauſe or their atrocity, be at all comparable to thoſe exhibited in European hiſtory, and ſtaining the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Chriſtendom:—to thoſe, for inſtance, of the

                     <p>Still harſher, however, are the deſcriptions given by Buffon and de Pauw, of the natives of this whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, in which the moſt mortifying degeneracy of the human race, as well as of all the inferior animals, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted to be conſpicuous. Againſt theſe philoſophers, or rather theoriſts, however, the Americans have found an able advocate in the Abbé Clavigero; an hiſtorian, who, not only from his being a native of America, but alſo from his ſituation, and long reſidence in Mexico, has been enabled to obtain the beſt means of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and who, though himſelf a ſubject of Spain, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſuperior to prejudice, and diſdains in his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the gloſſes of policy.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the ſtature of the Americans, M. de Pauw ſays, that although, in general, it is not equal to the ſtature of the Caſtilians, there is but little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between them. But the Abbé Clavigero evinces, that the Indians who inhabit thoſe countries lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 9 and 40 degrees of north latitude, which are the limits of the diſcoveries of the Spaniards, are more than five Pariſian feet in height, and that thoſe who do not reach that ſtature are as few in number amongſt the Indians as they are amongſt the Spaniards. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides certain, that many of the American nations, ſuch as the <hi>Apaches,</hi> the <hi>Hiaqueſe,</hi> the <hi>Pimeſe,</hi> and <hi>Cochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> are at leaſt as tall as the talleſt Europeans; and that, in all the vaſt extent of the New World, no race of people has been found, except the Eſquimaux, in the north, and weſt, and the Yacana-cunnees, and Peſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rais, &amp;c. in the ſouth, ſo diminutive in ſtature as the Laplanders, the <hi>Samojeds,</hi> and Tartars, in the north of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028963_0028_0FDDBD6366CD3658"/>the Old Continent. In this reſpect, therefore, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the two Continents are upon an equality.</p>
                     <p>Of the ſhape and character of the Mexican Indian the Abbé gives a moſt advantageous deſcription; which he aſſerts, no one who reads it, in America, will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, unleſs he views them with the eye of a prejudicial mind. It is true, that Ulloa ſays, in ſpeaking of the Indians of Quito, he had obſerved that "imperfect people abounded among them; that they were either irregularly diminutive, or monſtrous in ſome other to reſpect; that they became either inſenſible, dumb, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> blind; or wanted ſome limb of their body." Having, therefore, made ſome inquiry reſpecting this ſingularity of the Quitans, the Abbé found, that ſuch defect were neither cauſed by what he calls bad humours, not by the climate, but by the miſtaken and blind human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of their parents, who, in order to free their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the hardſhips and toils to which the healthy Indians are ſubjected by the Spaniards, fix ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity or weakneſs upon them, that they may become uſeleſs; a circumſtance of miſery which does not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in other countries of America, nor in thoſe places of the ſame kingdom of Quito, where the Indians are under no ſuch oppreſſion. M. de Pauw, and in agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him, Dr. Robertſon, ſays, that no deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons are to be found among the ſavages of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica; becauſe, like the ancient Lacedemonians, they put to death thoſe children which are born hunch backed, blind, or defective in any limb; but that the thoſe countries where they are formed into ſocieties and where the vigilance of their rulers prevents the murder of ſuch infants, the number of their deformed individuals is greater th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> it is in any country of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. This would make an exceedingly good ſolution of the difficulty if it were true: But if, poſſibly, then has been in America a tribe of ſavages who have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the barbarous example of the celebrated Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, it is certain that thoſe authors have no ground
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028963_0028_0FDDBD6366CD3658"/>to impute ſuch inhumanity to the reſt of the Americans: and it has not been the practice, at leaſt with the far greater part of thoſe nations, as may be demonſtrated from the atteſtations of authors who are the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their cuſtoms.</p>
                     <p>No argument againſt the New World can be drawn from the colour of the Americans; for their colour is leſs diſtant from the white of the Europeans than it is from the black of the Africans, and a great part of the Afraties. The hair of the Mexicans, and of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the Indians, is, as we have already ſaid, coarſe and thick; on their faces they appear to have little, and in general none on their arms and legs: But it is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to ſay, as M. de Pauw does, that they are entirely deſtitute of hair in all the other parts of their body. This is one of the many paſſages in the <hi>Philoſophical Reſearches,</hi> at which the Mexicans, and all the other nations, muſt ſmile, to find an European philoſopher ſo eager to diveſt them of the dreſs they had from nature. Don Ulloa, indeed, in the deſcription which he gives of the Indians of Quito, ſays, that hair neither grows upon the men nor upon the women when they arrive at puberty, as it does on the reſt of mankind; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſingularity may attend the Quitans, or occaſion this circumſtance, there is no doubt that among the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans in general, the period of puberty is accompanied with the ſame ſymptoms as it is among other nations of the world. In fact, with the North Americans, it is diſgraceful to be hairy on the body. They ſay, it likens them to hogs. They, therefore, pluck the hair as faſt as it appears. But the traders who marry their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and prevail on them to diſcontinue this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ſay, that nature is the fame with them as with the whites. As to the beards of the men, had Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon, or de Pauw, known the pains and trouble it coſts them to pluck out by the roots the hair that grows on their faces, they would have ſeen that nature had not been deficient in that reſpect. Every nation has its
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028963_0029_0FDDBD6532BFAF18"/>cuſtoms. "I have ſeen an Indian beau, with a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſs in his hand (ſays Mr. Jefferſon) examining his face, for hours together, and plucking out, by the roots, every hair he could diſcover, with a kind of tweezer made of a piece of fine braſs wire, that had been twiſted round a ſtick, and which he uſed with great dexterity."</p>
                     <p>The very aſpect of an Angolan, a Mandingan, or a Congan, would have ſhocked M. de Pauw, and made him recal the cenſure which he paſſes on the colour, the make, and the hair of the Americans. What can be imagined more contrary to the idea <hi>we</hi> have of beauty, and the perfection of the human frame, than a man, whoſe ſkin is black as ink, whoſe head and face are covered with black wool, inſtead of hair, whoſe eyes are yellow and bloody, whoſe lips are thick and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and whoſe noſe is flat? Such are the inhabitants of a very large portion of Africa, and of many iſlands of Aſia. What men can be more imperfect than thoſe who meaſure no more than four feet in ſtature, whoſe faces are long and flat, the noſe compreſſed, the iris yellowiſh black, the eyelids turned back towards the temples, the cheeks extraordinarily elevated, their mouths monſtrouſly large, their lips thick and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and the lower part of their viſages extremely narrow? Such, according to Count de Buffon, are the Laplanders, the Zemblans, the Borandines, the Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeds, and the Tartars, in the Eaſt. What objects more deformed than men whoſe faces are too long and wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led even in their youth, their noſes thick: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, their eyes ſmall and ſunk, their cheeks very much raiſed, the upper jaw low, their teeth long and diſunited, eyebrows ſo thick that they ſhade their eyes, the eyelids thick, ſome briſtles on their faces inſtead of beard, large thighs and ſmall legs? Such is the picture Count de Buffon gives of the Tartars; that is, of thoſe people who, as he ſays, inhabit a tract of land in Aſia, 1200 leagues long and upwards, and more than 750
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028963_0029_0FDDBD6532BFAF18"/>broad. Amongſt theſe, the Calmucks are the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their deformity; which is ſo great, that, according to Tavernier, they are the moſt brutal men of all the univerſe. Their faces are ſo broad that there is a ſpace of five, or ſix, inches between their eyes, as Count de Buffon himſelf affirms. In Calicut, in Ceylon, and in other countries of India, there is, ſay Pyrard, and other writers, on thoſe regions a race of men who have one, or both, of their legs as thick as the body of a man; and that this deformity among them is almoſt hereditary.</p>
                     <p>If we were, in like manner, to go through the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Aſia and Africa, we ſhould hardly find any exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive country where the colour of men is not darker, where there are not ſtronger irregularities obſerved, and groſſer defects to be found in them, than even the penetrating eye of de Pauw could diſcover in the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans. The colour of the latter is a good deal clearer than that of almoſt all the Africans and the inhabitants of ſouth Aſia. Even their alleged ſcantineſs of beard is common to the inhabitants of the Philippine Iſlands, and of all the Indian Archipelago, to the famous Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, Japaneſe, Tartars, and many other nations of the Old Continent. The imperfections of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, however great they may be repreſented to be, are, certainly, not comparable with the defects of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe people, whoſe character we have ſketched, and others whom we omit.</p>
                     <p>M. de Pauw repreſents the Americans to be a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſeaſed ſet of nations; and, in order to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the weakneſs and diſorder of their phyſical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, adduces ſeveral proofs equally ridiculous and ill founded, and which it will not be expected we ſhould enumerate. He alleges, among other particulars, that they were overcome in wreſtling by all the Europeans, and that they ſunk under a moderate burden; that by a computation made, 200,000 Americans were found to have periſhed, in one year, from carrying of baggage.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028963_0030_0FDDBD6656249828"/>With reſpect to the firſt point, the Abbé Clavigero ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, it would be neceſſary that the experiment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028963_0030_0FDDBD6656249828"/>Pauw ſays, that when the new world was diſcovered, nothing was to be ſeen but thick woods; that, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, there are ſome lands cultivated, not by the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans, however, but by the Africans, and Europeans; and that the ſoil in cultivation is to the ſoil which is uncultivated as 2000 to 2,000,000. Theſe three aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Abbé Clavigero demonſtrates to be preciſely ſo many errors. Since the conqueſt, the Americans alone have been the people who have ſupported all the fatigues of agriculture in all the vaſt countries of the continent of South America, and in the greater part of thoſe of North America ſubject to the crown of Spain. No European is ever to be ſeen employed in the labours of the field. The Moors who, in compariſon of the Americans, are very few in number in the kingdom of New Spain, are charged with the culture of the ſugar cane, and tobacco, and the making of fugar; but the ſoil deſtined for the cultivation of thoſe plants is not with reſpect to all the cultivated land of that country, in the proportion of one to two thouſand. The Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans are the people who labour on the ſoil. They are the tillers, the ſowers, the weeders, and the reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the wheat, of the maize, of the rice, of the beans, and other kinds of grain or pulſe, of the cocoa, of the vanilla, of the cotton, of the indigo, and all other plants uſeful to the ſuſtenance, the clothing, and commerce of thoſe provinces; and without them ſo little can be done, that in the year 1762, the harveſt of wheat was abandoned, in many places, on account of a ſickneſs which prevailed, and prevented the Indians from reaping it. But this is not all; the Americans are they who cut and tranſport all the neceſſary timber from the woods; who cut, tranſport, and work the ſtones; who make lime, plaſter, and tiles; who conſtruct all the buildings of that kingdom, except a few places where none of them inhabit; who open and repair all the roads, who make the canals and ſluices, and clean the cities. They work in many mines of gold, of ſilver, of copper, &amp;c.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028963_0031_0FDDBD67E49B3B28"/>they are the ſhepherds, herdſmen, weavers, potters, baſket makers, bakers, couriers, day labourers, &amp;c. In a word, they are the perſons who bear all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

This phenomenon, ſo much admired by the Spaniards, who reſide in Mexico, cannot be aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any other cauſe than the vigour of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the temperance of their diet, and the ſalubrity of their clime. Hiſtorians, and other perſons who have ſojourned there for many years, report the ſame thing of other countries of the New World.</p>
                     <p>As to the mental qualities of the Americans, M. de Pauw has not been able to diſcover any other characters than a memory ſo feeble, that to day they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what they did yeſterday; a capacity ſo blunt, that they are incapable of thinking or putting their ideas in order; a diſpoſition ſo cold, that they feel no excitement of love; a daſtardly ſpirit, and a genius that is torpid, and indolent. Many other Europeans, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and what is ſtill more wonderful, many of thoſe children or deſcendants of Europeans who are born in America, think as M. de Pauw does; ſome from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſome from want of reflection, and others from hereditary prejudice and prepoſſeſſion. But all this, and much more, would not be ſufficient to invalidate the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies of other Europeans whoſe authority has a great deal more weight, both becauſe they were men of great judgment, learning, and knowledge, of theſe countries, and becauſe they give their teſtimony in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſtrangers, againſt their own countrymen. In particular, Acoſta, whoſe <hi>Natural and Moral Hiſtory</hi> even de Pauw commends, as <hi>an excellent work,</hi> employs the whole ſixth book in demonſtrating the good ſenſe of the Americans, by an explanation of their ancient gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, their laws, their hiſtories in paintings and knots, calendars, &amp;c. M. de Pauw thinks the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans are beſtial; Acoſta, on the other hand, reputes thoſe perſons weak and preſumptuous who think them ſo. M. de Pauw ſays, that the moſt acute Americans were inferior in induſtry and ſagacity to the rudeſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028963_0032_0FDDBD6970643AB8"/>of the Old Continent: Acoſta extols the civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of the Mexicans above many republics of Europe. M. de Pauw finds, in the moral and political conduct of the Americans, nothing but barbarity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, and brutrlity; and Acoſta finds there, laws which are admirable and worthy of being preſerved for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>M. de Pauw denies them courage, and alleges the conqueſt of Mexico as a proof of their cowardice. "Cortes (ſays he) conquered the empire of Mexico with 450 vagabonds, and 15 horſes, badly armed; his miſerable artillery conſiſted of ſix falconets, which would not at the preſent day be capable of exciting the fears of a fortreſs defended by invalids. During his abſence, the capital was held in awe by the half of his troops. What men! what events!—It is confirmed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of all hiſtorians, that the Spaniards entered, the firſt time, into Mexico without making one ſingle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their artillery. If the title of hero is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to him who has the diſgrace to occaſion the death of a great number of rational animals, Ferdinand Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes might pretend to it; otherwiſe I do not ſee what true glory he has acquired by the overthrow of a tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering monarchy, which might have been deſtroyed, in the ſame manner, by any other aſſaſſin of our continent." Theſe paſſages indicate either M. de Pauw's ignorance of the hiſtory of the conqueſt of Mexico, or a wilful ſuppreſſion of what would openly contradict his ſyſtem; ſince all who have read that hiſtory know well, that the conqueſt of Mexico was not made with 450 men, but with more than 200,000. Cortes himſelf, to whom it was of more importance than to M. de Pauw to make his bravery conſpicuous, and his conqueſt appear glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, confeſſes the exceſſive number of the allies who were under his command, at the ſiege of the capital, and combated with more fury againſt the Mexicans than the Spaniards themſelves. According to the account which Cortes gave to the emperor Charles V. the ſiege,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028963_0032_0FDDBD6970643AB8"/>of Mexico began with 87 horſes, 848 Spaniſh infantry, armed with guns, croſs bows, ſwords, and lances, and upwards of 75,000 allies, of Tlaſcala, Huexotzinco, Cholula, and Chalco, equipped with various ſorts of arms; with three large pieces of cannon of iron, 15 ſmall of copper, and 13 brigantines. In the courſe of the ſiege were aſſembled the numerous nations of the Otomies, the Cohuixcas, and Matlazincas, and the troops of the populous cities of the lakes; ſo that he army of the beſiegers not only exceeded 200,000, but amounted to 400,000, according to the letter from Cortes; and beſides theſe, 3000 boats and canoes came to their aſſiſtance. Did it betray cowardice to have ſuſtained, for full 75 days, the ſiege of an open city, engaging daily, with an army ſo large, and in part provided with arms ſo ſuperior, and at the ſame time having to withſtand the ravages of famine? Can they merit the charge of cowardice, who, after having loſt ſeven of the eight parts of their city, and about 50,000 citizens, part cut off by the ſword, part by famine and ſickneſs, continued to defend themſelves until they were furiouſly aſſaulted in the laſt hold which was left them?</p>
                     <p>The following inſtances of courage, fortitude and cloquence, will ſhow how unjuſtly their character has been defamed. "The Mexicans, fearing that the city would be taken, and perceiving that there muſt ſoon be a total want of proviſions, turned their attention to the preſervation of their emperour, Gautimoſin. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to attempt his of cape, with a view of maintaining the war in the northern part of his dominions.

                     <p>But, although we ſhould ſuppoſe, that, in the torrid climates of the New World, as well as in thoſe of the Old, eſpecially under the additional depreſſion of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, there was an inferiority of the mental powers; the Chileſe, and the North Americans, have diſcovered higher rudiments of human excellence and ingenuity than have, perhaps, ever been known among tribes in a ſimilar ſtate of ſociety, in any part of the world.</p>
                     <p>M. de Pauw affirms, that the Americans were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the uſe of money, and quotes the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well known paſſage from Monteſquieu: "Imagine to yourſelf that, by ſome accident, you are placed in an unknown country; if you find money there, do not doubt that you are arrived among a poliſhed people." But, if by money we are to underſtand a piece of metal with the ſtamp of the prince, or of the public, the want of it in a nation is no token of barbarity. The Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians employed oxen for money, as the Romans did ſheep. The Romans had no coined money till the time of Servius Tullius, nor had the Perſians until the reign of Darius Hyſtapſes. But, if by money is underſtood a ſign repreſenting the value of merchandize, the Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans, and other nations of Anahuac, employed money in their commerce. The cacao, of which they made conſtant uſe in the market to purchaſe whatever they wanted, was employed for this purpoſe, as ſalt is in Abyſſinia.</p>

                     <p>M. de Pauw affirms, that the palace of Montezum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The advances which the Mexicans had made in the noble ſcience of aſtronomy, is, perhaps, the moſt ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proof of their attention and ſagacity; for it appears from Abbé Clavigero's Hiſtory, that they not only counted 365 days to the year, but alſo knew of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of about ſix hours in the ſolar over the civil year, and remedied the difference, by means of intercalary days.</p>

                     <p>"Mock not, my ſon, the aged, or the imperfect. Scorn not him whom you ſee fall into ſome folly, or tranſgreſſion, nor make him reproaches; but reſtrain thyſelf, and beware leſt thou fall into the ſame error which offends thee in another. Go not where thou art not called, nor interfere in that which does not concern thee. Endeavour to manifeſt thy good breeding, in all thy words and actions. In converſation, do not lay thy hands upon another, nor ſpeak too much, nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or diſturb another's diſcourſe.

If thou wilt be virtuous, thy example will put the wicked to ſhame. No more my ſon; enough hath been ſaid in diſcharge of the duties of a father.

                        </gap> acute; and yet he is more timid and cowardly. He has no vivacity, no activity of mind. The activity of his body is not ſo much an exerciſe or ſpontaneous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a neceſſary action produced by want. Deſtroy his appetite for victuals and drink, and you will, at once, annihilate the active principle of all his movements: he remains in ſtupid repoſe, on his limbs, or couch, for whole days. It is eaſy to diſcover the cauſe of the ſcattered life of ſavages, and of their eſtrangement from ſociety. They have been refuſed the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028963_0035_0FDDBD74AAF4A4A0"/>ſpark of Nature's fire: They have no ardour for women, and of courſe, no love to mankind. Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the moſt lively and the moſt tender of all attachments, their other ſenſations of this nature are cold and languid. Their love to parents and children is extremely weak. The bonds of the moſt intimate of all ſocieties, that of the ſame family, are feeble; and one family has no attachment to another. Hence no union, no republic, no ſocial ſtate can take place amongſt them. The phyſical cauſe of love gives riſe to the morality of their manners. Their heart is frozen, their ſociety cold, and their empire cruel. They regard their families as ſervants deſtined to labour, or as beaſts of burden, whom they load unmercifully with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of their hunting, and oblige, without pity or grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude, to perform labours which often exceed their ſtrength. They have few children, and pay little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to them. Every thing muſt be referred to the firſt cauſe: They are indifferent becauſe they are weak; and this indifference to the ſex is the original ſtain which diſgraces Nature; prevents her from expanding, and by deſtroying the germs of life, cuts the root of ſociety. Hence, man makes no exception to what has been advanced. Nature, by denying him the faculty of love, has abuſed and contracted him more than any other animal."</p>
                     <p>An humiliating picture, indeed! but than which, Mr. Jefferſon aſſures us, never was one more unlike the original. M. Buffon grants, that their ſtature is the ſame as that of the men of Europe, and he might have admitted, that the Iroquois were larger, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopi, or Delawares, taller, than people in Europe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally are. But, he ſays, their organs of generation are ſmaller and weaker than thoſe of Europeans; which is not <hi>known,</hi> at leaſt, to be a fact. And as to their want of beard, this error has been already noticed.</p>
                     <p>"They have no ardour for their females." It is true, they do not indulge thoſe exceſſes, nor diſcover that fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028963_0036_0FDDBD7620F79728"/>which are cuſtomary in Europe; but this is not ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a defect in nature, but to manners. The ſoul of the Indian is wholly bent upon war. This is what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures him glory amongſt the men, and makes him the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the women. To this he is educated, from his earlieſt youth. When he purſues game with ardour, when he bears the fatigues of the chace, when he ſuſtains and ſuffers patiently hunger and cold; it is not ſo much for the ſake of the game he purſues, as to convince his parents and the council of the nation, that he is fit to be enrolled in the number of the warriors. The ſongs of the women, the dance of the warriors, the ſage counſel of the chiefs, the tales of the old, the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant entry of the warriors returning, with ſucceſs, from battle, and the reſpect paid to thoſe who diſtinguiſh themſelves in battle, and in ſubduing their enemies; in ſhort, every thing he ſees or hears tends to inſpire the Indian with an ardent deſire for military fame. If a young man were to diſcover a fondneſs for women before he has been to war, he would become the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the men, and the ſcorn and ridicule of the women; or were he to indulge himſelf with a captive taken in war, and much more were he to offer violence in order to gratify his luſt, he would incur indelible diſgrace. The ſeeming frigidity of the American, therefore, is the effect of manners, and not a defect of nature. He is neither more defective in ardour, nor impotent with the female, than a white man reduced to the ſame diet and exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>"They raiſe few children."—They, indeed, raiſe fewer children than we do; the cauſes of which are to be found, not in a difference of nature, but of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The women very frequently attending the men in their parties of war and of hunting, child bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing becomes extremely inconvenient to them. It is ſaid, therefore, that they have learned the practice of procuring abortion by the uſe of certain vegetables; and that they even tend to prevent conception for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028963_0036_0FDDBD7620F79728"/>time after. During theſe parties, they are expoſed to numerous hazards, to exceſſive exertions, to the greateſt extremities of hunger. Even at their homes the nation depends for food, through a certain part of every year, on the gleanings of the foreſt; that is, they experience a famine once in every year. With all animals, if the female be badly fed, or not fed at all, her young periſh: and if both male and female be reduced to like want, generation becomes leſs active, leſs productive. To the obſtacles, then, of want and hazard, which nature has oppoſed to the multiplication of wild animals for the purpoſe of reſtraining their numbers within certain bounds, thoſe of labour and of voluntary abortion are added with the Indian. No wonder, then, if they multiply leſs than we do. Where food is regularly ſupplied, a ſingle farm will ſhow more of cattle than a whole country of foreſts can of buffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes. The ſame Indian women, when married to white traders, who feed them and their children plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and regularly, who exempt them from exceſſive drudgery, who keep them ſtationary and unexpoſed to accidents, produce, and raiſe, as many children as the white women. Inſtances are known, under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, of their rearing a dozen children.</p>
                     <p>Neither do they ſeem to be "deficient in natural affection." On the contrary their ſenſibility is keen, even the warriors weeping moſt bitterly on the loſs of their children, though, in general, they endeavour to appear ſuperior to human events.</p>
                     <p>Their friendſhips are ſtrong, and faithful to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt extremity. A remarkable inſtance of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the caſe of the late Col. Byrd of Virginia, who was ſent to the Cheerakee nation to tranſact ſome buſineſs with them. It happened that ſome of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly people had juſt killed one or two of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was, therefore, propoſed in the council of the Cheerakee, that Col. Byrd ſhould be put to death in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for the loſs of their countrymen. Amongſt them
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028963_0037_0FDDBD77CB8A7F90"/>was a chief called Silòuee, who on ſome former occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had contracted an acquaintance and friendſhip with Col. Byrd. He came to him every night, in his tent, and told him not to be afraid, they ſhould not kill him. After many days deliberation, however, the determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was, contrary to Silòuee's expectation, that Byrd ſhould be put to death, and ſome warriors were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> executioners. Silòuee attended them; and when they entered the tent, he threw himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and Byrd, and ſaid to the warriors, "This man is my friend; before you get at him, you muſt kill me." On which they returned; and the council reſpected the principle ſo much as to recede from their determination.</p>
                     <p>That "they are timorous and cowardly" is a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter with which there is little reaſon to charge them, when we recollect the manner in which the Iroquois met Monſ. —, who marched into their country; in which the old men, who ſcorned to fly or to ſurvive the capture of their town, braved death, like the old Romans, in the time of the Gauls, and in which they ſoon after revenged themſelves by ſacking and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Montreal.

                     <p>Much leſs are they to be characterized as a people of no vivacity, and who are excited to action or motion only by the calls of hunger and thirſt. Their dances,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028963_0037_0FDDBD77CB8A7F90"/>in which they ſo much delight, and which to a Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean would be the moſt ſevere exerciſe, fully contradict this; not to mention their fatiguing marches, and the toil they voluntarily and cheerfully undergo in their military expeditions. It is true, that when at home they do not employ themſelves in labour or the culture of the ſoil: But this, again, is the effect of cuſtoms and manners which have aſſigned that to the province of the women. But it is ſaid, "They are averſe to ſociety and a ſocial life." Can any thing be more inapplicable than this, to a people who always live in towns, or in clans? Or can they be ſaid to have no <hi>republique,</hi> who conduct all their affairs in national councils; who pride themſelves in their national character; who conſider an inſult or injury, done to an individual by a ſtranger, as done to the whole, and reſent it, accordingly?</p>
                     <p>To form a juſt eſtimate of their genius and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal powers, Mr. Jefferſon obſerves, more facts are wanting, and great allowance is to be made for thoſe circumſtances of their ſituation which call for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of particular talents only. This done, we ſhall, probably, find that the Americans are formed, in mind as well as in body, on the ſame model with the <hi>homo ſapiens Europaeus.</hi> The principles of their ſociety forbidding all compulſion, they are to be led to duty and to enterprize by perſonal influence and perſuaſion. Hence eloquence in council, bravery and addreſs in war, become the foundations of all conſequence with them. To theſe acquirements all their faculties are directed. Of their bravery and addreſs in war we have multiplied proofs, becauſe we have been the ſubjects on which they were exerciſed. Of their eminence in oratory we have fewer examples, becauſe it is diſplayed chiefly in their own councils. Some, however, we have of very ſuperior luſtre. We may challenge the whole orations of Demoſthenes and Cicero, and of any more eminent orator, if Europe has furniſhed more eminent, to produce a ſingle paſſage ſuperior to the

The ſtory is as follows; of which, and of the ſpeech, the authenticity is unqueſtionable.

Colonel Creſap, the laſt ſpring, in cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not ſparing even my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have ſought it; I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace; but do not harbour a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to ſave his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one."</p>
                     <p>To the preceding anecdotes, in favour of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican character, may be added the following, by Dr. Benjamin Franklin.—The Indian men, when young, are hunters and warriors; when old, counſellors; for all their government is by the counſel or advice of the ſages. Hence, they generally ſtudy oratory; the beſt ſpeakers having the moſt influence. The Indian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men till the ground, dreſs the food, nurſe and bring up the children, and preſerve and hand down to poſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity the memory of public tranſactions. Theſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of men and women are accounted natural and honourable. Having few artificial wants, they have abundance of leiſure for improvement by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Our laborious manner of life, compared with theirs, they eſteem ſlaviſh and baſe; and the learning on which we value ourſelves, they regard as frivolous and uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>Having frequent occaſions to hold public councils, they have acquired great order and decency in conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. The old men ſit in the foremoſt rank, the warriors in the next, and the women and children in the hindmoſt. The buſineſs of the women is to take exact notice of what paſſes; imprint it in their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for they have no writing, and communicate it to their children. They are the records of the council,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028963_0039_0FDDBD7AA777B6C8"/>and they preſerve tradition of the ſtipulations in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties a hundred years back; which, when we compare with our writings, we always find exact. He that would ſpeak, riſes. The reſt obſerve a profound ſilence. When he has finiſhed, and ſits down, they leave him five or ſix minutes to recollect, that if he has omitted any thing he intended to ſay, or has any thing to add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he may riſe again and deliver it. To interrupt another even in common converſation, is reckoned highly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                     <p>The politeneſs of theſe ſavages in converſation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> indeed, carried to exceſs; ſince it does not permit them to contradict, or deny, the truth of what is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in their preſence. By theſe means they, indeed, avoid diſputes; but then it becomes difficult to know their minds, or what impreſſion you make upon them. The miſſionaries, who have attempted to convert them to chriſtianity, all complain of this, as one of the great difficulties of their miſſion. The Indians hear, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, the truths of the goſpel explained to them, and give their uſual tokens of aſſent and approbation; but this by no means implies conviction; it is mere civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ility.</p>
                     <p>When any of them come into our towns, our people are apt to crowd round them, gaze upon them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode them when they deſire to be private; this they eſteem great rudeneſs, and the effect of the want of inſtruction in the rules of civility, and good manners. "We have," ſay they, "as much curioſity as you; and when you come into our towns, we wiſh for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of looking at you; but for this purpoſe we hide ourſelves behind buſhes where you are to paſs, and never intrude ourſelves into your company."</p>
                     <p>Their manner of entering one another's villages has likewiſe its rules. It is reckoned uncivil in travelling ſtrangers to enter a village abruptly, without giving notice of their approach. Therefore, as ſoon as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028963_0039_0FDDBD7AA777B6C8"/>there till invited to enter. Two old men uſually come out to them, and lead them in. There is in every vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage a vacant dwelling, called the <hi>ſtranger's houſe.</hi> Here they are placed, while the old men go round from hut to hut, acquainting the inhabitants that ſtrangers are arrived, who are, probably, hungry and weary; and every one ſends them what he can ſpare of victuals, and ſkins to repoſe on. When the ſtrangers are refreſhed, pipes and tobacco are brought; and then, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, converſation begins, with inquiries who they are, whither bound, what news, &amp;c. and it uſually ends with offers of ſervice; if the ſtrangers have occaſion for guides, or any neceſſaries, for continuing their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and nothing is exacted for the entertainment.</p>
                     <p>The ſame hoſpitality, eſteemed among them as a principal virtue, is practiſed by private perſons; of which Conrad Weiſer, a celebrated interpreter of the Indian languages, gave Dr. Franklin the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. He had been naturalized among the Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſpoke well the Mohawk language. In going through the Indian country, to carry a meſſage from our governour to the council at Onondaga, he called at the habitation of Canaſſetego, an old acquaintance, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, ſpread furs for him to ſit on, placed before him ſome boiled beans and veniſon, and mixed ſome rum and water for his drink. When he was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, and had lit his pipe, Canaſſetego began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him; aſked how he had fared the many years ſince they had ſeen each other, whence he then came, what had occaſioned the journey, &amp;c. Conrad anſwered all his queſtions; and when the diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to flag, the Indian, to continue it, ſaid, "Conrad, you have lived long among the white people, and know ſomething of their cuſtoms; I have been ſometimes at Albany, and have obſerved that once in ſeven days they ſhut up their ſhops, and aſſemble all in the great houſe; tell me what it is for?—What do they do there?

So I thought to myſelf, ſince I cannot do any buſineſs today, I may as well go to the meeting too; and I went with him.—There ſtood up a man in black, and began to talk to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, very angrily. I did not underſtand what he ſaid; but perceiving that he looked much at me and at Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I imagined he was angry at ſeeing me there; ſo I went out, ſat down near the houſe, ſtruck fire, and lit my pipe, waiting till the meeting ſhould break up. I thought, too, that the man had mentioned ſomething of beaver, and I ſuſpected that it might be the ſubject of their meeting. So when they came out, I accoſted my merchant.—Well, Hans, (ſays I) I hope you have agreed to give more than 4<abbr>s.</abbr> a pound?" "No, (ſays he) I cannot give ſo much, I cannot give more than 3<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr>" "I then ſpoke to ſeveral other dealers, but they all ſung the ſame ſong, three and ſix pence, three and ſix pence. This made it clear to me that my ſuſpicion was right; and that whatever they pretended of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to learn <hi>good things,</hi> the real purpoſe was, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult how to cheat Indians in the price of beaver. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider but a little, Conrad, and you muſt be of my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. If they met ſo often to learn <hi>good things,</hi> they certainly would have learned ſome before this time. But they are ſtill ignorant. You know our practice. If a white man, in travelling through our country,

But if I go into a white man's houſe at Albany, and aſk for victuals and drink, they ſay, where is your money? And if I have none, they ſay, get out, you Indian dog. You ſee they have not yet learned thoſe little <hi>good things</hi> that we need no meeting to be inſtructed in; becauſe our mothers taught them to us when we were children; and, therefore, it is impoſſible their meetings ſhould be, as they ſay, for any ſuch purpoſe, or have any ſuch effect; they are only to contrive <hi>the cheating of Indians in the price of beaver.</hi>"</p>

                     <p>Diſcoveries, long ago made, inform us, that an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between the Old Continent and America might be carried on, with facility, from the north weſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of Europe and the northeaſt boundaries of Aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. In the ninth century the Norwegians diſcovered Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and planted a colony there. The communication with that country was renewed in the laſt century by Moravian miſſionaries, in order to propagate their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines in that bleak and uncultivated region. By then we are informed that the north weſt coaſt of Greenland is ſeparated from America by a very narrow ſtrait; that at the bottom of the bay it is highly probable that they are united; that the Eſquimaux of America perfectly reſemble the Greenlanders, in their aſpect, dreſs, and mode of living; and that a Moravian miſſionary, well acquainted with the language of Greenland, having viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited the country of the Eſquimaux, found, to his aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, that they ſpoke the ſame language with the Greenlanders, and were, in every reſpect, the ſame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The ſame ſpecies of animals, too, are found in the contiguous regions. The bear, the wolf, the fox, the hare, the deer, the roebuck, the elk, frequent the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of North America, as well as thoſe in the north of Europe.</p>
                     <p>Other diſcoveries have proved, that if the two conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of Aſia and America be ſeparated at all, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a narrow ſtrait. From this part of the Old Continent, alſo, inhabitants may have paſſed into the New; and the reſemblance between the Indians of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica and the eaſtern inhabitants of Aſia, would induce us to conjecture that they have a common origin. This is the opinion adopted by Dr. Robertſon, in his Hiſtory of America, where we find it accompanied with the following narrative.</p>

Theſe the Ruſſians imagined to be part of America; and ſeveral circumſtances concurred not only in confirming them in this belief, but in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading them that ſome portion of that continent could not be very remote. Trees of various kinds, unknown in thoſe naked regions of Aſia, are driven upon the coaſt by an eaſterly wind. By the ſame wind, floating ice is brought thither in a few days; flights of birds arrive annually from the ſame quarter; and a tradition obtains among the inhabitants, of an intercourſe form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly carried on with ſome countries ſituated to the eaſt.</p>

Two veſſels were finiſhed; and, under the command of captains Behring and Tſchirikow, ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Kamtſchatka in queſt of the New World, in a quarter where it had never been approached. They ſhaped their courſe towards the eaſt; and though a ſtorm ſoon ſeparated the veſſels, which never rejoined, and many diſaſters befel them, the expectations from the voyage were not altogether fruſtrated. Each of the commanders diſcovered land, which to them appeared to be part of the American continent; and, according to their obſervations, it ſeems to be ſituated within a few degrees of the north weſt coaſt of California. Each ſet ſome of his people aſhore: but in one place the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants fled as the Ruſſians approached; in another, they carried off thoſe who landed, and deſtroyed their boats. The violence of the weather, and the diſtreſs of their crews, obliged both to quit this inhoſpitable coaſt. In their return they touched at ſeveral iſlands, which ſtretch in a chain from eaſt to weſt between the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which they had diſcovered and the coaſt of Aſia. They had ſome intercourſe with the natives, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them to reſemble the North Americans. They preſented to the Ruſſians the calumet, or pipe of peace, which is a ſymbol of friendſhip univerſal among the people of North America, and an uſage of arbitrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution peculiar to them."</p>
                     <p>The more recent and accurate diſcoveries of that il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious navigator Cooke, and of his ſucceſſor Clerke, have brought the matter ſtill nearer to certainty. The ſea, from the ſouth of Behring's Straits to the creſcent of iſles between Aſia and America, is very ſhallow. It deepens from theſe ſtraits (as the Britiſh ſeas do from thoſe of Dover) till ſoundings are loſt in the Pacific Ocean; but that does not take place but to the ſouth of the iſles.

From the volcanic diſpoſition, it has been judged prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, not only that there was a ſeparation of the continents at the ſtraits of Behring, but that the whole ſpace from the iſles to that ſmall opening had once been occupied by land; and that the fury of the watery element, actuated by that of fire, had, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Without adopting all the fancies of Buffon, there can be no doubt, as the Abbé Clavigero obſerves, that our planet has been ſubject to great viciſſitudes ſince the deluge.

                        </gap>. We have examples of all theſe revolutions in the paſt century. Sicily was united to the continent of Naples, as Eubea, now the Black Sea, was to Boeotia. Diodorus, Strabo, and other ancient authors, ſay the ſame thing of Spain, and of Africa, and affirm, that by a violent eruption of the ocean upon the land between the mountains Abyla and Calpe, that communication was broken, and the Mediterranean Sea was formed. Among the people of Ceylon there is a tradition that a ſimilar irruption of the ſea ſeparated their iſland from the peninſula of India. The ſame thing is believed by thoſe of Malabar with reſpect to the iſles of Maldivia, and with the Malayans with reſpect to Sumatra. It is certain, ſays the count de Buffon, that in Ceylon the earth has loſt 30 or 40 leagues, which the ſea has taken from it; on the contrary, Tongres, a place of the Low Countries, has gained 30 leagues of land from the ſea. The northern part of Egypt owes its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028963_0043_0FDDBD869105C5D8"/>to inundations of the Nile. The earth which this river has brought from the inland countries of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and depoſited in its inundations, has formed a ſoil of more than 25 cubits of depth. In like manner, adds the above author, the province of the Yellow River in China, and that of Louiſiana, have only been formed of the mud of rivers. Plina, Seneca, Diodorus, and Strabo, report innumerable examples of ſimilar revolutions, which we omit, that our diſſertation may not become too prolix; as alſo many modern revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are related in the theory of the earth of the Count de Buffon and other authors. In South A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, all thoſe who have obſerved with philoſophic eyes the peninſula of Yucatan, do not doubt that that country has once been the bed of the ſea; and, on the contrary, in the channel of Bahama, many indications ſhow the iſland of Cuba to have been once united to the continent of Florida. In the ſtrait which ſeparates America from Aſia many iſlands are found, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably were the mountains belonging to that tract of land which we ſuppoſe to have been ſwallowed up by earthquakes; which is made more probable by the multitude of volcanoes which we know of in the penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula of Kamtſchatka. It is imagined, however, that the ſinking of that land, and the ſeparation of the two continents, has been occaſioned by thoſe great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary earthquakes mentioned in the hiſtories of the Americans, which formed an aera almoſt as memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as that of the deluge.

Whether that great event, the ſeparation of the continents, took place before or after the population of America, it is impoſſible for us to determine: but we are indebted to the abovementioned navigators for ſettling the long diſpute about the point from which it was effected.

This uſage, as we well know, by horrid experience, is continued to this day in America. The ferocity of the Scyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians to their priſoners extended to the remoteſt part of Aſia. The Kamtſchatkans, even at the time of their diſcovery by the Ruſſians, put their priſoners to death by the moſt lingering and excruciating inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; a practice in full force to this very day among the aboriginal Americans.

Seventeen of the Kamtſchatkan quadrupeds are found in America: Others are common only to Siberia, or Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, having, for unknown cauſes, entirely evacuated Kamtſchatka, and divided themſelves between Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca and the parts of Aſia above cited. Multitudes, again, have deſerted the Old World, even to an individual, and fixed their ſeats at diſtances moſt remote from the ſpot from which they took their departure; from mount Ararat, the reſting place of the ark, in a central part of the Old World, and excellently adapted for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of the animal creation to all its parts.

After theſe wondrous proofs of omnipotency, it will be abſurd to deny the poſſibility of infuſing inſtinct into the brute creation. "God himſelf is the ſoul of brutes;" his pleaſure muſt have determined their will, and directed ſeveral ſpecies, and even whole genera, by impulſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible, to move by ſlow progreſſion to their deſtined regions. But for that, the illama and the pacos might ſtill have inhabited the heights of Armenia, and ſome more neighbouring Alps, inſtead of labouring to gain the diſtant Peruvian Andes; the whole genus of armadillos, flow of foot, would never have quitted the torrid zone of the Old World for that of the New; and the whole tribe of monkeys would have gamboled together in the foreſts of India, inſtead of dividing their reſidence between the ſhades of Indoſtan, and the deep foreſts of the Braſils.

The Old World would have been overſtocked with animals; the New remained an unanimated waſte! Or both have contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an equal portion of every beaſt of the earth. Let it not be objected, that animals bred in a ſouthern climate, after the deſcent of their parents from the ark, would be unable to bear the froſt and ſnow of the rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous north, before they reached South America, the place of their final deſtination. It muſt be conſidered, that the migration muſt have been the work of ages; that in the courſe of their progreſs each generation grew hardened to the climate it had reached; and that, after their arrival in America, they would again be gradually accuſtomed to warmer and warmer climates, in their removal from north to ſouth, as they had in the reverſe, or from ſouth to north. Part of the tiger, ſtill inhabit the eternal ſnows of Ararat, and multitudes of the very ſame ſpecies live, but with exalted rage, beneath the line, in the burning ſoil of Borneo, or Sumatra; but neither lions or tigers ever migrated into the New World. A few of the firſt are found in India and Perſia, but they are found in numbers only in Africa. The tiger extends as far north as weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern Tartary, in lat. 40°, 50′, but never has reached America."</p>
                     <p>In fine, the conjectures of the learned reſpecting the vicinity of the Old and New World are now, by the diſcoveries of late great navigators, loſt in conviction; and, in the place of imaginary hypotheſis, the real place of migration almoſt incontrovertibly pointed out. Some (from a paſſage in Plato) have extended over the Atlantic, from the ſtraits of Gibraltar to the coaſt of North and South America, an iſland equal in ſize to the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028963_0047_0FDD5F2A5196B368"/>continents of Aſia and Africa; over which had paſſed, as over a bridge, from the latter, men and animals; wool headed negroes, and lions and tigers, none of which ever exiſted in the New World. A mighty ſea aroſe, and, in one day and night, engulphed this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous tract, and with it every being which had not completed its migration into America. The whole ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro race, and almoſt every quadruped, now inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Africa, periſhed in this critical day. Five only are to be found, at preſent, in America; and of theſe only one, the bear, in South America: Not a ſingle cuſtom, common to the natives of Africa and America, to evince a common origin. Of the quadrupeds, the bear, ſtag, wolf, fox, and weeſel, are the only ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals which we can pronounce, with certainty, to be found on each continent. The ſtag, the fox, and the weeſel, have made, alſo, no farther progreſs in Africa than the north; but on the ſame continent the wolf is ſpread over every part, yet is unknown in South Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, as are the fox and weeſel. In Africa and in South America the bear is very local, being met with only in the north of the firſt, and on the Andes in the laſt. Some cauſe unknown arreſted its progreſs in Africa, and impelled the migration of a few into the Chilian Alps, and induced them to leave unoccupied the vaſt tract from North America to the lofty Cordilleras.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>ALLUSIONS have often been made by travellers, and others, to ſome remains in America which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to owe their original to a people more intimately acquainted with the arts of life than the <hi>ſavage</hi> tribes which inhabited this continent on its firſt diſcovery by the Europeans, or than thoſe which are, at preſent, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through various parts of its extent. In a ſmall work, publiſhed in London, in 1787, entitled <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on ſome parts of natural hiſtory<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>: To which is prefixed, an account of ſeveral remarkable veſtiges of an ancient date, which have been diſcovered in different parts of America,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">By Dr. <hi>Benjamin Smith Barton,</hi> of Philadelphia.</note> Part I. the author has collected the ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hints of Kaim, of Carver, of Filſon, and ſome other travellers, and writers; and has added a plan and deſcription of a regular work, which he ſuppoſes to have been a <hi>fortification,</hi> that has been diſcovered near the confluence of the rivers Ohio and Muſkingum. The remains deſcribed, or alluded to, in this publication, are characters, or ſingular marks, which were ſuppoſed by ſome Jeſuits, who examined them, to be <hi>Tartarian;</hi> furrows, as if the land had been ploughed; a ſtone wall; mounds of earth, of different forms and ſizes; earthen walls, and ditches, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The mounds of earth are ſuppoſed, by the author, to have been deſigned for different purpoſes: The <hi>ſmaller</hi> ones are, evidently, tumuli, or repoſitories of the dead; and, he thinks, the larger ones, as that at Grave Creek (a branch of the Ohio) many which are to be ſeen in Mexico, and in other parts of America, were intended to ſerve as the baſes of temples.</p>
                     <p>The moſt curious part of this little work is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, together with the plan, of the ſuppoſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028963_0048_0FDDBD920F627230"/>above alluded to. It is ſituated on the eaſt ſide of the river Muſkingum, about half a mile above it junction with the river Ohio, nearly in the latitude of 39°. 21′. and about 170 miles below Fort Pitt, at the confluence of the rivers Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eghaney and Monongahe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. The town, as it has been, ſometimes, called, is a large level, encompaſſed by walls of a tetragon form; occupying a piece of ground about one quarter of a mile ſquare. Theſe walls are from ſix to ten feet in height, and from twenty to forty feet in thickneſs. They are, at preſent, overgrown with vegetables, of different kinds, and, among others, with trees, ſome of which are of a very conſiderable diameter. Each ſide of the walls is divided, by three chaſms, or openings, into four, nearly equal, parts: Theſe chaſms are directly oppoſite to each other. Within the walls there are three elevations; the largeſt of theſe is of an oblong form, 74 yards long, 44 yards broad, and 6 feet in height: The ſecond is nearly of a ſimilar form, 50 yards long, and 40 broad: The third is, alſo, an oblong mount, but much ſmaller. Beſides theſe three eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there is a ſmall circular mount, placed nearly in the centre of four ſmall caves; and a "ſomi circular parapet," which, it is not improbable, may have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to guard one of the chaſms, or openings: This parapet has a ſmall mount. The author obſerves, that the three elevations "conſiderably reſemble ſome of the eminences which have been diſcovered near the river Miſſiſſippi," of which he has given an account in his publication.</p>
                     <p>The fortifications (for a diſtinction has been made between them and the town, but we cannot ſee with what great propriety) are nearly of the ſame form as the town. The walls have here, alſo, openings: And at each of theſe openings there is one, or more, of the ſmall circular mounts.</p>
                     <p>The pyramid is one of the moſt conſpicuous parts of theſe ſingular remains. It is of a circular form; 50
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028963_0049_0FDDBD93890B8188"/>feet in height, 390 feet in circumferance; and is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a ditch, 5 feet deep, and 15 feet wide: Externally to the ditch there is a parapet, which is 759 feet in circumference. "The pyramid, as well as the eminences and walls, is now covered with graſſes, and other kinds of vegetables." Beſides theſe, there are ſeveral other eminences, of which we do not think it neceſſary to take any notice, in this place.</p>
                     <p>The author's opinion concerning theſe remains is this; that they owe their original to "the Toltecas, or ſome other Mexican nation," and that theſe people were, probably, the deſcendants of the Danes. The firſt member of this <hi>conjecture</hi> appears not improbable, if we conſider the ſimilarity of the Mexican mounts and fortifications, deſcribed by Torquemada, by the Abbé Clavegero, and by other authors, to thoſe of which our author has publiſhed an account; and, alſo, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the tradition of the Mexicans, that they came from the north weſt, in which tract great numbers of theſe remains have been diſcovered. As to the ſecond mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this conjecture, we think it but feebly ſupported; although we are not ignorant that Grotius and other writers have endeavoured to prove, that the northern nations of Europe, had, actually, ſome intercourſe with America, long before the time of Columbus.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid, there are inſcriptions in ſtrange characters in different parts of the weſtern country: One, in particular, on a flat rock on the river Cumberland, the exiſtence of which general Clarke affirms. It is ſaid to be lengthy, and would no doubt if decyphered throw great light upon the ancient hiſtory of America.

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is believed, by many, that the ancients had ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect notion of the New World; and ſeveral an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authors are quoted in confirmation of this opinion. In a book, aſcribed to the philoſopher Ariſtotle, we are told that the Carthaginians diſcovered an iſland, far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the pillars of Hercules, large, fertile, and finely watered, with navigable rivers, but uninhabited. This iſland was diſtant a few days ſailing from the continent: its beauty induced the diſcoverers to ſettle there; but the policy of Carthage diſlodged the colony, and laid ſtrict prohibition on all the ſubjects of the ſtate not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any future eſtabliſhment. This account is alſo confirmed by an hiſtorian of no mean credit, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that the Tyrians would have ſettled a colony on the newly diſcovered iſland, but were oppoſed by the Carthaginians, for ſtate reaſons.</p>
                     <p>The Welſh, fondly, imagine that their country con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, in 1170, to people the New World, by the adventure of Madoc, ſon of Owen Gwynedd, who, on the death of his father, ſailed there, and colonized part of the country. It is pretended that Mado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> made two voyages: That ſailing weſt, he left Ireland ſo far to
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028963_0050_0FDDBD951E29F068"/>the north, that he came to land unknown, where he ſaw many ſtrange things; that he returned home, and, making a report of the fertility of the newly diſcovered country, prevailed on numbers of the Welſh, of each ſex, to accompany him, on a ſecond voyage, from which he never returned. The favourers of this opinion aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that ſeveral Welſh words, ſuch as <hi>gwrando,</hi> "to hearken, or liſten;" the iſle of <hi>Croeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But likeneſs of ſound, in a few words, will not be deemed ſufficient to eſtabliſh the fact; eſpecially if the meaning has been evidently pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For example, the whole pinguin tribe have, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, not only black <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

It may be added, that the Welſh were never a naval people; that the age in which Mado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note n="*" place="bottom">The different opinions upon this ſubject, and the foundations upon which they are built, are to be found in Dr. Robertſon's Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of America; Dr. Belknap's American Biography, Vol. I. and Dr. John Williams's inquiry concerning the firſt diſcovery of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.

                     <p>The Norwegians put in for a ſhare of the glory, on grounds rather better than the Welſh. By their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Iceland, and in Greenland, they had arrived within ſo ſmall a diſtance of the New World, that there is a probability of its having been touched at by a people ſo verſed in maritime affairs, and ſo adventurous, as the ancient Normans were. The proofs are much more numerous than thoſe produced by the Britiſh hiſtorians; for the diſcovery is mentioned in ſeveral of the Iceland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028963_0050_0FDDBD951E29F068"/>when it was viſited by one Biorn; and the diſcovery purſued to great effect by Leif, the ſon of Eric, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer of Greenland. It does not appear that they reached farther than Labrador; on which coaſt they met with the Eſquimaux, on whom they beſtowed the name of <hi>Skraelingues,</hi> or dwarfiſh people, from their ſmall ſtature. They were armed with bows and arrows, and had leathern canoes, ſuch as they have at preſent. All this is probable; nor ſhould the tale of the German, called <hi>Turkil,</hi> one of the crew, invalidate the account. He was one day miſſing; but ſoon returned, leaping and ſinging, with all the extravagant marks of joy a <hi>bon vivant</hi> could ſhow, on diſcovering the inebriating fruit of his country, the grape: Torſaeus even ſays, that he returned in a ſtate of intoxication. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his commander, he brought ſeveral bunches: And the country, from that circumſtance, was named <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> There appears no reaſon to doubt of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; it is thought probable, however, that theſe people reached no farther than the barren country of Labrador. In ſhort, it is from a much later period, that we muſt date the <hi>unequivocal</hi> diſcovery of America.</p>
                     <p>TOWARDS the cloſe of the 15th century, Venice and Genoa being rivals in commerce, in which the former had greatly the ſuperiority, Chriſtopher Colon, or Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, a native of Genoa, conceived a project of ſailing to the Eaſt Indies by directing his courſe weſtward. This deſign was founded upon a miſtake of the geographers, of thoſe days, who placed the eaſtern parts of Aſia im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely too far to the eaſtward; ſo that had they been in the right, the ſhorteſt way would have been to ſail directly weſtward. Columbus applied, firſt, to his own countrymen; but being rejected by them, he applied to Portugal, where he met with no better ſucceſs. Spain was his next reſource: here, after eight years attendance, he obtained, in 1492, a fleet of three ſhips. The largeſt, a ſhip of no conſiderable burden, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028963_0051_0FDDBD96A9581B40"/>by Columbus, as admiral, who gave it the name of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> out of reſpect for the Bleſſed Virgin, whom he honoured with ſingular devotion. Of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, called the <hi>Pinta,</hi> Martin Pinzon was captain, and his brother Francis pilot. The third, named the <hi>Nigna,</hi> was under the command of Vincent Yanez Pinzon. Theſe two were light veſſels, hardly ſuperior in bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or force, to large boats. This ſquadron, if it merits that name, was victualled for 12 months, and had on board 90 men, moſtly ſailors, together with a few ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, who followed the fortune of Columbus, and ſome gentlemen of Iſabella's court, whom ſhe appointed to accompany him. Though the expenſe of the undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was one of the circumſtances which chiefly alarmed the court of Spain, and retarded, ſo long, the negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with Columbus, the ſum employed in fitting out this ſquadron did not exceed 4000<abbr>l.</abbr> As Columbus was deeply impreſſed with ſentiments of religion, he would not ſet out upon an expedition ſo arduous, and of which one great object was to extend the knowledge of the chriſtian faith, without imploring publicly, the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and protection of Heaven. With this view, he, together with all the perſons under his command, marched, in ſolemn proceſſion, to the monaſtery of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bida. After confeſſing their ſins, and obtaining ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, they received the holy ſacrament from the hands of the guardian, who joined his prayers to theirs for the ſucceſs of an enterprize which he had ſo zealouſly patronized.</p>
                     <p>Next morning, being Friday, the third day of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, in the year 1492, Columbus ſet ſail, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſun riſe, in preſence of a vaſt crowd of ſpectators, who ſent up their ſupplications to Heaven for the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous iſſue of the voyage, which they wiſhed, rather than expected. Columbus ſteered, directly, for the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Iſlands, and arrived there without any occurrence that would have deſerved notice on any other occaſion: but, in a voyage of ſuch expectation and importance,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028963_0051_0FDDBD96A9581B40"/>every circumſtance was the object of attention. The rudder of the Pinta broke looſe, the day after ſhe leſt the harbour, and that accident alarmed the crew, no leſs ſuperſtitious than unſkilful, as a certain omen of the unfortunate deſtiny of the expedition. Even in the ſhort run to the Canaries, the ſhips were found to be ſo crazy, and ill appointed, as to be very improper for a navigation which was expected to be both long and dangerous. Columbus refitted them, however, to the beſt of his power; and having ſupplied himſelf with freſh proviſions, he took his departure from Gomera, one of the moſt weſterly of the Canary Iſlands, on the ſixth day of September.</p>
                     <p>Here the voyage of diſcovery may properly be ſaid to begin; for Columbus, holding his courſe due weſt, left, immediately, the uſual track of navigation, and ſtretched into unfrequented and unknown ſeas. The firſt day, as it was very calm, he made but little way; but on the ſecond he loſt ſight of the Canaries; and many of the ſailors, already dejected and diſmayed, when they contemplated the boldneſs of the undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, began to beat their breaſts, and to ſhed tears, as if they were never more to behold land. Columbus comforted them with aſſurances of ſucceſs, and the proſpect of vaſt wealth, in thoſe opulent regions whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he was conducting them. He regulated every thing by his ſole authority; he ſuperintended the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of every order; and allowed himſelf only a few hours for ſleep; he was at all other times upon deck. As his courſe lay through ſeas which had not, formerly, been viſited, the ſounding line, or inſtruments for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, were continually in his hands. After the example of the Portugueſe diſcoverers, he attended to the motion of tides and currents, watched the flight of birds, the appearance of fiſhes, of ſea weeds, and of every thing that floated on the waves, and entered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occurrence with a minute exactneſs, in the journal which he kept. As the length of the voyage could not
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028963_0052_0FDDBDF775555DB8"/>fail of alarming ſailors habituated only to ſhort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſions, Columbus endeavoured to conceal from them the real progreſs which they made. With this view, though they ran 18 leagues the ſecond day, after they left Gomera, he gave out that they had advanced only 15, and he uniformly employed the ſame artifice of reckoning ſhort, during the whole voyage. By the 14th of September, the fleet was above 200 leagues to the weſt of the Canary Iſles. There they were ſtruck with an appearance, no leſs aſtoniſhing than new. They obſerved that the magnetic needle, in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, did not point exactly to the polar ſtar, but varieſt towards the weſt; and, as they proceeded, this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation increaſed. This appearance, which is now familiar, though it ſtill remains one of the myſteries of nature, into the cauſe of which the ſagacity of man hath not been able to penetrate, ſilled the companions of Columbus with terror. They were now in a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, unknown, ocean, far from the uſual place of navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; nature itſelf ſeemed to be altered, and the only guide which they had left was about to fail them. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, with no leſs quickneſs than ingenuity, invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a reaſon for this appearance, which, though it did not ſatisfy himſelf, ſeemed ſo plauſible to them, that it diſpelled their fears, or ſilenced their murmurs.</p>
                     <p>He ſtill continued to ſteer due weſt, nearly in the ſame latitude with the Canary Iſlands. In this courſe, he came within the ſphere of the trade wind, which blows, invariably, from eaſt to weſt, between the tropics, and a few degrees beyond them. He advanced before this ſteady gale with ſuch uniform rapidity, that it was ſeldom neceſſary to ſhift a ſail. When about 400 leagues to the weſt of the Canaries, he found the ſea ſo covered with weeds, that it reſembled a meadow of vaſt extent; and in ſome places they were ſo thick, as to retard the motion of the veſſels. This ſtrange appearance occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned new alarm and diſquiet. The ſailors imagined that they were now arrived at the utmoſt boundary of

Columbus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſuade them, that what had alarmed, ought rather to have encouraged them, and was to be conſidered as a ſign of approaching land. At the ſame time, a briſk gale aroſe, and carried them forward. Several birds were ſeen hovering about the ſhip, and directed their ſlight towards the weſt. The deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crew reſumed ſome degree of ſpirit, and began to entertain freſh hopes.</p>
                     <p>Upon the firſt of October they were, according to the admiral's reckoning, 770 leagues to the weſt of the Canaries; but, leſt his men ſhould be intimidated by the prodigious length of the navigation, he gave out that they had proceeded only 584 leagues; and fortun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for Columbus, neither his own pilot, nor thoſe of the other ſhips, had ſkill ſufficient to correct this error, and to diſcover the deceit. They had, now, been above three weeks at ſea: they had proceeded far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what former navigators had attempted, or deemed poſſible: all their prognoſtics of diſcovery, drawn from the flight of birds, and other circumſtances, had prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fallacious: the appearances of land, with which their own credulity, or the artifice of their commander, had, from time to time, flattered and amuſed them, had been altogether illuſive, and their proſpect of ſucceſs ſeemed now to be as diſtant as ever. Theſe reflections occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red often to men, who had no other object, or occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to reaſon and to diſcourſe concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and circumſtances of their expedition.

                     <p>Columbus was fully ſenſible of his perilous ſituation. He had obſerved, with great uneaſineſs, the fatal oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ignorance, and of fear, in producing diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among his crew; and ſaw that it was now ready to burſt out into open mutiny. He reta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ed, however, perfect preſence of mind. He affected to ſeem igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their machinations. Notwithſtanding the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and ſolicitude of his own mind, he appeared with a cheerful countenance; like a man ſatisfied with the progreſs which he had made, and confident of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Sometimes he employed all the arts of inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſoothe his men. Sometimes he endeavoured to work upon their ambition, or avarice, by magnificent deſcriptions of the fame and wealth which they were about to acquire. On other occaſions he aſſumed a tone of authority, and threatened them with vengeance
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028963_0053_0FDDBD9808968450"/>from their ſovereign, if, by their daſtardly behaviour, they ſhould defeat this noble effort to promote the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and to exalt the Spaniſh name, above that of every other nation. Even with ſeditious ſailors, the words of a man, whom they had been accuſtomed to reverence, were weighty and perſuaſive; and not only reſtrained them from thoſe violent exceſſes which they meditated, but prevailed with them to accompany their admiral for ſome time longer.</p>
                     <p>As they proceeded, the indications of approaching land ſeemed to be more certain, and excited hope in proportion. The birds began to appear in flocks, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the ſouth weſt. Columbus, in imitation of the Portugueſe navigators, who had been guided in ſeveral of their diſcoveries by the motion of birds, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his courſe from due weſt towards that quarter whither they pointed their flight. But after holding on for ſeveral days in this new direction without any better ſucceſs than formerly, having ſeen no object during 30 days but the ſea and the ſky, the hopes of his companions ſubſided faſter than they had riſen; their fears revived with additional force; impatience, rage, and deſpair, appeared in every countenance. All ſenſe of ſubordination was loſt. The officers, who had hitherto concurred with Columbus in opinion, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his authority, now took part with the private men: they aſſembled tumultuouſly, on the deck, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with their commander, mingled threats with their expoſtulations, and required him inſtantly to tack about, and to return to Europe. Columbus perceived that it would be of no avail to have recourſe to any of his former arts, which having been tried ſo often had loſt their effect; and that it was impoſſible to rekindle any zeal for the ſucceſs of the expedition among men in whoſe breaſts fear had extinguiſhed every generous ſentiment. He ſaw that it was no leſs vain to think of employing either gentle or ſevere meaſures, to quell a mutiny ſo general and ſo violent. It was neceſſary,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028963_0054_0FDDBD998347C090"/>on all theſe accounts, to ſoothe paſſions which he could no longer command, and to give way to a torrent too impetuous to be checked. He promiſed, ſolemnly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> his men, that he would comply with their requeſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they would accompany him, and obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for three days longer; and if, during that time, land were not diſcovered, he would then abandon the enterprize and direct his courſe towards Spain.</p>
                     <p>Enraged as the ſailors were, and impatient to turn their faces again towards their native country, this propoſition did not appear to them unreaſonable. Not did Columbus hazard much in confining himſelf to a term ſo ſhort. The preſages of diſcovering land went now ſo numerous and promiſing, that he deemed the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> infallible. For ſome days, the ſounding line had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bottom, and the ſoil which it brought up indicated land to be at no great diſtance. The flocks of birds increaſed; and were compoſed not only of ſea fowl, but of ſuch land birds as could not be ſuppoſed to fly far from the ſhore. The crew of the Pinta obſerved a cane floating, which ſeemed to be newly cut, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a piece of timber artificially carved. The ſailors aboard the Nigna took up the branch of a tree, with red berries, perfectly freſh. The clouds around the ſetting ſun aſſumed a new appearance; the air was more mild and warm; and, during night, the wind became unequal and variable. From all theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, Columbus was ſo confident of being near land, that on the evening of the 11th of October, 1492, after public prayers for ſucceſs, he ordered the ſails to be furled and the ſhips to lie by, keeping ſtrict watch, leſt they ſhould be driven aſhore in the night. During this interval of ſuſpenſe and expectation, no man ſhut his eyes, all kept upon deck, gazing intently towards that quarter where they expected to diſcover the land which had been ſo long the object of their wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>About two hours before midnight, Columbus ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the forecaſtle, obſerved a light at a diſtance,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028963_0054_0FDDBD998347C090"/>and privately pointed it out to Pedro Guttierez, a page of the queen's wardrobe. Guttierez perceived it; and calling to Salcedo, comptroller of the fleet, all three ſaw it in motion, as if it were carried from place to place. A little after midnight, the joyful ſound of <hi>land! land!</hi> was heard from the Pinta, which kept always ahead of the other ſhips. But having been ſo often deceived by fallacious appearances, every man was now become ſlow of belief; and waited, in all the anguiſh of uncertainty and impatience, for the return of day. As ſoon as morning dawned, all doubts and fears were diſpelled. From each ſhip, an iſland was ſeen about two leagues to the north, whoſe flat and verdant fields, well ſtored with wood, and watered with many rivulets, preſented the aſpect of a delightful country. The crew of the Pinta inſtantly began the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> as a hymn of thankſgiving to God; and were joined by thoſe of the other ſhips, with tears of joy and tranſports of congratulation. This office of gratitude to Heaven was followed by an act of juſtice to their commander. They threw themſelves at the feet of Columbus, with feelings of ſelf condemnation ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with reverence. They implored him to pardon their ignorance, incredulity, and inſolence, which had created him ſo much unneceſſary diſquiet, and had ſo often obſtructed the proſecution of his well concerted plan; and paſſing, in the warmth of their admiration, from one extreme to another, they now pronounced the man whom they had ſo lately reviled, and threatened, to be a perſon inſpired by Heaven, with ſagacity and fortitude more than human, in order to accompliſh a deſign ſo far beyond the ideas and conception of all former ages.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the ſun aroſe, all their boats were man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and armed. They rowed towards the iſland with their colours diſplayed, with warlike muſic, and other martial pomp. As they approached the coaſt, they ſaw it covered with a multitude of people, whom the novelty of the ſpectacle had drawn together, whoſe
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028963_0055_0FDDBD9AFA0DADD8"/>attitudes and geſtures expreſſed wonder and aſtoniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Columbus was the firſt European who ſet foot in the New World, which he had diſcovered. He landed in a rich dreſs, and with a naked ſword in his hand. His men followed; and, kneeling down, they all kiſſed the ground which they had ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee. They, next, erected a crucifix; and, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating themſelves before it, returned thanks to God for conducting their voyage to ſuch an happy iſſue.</p>
                     <p>The above was one of the Bahama Iſlands; to which he gave the name of <hi>San Salvador,</hi> and took poſſeſſion of it in the name of their Catholic majeſties. In this firſt voyage he diſcovered ſeveral other of the Lucavo, or Bahama Iſlands, with thoſe of Cuba and Hiſpaniola. The natives conſidered the Spaniards as divinities, and the diſcharge of the artillery as their thunder: they fell proſtrate at the ſound. The women, however, offered their favours, and courted the embraces of their new gueſts as men. Their huſbands were not jealous of them; and in the arms of thoſe wantons the companions of Columbus are ſaid, by ſome authors, to have caught that malady which directs its poiſon to the ſprings of life. The Abbé Raynal is of opinion that this diſorder was known in Europe before the diſcovery of America.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. of the E. and W. Indies.</note> In a ſecond voyage, many new iſlands were diſcovered. In a third, he attained the great object of his ambition, by diſcovering the continent of America, near the mouth of the river Oroonoko, on the firſt day of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, 1498. His ſucceſs produced a crowd of adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, from all nations; but the year before this, the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern continent had been diſcovered by Sebaſtian Cabot, in the ſervice of Henry VII. of England.</p>
                     <p>Although Columbus had the diſtinguiſhed merit of enlarging the circle of ſcience, and opening new chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels for commerce, by diſcovering a new world, yet he has been deprived of the honour of having it called

This was at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and the country began to be called after the name of its firſt ſuppoſed diſcoverer.

                     <p>NORTH AMERICA was diſcovered in the reign of Henry VII. a period when the arts and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies had made very conſiderable progreſs in Europe. Many of the firſt adventurers were men of genius and learning, and were careful to preſerve authentic records of ſuch of their proceedings as would be intereſting to poſterity. Theſe records afford ample documents for American hiſtorians. Perhaps no people on the globe, can trace the hiſtory of their origin and progreſs with ſo much preciſion, as the inhabitants of North Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; particularly that part of them who inhabit the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of the United States.</p>

<note place="margin">1495.</note> and inſpired many with the ſpirit of enterprize. As early as 1495, four years only after the firſt diſcovery of America, John Cabot, a Venetian, obtained a grant or commiſſion from Henry VII. to diſcover unknown lands and annex them to the crown.
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hazard's "Hiſtorical Collections," page 9, Vol. I, where this grant is recited at large. It is dated A. D. 1495.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſpring of 1496 he ſailed from England with two ſhips, carrying with him his three ſons. In this voyage, which was intended for China, he fell in with the north ſide of Terra Labrador, and coaſted northerly as far as the 67th degree of latitude.

                     </p>
                     <p>1497.] The next year he made a ſecond voyage to America with his ſon Sebaſtian, who afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028963_0057_0FDDBD9DE02B5DE8"/>in the diſcoveries which his father had begun. On the 24th of June he diſcovered Bonnaviſta, on the north eaſt ſide of Newfoundland. Before his return he traverſed the coaſt from Davis's ſtraits to Cape Florida.</p>
                     <p>1502.] Sebaſtian Cabot was this year at Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and on his return, carried three of the natives of that iſland to King Henry VII.</p>
                     <p>1513.] In the ſpring of 1513, John Ponce ſailed from Porto Rico northerly, and diſcovered the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in 30° 8′ north latitude. He landed in April, a ſeaſon when the country around was covered with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and in full bloom. This circumſtance induced him to call the country Florida, which, for many years, was the common name for North and South America.</p>
                     <p>1516.] In 1516, Sir Sebaſtian Cabot and Sir Thomas Pert, explored the coaſt as far as Brazil in South Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica.</p>
                     <p>This vaſt extent of country, the coaſt of which was thus explored, remained unclaimed and unſettled by any European power, (except by the Spaniards in South America) for almoſt a century from the time of its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                     <p>1524.] It was not till the year 1524 that France at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted diſcoveries on the American coaſt. Stimulated by his enterprizing neighbours, Francis I. who poſſeſſed a great and active mind, ſent John Verrazano, a Flor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entine, to America, for the purpoſe of making diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. He traverſed the coaſt from latitude 28° to 50° north. In a ſecond voyage, ſometime after, he was loſt.</p>
                     <p>1525.] The next year Stephen Gomez, the firſt Spaniard who came upon the American coaſt for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, ſailed from Groyn in Spain, to Cuba and Flor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ida, thence northward to Cape Razo, in latitude 46° north, in ſearch of a northern paſſage to the Eaſt Indies.</p>
                     <p>

1534.] In the ſpring of 1534, by the direction of Francis I. a fleet was fitted out at St. Malo's in France, with deſign to make diſcoveries in America. The command of this fleet was given to James Cartier.
<note n="*" place="bottom">In Hazard's Hiſtorical Collection, Vol. I, page 19, is a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Francis I. to James Cartier or Quartier, for making an eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment in Canada, dated Oct. 17, 1540. Probably this commiſſion was given him in conſequence of his former diſcoveries.</note> He arrived at Newfoundland in May of this year. Thence he ſailed northerly; and on the day of the feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tival of St. Lawrence, he found himſelf in about lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 48° 30′ north, in the midſt of a broad gulf, which he named St. Lawrence. He gave the ſame name to the river which empties into it. In this voyage, he ſailed as far north as latitude 51°, expecting in vain to find a paſſage to China.</p>
                     <p>1535.] The next year he ſailed up the river St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence 300 leagues, to the great and ſwift <hi>Fall.</hi> He called the country New France; built a fort in which he ſpent the winter, and returned in the following ſpring to France.</p>
                     <p>1539.] On the 12th of May, 1539, Ferdinand de Soto, with 900 men, beſides ſeamen, ſailed from Cuba, having for his object the conqueſt of Florida. On the 30th of May he arrived at Spirito Santo, from whence he travelled northward to the Chickaſaw country, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout latitude 35° or 36°. He died and was buried on the bank of Miſſiſippi River, May, 1542, aged 42 years. Alverdo ſucceeded him.</p>
                     <p>1542.] In 1542, Francis la Roche, Lord Robewell, was ſent to Canada, by the French king, with three ſhips and 200 men, women and children. They win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered here in a fort which they had built, and returned in the ſpring. About the year 1550, a large number of adventurers ſailed for Canada, but were never after heard of. In 1598, the king of France commiſſioned the Marquis De la Roche to conquer Canada, and other countries not poſſeſſed by any Chriſtian Prince. We
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028963_0058_0FDDBD9F72D398C0"/>do not learn, however, that la Roche ever attempted to execute his commiſſion, or that any farther attempts were made to ſettle Canada during this century.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>January</hi> 6, 1548-49.] This year king Henry VII. granted a penſion for life to Sebaſtian Cabot, in conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of the important ſervices he had rendered to the kingdom by his diſcoveries in America.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Hazard's Hiſt. Col. Vol. I. page 23. Hackluyt calls this "The large penſion granted by K. Edward VI. to Sebaſtian Cabot, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting him Grand Pilot of England."</note> Very reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſcendants of the Cabot family now live in the Commonwealth of Maſſachuſetts.</p>
                     <p>1562.] The Admiral of France, Chatillon, early in this year, ſent out a fleet under the command of John Ribalt. He arrived at Cape Francis on the coaſt of Florida, near which, on the firſt of May, he diſcovered and entered a river which he called May river. It is more than probable that this river is the ſame which we now call St. Mary's, which forms a part of the ſouthern boundary of the United States. As he coaſted north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he diſcovered eight other rivers, one of which he called Port Royal, and ſailed up it ſeveral leagues. On one of the rivers he built a fort and called it <hi>Charles,</hi> in which he left a colony under the direction of Captain Albert. The ſeverity of Captain Albert's mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures excited a mutiny,
<note place="margin">1564.</note> in which, to the ruin of the colony, he was ſlain. Two years after, Chatillon ſent Rene Laudonier, with three ſhips, to Florida. In June he arrived at the river <hi>May,</hi> on which he built a fort, and, in honour to his king, Charles IX. he called it Carolina.</p>
                     <p>In Auguſt, this year, Capt. Ribalt arrived at Florida the ſecond time, with a fleet of ſeven veſſels, to recruit the colony, which, two years before, he had left under the direction of the unfortunate Capt. Albert.</p>
                     <p>The September following, Pedro Melandes, with ſix Spaniſh ſhips, purſued Ribalt up the river on which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028963_0059_0FDDBDA0FB2E67E8"/>maſſacred him and his whole company. Melandes having in this way taken poſſeſſion of the country, built three forts, and left them garriſoned with 1200 ſoldiers. Laudonier and his colony on May river, receiving infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the fate of Ribalt, took the alarm and eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to France.</p>
                     <p>1567.] A fleet of three ſhips was this year ſent from France to Florida, under the command of Dominique de Courges. The object of this expedition, was to diſpoſſeſs the Spaniards of that part of Florida which they had cruelly and unjuſtifiably ſeized three years before.
<note place="margin">1568.</note> He arrived on the coaſt of Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, April 1568, and ſoon after made a ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attack upon the forts. The recent cruelty of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endoes and his company excited revenge in the breaſt of Gourges, and rouſed the unjuſtifiable principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation. He took the forts; put moſt of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards to the ſword; and having burned and demoliſhed all their fortreſſes, returned to France. During the 50 years next after this event, the French enterprized no ſettlements in America.</p>
                     <p>1576.] Capt. Frobiſher was ſent this year, to find out a north weſt paſſage to the Eaſt Indies. The firſt land which he made on the coaſt was a Cape, which, in honor to the queen, he called <hi>Queen Elizabeth's Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> In coaſting northerly he diſcovered the ſtraits which bear his name. He proſecuted his ſearch for a paſſage into the weſtern ocean, till he was prevented by the ice, and then returned to England.

                        <hi>June</hi> 11th, 1578.] In 1578, Sir Humphry Gilbert obtained a patent from queen Elizabeth, for lands not yet poſſeſſed by any Chriſtian prince, provided he would take poſſeſſion within ſix years. With this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement he ſailed for America,
<note place="margin">1583.</note> and on the firſt of Auguſt 1583, anchored in Conception Bay. Afterwards he diſcovered and took poſſeſſion of St. John's Harbour, and the country ſouth of it. In
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028963_0059_0FDDBDA0FB2E67E8"/>purſuing his diſcoveries he loſt one of his ſhips on the ſhoals of Sablon, and on his return home, a ſtorm over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him, in which he was unfortunately loſt, and the intended ſettlement was prevented.</p>
                     <p>1584.] This year two patents were granted by queen Elizabeth, one to Admiral Gilbert, (Feb. 6.) the other to Sir Walter Raleigh (Mar. 25.) for lands not poſſeſſed by any Chriſtian Prince.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Hazard's Hiſtorical Collection, Vol. I. page 28 and 33.</note> By the direction of Sir Walter, two ſhips were fitted and ſent out under the command of Philip Amidas, and Arthur Barlow, with 107 paſſangers. In June 1585 they arrived on the coaſt, and anchored in a harbour ſeven leagues weſt of the Roanoke. This colony returned to England in June, 1586. On the 13th of July, they, in a formal manner, took poſſeſſion of the country, and, in honour of their virgin queen, Elizabeth, they called it <hi>Virginia.</hi> Till this time the country was known by the general name of <hi>Florida.</hi> After this Virginia became the common name for all North America.</p>
                     <p>1586.] This year, Sir Walter Raleigh ſent Sir Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Greenville to America, with ſeven ſhips. He arrived at Wococon harbour in June. Having ſtation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a colony of more than an hundred people at Roan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oke, under the direction of Capt. Ralph Lane, he coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed northeaſterly as far as Cheſapeak Bay, and returned to England.</p>
                     <p>The colony under Capt. Lane, endured extreme hardſhips, and muſt have periſhed, had not Sir Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Drake fortunately returned to Virginia, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them to England, after having made ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts for the queen in the Weſt Indies, and other places.</p>
                     <p>A fortnight atter, Sir Richard Greenville arrived with new recruits; and although he did not find the colony which he had before left, and knew not but they had periſhed, he had the raſhneſs to leave 50 men at the ſame place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="unknown:028963_0060_0FDDBDA280ACD230"/>
1587.] The year following, Sir Walter ſent another company to Virginia, under governour White, with a charter and twelve aſſiſtants. In July he arrived at Roanoke. Not one of the ſecond company remained. He determined, however, to riſk a third colony. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he left 115 people at the old ſettlement, and returned to England.</p>
                     <p>This year (Aug. 13.) <hi>Manteo</hi> was baptized in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia. He was the firſt native Indian who received that ordinance in that part of America. He, with Towaye, another Indian, had viſited England, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to Virginia with the colony. On the 18th of Auguſt, Mrs. Dare was delivered of a daughter, whom ſhe called <hi>Virginia.</hi> She was born at Roanoke, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>1590.] In the year 1590, governour White came over to Virginia with ſupplies and recruits for his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony, but, to his great grief, not a man was to be found. They had all miſerably famiſhed with hunger, or were maſſacred by the Indians.</p>
                     <p>1602.] In the ſpring of this year, Bartholomew Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold, with 32 perſons, made a voyage to North Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, and diſcovered and gave names to Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Elizabeth Iſlands, and to Dover Cliff. Elizabeth Iſland was the place which they fixed for their firſt ſettlement. But the courage of thoſe who were to have tarried, failing, they all went on board and returned to England. All the attempts to ſettle this continent which were made by the Dutch, French, and Engliſh, from its diſcovery to the preſent time, a period of 110 years, proved ineffectual. The Spaniards only, of all the European nations, had been ſucceſsful. There is no account of there having been one European family at this time, in all the vaſt extent of coaſt from Florida to Greenland.</p>
                     <p>1693.] Martin Pring and William Brown, were this year ſent by Sir Walter Raleigh, with two ſmall veſſels,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028963_0060_0FDDBDA280ACD230"/>to make diſcoveries in North Virginia. They came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coaſt, which was broken with a multitude of iſlands, in latitude 43° 30′ north. They coaſted ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Cape Cod Bay; thence round the Cape into a commodious harbour in latitude 41° 25′, where they went aſhore and tarried ſeven weeks, during which time they loaded one of their veſſels with ſaſſafras, and returned to England.</p>
                     <p>Bartholomew Gilbert, in a voyage to South Virginia, in ſearch of the third colony which had been left there by governour White, in 1587, having touched at ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of the Weſt India Iſlands, landed near Cheſapeak Bay, where, in a ſkirmiſh with the Indians, he and four of his men were unfortunately ſlain. The reſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further ſearch for the colony, returned to England.</p>
                     <p>France, being at this time in a ſtate of tranquility, in conſequence of the edict of Nantz in favour of the Proteſtants, paſſed by Henry IV. (April, 1598) and of the peace with Philip, king of Spain and Portugal, was induced to purſue her diſcoveries in America. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the king ſigned a patent
<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Coll. Vol. I. p. 45.</note> in favour of De Mons, (November 8, 1603) of all the country from the 40th to the 46th degrees of north latitude, under the name of <hi>Acadia.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1604.</note> The next year De Mons rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the coaſt from St. Lawrence to Cape Sable, and round to Cape Cod.</p>
                     <p>1605.] In May 1605, George's Iſland and Pentecoſt Harbour, were diſcovered by Capt. George Weymouth. In May he entered a large river in latitude 43° 20′, (variation 11° 15′ weſt,) which Mr. Prince, in his Chronology, ſuppoſes muſt have been Sagadahock; but from the latitude, it was more probably the Piſcataqua. Capt. Weymouth carried with him to England five of the natives.</p>
                     <p>1606.] Sir Walter Raleigh's grant being vacated by attainder in 1603, James I. by patent,
<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 50.</note> divided Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028963_0061_0FDDBDA3DC2830E0"/>into two colonies, on the 10th of April this year. The <hi>ſouthern,</hi> included all lands between th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>northern,</hi> called the ſecond colony, and known by the general name of North Virginia, included all lands between the 38th and 45th degrees of north latitude, and was granted to the Plymouth Company. Each of theſe colonies had a council of thirteen men to govern them. To prevent diſputes about territory, the colony which ſhould laſt place themſelves, was prohibited to plant within an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles of the other. There appears to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency in theſe grants, as the lands lying between the 38th and 41ſt degrees are covered by both patents.

The colony was chiefly indebted for its ſettlement and eſtabliſhment to Sir Walter Raleigh, who is ſaid to have expended £ 40,000 in his different enterprizes; Lord de la War, and captain John Smith, likewiſe ſpent their fortunes in labouring zealouſly for its proſperity.</p>
                        <p>An opening for a friendly intercourſe with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives was made by the marriage of Mr. John Rolfe, a very worthy gentleman, to Pocahontas, the daughter of Bowhatan, a famous Indian chief.

During the cruel reign of queen
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028963_0071_0FDDBDBC1B0D1450"/>Mary, the oppoſition became more general and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; and great numbers fled to and reſided in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign parts, in order to eſcape perſecution.</p>

Thoſe of the clergy who would comply with the queen's eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, were quickly preferred; but the reſt, after being permitted to preach a while, were ſuſpended, and reduced to their former indigence.</p>
                        <p>The clergy and laity, who wiſhed for greater eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical purity, ſtruggled hard for the abolition of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and habits which they thought unlawful; cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which even their opponents acknowledged to be in their own nature indifferent. From their attempting a purer form of worſhip and diſcipline, than had yet been eſtabliſhed, they obtained the honourable nick name of <hi>Puritans.</hi>

                        <p>It is very likely, the three perſons, firſt named in this grant, had nothing more in view by the purchaſe, than a ſettlement for trade with the natives, or for fiſhery, or other advantageous purpoſes.

At firſt, they pitched upon the north ſide of Charles river, or rather northweſt, by the major voice; but a number of the principal gentlemen hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixed their cottages, or ſhelters, intended for one winter only, upon the oppoſite ſide of the river, the governour and moſt of the aſſiſtants removed to them in November.</p>
                        <p>They found when they arrived, a few families ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered about in ſeveral parts of the bay. Mr. Maverick lived on Noddles Iſland, a grant or confirmation of which he afterwards obtained from the court. He had built a ſmall fort, and had four cannon mounted there.

There were alſo ſeveral families at Mattapan, ſince called Dorcheſter, or rather Dorcheſter neck;
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028963_0088_0FDDBDDFDD174018"/>here Mr. Ludlow and Mr. Roſſiter pitched, with two miniſters, Mr. Warham and Mr. Maverick. On the north of Charles river (Charleſtown) were the remains of thoſe who had moved the laſt year from Salem; here Mr. Nowel and ſome of his friends made their pitch, but conſidered themſelves and Boſton at firſt, as but one ſettlement and one church, with Mr. Wilſon for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Mr. Pynchon was at the head of another company who ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled between Dorcheſter and Boſton. Their town took the name of Roxbury. They had Mr. Elliot for their miniſter. Medford and Miſtic were then diſtinct places, though not ſo at preſent. At Medford, which I take to have been a ſmall village at the lower part of Miſtick river, now called Neck of Land, where a creek alſo ran into Charles river, it was intended a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be made for Mr. Cradock and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he was ſending and had ſent over. Here, by his agents, he built ſeveral veſſels of burden. At theſe ſeveral places, together with Salem, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were ſettled for the firſt winter. They had little time enough to provide their huts. As ſoon as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember came their out door work was over. On the 6th of December, the governour and aſſiſtants met, and agreed to fortify the neck between Boſton and Roxbury, and orders were given for preparing the materials; but at another metting, on the 21ſt, they laid that deſign aſide, and agreed on a place, firſt called Newtown, ſince Cambridge, about three miles above Charleſtown, and moſt of them engaged to build houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es there the next year.

From that time, to the 10th of February, their chief care was to keep themſelves warm, and as comfortable in other reſpects as their ſcant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions would permit. The poorer ſort were much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, lying in tents and miſerable hovels, and many died of the ſcurvy and other diſtempers. They were ſo ſhort of proviſions, that many were obliged to live upon clams, muſſels and other ſhell fiſh, with ground nuts and acorns inſtead of bread. One, that came to the governour's houſe to complain of his ſufferings, was prevented, being informed that even there, the laſt batch was in the oven. Some inſtances were mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of great calmneſs and reſignation in this diſtreſs. A good man, who had aſked his neighbour to a diſh of clams, after dinner returned thanks to God who had given them to ſuck of the abundance of the ſeas and of treaſures hid in the ſands. They had appointed the 22d of February for a faſt, but on the 5th, to their great joy, the ſhip Lyon, capt. Pierce, one of the laſt year's fleet, returned, laden with proviſions from England, which were diſtributed according to the neceſſities of the people. They turned their faſt into a thankſgiving.</p>
                        <p>In the ſpring of 1631, they purſued their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of a fortified town at Newtown.
<note place="margin">1631.</note> The governour ſet up the frame of a houſe; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty governour finiſhed his houſe and removed his family. About this time, Chicketawbut, the chief of the Indians near Boſton, came to viſit the governour, and made high profeſſions of friendſhip. The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of danger leſſened by degrees, the deſign of a fortified town went off in the ſame proportion, until it was wholly laid aſide. The governour took down his frame and carried it to Boſton. Mr. Dudley, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, was offended, and perſiſted for ſome time in his firſt determination of reſiding at Newtown, but at length removed to Roxbury.</p>

The firſt court of aſſiſtants was held at Charleſtown, Auguſt 23, about two months after their arrival. The firſt general court, was held the 19th of October 1630, "not by a repreſentative, but by every one, that was free of the corporation in perſon." None had been admitted freemen ſince they left England. The gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernour and aſſiſtants having great influence over the court, it was ordered, that, for the future, the freemen ſhould chuſe the aſſiſtants, and the aſſiſtants from among themſelves, chuſe the governour and deputy governour. The court of aſſiſtants were to have the power of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laws and appointing officers. This was a departure from their charter. One hundred and nine freemen were admitted at this court. Maverick, Blackſtone, and many more, who were not of any of the churches, were of this number.</p>
                        <p>The next general court was the court of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for 1631.
<note place="margin">1631.</note> The ſcale was now turned, and the freemen reſolved to chuſe both governour, deputy governour and aſſiſtants, notwithſtanding the former vote, and made an order, that for the time to come, none ſhould be admitted to the freedom of the body politic but ſuch as were church members.</p>
                        <p>This law continued in force until the diſſolution of the government; it being repeated, in appearance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after the reſtoration of Charles II. Had they been deprived of their civil privileges in England by an act of parliament, unleſs they would join in communion with the churches there, it might very well have been the firſt in the roll of grievances. But ſuch were the requiſites to qualify for church memberſhip here, that the grievances were abundantly greater.

"This year, a ſmall glean of rye was brought to the court, as the firſt fruits of Engliſh grain, at which, this poor people greatly rejoiced to ſee the land would bear it."

<note place="margin">1634.</note> the number of freemen being greatly multiplied, an alteration of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution ſeems to have been agreed upon or fallen into by the general conſent of the towns; for at a general court for elections, this year, twenty four of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal inhabitants appeared as the repreſentatives of the body of freemen. This was a variation from the charter, which gave no power to admit repreſentatives. Theſe, with the governour, deputy governour, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants, formed the legiſlature of the colony, met and voted together in one apartment till March 1644, when it was ordained, that the governour and aſſiſtants ſhould ſet apart: and thus commenced the houſe of repreſentatives, as a diſtinct body.

                        </gap>hat balance of power which the ſovereigns of Europe have for a long time endeavoured to preſerve. They were, therefore, in general, diſpoſed to favour any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion which promiſed to diminiſh her overgrown treatneſs. It could be no wonder that France and Spain, eſpecially, ſhould have embraced the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, that offered, to humble a nation, which, with the aſſiſtance of her colonies, had laid their pride in the duſt.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſaid that theſe powers employed emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, immediately after the peace, to ſow the ſeeds of diſunion between Great Britain and her colonies; but this is a fact barely probable, and remains unſupported, as yet, by any document which the purity of hiſtorical
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:028963_0128_0FDDBE34947E8948"/>truth will admit. However, it is not at all improbable that the French may have employed ſome perſons to gain information of the diſpoſitions of the Americans towards Great Britain: and it is as likely that they found out nothing to gratify their wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>Baron de Kalb, who had been long an officer in the French ſervice, and who was afterwards killed in the ſervice of the United States, travelled through the Britiſh provinces, about the time of the Stampact, and is ſaid to have reported to his ſuperiors on his return, "That the coloniſts were ſo firmly and univerſally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to Great Britain, that nothing could ſhake their loyalty."</p>
                     <p>The hoſtile policy which led the colonies to examine ſerupulouſly the nature of their dependence on Great Britain followed, but did not precede, her attempts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rights and liberties of America. Nor is there any juſt reaſon to believe, that the French could, by any artifice or addreſs, have diſſolved the union of the Britiſh empire, at the cloſe of a war in which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and feelings of the colonies and the parent ſtate had been interwoven with more than uſual ſtrength and energy; and that too in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time, as elapſed from the peace in 1763, to the promulgation of the firſt obnoxious acts of the Britiſh parliament in 1764.</p>
                     <p>When the manners and habits of the Americans are conſidered—the equality of rank which ſubſiſted among them—their independent principles—their jealous and watchful care of their conſtitutional rights—the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of their own ſtrength, which they had acquired in the war with France—the removal of hoſtile neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours—their knowledge of the ſtrong factions in the parent ſtate—What might not have been expected from ſuch a people, in ſuch a country, and in ſuch a ſituation, when their liberties were attacked?—Could

                        </gap> forwarded its birth ſomewhat ſooner than it would have happened in the common courſe of nature.</p>
                     <p>It was a love of liberty and a quick ſenſe of injury which led the Americans to riſe in arms againſt the another country; at a time when there were very few who thought it their intereſt, or had any idea, to ſhake of their allegiance to Britain, until the inefficacy of victions and remonſtrances, and the progreſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, rendered the declaration of Independence to be a meaſure abſolutely neceſſary for their own ſafety. This view of the ſubject is not only natural and juſt, but it entirely correſponds with the American character, and with the conduct which was diſplayed through all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ciffitudes that attended the revolt.</p>
                     <p>From the firſt ſettlement of North America, till the cloſe of the war of 1755, Britain followed the wiſe line of conduct marked out by the charters granted to the colonies, and governed them with mutual benefit to both countries. The colonies were rather conſidered as inſtruments of commerce, than as objects of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They were allowed their own judgment in the management of their own intereſt. Till the year 1764, the deviations from this happy ſyſtem, and the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances complained of, were few; and their preſſure was neither great nor univerſal. The acts of the Britiſh parliament, tending to prohibit ſeveral colonial manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and lay reſtrictions on their trade, although they bore hard upon the ſpirits of a riſing people; yet
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:028963_0129_0FDDBE3614812928"/>the articles, the manufacture of which were thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, could be purchaſed at a cheaper rate in Britain; and the advantages accruing to the colonies from their connexion with the mother country infinitely overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anced the evil.</p>
                     <p>At length the Britiſh parliament reſolved to alter the ſyſtem of colonial government, by raiſing a revenue in America, by taxation. Mr. Iſrael Maudit, the Maſſachuſetts' agent,
<note place="margin">1763.</note> gave the earlieſt notice of theſe proceedings; but, the general court of that colony not being called together till the latter end of the year, inſtructions to the agent, though ſolicited by him, could not be ſent in ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>The next year, however, the houſe of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives came to the following reſolutions: "That the ſole right of giving and granting the money of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that province, was veſted in them, as their legal repreſentatives; and that the impoſition of duties and taxes, by the parliament of Great Britain, upon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are not repreſented in the houſe of commons, is abſolutely irreconcilable with their rights." "That no man can juſtly take the property of another without his conſent; upon which original principle, the right of repreſentation in the ſame body which exerciſes the power of making laws for levying taxes, one of the main pillars of the <hi>Britiſh conſtitution,</hi> is evidently founded."</p>
                     <p>Theſe reſolutions were occaſioned by intelligence of what had been done in the Britiſh houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. It had been there debated, whether they had a <hi>right</hi> to tax the Americans, they not being repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and determined unanimouſly in the affirmative. Not a ſingle perſon preſent, ventured to controvert the right.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, in March, 1764, a bill was paſſed, by which heavy duties were laid on goods imported by
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:028963_0129_0FDDBE3614812928"/>the coloniſts from ſuch Weſt India iſlands as did not belong to great Britains; at the ſame time that theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were to be paid into the exchequer in ſpecie; and in the ſame ſeſſion another bill was framed to reſtrain the currency of paper money in the colonies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

                     <p>Vehement remonſtrances were made to the miniſtry, and every argument made uſe of that reaſon or ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity could ſuggeſt, but to no purpoſe. Their reaſoning,
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:028963_0130_0FDDBE3C32064E10"/>however, convinced a great number of people in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and thus the American cauſe came to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the cauſe of liberty.</p>
                     <p>The Americans, finding all argumentation vain, at laſt united in an agreement to import no more of the manufactures of Great Britain, but to encourage to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> therefore proceeded to the laſt ſtep of their inteaded plan, which was to lay on ſtamp duties throughout the continent. Previous to this, indeed, ſeveral regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were paſſed in favour of the commerce of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies; but they had now imbibed ſuch unfavourable ſentiments of the Britiſh miniſtry, that they paid very little regard to any thing pretended to be done in their favour; or if theſe acts made any favourable impreſſions, it was quickly obliterated by the news of the Stamp act. The reaſon given for this act, ſo exceedingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, was, that a ſum might be raiſed ſufficient for the defence of the colonies againſt a foreign enemy; but this pretence was ſo far from giving any ſatisfaction to the Americans, that it excited their indignation to the utmoſt degree. They not only aſſerted that they were abandantly able to defend themſelves againſt my foreign enemy, but denied that the Britiſh parliament had any right to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The colonies denied the parliamentary right of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation many months before any member of the Britiſh parliament uttered a ſingle ſyllable to that purpoſe: and the American oppoſition to the Stamp act was fully formed, before it was known by the coloniſts that their cauſe was eſpouſed by any man of note at home, as Britain was ſtyled.</p>

                     <p>The intended ſtamp act, was communicated to the American agents. Many of them did not oppoſe it. Half their number were placement, or dependent on the miniſtry. Mr. Joſeph Sherwood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Mr. Mauduit, the Maſſachuſetts agent, favoured the raiſing of the wanted money by a ſtamp duty, as it would occaſion leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of officers, and would include the Weſt India iſlands. But the ſcheme was poſtponed, and the agents authorized to inform the American aſſemblies, that they were at liberty to ſuggeſt any other way of raiſing monies; and that Mr. Grenville was ready to receive propoſals for any other tax, that might be equivalent in its produce to the ſtamp tax. The colonies ſeemed to conſider it as an affront, rather than a compliment. He would not have been content with any thing ſhort of a certain ſpeciſic ſum, and proper funds for the

No ſatisfactory propoſals being made, he adhered to his purpoſe of bringing forward the ſtamp bill, though repeatedly preſſed by ſome of his friends to deſiſt, what he might have done it with honour.

At this interview Mr. Jackſon opened his mind freely on the ſubject; and Mr. Franklin, as muſt be ſuppoſed, mentioned that he had it in inſtruction from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Pennſylvania, to aſſure the miniſtry, that they ſhould always think it their duty to grant ſuch aids to the crown, as were ſuitable to their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, whenever called for in the uſual conſtitutional manner. Mr. Grenville however, pertinaciouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to his own opinions; and ſaid, that he had pledged his word for offering the ſtamp bill to the houſe, and that the houſe would hear their objections.</p>
                     <p>The bill was brought in; and on the firſt reading, Mr. Charles Townſend ſpoke in its favour.

                     <p>The aſſemblies of Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia, were prevented, by their governours, from finding a deputation to this congreſs. Twenty eight deputies from Maſſachuſetts, Rhode Iſland, Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, New York, New Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South Carolina, met at New York, and after mature deliberation agreed on a declaration of
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:028963_0135_0FDDBE414F178E50"/>their rights, and on a ſtatement of their grievances. They aſſerted in ſtrong terms, their exemption from all taxes, not impoſed by their own repreſentatives. They alſo concurred in a petition to the king, and memorial to the houſe of lords, and a petition to the houſe of commons. The colonies that were prevented from ſending their repreſentatives to this congreſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded petitions, ſimilar to thoſe which were adopted by the deputies which attended.</p>
                     <p>Some ſpeakers of great weight, in both houſes of parliament, denied their right of taxing the colonies. The chief ſupporters of this opinion were lord Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the houſe of peers, and Mr. Pitt in the houſe of commons. The former in nervous language ſaid, "Bly poſition is this, I repeat it, I will maintain it to my laſt hour. Taxation and repreſentation are inſeparable. This poſition is founded on the laws of nature. It is more, it is itſelf an eternal law of nature. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is a man's own, is abſolutely his own. No man has a right to take it from him without his conſent. Whoever attempts to do it attempts an injury, whoev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er does it commits a robbery." Mr. Pitt, with great boldneſs of expreſſion, juſtified the coloniſts, in oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtamp act. "You have no right," ſaid he, "to tax America. I rejoice that America has reſiſted. Three millions of our fellow ſubjects ſo loſt to every ſenſe of virtue, as tamely to give up their liberties, would be fit inſtruments to make ſlaves of the reſt." He afterwards ſhewed the unreaſonableneſs of Great Britain taxing America, thus—"When I had the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of ſerving his majeſty, I availed myſelf of the means of information, which I derived from my office. I ſpeak therefore from knowledge. My materials were good. I was at pains to collect, to digeſt, to conſider them; and I will be bold to affirm, that the profit to Great Britain from the trade of the colonies, through

                     <p>Dr. Benjamin Franklin was examined at the bar of the houſe of commons, upon this occaſion; and his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tended much to remove prejudices, and promoted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>After much debating, and two proteſts in the houſe of lords, and paſſing an act "For ſecuring the depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of America on Great Britain," the repeal of the ſtamp act was finally carried: and on the 19th of March, 1766, the king went to the houſe of peers and paſſed the bill, to the univerſal joy of the Americans, and indeed to the great ſatisfaction of the Britiſh, whoſe manufactures began to ſuffer very ſeriouſly, in conſequence of the American aſſociation againſt them.</p>

The oppoſers of the repeal had contended for the declaratory bill, as eſſentially neceſſary.

                     <p>The governour now took the laſt ſtep in his power to put a ſtop to the violent proceedings of the aſſembly, by diſſolving it entirely; but this was of little moment.

Whilſt the diſpoſition of the Boſtonians was thus go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on from bad to worſe, news arrived that the agent for the colony had not been allowed to deliver their petition to the king; it having been objected, that the aſſembly, without the governour, was not ſufficient a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>A dreadful alarm now took place. The people called on the governour to convene a general aſſembly, in order in remove their fears of the military; who, they ſaid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It was alſo proved that only ſeven muſkets were fired by the eight priſoners. The captain and ſix of the men were acquitted, and two were found guilty of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter. "The reſult of the trial reflected great honour on John Adams and Joſiah Quincey, the counſel for the priſoners; and alſo on the integrity of the jury, who ventured to give an upright verdict, in defiance of popular opinions."

                     <p>The new aſſembly proceeded in the moſt formal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to diſavow the ſupremacy of the Britiſh legiſlature; and accuſed the parliament of Britain of having violated the natural rights of the Americans in a number of laſtances.

                     <p>The rigorous execution of the ſmuggling laws, gave occaſion to the firſt daring act of violence, which might, with propriety, be called an act of hoſtility againſt government. This happened at Providence in Rhode Iſland, where, on the 10th of June 1772, the Gaſpee

A reward of £.500 was offered for the diſcovery of thoſe concerned; but ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable was it to the univerſal voice of the people, that not one man was found to accept the offered reward.</p>
                     <p>The diſturbances were greatly heightened in Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts by an accidental diſcovery that Mr. Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, governour of Maſſachuſetts Bay, had written ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral confidential letters to people in power in England, complaining of the behaviour of the province, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending vigorous meaſures againſt them, and, among other things, aſſerting, that "there muſt be an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what is called Britiſh liberty." Letters of this kind had fallen into the hands of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the agent for the colony at London. They were immediately tranſmitted to Boſton, where the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was ſitting, by whom they were ſaid before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the juſt grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which led the Americans to oppoſe with vigour, the arbitrary deſigns of the Britiſh miniſtry, it would be difficult to account ſatisfactorily for their regular and ſteady oppoſition, from the beginning of the diſputes, and even after hoſtilities commeneed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking a view of the diſſenſions which agitated Britain during the ſame period.</p>
                     <p>The feuds and animoſities which the Middleſex elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excited, gave occaſion to ſudden changes of the miniſtry, and reſolutions of parliament dangerous to the liberties of the people; which, probably, would never elſe have taken place. As this election is the great hinge upon which the political events of the reign of George III. for many years turned, every material circumſtance relating to that ſingular tranſaction, and even to Mr. Wilkes, the principal agent concerned in it, ſhall be particularly attended to, conſiſtently with the limits of this work.</p>
                     <p>Till the reſignation of Mr. Pitt, (October 9, 1761) no material change had been made in the miniſtry dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:028963_0141_0FDDBE4F98D30AA0"/>the firſt year of the reign of George III. It continued nearly the ſame as it was at the death of the late king; with only this difference, that lord Bute, who was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a particular favourite of the preſent king, had been introduced into the cabinet, and appointed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of ſtate in the room of the earl of Holder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A more important alteration took place in 1762. An opinion had been long entertained, at leaſt it was induſtriouſly propagated by certain perſons, that the Pelham family had been as complete maſters of the cabinet during the latter years of the laſt reign, as ever the Marlborough family was, during a great part of that of queen Anne. A reſolution, it is ſaid, was therefore taken to get rid of the Pelhams and all their connections. The duke of Newcaſtle was made ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy in his ſituation, that he reſigned his poſt of firſt lord of the treaſury, and was ſucceeded by the earl of Bute. This gave occaſion to a moſt furious paper war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the friends and adherents of theſe two noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and naturally tended to revive in the kingdom, that ſpirit of party, which, during the ſucceſsful admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration of Mr. Pitt, had, in a great meaſure, been laid aſleep. Dr. Goldſmith obſerves, that the earl of Bute was believed to be a man of ability and even of virtue, but deficient in that eaſineſs of addreſs and thoſe engaging manners, without which no miniſter can ever expect to be long popular in England. As he was a man of taſte and learning, had he continued groom of the ſtate, as he was at the time of the king's acceſſion, he might have eaſily paſſed for the Macenas of the age. Every favour which the king might have beſtowed upon men of letters, would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as originating from his advice; whereas, by plunging into politics, for which, as he was not bred to them, perhaps he was but ill qualified, he at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the peace of his own mind, diminiſhed for a
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:028963_0141_0FDDBE4F98D30AA0"/>while the popularity of his ſovereign, and diſtracted and perplexed the councils of his country.</p>
                     <p>The cry of favouritiſm, which was raiſed againſt lord Bute, immediately upon his introduction into the miniſtry, had hitherto been kept up with the utmoſt virulence and animoſity. Having completed the peace in 1763, he reſigned his place, as firſt lord of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, in April, in the ſame year, and was ſucceeded by Mr. George Grenville.</p>
                     <p>The ſpirit of venality and corruption was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prevalent at this time in Britain. Licentiouſneſs and riot were become general among the lower ranks; and tumults, and a ſpirit of diſorder, affected moſt parts of the kingdom.</p>
                     <p>During the earl of Bute's adminiſtration, the Engliſh populace reſigned all their thinking faculties, and even their ſenſes, to the indefatigable incendiaries of a bold and inſolent faction, who were overawed by no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and reſtrained by no principle; till at length the animoſity to the Scotch in general, and the averſion to the miniſter in particular, proceeded to an amazing degree of infatuation.</p>
                     <p>The jealouſy of the Engliſh nation, towards their fellow ſubjects on the other ſide of the Tweed, had diſcovered itſelf occaſionally ever ſince the union of the crowns; and the ancient animoſities had been kept alive by the two ſucceſſive rebellions which began in Scotland; but the common grudge was founded upon the ſucceſs of the Scotch, who had eſtabliſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in different parts of England, and riſen from very ſmall beginnings, to wealth and conſideration. In a word, the Engliſh looked upon them with an evil eye, as interlopers in commerce and competitors for reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was not without murmuring that they had ſeen them aſpire to the firſt offices in the law, the army, and the navy; but they were exaſperated to find a Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:028963_0142_0FDDBE5738626320"/>at the head of the Engliſh treaſury, and the chief ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the kingdom in his hands. Theſe were topics on which the writers in the oppoſition did not fail to expatiate. They revived and retailed with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar virulence, all the calumnies, ancient and modern, that ever had been uttered againſt the Scotch nation, ſome of them ſo groſs and abſurd, that they could not poſſibly obtain credit but among the very dregs of the people. They enlarged upon their craft, diſſimulation, deceit, and national partiality. They denounced the dangers that threatened the intereſts of Old England, from the great numbers of thoſe northern adventurers, who had wriggled themſelves into all the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of civil and military inſtitution; and they inſiſted upon the diſgrace of acquieſcing under the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of a North Briton, a Stuart, allied by blood to the pretender, who had expelled from court the beſt friends of the proteſtant ſucceſſion, aſſociated himſelf with avowed tories, who proſtituted the offices, and ſquandered away the wealth of England on worthleſs favourites of his own country. Theſe bitter remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, in which no regard was paid either to truth or decency, they reinforced with feigned circumſtances, and forged liſts of North Britons gratified with pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, appointed to places, or promoted in the ſervice, till at length the populace were incenſed even to the verge of inſurrection. Had the natives of North Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proved equally combuſtible, the flames of civil war would have certainly been kindled; and, in that caſe, the ruin of a mighty nation might have been effected by two or three infamous emiſſaries, equally deſperate and obſcure, who either proſtituted their pens to a party for hire, or exerciſed their talents for abuſe, in hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bought off by the miniſter.</p>
                     <p>All the moſt virulent papers againſt government, in former days, ſeemed to be but decent compoſitions
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:028963_0142_0FDDBE5738626320"/>compared to thoſe which were circulated through the nation, after the reſignation of Mr. Pitt. Had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgators of the firſt defamatory libels that appeared againſt the king and his family been apprehended, and puniſhed in the ordinary courſe of law proceedings, the ſection would have found it a very difficult taſk, in the ſequel, to engage either printer or publiſher in their ſervice; and, in all probability, the evil would have been cruſhed in the bud; but they were emboldened by impunity to proceed in their career, to confirm their calumnies by unrefuted falſehoods, and to give rein to the moſt audacious ſcurrility; until the minds of the people were ſo deeply and univerſally tainted, that it became hazardous to call the libeliers to account, and very doubtful whether a jury could be found in the capital, that would ſurrender thoſe new idols to the caſtigation of the law.</p>
                     <p>The new miniſtry ſhowed the ſame contempt and diſregard of all the abuſe offered to their perſons, in the papers and pamphlets publiſhed againſt them, as their predeceſſors in office had done,
<note place="margin">1763.</note> although their names were printed at full length in many audacious libels; eſpecially in a periodical paper called the North Briton. Mr. John Wilkes, member of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for Ayleſbury, was at very little pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal that he was the author of this paper, which in point of wit, language or argument, could never have attracted the attention of the public, had not the minds of the people, by the arts of faction, been inflamed to a degree of madneſs. Wilkes was lively, but ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial; and, in his morals, he was ſaid to be diſſipated even to profligacy. He had more than once applied to the new miniſters for a poſt that might repair his ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered fortunes; but prepoſſeſſions, ariſing from his character, were ſo ſtrong againſt him, that failing of ſucceſs, he reſolved, as he openly declared, to try how far it was practicable to carry the licentiouſneſs of
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:028963_0143_0FDDBE58B43D2758"/>writing, under pretext of exerciſing the liberty of the preſs. Perceiving the next to ſtoical indifference of the miniſtry with regard to their own perſons, he aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his abuſe at the king himſelf, and in the forty fifth number of his paper, animadverted upon the king's ſpeech in parliament, with an acrimony ſo indecent towards his majeſty's probity as well as perſon, that the miniſters, at length, gave orders for ſeizing the printer, and all concerned in the publication. Theſe orders were contained in a warrant of a general nature, under the hand of lord Halifax, directed to four of his majeſty's meſſengers, commanding them to apprehend, without ſpecifying their names, the authors, printers, and publiſhers of that ſeditious and treaſonable paper; and the publiſher, George Kearſley, being accordingly apprehended, his examination afforded ſufficient ground for fixing upon Mr. Wilkes as the author. This war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, though afterwards pronounced to be illegal by a lord chief juſtice, was, in point of form and ſubſtance, the ſame that had always been iſſued by former ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſtate, and even by Mr. Pitt and the duke of Newcaſtle, whoſe party now openly contended, that it was ſubverſive of the Britiſh conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wilkes was thereupon committed priſoner to the tower,
<note place="margin">1763. <hi>April</hi> 30.</note> and his papers being ſealed up in preſence of the under ſecretary of ſtate and the ſolicitor of the treaſury, were ſeized.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wilkes, upon bringing his <hi>habeas corpus</hi> before the court of common pleas, was releaſed from the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by a deciſion of that court, the judges of which unanimouſly declared that privilege of parliament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the caſe of writing a libel.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the perſonal veracity of Mr. Wilkes received a ſevere ſhock, by his being called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the public papers, to make good an aſſertion he

The houſe, however, was of opinion, that under no former oppoſition ſuch abuſive terms, or ſo perſonally diſreſpectful to majeſty, had ever been made uſe of; and therefore it was reſolved by a great major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, "That the paper, intitled the North Briton, No. 45, is a falſe, ſcandalous, and ſeditious libel, containing expreſſions of the moſt unexampled inſolence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely towards his majeſty, the groſſeſt aſperſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both houſes of parliament, and the moſt audacious defiance of the authority of the whole legiſlature; and moſt manifeſtly tending to alienate the affections of the people from his majeſty, to withdraw them from their obedience to the laws of the realm, and to excite them to traitorous inſurrections." The houſe likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that the privilege of parliament did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the caſe of writing ſuch a libel. A number of members ſpoke and voted againſt the latter reſolution, only becauſe they thought it was a matter founded in
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:028963_0144_0FDDBE5A2796E728"/>the conſtitution, independent of all party conſideration. Soon after Mr. Wilkes fought a duel with Mr. Martin, a member of parliament, and late ſecretary to the treaſury, whoſe character he had attacked in his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the moſt barefaced manner. In this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both parties behaved like men of courage; but Mr. Wilkes was wounded in the body ſo dangerouſly, that he was in no condition to appear in the houſe of commons when the matter of his complaint of breach of privilege was to be heard.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt this matter was depending, the ſheriffs of London, the hon. Mr. Harley and Richard Blunt,
<note place="margin">1763. <hi>Nov.</hi> 19.</note> eſq. endeavoured to execute the order of the two houſes of parliament, by burning the 45th number of the North Briton, by the hands of the common hangman, at the Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; but the mob proved ſo riotous on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that they reſcued the paper from the executioner before it was conſumed, pelted the conſtables and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er peace officers, and even put Mr. ſheriff Harley in danger of his life.</p>
                     <p>The walls of parliament as yet contained the debates on the whole affair, which was of far greater import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than the public at firſt apprehended. The reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of neither houſe could determine the great points depending on it, for thoſe were cognizable only in a court of law. In the July preceding, the journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men printers, who had been ſeized and confined on ſuſpicion of printing the North Briton, brought actions againſt the meſſengers on that account. On the firſt action that was tried, the plaintiff recovered 300<abbr>l.</abbr> dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and 200<abbr>l.</abbr> was allowed to each of the others, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> been moſt ſcurrilouſly introduced, as being the author of the notes. The book itſelf, though printed with the utmoſt ſecreſy, had been communicated, through Mr. Wilkes's own inadvertency, to the ſecretary, by a journeyman printer, who was poſſeſſed of a copy, and the very mention of its contents ſtruck the public with horrour. The concern which the pretended patriot had in printing and correcting the preſs, was proved beyond all contradiction; and left upon the minds of the public a ſtrong conviction of his being the author alſo. Scarcely any defence was made for him by his friends, and the houſe addreſſed his majeſty to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that he ſhould be proſecuted; but neither this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, nor the proſecutions intended to be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for breach of privilege, had any other effect, than that of greatly increaſing the number of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the rational unprejudiced part of the nation. However, many ſtill remained his political friends, who deteſted his profligate principles. General warrants were afterwards declared to be illegal by a reſolution of both houſes; and this, indeed, ſeems to be the chief advantage reſulting from this violent diſpute between Mr. Wilkes and the miniſtry.</p>

As he was eſteemed by many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as a kind of martyr in the cauſe of public liberty, a ſubſcription was opened by ſome merchants of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:028963_0146_0FDDBE5D90FF2688"/>and other gentlemen of property, for paying his fine, ſupporting him whilſt in priſon, and compounding his debts, amounting to above twenty thouſand pounds; and all theſe purpoſes were, in the end, completely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
                     <p>When the new parliament met, the people imagined that Mr. Wilkes would take his ſeat along with the other members. In expectation of this, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them aſſembled in St. George's Fields,

The furry juſtices ſoon came among them, and the riot act was read; but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not diſperſing, the military were called in, and were ordered, perhaps unadviſedly, to fire. Several perſons were ſlightly wounded, two or three mortally, and one was killed on the ſpot.</p>
                     <p>Lord Weymouth, one of the ſecretaries of ſtate, ſent a letter to the juſtices, thanking them for their ſpirited conduct in this affair. Mr. Wilkes, who was no incurious, nor, we may believe, unconcerned ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of the whole ſcene, took this opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his reſentment againſt the miniſtry, whom he regarded as the authors of all the perſecutions he had ſuffered. He publiſhed lord Weymouth's letter, with a few remarks of his own prefixed to it, in which the termed the affair of St. George's Fields a horrid maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre; and this ſtep was either conſidered as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>This vote of the houſe of commons was conſidered as a fatal blow to the liberties of the people; at leaſt to the right of election, the moſt vital and eſſential part of thoſe liberties. This poured poiſon into the political wound, that rendered it perfectly incurable. The Middleſex election may hitherto be regarded mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a common controverted election, in which none but Mr. Wilkes and his opponents were concerned. From this time forward it aſſumed a more dignified air, a more important aſpect. Inſtead of a private, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a national concern. A great part of the people took the alarm. They thought they foreſaw, in the deſtruction of the rights of the freeholders of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, the utter ruin and ſubverſion of their own. The conſequence was, that petitions firſt, and remonſtranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es afterwards poured in from the different counties and corporations in the kingdom. Many of theſe were of a very bold, and, as ſome thought, of a moſt daring nature. They not only prayed for a diſſolution of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but they even denied the legality of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent one, the validity of its acts, and the obligation of the people to obey them. In a word, they affected that the government was actually diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>The miniſtry had now brought themſelves into a muſt diſagreeable dilemma. They ought either not to have proceeded ſo far,
<note place="margin">1770.</note> or they ought to have gone farther. They ought either not to have furniſhed the people with a juſt cauſe, nor even with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>lauſible pretence, for preſenting ſuch remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, or they ought to have puniſhed them for dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:028963_0147_0FDD5F31BA5D0658"/>to preſent them. This, however, they did not think it prudent, nor perhaps even ſafe, to attempt.</p>
                     <p>Some of the freeholders of Middleſex even attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry their ſpeculative principles into practice. They refuſed to pay the land tax; and the matter was brought to a trial. But the jury determined, that they were obliged to pay it; and, in ſo doing, they diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more firmneſs and fortitude than their rulers. This, however, was but a poor compenſation for the want of courage and conſiſtency in the miniſters. It was like endeavouring to ſupport a mighty arch with a feeble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ttreſs, when the key ſtone, that held it together, was removed.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of this year a very important act was paſſed for regulating the proceedings of the houſe of commons in controverted elections.

                        </gap> ſame time affraid to encounter oppoſition effectively, they conceded enough to weaken their authority, and yet not enough to ſatisfy the coloniſts. And theſe cauſes had operated with redoubled force, upon every renewal of the diſpute.</p>
                     <p>The declaratory act, and the reſervation of the duty upon tea, left the cauſe of contention in full force, but the former was only a claim on paper, and the latter
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:028963_0150_0FDDBE67B27FC7B8"/>might be evaded by refuſing to purchaſe any tea, on which the parliamentary tax was impoſed. The coloniſts, therefore, conceiving that their commerce might be renewed, without eſtabliſhing any precedent, injurious to their liberties, relaxed in their aſſociations, in every particular, except tea, and immediately recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced the importation of all other articles of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize. Britain might now have cloſed the diſpute forever, and honourably receded, without a formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhment of her claims. Many hoped that the contention between the two countries was finally cloſed. In all the provinces excepting Maſſachuſetts, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ſeemed to favour that opinion; but in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, the unhappy quarrel which has been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, between the people and the military force there ſtationed, proved a fruitful ſource of complaint. The continuance of a board of commiſſioners in Boſton, the conſtituting the governours and judges of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince independent of the people, were likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cauſes of irritation.</p>
                     <p>The only reaſon aſſigned by the Britiſh miniſter for retaining the tea duty, was to ſupport the authority of parliament; at the ſame time, he acknowledged it to be as anticommercial a tax, as any of thoſe that had been repealed upon that principle. The Eaſt India company, feeling the bad effects of the colonial ſmuggling trade, by the large quantity of tea which remained in their ware houſes unfold, requeſted the repeal of the three pence per pound in America, and offered, that on its being complied with, government ſhould retain ſix pence in the pound on the exportation. Thus the company preſented the happieſt opportunity that could have been offered for honourably removing the cauſe of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with America. This afforded an opening for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice without infringing the claims on either ſide. The miniſter was requeſted and intreated, by a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:028963_0150_0FDDBE67B27FC7B8"/>of great weight in the company, and a member of parliament, to embrace the opportunity; but it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately rejected.</p>
                     <p>New contrivances were ſet on foot, to introduce the tea attended with the three penny duty, into all the colonies. Various intrigues and ſolicitations were uſed to induce the Eaſt India company to undertake this raſh and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh buſineſs. It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> proteſted againſt, as contrary to the principle of the company's monopoly; but the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the miniſtry prevailed, and the inſignificant duty of three pence per pound on tea, was doomed to be the fatal bane of contention between Great Britain and her colonies.</p>
                     <p>The Americans perceiving that the tax was thus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be enforced, whether they would or not, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take every poſſible method to prevent the tea from being landed, as well knowing that it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to hinder the ſale, ſhould the commodity once be brought on ſhore. For this purpoſe, the people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in great numbers, forcing thoſe to whom the tea was conſigned to reſign their offices, and to promiſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly never to reſume them; and committees were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to examine the accounts of merchants, and make public teſts, declaring ſuch as would not take them, enemies to their country. And this was no empty menace, but pregnant with certain ruin to their property, and the groſſeſt indignity to their perſons. Nor was this behaviour confined to the colony of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts Bay; the reſt of the provinces entered into the conteſt with the ſame warmth, and manifeſted the ſame reſolution to oppoſe this invaſion of their rights.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of this confuſion, three ſhips laden with tea, arrived in Boſton; but ſo much were the captains alarmed at the diſpoſition which ſeemed to prevail among the people, that they offered, providing they could obtain the proper diſcharges from the tea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignees,

The ſhips, therefore, would have been obliged to remain in the harbour; but the people, apprehenſive that if they remained there, the tea would be landed in ſmall quantities and diſpoſed of in ſpite of every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent it, reſolved to deſtroy it at once.

No tea was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in other places, though the ſame ſpirit was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where manifeſted. At Philadelphia, the pilots were enjoined not to conduct the veſſels up the river; and at New York, though the governour cauſed ſome tea to be landed, under the protection of a man of war, he was obliged to deliver it up to the cuſtody of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to prevent its being ſold.</p>
                     <p>The deſtruction of the tea at Boſton, was the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate prelude to the diſaſters attending civil diſcord.

                        </gap>cted, that, inſtead of having any tendency to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile or ſubdue the Americans, it would infallibly exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate them beyond any poſſibility of reconciliation. The petitions againſt it, preſented by the colony's agent, pointed out the ſame conſequence in the ſtrongeſt terms, and in the moſt poſitive manner declared that the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans never would ſubmit to it: but ſuch was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this confidence, a third bill was propoſed for the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice on ſuch perſons as might be employed in the ſuppreſſion of riots and tumults in the province of Maſſachuſetts Bay. By this act it was provided, that ſhould any perſons act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that capacity be indicted for murder, and not able to obtain a fair trial in the province, they might be ſent by the governour to England, or to ſome other colony, if neceſſary, to be tried for the ſuppoſed crime.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three bills having paſſed ſo eaſily, the miniſtry propoſed a fourth, relative to the government of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da; which, it was ſaid, had not yet been ſettled on any proper plan. By this bill the extent of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was greatly enlarged; its affairs were put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:028963_0152_0FDE10206DE724F8"/>the direction of a council, in which Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics were to be admitted; the Roman Catholic clergy were ſecured in their poſſeſſions, and the uſual perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites from thoſe of their own profeſſion. The council above mentioned were to be appointed by the crown; to be removable at its pleaſure; and to be inveſted with every legiſlative power, excepting that of taxation.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner were theſe laws made known in America, than they cemented the union of the colonies almoſt beyond any poſſibility of diſſolving it. The aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts Bay had paſſed a vote againſt the judges' accepting ſalaries from the crown, and put the queſtion, Whether they would accept them as uſual from the general aſſembly? Four anſwered in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative; but Peter Oliver, the chief juſtice, refuſed. A petition againſt him, and an accuſation, were brought before the governour; but the latter refuſed the accuſation, and declined to interfere in the matter; but as they ſtill inſiſted for juſtice, againſt Mr. Oliver, the governour thought proper to put an end to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by diſſolving the aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation of affairs, a new alarm was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the news of the port bill, which had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both houſes, on the 25th of March, and reached Boſton on the 15th of May. This had been totally unexpected, and was received with the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant expreſſions of diſpleaſure, among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and whilſt theſe continued, the new governour,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 19.</note> general Gage, arrived from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. He had been choſen to this office on account of his being well acquainted in America, and generally agreeable to the people; but human wiſdom could not now point out a method by which the flame could be allayed. The firſt act of his office as governour, was to remove the aſſembly to Salem, a town 17 miles diſtant, in conſequence of the late act.
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:028963_0152_0FDE10206DE724F8"/>When this was intimated to the aſſembly, they replied by requeſting him to appoint a day of public humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for deprecating the wrath of Heaven, but met with a refuſal. When met at Salem, they paſſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, declaring the neceſſity of a general congreſs, compoſed of delegates from all the provinces, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take the affairs of the colonies at large into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and five gentlemen, remarkable for their oppoſition to the Britiſh meaſures, were choſen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent that of Maſſachuſetts Bay. This was the baſis of the continental congreſs. They then proceeded with all expedition to draw up a declaration, containing a detail of the grievances they laboured under, and the neceſſity of exerting themſelves againſt lawleſs power; they ſet forth the diſregard ſhown to their petitions, and the attempts of Great Britain to deſtroy their ancient conſtitution; and concluded with exhorting the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of the colony to obſtruct, by every method in their power, ſuch evil deſigns, recommending at the ſame time, a total renunciation of every thing import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Great Britain, till a redreſs of grievances could be procured.</p>
                     <p>Intelligence of this declaration was carried to the governour, on the very day it was completed; on which he diſſolved the aſſembly. This was followed by an addreſs from the inhabitants of Salem in favour of thoſe of Boſton, and concluding with theſe remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words: "By ſhutting up the port of Boſton, ſome imagine that the courſe of trade might be turned hither, and to our benefit; but nature, in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our harbour, forbids our becoming rivals in commerce with that convenient mart; and were it otherwiſe, we muſt be dead to every idea of juſtice, loſt to all feelings of humanity, could we indulge one thought to ſeize on wealth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It had been fondly hoped by the miniſterial party, that the advantages which other towns of the colony might derive from the annihilation of the trade of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, would make them readily acquieſce in the meaſure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>utting up that port, and rather rejoice in it than otherwiſe; but the words of the addreſs above mentioned ſeemed to preclude all hope of this kind; and ſubſequent tranſactions ſoon manifeſted it to be totally vain. No ſooner did intelligence arrive of the remaining bills, paſſed in the ſeſſion of 1774, than the cauſe of Boſton became the cauſe of all the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies. The port bill had already occaſioned violent commotions throughout them all. It had been repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in provincial meetings, and reſiſtance even to the laſt had been recommended againſt ſuch oppreſſion. In Virginia, the firſt of June, the day on which the port of Boſton was to be ſhut up, was held a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ceſſion in favour of America was enjoined. The ſtyle of the prayer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined at this time was, that "God would give the people one heart and one mind, firmly to oppoſe every invaſion of the American rights." The Virginians, however, did not content themſelves with acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They recommended in the ſtrongeſt manner a general congreſs of all the colonies, as fully perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that an attempt to tax any colony in an arbitrary manner was in reality an attack upon them all, and muſt ultimately end in the ruin of them all.</p>
                     <p>The provinces of New York and Pennſylvania, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, were leſs ſanguine than the reſt, being ſo cloſely connected in the way of trade with Great Britain, that the giving it up entirely, appeared a matter of the moſt ſerious magnitude, and not to be thought of but after every other method had failed. The intelligence of the remaining bills reſpecting Boſton, however, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="307" facs="unknown:028963_0153_0FDE102308E7A1F0"/>thoſe who had ſeemed to be the moſt wavering. The propoſal of giving up all commerical intercourſe with Britain was again propoſed; contributions for the inhabitants of Boſton were raiſed in every quarter; and they every day received addreſſes commending them for the heroic courage with which they ſuſtained their calamity.</p>
                     <p>The Boſtonians on their part were not wanting in their endeavours to promote the general cauſe. An agreement was framed, which, in imitation of former times, they called a Solemn League and Covenant. By this the ſubſcribers moſt religiouſly bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to break off all communication with Britain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the expiration of the month of Auguſt enſuing, until the obnoxious acts were repealed; at the ſame time they engaged neither to purchaſe nor uſe any goods imported after that time, and to renounce all connexion with thoſe who did, or who refuſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to this covenant; threatening to publiſh the names of the refractory; which at this time was a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment by no means to be deſpiſed. Agreements of a ſimilar kind were almoſt inſtantaneouſly entered into throughout all America. General Gage indeed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to counteract the covenant by a proclamation, wherein it was declared an illegal and traiterous combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, threatening with the pains of law ſuch as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed or countenanced it. But matters were too far gone for his proclamations to have any effect. The Americans retorted the charge of illegality on his own proclamation, and inſiſted that the law allowed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to meet in order to conſider of their grievances, and aſſociate for relief from oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Preparations were now made for holding the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al congreſs ſo often propoſed. Philadelphia, as being the moſt central and conſiderable town, was pitched upon for the place of its meeting. The delegates, of
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:028963_0154_0FDE102469B36E28"/>whom it was to be compoſed, were choſen by the rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentatives of each province, and were in number from two to ſeven for each colony, though no province had more than one vote. The firſt congreſs which met at Philadelphia,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 5.</note> on the 5th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1774, conſiſted of 51 delegates; near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one half of whom were lawyers. Gentlemen of that profeſſion had acquired the confidence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants by their exertions in the common cauſe. The previous meaſures in the reſpective provinces had been planned and carried into effect, more by lawyers than by any other order of men. The novelty and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the meeting excited an univerſal attention; and their tranſactions were ſuch as could not tend but to render them reſpectable. They choſe Peyton Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph their preſident, and Charles Thomſon their ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. It was agreed, as one of the rules of their doing buſineſs, that no entry ſhould be made in their journals of any propoſitions diſcuſſed before them, to which they did not finally aſſent.</p>
                     <p>The firſt act of congreſs was an approbation of the conduct of Maſſachuſetts Bay, and an exhortation to continue in the ſame ſpirit with which they had begun. Supplies for the ſuffering inhabitants (whom the oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the port bill had reduced to great diſtreſs) were ſtrongly recommended; and it was declared, that in caſe of attempts to enforce the obnoxious acts by arms, all America ſhould join to aſſiſt the town of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; and, ſhould the inhabitants be obliged, during the courſe of hoſtilities, to remove farther up the country, the loſſes they might ſuſtain ſhould be repaired at the public expenſe.</p>
                     <p>They next addreſſed general Gage by letter; in which, having ſtated the grievances of the people of Maſſachuſetts colony, they informed him of the fixed and unalterable determination of all the other provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:028963_0154_0FDE102469B36E28"/>to ſupport their brethren and to oppoſe the Britiſh acts of parliament; that they themſelves were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to watch over the liberties of America; and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to deſiſt from military operations, leſt ſuch hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities might be brought on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The next ſtep was to publiſh a declaration of their rights. Theſe they ſummed up in the rights belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Engliſhmen; and particularly inſiſted, that as their diſtance rendered it impoſſible for them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Britiſh parliament, their provincial aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, with the governour appointed by the king, conſtituted the only legiſlative power within each prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince. They then marked the line between the ſuprem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> parliament, and the independency of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial legiſlatures, by proviſoes and reſtrictions, expreſſed in the following words: "But from the neceſſity of the caſe, and a regard to the mutual intereſts of both countries, we cheerfully conſent to the operation of ſuch acts of the Britiſh parliament, as are <hi>bona fide</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpoſe of ſecuring the commerical advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commerical benefits of its reſpective members, exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every idea of taxation, internal and external, for raiſing a revenue on the ſubjects of America without their conſent."</p>
                     <p>Doctor Ramſay remarks, that "this was the very hinge of the controverſy. The abſolute unlimited ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the Britiſh parliament, both in legiſlation and taxation, was contended for on one ſide; while on the other, no farther authority was conceded than ſuch a limited legiſlation, with regard to external commerce, as would combine the intereſt of the whole empire. In government, as well as in religion, there are myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, from the cloſe inveſtigation of which little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:028963_0155_0FDE102A68C76078"/>can be expected. From the unity of the empire it was neceſſary, that ſome acts ſhould extend over the whole. From the local ſituation of the colonies it was equally reaſonable that their legiſlatures ſhould at leaſt in ſome matters be independent. Where the ſuprem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acy of the firſt ended and the independency of the laſt began, was to the beſt informed a puzzling queſtion. Happy would it have been for both countries, had the diſcuſſion of this doubtful point never been attempted."</p>
                     <p>They proceeded to reprobate the intention of each of the new acts of parliament; and inſiſted on all the rights they had enumerated as being unalienable, and what none could deprive them of. The Canada act they particularly pointed out as being extremely ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical to the colonies, by whoſe aſſiſtance it had been conquered; and they termed it "An act for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Roman Catholic religion in Canada, aboliſhing the equitable ſyſtem of Engliſh laws, and eſtabliſhing a tyranny there." They further declared in favour of a non importation and non conſumption of Britiſh goods, until the acts were repealed by which duties were impoſed upon tea, coffee, wine, ſugar, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes, imported into America, as well as the Boſton port act, and the three others paſſed in the preceding ſeſſion of parliament. The new regulations againſt the importation and conſumption of Britiſh commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were then drawn up with great ſolemnity; and they concluded with returning the warmeſt thanks to thoſe members of parliament who had, with ſo much zeal, though without any ſucceſs, oppoſed the obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious acts of parliament.</p>
                     <p>Their next proceedings were to frame a petition to the king, a memorial to the Britiſh nation, an addreſs to the colonies, and another to the inhabitants of the province of Quebeck. They were all drawn up in a maſterly manner, and ought to have impreſſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:028963_0155_0FDE102A68C76078"/>of Britain with a more favourable idea of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans than they could at that time be induced to entertain. The petition to the king was as follows:</p>

                     <p>To a ſovereign who glories in the name of Briton, the bare recital of theſe acts muſt, we preſume, juſtify the loyal ſubjects who fly to the foot of the throne, and implore his clemency for protection againſt them.</p>
                     <p>From this deſtructive ſyſtem of colony adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adopted ſince the concluſion of the laſt war, have flowed thoſe diſtreſſes, dangers, fears and jealouſies, that overwhelm your majeſty's dutiful coloniſts with affliction; and we defy our moſt ſubtle and inveterate enemies to trace the unhappy differences between Great Britain and theſe colonies, from an earlier peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, or from other cauſes than we have aſſigned.</p>

                     <p>We, therefore, moſt earneſtly beſeech your majeſty, that your royal authority and interpoſition may be uſed for our relief; and that a gracious anſwer may be given to this petition.</p>

                     <p>All this time the diſpoſition of the people had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with the warmeſt wiſhes of congreſs. The firſt of June had been kept as a faſt, not only through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Virginia, where it was firſt propoſed, but through the whole continent. Contributions for the diſtreſſes of Boſton had been raiſed throughout America, and people of all ranks ſeemed to be particularly touched with them. Even thoſe who ſeemed to be moſt likely to derive advantages from them, took no opportunity, as has been already inſtanced in the caſe of Salem. The inhabitants of Marblehead alſo ſhowed a noble example of magnanimity in the preſent caſe. Though ſituated in the neighbourhood of Boſton, and moſt likely to derive benefit from their diſtreſſes, they did not attempt to take any advantage, but generouſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the uſe of their harbour to the Boſtonians, as well as their wharfs and warehouſes, free of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. In the mean time the Britiſh forces at Boſton were continually increaſing in number, which greatly augmented the general jealouſy and diſaffection; the country were ready to riſe at a moment's warning; and the experiment was made by giving a falſe alarm
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:028963_0159_0FDE104358D60C28"/>that the communication between the town and country was to be cut off, in order to reduce the former by famine to a compliance with the acts of parliament. On this intelligence, the country people aſſembled in great numbers, and could not be ſatisfied till they had ſent meſſengers into the city to enquire into the truth of the report. Theſe meſſengers were enjoined to inform the town's people, that if they ſhould be ſo puſillan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imous as to make a ſurrender of their liberties, the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince would not think itſelf bound by ſuch examples; and that Britain, by breaking their original charter, had annulled the contract ſubſiſting between them, and left them to act as they thought proper.</p>
                     <p>The people in every other reſpect manifeſted their inflexible determination to adhere to the plan they had ſo long followed. The new counſellors and judges were obliged to reſign their offices, in order to preſerve their lives and properties from the fury of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. In ſome places they ſhut up the avenues to the court houſes; and, when required to make way for the judges, replied, that they knew of none but ſuch as were appointed by the ancient uſage and cuſtom of the province. Every where they manifeſted the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire of learning the art of war; and every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual who could bear arms, was moſt aſſiduous in pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uring them, and learning their exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>Matters at laſt proceeded to ſuch an height, that General Gage thought proper to fortify the neck of land which joins the town of Boſton to the continent. This, though undoubtedly a prudent meaſure in his ſituation, was exclaimed againſt by the Americans in the moſt vehement manner; but the general, inſtead of giving ear to their remonſtrances, deprived them of all power of acting againſt himſelf, by ſeizing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial powder, ammunition, and military ſtores at Cambridge and Charleſtown. This excited ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:028963_0160_0FDE1044B3A275C8"/>that it was with the utmoſt difficulty the people could be reſtrained from marching to Boſton, and attacking the troops. Even in the town itſelf, the company of cadets that uſed to attend him diſbanded themſelves, and returned the ſtandard he had as uſual preſented them with on his acceſſion to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This was occaſioned by his having deprived the celebrated patriot John Hancock, afterwards preſident of the congreſs, of his commiſſion as colonel of the cadets. A ſimilar inſtance happened of a provincial colonel having accepted a ſeat in the new council; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which 24 officers of his regiment reſigned their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions in one day.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the proceedings of the governour occaſioned the holding an aſſembly of delegates from the ſeveral towns and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts in the county of Suffolk,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 9.</note> of which Boſton is the county town. The purport of this was publickly to renounce all obedience to the late acts of parliament, and to form an engagement to indemnify ſuch as ſhould be proſecuted on that account; the members of the new council were declared violaters of the rights of their country; all ranks and degrees were exhorted to learn the uſe of arms; and the receivers of the public revenue were ordered not to deliver it into the treaſury, but to retain it in their own hands till the conſtitution ſhould be reſtored, or a provincial congreſs diſpoſe of it otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>A remonſtrance againſt the fortifications on Boſton Neck,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 12.</note> was next prepared, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the governour; in which, however, they ſtill declared their unwillingneſs to proceed to any hoſtile meaſures; aſſerting only as uſual, their firm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination not to ſubmit to the acts of parliament, they had already ſo much complained of. The governour, to reſtore tranquillity, if poſſible, called a general
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:028963_0160_0FDE1044B3A275C8"/>aſſembly; but ſo many of the council had reſigned their ſeats, that he was induced to countermand its ſitting by proclamation. This meaſure, however, was deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed illegal; the aſſembly met at Salem; and, after wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a day for the governour, voted themſelves into a provincial congreſs, of which Mr. Hancock was choſen preſident. A committee was inſtantly appointed, who waited on the governour with a remonſtrance concerning the fortifications on Boſton Neck; but nothing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence took place, both parties mutually criminating each other. The winter was now coming on, and the governour, to avoid quartering the ſoldiers upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, propoſed to erect barracks for them; but the ſelectmen of Boſton compelled the workmen to deſiſt. Carpenters were ſent for to New York, but they were refuſed; and it was with the utmoſt difficulty that he could procure winter lodgings for his troops. Nor was the difficulty leſs in procuring clothes; as the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of New York told him, that "they would never ſupply any article for the benefit of men ſent as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to their country."</p>
                     <p>This diſpoſition, known to be almoſt univerſal throughout the continent, was in the higheſt degree ſatisfactory to congreſs; they unanimouſly approved of the Suffolk reſolutions,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 17.</note> and vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that contributions ſhould be raiſed for the relief of their brethren at Boſton, as their occaſions might require; and having accompliſhed the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous buſineſs for which they met, they broke up the 26th of October; after appointing another meeting of congreſs, the 10th of May enſuing, unleſs grievances ſhould be redreſſed before that time.</p>
                     <p>Every one ſaw that the enſuing ſpring was to be the ſeaſon of commencing hoſtilities, and the moſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable diligence was uſed by the colonies to be well provided againſt ſuch a formidable enemy. A liſt of
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:028963_0161_0FDE104C0D2F8CA0"/>all the fencible men in each colony was made out, and eſpecially of thoſe who had ſerved in the former war; of whom they had the ſatisfaction to find that two thirds were ſtill alive and fit to bear arms. Magazines of arms were collected, and money was provided for the payment of troops. The governour in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to put a ſtop to theſe proceedings by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations; the fatal period was now arrived; and the more the ſervants of government attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſpirit of the Americans, the more violent it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the inhabitants of Boſton were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to great diſtreſs. The Britiſh troops, now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the name of the <hi>enemy,</hi> were abſolutely in poſſeſſion of it; the inhabitants were kept as priſoners, and might be made accountable for the conduct of the whole colonies, and various meaſures were contrived to relieve the latter from ſuch a diſagreeable ſituation. Sometimes it was thought expedient to remove the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants altogether; but this was impracticable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the governour's conſent. It was then propoſed to ſet fire to the town at once, after valuing the houſes and indemnifying the proprietors; but this being found equally impracticable, it was reſolved to wait ſome other opportunity, as the garriſon were not very num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous, and not being ſupplied with neceſſaries by the inhabitants, might ſoon be obliged to leave the place. The friends of Britiſh government indeed attempted to do ſomething in oppoſition to the general voice of the people; but, after a few ineffectual meetings and reſolutions, they were utterly ſilenced, and obliged to yield to the ſuperior number of their adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the gloomy ſituation of affairs, the Americans had great expectations, as well from the petition to the king, as the addreſs to the inhabitants of Great Britain. The indifference, however, with
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:028963_0161_0FDE104C0D2F8CA0"/>which this addreſs was generally received, quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them, that nothing was to be hoped for from that quarter. This apparent indifference, ſo contrary to the expectation of the colonies, had ariſen from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſes. A great part of the people had always conſidered America as a country the property of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to whoſe laws and protection ſhe had a claim; and that the mother country, on the other hand, had an equal title to demand from her colonies a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quota towards defraying the expenſe of the empire in general. Their prejudices in favour of the omnip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otence of parliament, and their deſire that America ſhould bear a proportional ſhare of the public expenſes, hindered them from viewing any other ſecurity in the colonial charters, to the inhabitants of America, than a bar againſt taxation, by the king alone. The greater part of the people had no juſt conception of the grounds of the quarrel, nor acquaintance of the real ſituation of things in America. They were likewiſe farther bewildered in their opinions by the conduct of oppoſition. They obſerved that many of the members of both houſes of parliament who ſtood forward in favour of America, were the men, who, when in office, had been moſt active in ſupport of thoſe obnoxious acts of parliament which gave birth to the diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in the colonies. The American conteſts were no longer new. They had engaged the attention of parliament, with very little intermiſſion, for a period of ten years. Moſt of the ſubjects in diſpute were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by endleſs altercations; and the paſſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by them, however violent at firſt, had now ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, and been ſucceeded by that liſtleſſneſs and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor conſequent on violent agitations of the mind. The former non importation agreement had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, without producing any ſerious conſequences, owing moſt probably to the diviſions occaſioned by the
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:028963_0162_0FDE106D359F95B8"/>repeal of the ſeveral new taxes in 1767. Moſt people, therefore flattered themſelves, that as things had ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently appeared at the verge of a rupture, without actually arriving at it, ſome means would ſtill be found for accommodating this diſpute; or, at worſt, it was ſuppoſed the Americans themſelves would grow tired. An opinion was alſo circulated, with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, that a ſhow of reſolution on the part of the Britiſh miniſtry, if perſevered in for ſome time, would certainly put an end to the conteſt, which, it was ſaid, had been wholly nouriſhed by former conceſſions. The generality of the people, therefore, were inclined to leave the trial of the effects of perſeverance and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the miniſtry, who valued themſelves on theſe qualities. Thus adminiſtration, being little oppoſed at home, was left at leizure to proſecute ſuch meaſures againſt America, as had either been already adopted, or were as yet in embryo.</p>
                     <p>The parliament at that time, had but one ſeſſion more to run before it would expire of courſe. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for its diſſolution, was, however, iſſued on the 30th of September, and the writs made returnable for a new one, on the 29th of November following. The proceedings of congreſs had not yet reached Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but it was thought the miniſtry dreaded a non-importation agreement; and wiſhed to have the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions over, apprehending that the news of this event might influence the trading and manufacturing towns to vote againſt the court party. In the city, the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar party, carried every thing before them. Mr. Wilkes, was again elected for Middleſex, as well as lord mayor of London; and the miniſtry had now too much to riſk, to give him any diſturbance. The ſpeech from the throne,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nov.</hi> 30.</note> at the meeting of parliament, ſet forth the conduct of the Americans, particularly the inhabitants of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:028963_0162_0FDE106D359F95B8"/>Bay, in the moſt atrocious light; and a firm reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was announced of withſtanding to the utmoſt every attempt to oppoſe the ſupreme legiſlative author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Great Britain over all the dominions of the crown, the maintenance of which was held to be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the welfare, ſafety, and dignity of the empire in general.</p>
                     <p>An addreſs, in anſwer to the ſpeech, was propoſed in the uſual form, by the miniſter; but the oppoſite party inſiſted, that a requeſt ſhould be made to his majeſty, for a production of the whole intelligence he had received from America, as well as the letters, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and inſtructions relative to that buſineſs. This amendment was oppoſed by the miniſtry, on the ground that addreſſes were merely complimentary; that there was not then time for entering into a full diſcuſſion of American affairs; but that they would come before the houſe in their due order. After a warm debate, the original addreſs was carried by a prodigious majority, no leſs than 264 to 73.</p>
                     <p>The debate in the houſe of lords was warm and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, though the minority was but 13 to 63 on the diviſion. The diſpute was, however, remarkable for a proteſt, being the firſt mentioned in the Engliſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon an addreſs. It concluded thus: "But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the miſchievous deſigns, or the inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate temerity, which leads others to this deſperate courſe, we wiſh to be known as perſons who have ever diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of meaſures ſo pernicious in their paſt effects and their future tendency, and who are not in haſte, without inquiry or information, to commit ourſelves in declarations which may precipitate our country into all the calamities of a civil war."</p>
                     <p>However it was, whether it proceeded from irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a want of ſyſtem, doubts of parliamentary ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or a difference of opinion in the cabinet, there
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:028963_0163_0FDE106F07E656C0"/>was a ſtrange ſuſpenſion of American buſineſs previous to the Chriſtmas receſs, and the miniſter ſeemed evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to ſhrink from all conteſt upon that ſubject. The national eſtimates were entirely formed upon a peace eſtabliſhment. The land tax was continued at three ſhillings in the pound; no vote of credit was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; the army remained upon its former footing, and a reduction of 4000 ſeamen took place, only 16,000 being demanded for the enſuing year.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrange inconſiſtency of adminiſtration, with reſpect to American affairs, was ſeverely ſcrutinized by the oppoſition. It was aſſerted, that the whole was a cheat, in order to delude the people into a war, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doubly ruinous and diſgraceful by a defective pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; that the miniſters obſtinately reſolved not to make peace by any reaſonable political conceſſion, nor war by any vigorous military arrangement; but, by fluctuating between both, deprived the nation of a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of deriving benefit from either. Far from ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public, this delay of incurring timely charge would certainly aggravate the future expenſe, as they would aſſuredly feel in due time. That they were far from deſiring war; as little did they reliſh large peace eſtabliſhments: but if, againſt their will, war <hi>muſt</hi> be carried on, common ſenſe diſtated, that it ought to be carried on with effect; and that, if a peace eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and even lower than a peace eſtabliſhment, was ſufficient to ſupport a war, this afforded a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proof, that the peace eſtabliſhment had been ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prodigal.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to this, the miniſter of the naval depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment publicly aſſerted in the houſe of lords, that he knew the low eſtabliſhment propoſed would be fully ſufficient for reducing the colonies to obedience. He ſpoke with the greateſt contempt both of the power and the courage of the Americans. He held, that they
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:028963_0163_0FDE106F07E656C0"/>were not diſciplined nor capable of diſcipline, and that, formed of ſuch materials, and ſo indiſpoſed to action, the numbers, of which ſuch boaſts had been made, would only add to the facility of their defeat.</p>
                     <p>On this occaſion, however, the moſt wary ſilence was obſerved by the miniſters with regard to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt the Americans; being, in all probability, affraid that they would meet with a violent oppoſition from the mercantile intereſt; and in this they were not deceived. A general alarm had been ſpread during the receſs; the merchants of ſeveral towns had met and prepared petitions to parliament; and lord Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, though now broken with age and infirmities, once more appeared in the houſe of lords, to teſtify his diſapprobation of miniſterial meaſures.
<note place="margin">1775, <hi>Jan.</hi> 20.</note> He made a motion for recalling the troops
from Boſton, and repreſented the meaſure not
as matter of choice, but of neceſſity. An hour loſt in allaying the preſent ferment might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce years of calamity, as the ſituation of the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants and troops, with regard to one another, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them continually liable to events which might cut off all poſſibility of a reconciliation: whereas, ſuch a conciliatory meaſure on the part of Britain would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all jealouſy and apprehenſion on the part of the colonies, and inſtantaneouſly produce the happieſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to both countries. He ſeverely reproved admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration for refuſing to take the American affairs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly into conſideration; for deluding and deceiving the people by miſrepreſentations of facts; perſuading them that Boſton ſtood unconnected with the other colonies in the diſpute with Great Britain, and that quiet would be reſtored to that city by the appearance of a ſingle regiment, as had been unwarily aſſerted. After condemning, in the moſt explicit manner, the whole ſeries of miniſterial conduct with regard to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:028963_0164_0FDE107004001FC8"/>he is ſaid to have concluded his ſpeech with the following words: "If the miniſters thus perſevere in <hi>miſadviſing</hi> and <hi>miſleading</hi> the king, I will not ſay that they can alienate the affections of his ſubjects from his crown; but I will affirm, that they will make the crown not worth his wearing!—I will not ſay that the king is betrayed, but I will pronounce that the kingdom is undone." Lord Chatham's motion was loſt by a majority of 68 to 18; and, on this occaſion, the duke of Cumberland, the king's brother, divided with the minority. Such a deciſive victory, however, as it diſcovered to the miniſter the true diſpoſition of the new parliament, ſo it was thought to have given him confidence to go farther in his plan of coercion than he would otherwiſe have ventured to have done.</p>
                     <p>The American papers, at leaſt ſuch as the miniſter choſe at this time to produce, were now laid before the houſe. A ſeparate committee was propoſed for conſidering the petitions of the merchants, and this committee was to begin its ſittings on the 27th of January, the day after that appointed for taking the American affairs into conſideration. On this occaſion the moſt violent debates enſued, in which the utmoſt aſperity of language was made uſe of, eſpecially on the part of oppoſition. They ſaid it was a pitiful ſhift to defeat the petitions which they durſt not openly reject. The queſtion, however, was carried by a majority of 197 to 81.</p>
                     <p>Thus were conſigned to the <hi>Committee of Oblivion,</hi> as it was named by the members in oppoſition, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions from London, Briſtol, Glaſgow, Norwich, Liverpool, Mancheſter, Birmingham, Woolverhampton, Dudley, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A petition was next preſented by Mr. Bollan, Dr. Franklin, and Mr. Lee, three American agents, ſetting forth, that they were authorized by the American con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:028963_0164_0FDE107004001FC8"/>congreſs to preſent a petition from the congreſs to the king, which petition his majeſty had referred to that houſe. They were enabled, they ſaid, to throw great light upon the ſubject; and prayed to be heard at the bar in ſupport of it. Their application had the ſame fate with the reſt, being treated with the utmoſt indifference and contempt. The motion for receiving the petition was rejected by a majority of 218 to 68.</p>
                     <p>Lord Chatham perſevered in the proſecution of his conciliatory ſcheme with America, and accordingly brought into the houſe of lords a bill entitled, "A proviſional act for ſettling the troubles in America, and for aſſerting the ſupreme legiſlative authority and ſuperintending power of Great Britain over the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies." By this bill, the holding of a congreſs in the enſuing month of May was allowed, for the double purpoſe of duly recognizing the ſupreme legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and ſuperintending power of parliament over the colonies, and for making a free grant to the king, his heirs and ſucceſſors, of a certain and perpetual revenue, ſubject to the diſpoſition of parliament, and applicable to the alleviation of the national debt; taking it for granted, that this free aid would bear an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proportion to the great and flouriſhing ſtate of the colonies, the neceſſities of the mother country, and their obligations to her. On theſe conditions it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the powers of the admiralty courts to their ancient limits: and, without repealing, ſuſpended for a limited time thoſe acts, or parts of acts, which had been complained of in the petition from the continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal congreſs. It placed the judges upon the ſame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to the holding of their ſalaries and offices, with thoſe of England; and ſecured to the colonies all the privileges, franchiſes, and immunities granted by their ſeveral charters and conſtitutions. This propoſal was treated with the utmoſt indignity and contempt; not
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:028963_0165_0FDE107194A6E938"/>being allowed even to lie upon the table. On this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as on a former, the duke of Cumberland divided with the minority.</p>
                     <p>The meaſures now propoſed by lord North were entirely of a coercive kind.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Feb.</hi> 2.</note> A greater force was to be ſent to America, and a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary act paſſed to put a ſtop to all the foreign trade of the New England colonies, particularly the fiſhery on the banks of Newfoundland, until they returned to their duty. An addreſs to his majeſty was at the ſame time moved for, to "beſeech him to take the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual meaſures, to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the ſupreme legiſlature."</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately for the peace of both countries, the parliament of Great Britain believed that the claims of the coloniſts amounted to abſolute independence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecious ſhew of a redreſs of grievances. On the other hand, the coloniſts were confident that Britain harboured deſigns not only hoſtile to their intereſts, but that it was reſolved to introduce arbitrary government. Probably neither of theſe opinions were true in their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent; but matters had now proceeded ſo far, that every idea of reconciliation or friendſhip with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was loſt. The miniſtry, unhappily, liſtened for information only to thoſe whoſe intereſt it was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; ſuch as governours, judges, revenue offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and other ſervants of government; theſe men fancied that palatable information would prove the way to farther promotion; and thoſe whoſe integrity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them from ſtooping to ſuch meanneſs, were ſo warped by prejudice, that their information had an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect equally hurtful as that of the former.</p>
                     <p>In the debates on the meaſures propoſed by the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter, all the arguments which had been uſed on form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er occaſions by the members in oppoſition were now collected and urged with the utmoſt vehemence. The
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:028963_0165_0FDE107194A6E938"/>dangers that would attend a war with America, were pointed out; and the interference of foreign nations was foretold. The miniſtry did not deny the danger, but ſaid, "it muſt be encountered; that every day's delay increaſed the evil, and that it would be baſe and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly to put off for the preſent, an unavoidable conteſt, which muſt fall with accumulated weight on the heads of their poſterity. The danger of the foreign interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was denied; the very idea of it was treated as the creature of imagination, and it was ſaid, that an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of vigorous meaſures, with a farther rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of troops, would be ſufficient to quell the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances: and it was added, that the friends of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, were ſtrong and numerous, and only waited for proper ſupplies, and favourable circumſtances, to declare themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The miniſter carried all his plans by great majorities, but not without long and warm debates, and ſeveral proteſts in the houſe of lords. At length, on the 9th of February, 1775, a joint addreſs, from both houſes, was preſented to his majeſty in which, "they returned thanks for the communication of the papers relative to the ſtate of the Britiſh colonies in America, and gave it as their opinion, that a rebellion actually exiſted in the province of Maſſachuſetts, and beſought his majeſty, that he would take the moſt effectual meaſures to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force due obedience to the laws and authority of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme legiſlature, and begged in the moſt ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to aſſure his majeſty, that it was their fixed reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the hazard of their lives and properties, to ſtand by his majeſty againſt all rebellious attempts, in the maintenance of the juſt rights of his majeſty and the two houſes of parliament."</p>

                     <p>Thus the miniſtry, having proved ultimately victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, no farther obſtacle remained to the entering upon deciſive meaſures with regard to America. In anſwer to the addreſs, a meſſage was ſent from the throne, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding an augmentation of the forces by ſea and land. This being referred to the uſual committee of ſupply, a project was next formed of laying farther reſtrictions on the province of Maſſachuſetts Bay, it being deemed abſurd to ſend a military force, without making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per coercive laws, of which the military were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the execution. For this purpoſe the miniſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he would make choice of a puniſhment ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, that all ranks and degrees of men could not but be affected by it, which, of courſe, he ſuppoſed, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce obedience to the former laws. A bill was therefore brought into the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Feb.</hi> 10.</note> to reſtrain the trade and commerce of the provinces of Maſſachuſetts Bay and New Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, the colonies of Connecticut, and Rhode Iſland and Providence Plantations in North America, to Great Britain, Ireland, and the Britiſh Iſlands in the Weſt Indies; and to prohibit ſuch colonies and provinces from carrying on any fiſhery on the banks of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland, or other places therein to be mentioned, under certain conditions, and for a limited time. That the
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:028963_0167_0FDE107807DCF080"/>extreme ſeverity of this act, however, might be allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by ſuch proviſions as would not deſtroy its main object, the miniſter ſaid he would only propoſe it as temporary, to continue either to the end of the year, or the next ſeſſion of parliament; and he would alſo propoſe, that particular perſons might be excepted, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their obtaining certificates from the governour of the province in which they reſided, of their good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; or upon their ſubſcribing a teſt, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rights of parliament. Every argument which wit or ingenuity could ſuggeſt was urged againſt this bill, by the minority. Petitions were preſented and heard from the London merchants and the ſociety of Friends, repreſenting the cruelty and impolicy of the act, the nature and extent of the fiſhery, and the trade of New England, at different periods. [See New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, p. 165, &amp;c.] The marquis of Rockingham, in his ſpeech againſt the bill, entered into a very minute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of the American trade, and took a comparative view of that of New England at different periods. In the year 1704, he ſhewed that the whole amount of the exports to New England was only about 70,000<abbr>l.</abbr> annually; that in 1754, it had increaſed to 180,000<abbr>l.</abbr> and in the ſucceeding ten years to 400,000<abbr>l.</abbr> and that in the laſt ten years it had been nearly doubled. He concluded his ſpeech, by fortelling, "that an uſeful and conſtitutional agreement in ſentiments, and coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of intereſts, could never take place between them and the mother country, unleſs the former meaſures, preceding the laying on of any duties on the Americans, were recurred to and adopted."</p>
                     <p>The New England reſtraining act, having paſſed and received the royal aſſent, was accompanied with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of two thouſand additional ſeamen, and four thouſand three hundred and eighty three land forces; and the laſt demand was followed by an explanation
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:028963_0168_0FDE101D29D32B28"/>from the miniſter, that the force at Boſton would be augmented to ten thouſand men. Theſe propoſals drew forth the fierceſt wrath of oppoſition; the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, folly, and cruelty of miniſters reſounded through the houſe. But whilſt both parties were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting themſelves in fruitleſs debates, lord North ſurprized the whole nation by his conciliatory motion, afterwards ſtyled his <hi>Olive Branch.</hi> By this it was propoſed, that when the governour, council, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of any province, or the general court, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make proviſion according to their reſpective conditions, circumſtances, and ſituations, for contrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uting their proportion to the common defence, ſuch proportion to be raiſed under the authority of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral court, or general aſſembly of ſuch province or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony, and diſpoſable by parliament; and ſhall engage to make proviſion alſo for the ſupport of the civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the adminiſtration of juſtice in ſuch province or colony, it would be proper, if ſuch propoſal ſhould be approved of by his majeſty in parliament, and for ſo long as ſuch proviſion ſhall be made accordingly, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, in reſpect of ſuch province or colony, to levy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Suties, tax, or aſſeſſment, except only ſuch duties as it may be expedient to impoſe for the regulation of commerce; the net produce of the duties laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to be carried to the account of ſuch province, colony, or plantation reſpectively.</p>
                     <p>Such a propoſition from the miniſter involved him in the moſt violent conteſts, even with thoſe of his own party. However, he ſoon convinced the mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="335" facs="unknown:028963_0168_0FDE101D29D32B28"/>but that, if it did no good there, it would do good in Britain: It would unite the people, by holding out to them a diſtinct object of revenue; and as it united Britain, it would diſunite America: That whatever province came firſt to make a dutiful offer, would be kindly and gently treated; and if only one province accepted the offer, the whole confederacy would be broken.</p>
                     <p>By the members in oppoſition, this bill was reprobat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt violent manner. It was remarked that hitherto it had been conſtantly denied that they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conteſt about an American revenue; that the whole had been a diſpute about obedience to trade laws, and the general legiſtative authority of parliament; but now miniſters ſuddenly changed their language, and propoſed to intereſt the nation, conſole the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, and animate the ſoldiery, by perſuading them that it is not a conteſt for empty honour, but for the acquiſition of a ſubſtantial revenue. It was ſaid that the Americans would be as effectually taxed, without their conſent, by being compelled to pay a groſs ſum, as by an aggregate of ſmall duties to the ſame amount. That this ſcheme of taxation exceeded in oppreſſion any that the rapacity of mankind had hitherto deviſed. In other caſes, a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ecifie ſum was demanded, and the people might reaſonably preſume that the remainder was their own; but here, they were wholly in the dark as to the extent of the demand. All their eloquence, however, was by no means ſufficient to carry the point even here, when the miniſter had been deſerted by ſome of his ſtauncheſt friends. The bill was paſſed by a majority of 274 to 88.</p>
                     <p>This bill was followed by another, ſeemingly of a contrary tendency, being a ſupplement to the New England Fiſhery Bill, and included the colonies of New Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and South
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:028963_0169_0FDE107DA4637DA0"/>Carolina. No debate of any conſequence enſued on this ſubject; but the diſcuſſion of another petition from the Weſt India planters, proved the means of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the importance of theſe iſlands, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on North America, more generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood than before this time. From documents now produced, it appeared, that the capital in theſe iſlands, conſiſting of cultivated lands, buildings, negroes, and ſtock of all kinds, did not amount to leſs than ſixty millions ſterling. Their exports of late years to Great Britain Lad run to about 190,000 hogſheads and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons of ſugar and rum annually; amounting in weight to 95,000 tons, and in value about four millions; beſides a great number of ſmaller articles, as well as their immenſe export to North America. So rapid was the improvement of theſe iſlands, that within a few years, their export of ſugar to Britain had been increaſed by 40,000 hogſheads annually, amounting to near 800,000<abbr>l.</abbr> in value; and it ſeemed probable, that no leſs than thirty millions of Weſt India property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to people in Britain; and that the revenue gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above 700,000<abbr>l.</abbr> annually upon the Weſt India trade, excluſive of its eventual and circuitous products, and of the African trade. It was alſo fully ſhown, that this immenſe capital and trade, as well as the African, neither of which could ſubſiſt without the other, were, both from nature and circumſtance, totally dependent on North America.</p>
                     <p>This petition, as well as another from Waterford in Ireland, produced no good conſequences. The miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial plan was unalterably determined. Conciliatory motions were propoſed by Mr. Burke and Mr. Hartley; but, whatever ingenuity might be diſplayed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing and framing theſe motions, very little regard was paid to them by adminiſtration. The only thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable was the immenſe value of North America
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:028963_0169_0FDE107DA4637DA0"/>to Britain, as appeared from Mr. Barke's comparative view of the trade of Britain at different periods. From thence it was ſhown, that in 1704, the exports to North Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, the Weſt Indies, and Africa, amounted only to 569,930<abbr>l.</abbr> That in the year 1772, at an average of ſeveral years before and after the exports to the ſame places, including thoſe from Scotland, (which, in the year 1704, had no exiſtence) amounted to no leſs than 6,024,171<abbr>l.</abbr> being in the proportion of nearly eleven to one. He alſo ſhewed, that the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port trade of England, including that of the colonies, amounted, at the firſt period of 1704, only to 6,509,000<abbr>l.</abbr> Thus, the trade to the colonies alone was, at the latter period, within leſs than half a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of being equal to what Britain carried on at the beginning of the preſent century with the whole world. And, ſtating the whole export trade of Britain at preſent at ſixteen millions, that to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which in the firſt period conſtituted but one twelfth of the whole, was now very conſiderably more than one third.</p>
                     <p>However aſtoniſhing this general increaſe of the whole colonies may appear, the growth of the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince of Pennſylvania was ſtill more extraordinary. In the year 1704, the whole exports to that colony amounted only to 11,459<abbr>l.</abbr> and in 1772 they were riſen to 507,509<abbr>l.</abbr> being nearly fifty times the original demand, and almoſt equal to the whole colony export at the firſt period.</p>
                     <p>Towards the cloſe of the ſeſſion a memorial was preſented to the houſe of commons, and another to the houſe of peers, from the aſſembly of New York, and both were rejected, upon the principle that they claimed to themſelves rights derogatory to, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with, the legiſlative authority of parliament. Memorials from the Britiſh inhabitants of Quebeck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The only remarkable circumſtances attending theſe, were the two royal brothers voting in the minority, and the animated ſpeech of lord Effingham, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per houſe, in favour of the claims of America, when he declared his reſignation of the military command he held.</p>
                     <p>The ſeſſion concluded with the paſſing the money bills in the uſual form. The ſpeaker, in his addreſs to the king, ſtated the heavineſs of the grants, which, however, had been readily complied with, on account of the particular exigence of the times; at the ſame time aſſuring his majeſty, that ſhould the Americans perſiſt in their reſolutions, and thus render it neceſſary to draw the ſword, the commons would do every thing in their power to ſupport the dignity of the Britiſh legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>Doctor Franklin laboured hard to prevent the breach from becoming irreparable, and in union with Dr. Fothergill and Mr. David Barclay, two Engliſh gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, highly eſteemed by the Britiſh miniſtry, candidly ſtated the outlines of a compact which he ſuppoſed would procure a durable union of the two countries; but his well meant endeavours proved abortive, and in the mean time he was abuſed as the fomenter of thoſe diſturbances which he was anxiouſly endeavouring to prevent. That the miniſtry might have ſome opening to proceed upon, and ſome ſalvo for their perſonal hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he was diſpoſed to engage, that pecuniary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation ſhould be made for the tea deſtroyed; but he would not give up eſſential liberty, for the purpoſe of procuring temporary ſafety. Dr. Franklin finding the miniſtry bent on war, unleſs the coloniſts would conſent to hold their rights, liberties and charters as the diſcretion of a Britiſh parliament, and well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>I MENTIONED it yeſterday to your excellency as my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that excluding the people of the colonies from all ſhare in the choice of the grand council, would probably give extreme diſſatisfaction, as well as the taxing them by an act of parliament, where they have no repreſentative. In matters of general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to the people and eſpecially where burdens are to be laid upon them, it is of uſe to conſider, as well what they will be apt to think and ſay, as what they ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> think; I ſhall therefore, as your excellency requires it of me, briefly mention what of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind occurs to me on this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they will ſay, and perhaps with juſtice, that the body of the people in the colonies are as loyal and as firmly attached to the preſent conſtitution and reigning family, as any ſubjects in the king's dominions:</p>
                  <p>That there is no reaſon to doubt the readineſs and willingneſs of the repreſentatives they may chooſe, to grant from time to time ſuch ſupplies for the defence of the country as ſhall be judged neceſſary, ſo far as their abilities will allow:</p>
                  <p>That the people in the colonies, who are to feel the immediate miſchiefs of invaſion and conqueſt by an enemy, in the loſs of their eſtates, lives and liberties are likely to be better judges of the quantity of forces neceſſary to be raiſed and maintained, forts to be built and ſupported, and of their own abilities to bear the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, than the parliament of England at ſo great a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>That governours often come to the colonies merely to make fortunes, with which they intend to return to Britain; are not always men of the beſt abilities or integrity; have many of them no eſtates here, nor any natural connexions with us, that ſhould make them heartily concerned for our welfare; and might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be fond of raiſing and keeping up more forces than neceſſary from the profits accruing to themſelves, and to make proviſion for their friends and dependants:</p>
                  <p>That the counſellors in moſt of the colonies being appointed by the crown, on the recommendation of governours, are often
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:028963_0172_0FDE1082062DBDC8"/>of ſmall eſtates, frequently dependent on the governours for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and therefore too much under influence:</p>
                  <p>That there is, therefore, great reaſon to be jealous of a power in ſuch governours and councils, to raiſe ſuch ſums as they ſhall judge neceſſary, by draft on the lords of the treaſury, to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſaid on the colonies by act of parliament, and paid by the people here; ſince they might abuſe it, by projecting uſeleſs expeditions, haraſling the people, and taking them from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to execute ſuch projects, merely to create offices and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and gratify their dependants and divide profits:</p>
                  <p>That the parliament o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> England is at a great diſtance, ſubject to be miſinformed and miſled by ſuch governours and councils, whoſe united intereſts might probably ſecure them againſt the effect of any complaint from hence:</p>
                  <p>That it is ſuppoſed to be an undoubted right of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> not to be taxed but by their own conſent given through their repreſentatives:</p>
                  <p>That the colonies have no repreſentatives in parliament:</p>
                  <p>That to propoſe taxing them by parliament, and refuſe them the liberty of chooſing a repreſentative council, to meet in the colonies, and conſider and judge of the neceſſity of any general tax, and the quantum, ſhows a ſuſpicion of their loyalty to the crown, or of their regard for their country, or of their common ſenſe and underſtanding, which they have not deſerved:</p>
                  <p>That compelling the colonies to pay money without their conſent, would be rather like raiſing contributions in an enemy's country, than taxing <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> for their own public benefit:</p>
                  <p>That it would be treating them as a conquered people, and not as true Britiſh ſubjects:</p>
                  <p>That a tax laid by the repreſentatives of the colonies might eaſily be leſſened, as the occaſions ſhould leſſen; but being once laid by parliament, under the influence of the repreſentations made by governours, would probably be kept up, and continued for the benefit of governours, to the grievous burden and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the colonies, and prevention of their growth and increaſe:</p>
                  <p>That a power in governours to march the inhabitants from one end of the Britiſh and French colonies to the other, being a country of at leaſt 1,500 ſquare miles, without the approbation or conſent of their repreſentatives firſt obtained, might occaſion expeditions grievous and ruinous to the people, and would put them upon a footing with the ſubjects of France in Canada, that now groan under ſuch oppreſſion from their governour, who, for two years paſt, has harraſſed them with long and deſtructive marches to the Ohio:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="unknown:028963_0172_0FDE1082062DBDC8"/>
That, if the colonies in a body may be well governed by gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernours and councils appointed by the crown without repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives, particular colonies may as well, or better, be ſo govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: A tax may be laid on them all by act of parliament for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of government, and their aſſemblies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> diſmiſſed as an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs part of the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>That the powers propoſed by the <hi>Albany</hi> plan of union, to be veſted in a grand repreſentative council of the people, even with regard to military matters, are not ſo great as thoſe the colonies of <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> are entruſted with by their charter, and have never abuſed: For by this plan, the preſident general is appointed by the crown, and controls all by his negative; but in theſe governments, the people chooſe the governour, and yet allow him no negative:</p>
                  <p>That the Britiſh colonies bordering on the French, are prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly frontiers of the Britiſh empire; and the frontiers of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire are properly defended at the joint expenſe of the body of the people in ſuch empire. It would now be thought hard, by act of parliament, to oblige the cinque ports, or ſea coaſts of Britain, to maintain the whole navy, becauſe they are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately defended by it; not allowing them at the ſame time a vote in chooſing the members of parliament: And if the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers in America muſt bear the expenſe of their own defence, it ſeems hard to allow them no ſhare in voting the money, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the neceſſity and ſum, or adviſing the meaſures:</p>
                  <p>That beſides the taxes neceſſary for the defence of the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, the colonies pay yearly great ſums to the mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try unnoticed; for taxes paid in Britain, by the landholder or artificer, muſt enter into and increaſe the price of the produce of land, and of manufactures made of it; and great part of this is paid by conſumers in the colonies, who thereby pay a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the Britiſh taxes.</p>
                  <p>We are reſtrained in our trade with foreign nations; and where we could be ſupplied with any manufacture cheaper from them, but muſt buy the ſame dearer from Britain, the difference of price is a clear tax to Britain. We are obliged to carry great part of our produce directly to Britain; and wherein the duties there laid upon it leſſen its price to the planter, or it ſells for leſs than it would in foreign markets, the difference is a tax paid to Britain.</p>
                  <p>Some manufactures we could make, but are forbidden and muſt take of <hi>Britiſh</hi> merchants; the whole price of theſe is a tax paid to Britain.</p>
                  <p>By our greatly increaſing the demand and conſumption of Britiſh manufactures, their price is conſiderably raiſed of late
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:028963_0173_0FDE10845B06CAF0"/>years: Their advance is clear profit to Britain, and enables its people better to pay great taxes; and much of it being paid by us, is a clear tax to Britain.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, as we are not ſuffered to regulate our trade, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the importation and conſumption of Britiſh ſuperfluities, (as Britain can the conſumption of foreign ſuperfluities) our whole wealth centres finally among the merchants and inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Britain; and if we make them richer, and enable them better to pay their taxes, it is nearly the ſame as being taxed ourſelves, and equally beneficial to the crown. Theſe kind of ſecondary taxes, however, we do not complain of, though we have no ſhare in the laying or diſpoſing of them: But to pay immediate heavy taxes, in the laying, appropriation, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of which we have no part, and which, perhaps, we may know to be as unneceſſary as grievous, muſt ſeem hard meaſure to <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> who cannot conceive, that by hazarding their lives and fortunes, in ſubduing and ſettling new countries, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dominion, and increaſing the commerce of their mother nation, they have forfeited the native rights of <hi>Britons,</hi> which they think ought rather to be given them as due to ſuch merit, if they had been before in a ſtate of ſlavery. Theſe, and ſuch kind of things as theſe, I apprehend, will be thought and ſaid by the people, if the propoſed alteration of the Albany plan ſhould take place. Then the adminiſtration of the board of governours and councils ſo appointed, not having any repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative body of the people to approve and unite in its meaſures, and conciliate the minds of the people to them, will probably become ſuſpected and odious: Dangerous animoſities and feuds will ariſe between the governours and governed, and every thing go into confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps I am too apprehenſive in this matter; but having freely given my opinion and reaſons, your excellency can judge better than I whether there be any weight in them; and the ſhortneſs of the time allowed me, will, I hope, in ſome degree excuſe the imperfections of this ſcrawl.</p>
                  <p>With the greateſt reſpect and fidelity, I have the honour to be, your excellency's moſt obedient and moſt humble ſervant,</p>

                     <p>Doctor Gordon obſerves, that aſſemblies, conventions, congreſſes, towns, cities, private clubs and circles, were ſeemingly animated by one great, wiſe, active and noble ſpirit; one maſterly ſoul, enlivening one vigorous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>On the 26th of February general Gage, having been informed that a number of field pieces had been brought to Salem, diſpatched a party to ſeize them. Their road was obſtructed by a river, over which was a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. This the people had pulled up, and refuſed to let down: upon which the ſoldiers ſeized a boat to ferry them over; but the people cut out her bottom. Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities would immediately have commenced, had it not been for the interpoſition of a clergyman,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Reverend Thomas Barnard.</note> who rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſented to the military, on the one hand, the folly of oppoſing ſuch numbers; and to the people, on the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that as the day was far ſpent, the military could not execute their deſign, ſo that they might without any fear leave them the quiet poſſeſſion of the draw-bridge. This was complied with; and the ſoldiers, after having remained for ſome time at the bridge, returned without executing their orders.</p>
                     <p>The next attempt, however, was attended with more ſerious conſequences. Generel Gage having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that a large quantity of ammunition and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtores had been collected at Concord, about 20 miles from Boſton, for the ſupport a provincial army, wiſhed to prevent hoſtilities by depriving the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the means neceſſary for carrying them on. It was likewiſe reported that he had a deſign to ſeize meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs Hancock and Adams, the leading men of the congreſs. Wiſhing to accompliſh his deſign without bloodſhed, he took every precaution to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it by ſurprize,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 18.</note> and without alarming the country. At eleven o'clock at night, 800 grenadiers and light infantry, the flower of the royal army, embarked at the common, landed at Phipp's farm, and marched for Concord, under the command of lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028963_0181_0FDDBEB722D1BA10"/>colonel Smith. Neither the ſecrecy with which this expedition was planned; the privacy with which the troops marched out, nor an order that no inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants ſhould leave Boſton, were ſufficient to prevent intelligence from being ſent to the country militia, of what was going on.</p>
                     <p>About two in the morning, 130 of the Lexington militia had aſſembled to oppoſe them, but the air being chilly, and intelligence reſpecting the regulars uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they were diſmiſſed, with orders to appear again at beat of drum. They collected a ſecond time to the number of 70, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Britiſh regulars ſoon after made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.

A diſperſion of the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itia was the conſequence, but the firing of the regulars was nevertheleſs continued. Individuals, finding they were fired upon, though diſperſing, returned the fire. Three or four of the militia were killed on the green. A few more were ſhot after they had began to diſperſe. The royal detachment proceeded on to Concord, and executed their commiſſion. They diſabled two 24 pounders—threw 500lb. of ball into rivers and wells, and broke in pieces about 60 barrels of flour.</p>
                     <p>Mr. John Butterick of Concord, major of a minute-regiment, not knowing what had paſſed at Lexington, ordered his men not to give the firſt fire, that they might not be the aggreſſors. Upon his approaching near the regulars, they fired, and killed captain Iſaac Davis, and one private of the provincial minute-men. The fire was returned, and a ſkirmiſh enſued. The king's troops, having done their buſineſs, began their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028963_0181_0FDDBEB722D1BA10"/>retreat towards Boſton. This was conducted with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, for the adjacent inhabitants had aſſembled in arms, and began to attack them in every direction. In their return to Lexington, they were exceedingly annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both by thoſe who preſſed on their rear, and others who, pouring in from all ſides, fired from behind ſtone walls, and ſuch like coverts, which ſupplied the place of lines and redoubts.</p>
                     <p>At Lexington the regulars were joined by a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 900 men, under lord Piercy, which had been ſent out by general Gage to ſupport lieutenant colonel Smith. This reinforcement having two pieces of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, awed the provincials, and kept them at a greater diſtance, but they continued a conſtant, though irreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular and ſcattering fire, which did great execution. The cloſe firing from behind the walls by good markſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, put the regular troops in no ſmall confuſion, but they nevertheleſs kept up a briſk retreating fire on the militia and minute-men.</p>
                     <p>A little after ſunſet, the regulars reached Bunker's Hill, worn down with exceſſive fatigue, having marched that day between thirty and forty miles. On the next day they croſſed Charleſtown ferry, and returned to Boſton.</p>
                     <p>There never were more than 400 provincials engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at one time, and often not ſo many. As ſome tired and gave out, others came up and took their places. There was ſcarcely any diſcipline obſerved among them. Officers and privates ſired when they were ready, and ſaw a royal uniform, without waiting for the word of command. Their knowledge of the country enabled them to gain opportunities by croſſing fields and fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and to act as flanking parties againſt the king's troops, who kept to the main road.</p>
                     <p>The regulars had 65 killed, 180 wounded, and 28 made priſoners. Of the provincials 50 were killed, and 88 wounded and miſſing.</p>

This was the fatal day remarkable for the diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berment of the Britiſh empire, and the final ſeparation of the American colonies. The provincial congreſs of Maſſachuſetts, which was in ſeſſion at the time of the battle, diſpatched an account of it to Great Britain, accompanied with many depoſitions, to prove that the Britiſh troops were the aggreſſors. They alſo addreſſed the inhabitants of Great Britain, in which, after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of their ſufferings, they ſay, "theſe have not yet detached us from our royal ſovereign; we profeſs to be his loyal and dutiful ſubjects, and though hardly dealt with, as we have been, are ſtill ready with our lives and fortunes, to defend his perſon, crown, and dignity.

The ſelectmen gave repeated aſſurances that the inhabitants had delivered up their arms; on the other hand general Gage iſſued a proclamation, in which he aſſerted that he had full proof to the contrary. The provincial congreſs remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, but without effect. Paſſports were not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally refuſed, but were given out ſlowly. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſhewed a diſinclination to part with the women and children, thinking, that, by retaining them, the provincials would be reſtrained from aſſaulting the town. This occaſioned very diſtreſſing ſcenes—wives ſeparated from their huſbands—children from their parents—and the aged and infirm from their relations and friends: and this diſtreſs was heightened by the quibble which was made on the meaning of the word <hi>effects,</hi> which the general conſtrued as not including merchandize; whereby he deprived the provincials of a ſupply of thoſe articles of which they ſtood moſt in need. Thus, many who quitted the town were depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their uſual means of ſupport.</p>
                     <p>The flame of civil diſcord now broke out in all its fury. The bravery ſhown by the American militia in their firſt eſſay at Lexington, and the advantages they imagined themſelves to have gained, afforded great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of exultation.</p>
                     <p>The ſpirits of the people were ſo raiſed, that they meditated nothing leſs than the total expulſion of the Britiſh troops from Boſton. An army of 20,000 men was aſſembled, who formed a line of encampment from Roxbury to Myſtic; and here they were ſoon after pined by a large body of Connecticut troops, under general Putnam, an old officer of great bravery and experience. By this formidable force was the town of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028963_0183_0FDDBEBA2E4D68A8"/>Boſton now kept blocked up. General Gage, however, had ſo ſtrongly fortified it, that the provincials, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as they were, durſt not make an attack; whilſt, on the other hand, his force was by far too inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant to meet ſuch an enemy in the field.</p>
                     <p>Reſiſtance being univerſally reſolved on by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, the pulpit, the preſs, the bench and the bar ſeverally laboured to encourage them. The clergy of New England were a numerous, learned, and reſpectable body, who had a great aſcendency on the minds of their hearers. Their number is ſaid to have amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 700, and their exertions in the public cauſe were important and effectual. In their prayers and in their ſermons they repreſented the cauſe of America as the cauſe of heaven. The ſynod of New York and Philadelphia ſent forth a paſtoral letter, which was publickly read in their churches. This earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended ſuch ſentiments and conduct as were ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their ſituation. Writers and printers followed in the rear of the preachers, and next to them had the greateſt hand in animating their countrymen. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the bench and of the bar denied the charge of rebellion, and juſtified the reſiſtance of the coloniſts. A diſtinction, founded on law, between the king and his miniſtry, was introduced. The former, it was contended, could do no wrong. The crime of treaſon was charged on the latter, for uſing the royal name to varniſh their own unconſtitutional meaſures.

                     <p>The neceſſity of ſecuring Ticonderoga was early at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by many in New England. General Gage had ſet the example of attempting to ſeize upon mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtores, and by ſo doing had commenced hoſtilities, ſo that retaliation appeared warrantable.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Allen was at Caſtleton with about 270 men, 230 of which were Green Mountain Boys, ſo called from their reſiding within the limits of the Green Mountains, the Hampſhire grants being ſo denominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the range of green mountains that run through them. Centinels were placed immediately on all the roads to prevent any intelligence being carried to Ticonderoga.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Arnold, who now joined colonel Allen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that there were at Ticonderoga, 80 pieces of heavy cannon, 20 of braſs, from four to eighteen pounders, ten or a dozen mortars, a number of ſmall arms, and conſiderable ſtores; that the fort was in a ruinous condition, and, as he ſuppoſed, garriſoned by about forty men. It was then ſettled, that colonel Allen ſhould have the ſupreme command, and colonel Arnold was to be his aſſiſtant.</p>
                     <p>They arrived at Lake Champlain, oppoſite Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga, on the ninth of May at night. Boats were with difficulty procured, when he and colonel Arnold croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028963_0184_0FDDBEBBE54A8DF8"/>over with 83 men, and landed near the garriſon: The two colonels advanced along ſide each other, and entered the port, leading to the fort, in the grey of the morning. A centinel ſnapped his fuſee at colonel Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and then retreated through the covered way to the parade. The main body of the Americans then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and drew up. Captain de la Place, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, was ſurprized in bed. Thus the place was taken without any bloodſhed. They likewiſe ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Crown Point, in which there was a garriſon of twelve men. They took, alſo, two ſmall veſſels, and found materials at Ticonderoga for building others. By this expedition the provincials acquired great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of ammunition and military ſtores; and obtained the command of Lake Champlain, which ſecured them a paſſage into Canada. Colonel Allen went home, and colonel Arnold, with a number of men, agreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there in garriſon. Colonel Arnold, after a ſeries of ſucceſſes, formed the bold plan of invading Canada. He wrote to congreſs, that with 2000 men he would reduce the whole province. His great exertions, when that meaſure was adopted, will be related hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs, before its diſſolution on the 26th of October 1774, recommended to the colonies, to chuſe members for another, to meet on the 10th of May 1775, unleſs the redreſs of their grievances was previouſly obtained.

The line of moderation and firmneſs which they purſued will be hereafter related.</p>
                     <p>Towards the latter end of May, a conſiderable rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement having arrived with the Britiſh generals Howe, Burgoyne and Clinton, general Gage was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to attempt ſomething of conſequence; and this the boaſts of the provincials, that they were beſieging thoſe who had been ſent to ſubdue them, ſeemed to render neceſſary. Some ſkirmiſhes in the mean time happened in the iſlands lying off Boſton harbour, in which the Americans had the advantage, and burned an armed ſchooner, which her people had been obliged to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don after ſhe was left aground by the tide.</p>
                     <p>Hoſtilities were now forwarded by the reſolves of the continental congreſs, which on the 8th of June, declared the compact between the crown and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Maſſachuſetts Bay to be diſſolved by the violation of the charter of William and Mary. They, at the ſame time, recommended to the people, to eſtabliſh a new government, until a governour of his majeſty's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment will conſent to govern the colony according to its charter. They prohibited them from negociating any bill, or tranſacting any buſineſs with the ſea or land officers of Britain, their agents or contractors, furniſhing them with ſtores or proviſions of any kind. A general poſt office was eſtabliſhed at Philadelphia, at the head of which they placed Dr. Franklin, who had been deprived of the ſame place in England.</p>
                     <p>General Gage, on the other hand, iſſued a procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, wherein he offered a pardon in the king's name, to all who ſhould forthwith lay down their arms and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028963_0185_0FDD5F39F02DD108"/>return to their reſpective occupations and peaceable duties, excepting only from the benefit of that pardon, "Samuel Adams and John Hancock, whoſe offences were ſaid to be of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other conſideration than that of condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment." It was alſo declared, that not only the perſons above named and excepted, but alſo all their adherents, aſſociates, and correſpondents, ſhould be deemed guilty of treaſon and rebellion, and treated accordingly. "That all the courts of judicature were ſhut, and martial law ſhould take place, till a due courſe of juſtice ſhould be eſtabliſhed."</p>
                     <p>The Americans, ſuppoſing this proclamation to be a prelude to hoſtilities, prepared for action. Orders were therefore iſſued by the provincial commander<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Between twelve and one o'clock, and the day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly hot, a number of boats and barges filled with regular troops from Boſton approached Charleſtown, when the men were landed at Moreton's Point, a little to the eaſtward of the American works. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of four battalions, two companies of grenadiers, and ten of light infantry, with a proportion of field ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery; but, by ſome overſight, their ſpare cartridges were much too big for them: ſo that, when the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans were at length forced from their lines; there was not a round of artillery cartridges remaining.</p>
                     <p>Major general Howe and brigadier general Pigot had the command. The troops formed and remained in that poſition, till joined by a ſecond detachment of light infantry and grenadier companies, a battalion of the land forces, and a battalion of marines, amounting in the whole to about 3000 men. The generals Clinton and Burgoyne took their ſtand upon Copp's Hill, to obſerve and contemplate the bloody and deſtructive operations that were now commencing. The regulars formed in two lines, and advanced deliberately, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently halting to give time for the artillery to fire, which was not well ſerved. The light infantry were directed to force the left point of the breaſt work, and to take the American line in flank.

He was appointed a delegate to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs which met in September 1774.

                     <p>The continental army under the command of general Waſhington, amounted to about 14,500 men. They
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028963_0195_0FDDBEDDC5125ED0"/>were entrenched at Winter Hill, Proſpect Hill, and Roxbury, communicating with one another by ſmall poſts over a diſtance of ten miles. Parties were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtationed in ſeveral towns along the ſea coaſt. This whole force was thrown into three grand divſions: general Ward commanded the right wing, at Roxbury; general Lee, the left, as Proſpect Hill; and the centre was commanded by general Waſhington. Theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were ſo judiciouſly made, that the Britiſh were pent up in the town, and excluded from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and forage which the adjacent country, and iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands in Boſton Bay, afforded.</p>

                     <p>It was found on the 4th of Auguſt, that the whole ſtock of powder throughout the four New England provinces, could make but little more than nine rounds a man, to the army inveſting Boſton. They remained in this deſtitute condition for a fortnight or more. During this interval, the ſcarcity of powder became a common camp talk; and a deſerter carried an account of it to Boſton. But the Britiſh, having been ſo often deceived, durſt not rely upon the intelligence. Beſides, though they had met with unexpected proofs of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican courage, yet they could not believe that the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts were poſſeſſed of ſuch conſummate aſſurance, as to continue inveſting them, whilſt ſo deſtitute of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. They rather ſuſpected a deep laid plot to inſnare them. At length, the American army was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. The Jerſey committee of Elizabeth Town, upon receiving the alarming news, ſent a ſew tons, with the greateſt privacy, leſt the fears of their own people, had it been known, ſhould have ſtopt it for their own uſe, in caſe of an emergency. A ſupply of ſeveral thouſand pounds weight of powder was ſoon after obtained from Africa, in exchange for New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land rum. This was managed with ſo much addreſs, that every ounce for ſale in the Britiſh forts on the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican coaſts, was purchaſed and brought off for the uſe of the coloniſts.</p>
                     <p>The firſt attempts of the Americans at ſea proved very ſucceſsful. In the month of November, the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts aſſembly and the continental congreſs both reſolved to grant letters of marque and repriſal, and to eſtabliſh coarts of admiralty.

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028963_0196_0FDDBEDF0E87AA60"/>of their enemies; but as the proſpect of accommodation gradually vaniſhed, it was extended to all Britiſh proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the high ſeas.</p>
                     <p>In the end of the ſame month, the Lee privateer,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nov.</hi> 29.</note> commanded by captain Manly of Marblehead, captured the brig Nancy, as ordnance ſhip from Woolwich, containing a large braſt mortar, upon a new conſtruction, afterwards called the Congreſs, ſeveral pieces of braſs cannon, a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of arms and ammunition, with all manner of tools utenſils and machines neceſſary for camps and artillery; ſo that had congreſs ſent an order for the articles moſt wanted, they could not have made out a more ſuitable invoice. The whole value of the veſſel and cargo was computed at 50,000<abbr>l.</abbr> and this loſs, in particular, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned much diſcontent in Britain.</p>
                     <p>About two months before this valuable capture, a ſhip from Briſtol to Boſton, with flour, having parted with her convoy, was decoyed into Portſmouth, New Hampſhire, and ſecured for the benefit of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. Several ſtore ſhips were captured in the month of December. Among others, captain Manly took three, with various ſtores for the troops in Boſton, and a brig from Antigua with rum.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were part of the immenſe ſupplies which the Britiſh miniſtry had prepared for the relief of the troops in Boſton. It is ſaid that no fewer than five thouſand oxen, fourteen thouſand of the largeſt and farteſt ſheep, with a vaſt number of hogs, were purchaſed and ſent out alive. Incredible quantities of vegetables were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bought up, and cured by new methods. Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand butts of ſtrong beer were ſupplied by two brewers. Five thouſand chaldrons of coals were purchaſed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some eſtimate of the expenſe of the whole may be formed, from that of the trifling arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of vegetables, caſks and vinegar, which amounted to little leſs than 22,000<abbr>l.</abbr> and the articles of hay, oats, and beans, for a ſingle regiment of light cavalry, to nearly as much more. Beſides all this enormous expenſe, and the charge of flour, corn, and ſalted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, near half a million of money was expended in the purchaſe of Spaniſh and Portugueſe coin for the extraordinary and contingent articles in various branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the military operations. In fine, the expenſe in every article, was ſwelled to the utmoſt.</p>
                     <p>It was not without reaſon ſuppoſed, in Britain, that by ſuch unbounded ſupplies, the troops would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to health and ſpirits, and the general complaint ſilenced, that had for ſome time prevailed, concerning the bad and unwholeſome quality of the proviſions with which they had been ſupplied. But things turned out, however, in a manner directly oppoſite to every expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this kind. After every delay in fitting out had been ſurmounted, the veſſels were detained for a long time on the coaſt of Britain, or toſſed about by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds in the channel, until the greater part of the live ſtock, particularly the ſheep, periſhed; ſo that the ſea was every where ſtrewed with their carcaſes. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds and ſtormy weather purſued them on their voyage in the mid ſeas; and as they approached the place of their deſtination, the wind blew full in their teeth and drove them off the coaſts. Several of them were blown to the Weſt India Iſlands in great diſtreſs; others, entangled with the American coaſts, were either taken at ſea, or in the harbours and creeks where they put in for ſhelter. A few arrived at Boſton, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been beat about in ſtormy ſeas for three or four months, with their cargoes almoſt entirely ſpoilt, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028963_0197_0FDDBEE080466770"/>a very inconſiderable portion of refreſhments to the troops, after having been purchaſed at ſuch an enormous coſt.</p>
                     <p>The diſaſters which attended the Boſton tranſports ſeemed alſo to have waited on the Newfoundland fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery for the year 1775. It did not at all realize the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectations of the miniſtry with reſpect to its eaſy tranſlation from America to Britain. The Americans, by cutting off all ſupplies of proviſions from the ſhips employed in the fiſhery, threw every thing into diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. So that by ſending off a number of ſhips to Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for proviſions, ſuch a neglect was occaſioned in the fiſhery, that the value of more than half a million ſterling of the uſual produce was left in the bowels of the deep.</p>
                     <p>A dreadful tempeſt, likewiſe, which diſcharged itſelf chiefly on the ſhores of Newfoundland, contributed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> render abortive the ſucceſs of thoſe who remained. The ſea is ſaid to have riſen, almoſt inſtantaneouſly thirty feet above its level. Upwards of ſeven hundred boats, with a number of ſhips, with all on board, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in the ocean, whilſt the waves, ſurpaſſing their uſual bounds ſo far, overwhelmed every thing with a rapid and unavoidable deſtruction. The ſhores pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a ſhocking ſpectacle for ſome time after, and the fiſhing nets were hauled up loaded with dead bodies. Theſe diſaſters were, by ſome, aſcribed to the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate vengeance of the Deity on the oppoſite party.</p>
                     <p>The accumulated misfortunes of the Britiſh, as they gave new life and ſpirit to the coloniſts, could not but add greatly to the diſtreſſes of the troops and inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants blocked up in Boſton. The Britiſh had the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to ſee a number of the tranſports taken in the very entrance of the harbour, whilſt, from various cauſes, the ſhips of war were prevented from affording them any relief: thus the American camp obtained
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028963_0197_0FDDBEE080466770"/>the ſtores and neceſſaries which had been deſtined for the ſuſtenance and uſe of their enemies.</p>
                     <p>In order to ſupply the troops in Boſton with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, it had been found neceſſary to carry on a kind of predatory war. In the courſe of which, the town of Falmouth, in Maſſachuſetts Bay, having given ſome offence relative to the loading of a maſt ſhip, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the flames. The officer, captain Mowat, is ſaid to have declared he had orders for burning all the towns on the coaſt between Boſton and Halifax. However, he gave the people time to remove their families from the danger, which, under pretence of a negociation for delivering up their arms, was length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened out till next morning; during which time, they had removed the greateſt part of their effects. About nine in the morning, on the 18th of October, on their refuſal to deliver up their arms, and ſome carriage guns, a violent diſcharge of cannon and mortars took place, from four armed veſſels. Above three thouſand ſhot, beſides bombs and careaſes, were thrown into the town, by which the principal part of it, lying next the water, and conſiſting of 130 dwelling houſes, and 278 warehouſes, together with the church, a new handſome court-houſe, the old town-houſe, and public library, were reduced to aſhes. About one hundred of the worſt houſes, favoured by their ſituation and diſtance, eſcaped without damage. This produced an alarm on the ſea coaſt, and occaſioned many to move with their families and effects farther into the country, but had no tendency to procure the ſubmiſſion of the people to the power and mercy of the armed Britiſh agents.</p>

                     <p>The firſt hoſtilities that happened in New York, commenced in the month of Auguſt. The New York convention having reſolved upon the removal of the cannon from the battery of that city, captain Sears w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>This affair happened between twelve o'clock at night and two in the morning, and threw the inhabitants into the utmoſt conſternation. The diſtreſs of the New Yorkers was very much increaſed by a painful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that captain Vandeput would renew his firing upon the city. A removal of men, women, children, and goods commenced, and continued for ſome time. Matters were however ſo far adjuſted, as to quiet the apprehenſions of the people, in reference to their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering farther from the fire of the Aſia. To prevent it, the convention permitted Abraham Lott, <abbr>eſq</abbr> to ſupply the king's ſhips, ſtationed at New York, with all neceſſaries, as well freſh as ſalted, for the uſe of thoſe ſhips.</p>
                     <p>In the month of November, the general aſſembly of Rhode Iſland paſſed an act for the capital puniſhment of perſons, who ſhould be found guilty of holding a traitorous correſpondence with the miniſtry of Great Britain, or any of their officers or agents, or of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miniſterial army or navy, employed againſt the United Colonies, with proviſions, arms, &amp;c. or of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as pilots on board any of their veſſels. They alſo paſſed an act for ſequeſtering the eſtates of ſeveral perſons, whom they conſidered as avowed enemies to the liberties of America.</p>
                     <p>Hoſtilities commenced in Georgia, between the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite parties, about the middle of November, when a number of royaliſts attacked the Americans, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them after three days, to ſurrender a fort they had taken poſſeſſion of, in which they expected to make an effectual reſiſtance.</p>

By or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of congreſs, therefore, 3000 men were put under the command of generals Montgomery and Schuyler, to whom were committed the management of their military arrangements in the northern department, with orders to proceed to Lake Champlain, from whence they were to be conveyed in flat bottomed boats to the mouth of the river Sorel, a branch of the great river St. Lawrence, and on which is ſituated a fort of the ſame name with the river. On the other hand, they were oppoſed by general Carleton, governour of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, a man of great activity and experience in war, who, with a very few troops, had hitherto been able to keep in awe the diſaffected people of Canada, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the repreſentations of the coloniſts.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as general Montgomery arrived at Crown Point, he received information that ſeveral arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed veſſels were ſtationed at St. John's, a ſtrong fort on the Sorel, with a view to prevent his croſſing the lake, on which he took poſſeſſion of an iſland which commands the mouth of the Sorel, and by which he could prevent them from entering the lake. In conjunction with general Schuyler, he next proceeded to St John's: but finding that place too ſtrong, it was agreed in a council of war, to retire to Iſle aux Noix, where general Schuyler being taken ill, Montgomery was left to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand alone.

"This deliverance of Quebeck," ſays Dr. Ramſay, "may be conſidered as a proof how much may be done by one man for the preſervation of a country. It alſo proves that ſoldiers may in a ſhort time be formed out of the maſs of citizens."</p>
                     <p>The conduct and courage of general Carleton in the defence of his province, and the behaviour of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, met with deſerved applauſe; nor could the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the American troops be exceeded. They had fought under as great diſadvantages as thoſe which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Britiſh at Bunker's hill, and had behaved equally well, although unſucceſsful. Such a terrible difaſter left no hope remaining of the accompliſhment of their purpoſe, as the force under general Arnold was now greatly reduced. He did not, however, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the province, or even remove to a greater diſtance than three miles from Quebeck.</p>
                     <p>The provincials ſtrengthened their camp in the beſt manner they could, being apprehenſive of an attack from the garriſon. As there were few regular troops in the place, however, general Carleton did not chuſe to venture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Arnold, indeed, in his preſent ſituation, diſcovered an amazing vigour of mind as well as perſeverance in his enterpriſe. Though the ſeverity of the winter was far beyond any thing they had hitherto experienced the ſnow lying four feet deep on a level, he made a ſhift not only to keep his troops together, but to render them formidable. An expreſs was diſpatched to general Wooſter, who was at Montreal, to come with a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, and aſſume the command; but as this could not be inſtantly done, he bore up, with the ſmall force he had, againſt the difficulties which ſurrounded him, and by obſtructing the ſupplies of proviſions and other,

                     <p>The people now held frequent aſſemblies. Some of them took up arms with a deſign to force the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernour to reſtore the powder, and to take the public money into their own poſſeſſion; but on their way to Williamſburg for this purpoſe, they were met by the receiver general, who became ſecurity for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the gunpowder, and the inhabitants promiſed to take care of the magazine and public revenue.</p>

                     <p>In this ſtate of confuſion the governour thought it neceſſary to fortify his palace with artillery, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a party of marines to guard it.

<note place="margin">1776, <hi>March.</hi>
                        </note> Thus matters contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued till the month of March 1776, when the town was evacuated.</p>
                     <p>General Waſhington opened a battery on the weſt ſide of the town, from whence it was bombarded, with a heavy fire of cannon at the ſame time; and three days after, it was attacked by another battery from the eaſtern ſhore. This terrible attack continued for 14 days without intermiſſion; when general Howe, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place no longer tenable, determined if poſſible to drive the enemy from their works. Preparations were therefore made for a moſt vigorous attack, on a hill called Dorcheſter Neck, which, during one night, the Americans had fortified in ſuch a manner as would in all probability have rendered the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe next to deſperate. No difficulties, however, were ſufficient to daunt the ſpirit of the general; and every thing was in readineſs, when a ſudden ſtorm prevented an exertion which muſt have been productive of a dreadful waſte of blood. Next day, upon a more cloſe inſpection of the works they were to attack, it was thought adviſable to deſiſt from the enterpriſe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The fortifications were very ſtrong, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well provided with artillery; and, beſides other implements of deſtruction, upwards of 100 hogſheads of ſtones were provided to roll down upon the enemy as they came up; which, as the aſcent was extremely ſteep, muſt have done prodigious execution.</p>
                     <p>Nothing therefore now remained but to think of a retreat; and even this was attended with the utmoſt difficulty and danger. The Americans, however, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was in the power of the Britiſh general to reduce the town to aſhes, which could not have been
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028963_0207_0FDDBEFED2FDA220"/>repaired in many years, and being told by four of the ſelectmen, who were allowed to go to the American camp, that general Howe did not intend to burn the town unleſs he was impeded in his embarkation, did not think proper to give the leaſt moleſtation; and for the ſpace of a fortnight the troops were employed in the evacuation of the place, from whence they carried along with them 2000 of the inhabitants, who durſt not ſtay, on account of their attachment to the Britiſh cauſe. Several ſhips were left behind, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect ſuch veſſels as ſhould arrive from Britain; and the fortifications of Caſtle William were blown up, leſt the Americans ſhould, by their means, lock up the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

From Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton they ſailed to Halifax; but all their vigilance could not prevent a number of valuable ſhips from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the hands of the Americans. During the embarkation of the rear of the royal army, general Waſhington marched into the town of Boſton with all the parade of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>March</hi> 17.</note> and was received by the inhabitants, who now recovered their liberty, with every poſſible mark of gratitude and reſpect, as their deliverer. He likewiſe received the public thanks of the aſſembly of the province. Being apprehenſive however, that general Howe, who had rather more than 7000 men embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might make ſome attempt on New York, he that very day ſent off ſome regiments for the defence of the place, under the conduct of general Lee. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of cannon and ammunition had alſo been left at Bunker's Hill and Boſton Neck; and in the town, an immenſe variety of goods, principally woollen and linen, of which the provincials ſtood very much in need. Some ſhops, it is ſaid, were opened and ſtripped of their goods by the ſoldiers; part w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Theſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities were forbidden in orders, and the guilty threatened with death; but nevertheleſs much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief was committed. The eſtates of thoſe who fled to Halifax were confiſcated; as alſo thoſe who were attached to government, and had remained in the town.</p>
                     <p>As an attack was expected as ſoon as the Britiſh forces ſhould arrive, every method was employed to render the fortifications, already very ſtrong, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. For this purpoſe, ſome foreign engineers were employed, who had before arrived at Boſton; and ſo eager were people of all ranks to accompliſh this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that every able bodied man in the place, without diſtinction of rank, ſet apart two days in the week, to complete it the ſooner.</p>

The cauſe of the Americans had received ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful aid from many patriotic publications in their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes, and from the fervent exhortations of popular preachers, connecting the cauſe of liberty with the principles of religion, that it was determined to employ theſe two powerful inſtruments, printing and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to operate on the minds of the Canadians. A complete apparatus for printing, together with a printer and a clergyman, were therefore ſent into Canada.</p>
                     <p>Theſe powerful auxiliaries were, however, of no avail. Reinforcements had been promiſed to general Arnold, who ſtill continued the blockade of Quebeck; but they did not arrive in time to ſecond his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Being ſenſible, however, that he muſt either deſiſt from the enterpriſe, or finiſh it ſucceſsfully, he recommenced in form; attempting to burn the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and even to ſtorm the town itſelf. The provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials were unſucceſsful, by reaſon of the ſmallneſs of their number, though they ſucceeded ſo far as to burn a number of houſes in the ſuburbs; and the garriſon were obliged to pull down the remainder, in order to prevent the ſire from ſpreading.</p>
                     <p>As the provincials, though unable to reduce the town, kept the garriſon in continual alarms, and in a very diſagreeable ſituation,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>March</hi> 25.</note> ſome of the nobility collected themſelves into a body under the command of one Mr. Beaujeu, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to relieve the capital; but they were met on their march, and ſo entirely defeated, that they were never afterwards able to attempt any thing.</p>
                     <p>By the firſt of May ſo many new troops had arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the American army, in name, amounted to 3000; but they had little reaſon to plume themſelves on their ſucceſs or augmented numbers. Their want of artillery at laſt convinced them, that it was imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable in their ſituation to reduce a place ſo ſtrongly
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028963_0209_0FDDBF0165BD4528"/>fortified; the ſmall pox at the ſame time made its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in their camp, and carried off great numbers; intimidating the reſt to ſuch a degree, that they deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in crowds. The affections of the Canadians were likewiſe alienated by the rapacity and love of plunder which led many of the invading army to practices, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to themſelves, and injurious to the cauſe in which they had taken up arms. To add to their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, the Britiſh reinforcements unexpectedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and the ſhips made their way through the ice with ſuch celerity, that the one part of their army was ſeparated from the other, and general Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 6.</note> ſallying out as ſoon as the reinforcement was landed, obliged them to fly with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt precipitation, leaving behind them all their cannon and military ſtores; at the ſame time that their ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping was entirely captured by veſſels ſent up the river for that purpoſe. On this occaſion the provincials fled ſo faſt that they could not be overtaken; ſo that none fell into the hands of the Britiſh, excepting the ſick and the wounded.</p>
                     <p>The humanity and generoſity of general Carleton met with no leſs applauſe, on this proſperous turn in his favour, than what he acquired by the brave and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious defence he had made, whilſt every thing ſeemed to conſpire againſt him. A number of the ſick and wounded Americans were ſcattered about in the woods and villages, not only deſtitute of every comfort neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in their miſerable ſituation, but in the utmoſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of periſhing for want. To prevent the melancholy fate which threatened theſe unfortunate men, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious general iſſued a proclamation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their doubts and fears,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 10.</note> engaging "that they ſhould have relief and aſſiſtance at the public expenſe;" at the ſame time aſſuring them, "that as ſoon as they were recovered, they ſhould have free
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028963_0209_0FDDBF0165BD4528"/>liberty to depart." "This humane line of conduct," ſays Dr. Ramſay, was more injurious to the views of the leaders in the American councils, than the ſeverity practiſed by other Britiſh commanders. The truly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic, as well as humane general Carleton, diſmiſſed theſe priſoners, after liberally ſupplying their wants, with a recommendation, "to go home, mind their farms, and keep themſelves and their neighbours from all participation in the unhappy war."</p>
                     <p>It was during this calamitous ſtate of affairs that congreſs were ſeriouſly deliberating upon a final ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from Great Britain. And, at length, in the month of July, the declaration of independence was publiſhed. A particular account of this momentous tranſaction will be given hereafter. In the mean time we ſhall go on with an account of the northern cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh general, now freed from any danger of an attack, was ſoon enabled to act offenſively againſt the provincials, by the arrival of the forces deſtined for that purpoſe from Britain. By theſe he was put at the head of about 13,000 men, among whom were thoſe of Brunſwick. With this force he inſtantly ſet out to the Three Rivers, where he expected that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold would have made a ſtand; but he had retired to Sorel, a place 150 miles diſtant from Quebeck, where he was at laſt met by the reinforcements ordered by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. Here, though the preceding events were by no means calculated to inſpire much military ardour, a very daring enterpriſe was undertaken; and this was, to ſurpriſe the Britiſh troops poſted here under generals Fraſer and Neſbit; of whom the former commanded thoſe on land, the latter ſuch as were on board of tranſports, and were but a little way diſtant. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe was undoubtedly very hazardous, both on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſtrength of the parties againſt whom they
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028963_0210_0FDDBF0321DFA180"/>were to act, and as the main body of the Britiſh forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were advanced within 50 miles of the place; beſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was thought that they would have made ſome reſiſtance at Nut Iſland, the entrance to Lake Champlain; but this alſo they had abandoned, and retreated acroſs the lake to Crown Point, whither they could not be immediately followed. Thus was the province of Canada entirely evacuated by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans; whoſe loſs in their retreat from Quebeck was not calculated at leſs than 1000 men, of whom 400 fell at once into the hands of the enemy at a place called the Cedars, about 50 miles above Montreal, by the bad conduct of colonel Cole and major Butterfield, who eſcaped deſerved puniſhment, and were only caſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iered and diſgraced. General Sullivan, however, who conducted this retreat after the affair of general Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had great merit in what he did, and received the thanks of congreſs accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Great numbers of Canadians had taken a decided part with the Americans; and although congreſs had aſſured them but a few months before, "that they would never abandon them to the fury of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies," the provincial commanders were, from the neceſſity of the caſe, forced to leave them to the mercy of that government againſt which they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. A ſhort time before the Americans evacuated Canada, general Arnold was buſily employed in plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the merchants of Montreal, under pretence of ſupplying the army. And "his nephew, ſoon after, opened a ſtore at Albany, and publicly diſpoſed of goods which had been procured at Montreal."</p>
                     <p>General Sullivan left the northern army on the 12th of July, and was ſucceeded by general Gates. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Sullivan's return of the troops ſerving in Canada was 7006. It appears that the whole loſs ſuſtained by the provincials at Quebeck, Three Rivers, Cedars, the conſequent retreat from Canada, together with deaths and deſertions which happened from the firſt of April,

<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028963_0211_0FDDBF0467F6C620"/>from other motives, made no reſiſtance. Commodore Banks lay a few miles off with his men of war, in ſight; and his boats might ſoon have been up with the ſhip. The captain of the Hope, ſenſible of this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, gave orders to his men to cut the topfail hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liards and ties. Mugford heard the orders, and knew the conſequence of executing them—that the ſailing of the ſhip would be ſo long prevented, that the men of war's boats would recover her. He therefore open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a volley of oaths and execrations, and, in the moſt horrid manner, threatened the captain and every man on board with immediate death if the orders were executed, upon which the captain was ſo terrified as to deſiſt. After taking poſſeſſion of his prize, Mugford was joined by two other ſmall cruiſers, who aſſiſted in carrying her ſafe through Pudding Point Gut.

                     <p>Two days after this exploit, Mugford's cruiſer and another in company were attacked, when at anchor in Pudding Point Gut, by thirteen boats from the men of war at Nantaſket.

                     <p>Commodore Banks, omitting to leave cruiſers in the bay, after he was forced to leave Nantaſket, afforded an opportunity to the American privateers of taking a number of Highlanders. Three days after his quitting it,

To the chiefs of theſe people commiſſions were ſent, in order to raiſe ſome regiments; and a colonel Macdonald was appointed to command them.

The Americans, ſenſible of their danger, diſpatched immediately what forces they had to act againſt the royaliſts, at the ſame time that they diligently exerted themſelves to ſupport theſe with ſuitable reinforcements. Their preſent force was commanded by a general Moore, whoſe numbers were inforior <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The three frigates were ordered to take their ſtation between Charleſton and the fort, in order to enſilade the batteries, and cut off the communication with the main land; but through the ignorance of the pilots they all ſtuck faſt; and though two of them were diſentangled, they were found to be totally unfit for ſervice: the third was burnt, that ſhe might not fall into the hands of the provincials.</p>
                     <p>The attack was therefore confined to the Briſtol, Experiment, the three armed veſſels, and the bomb ketch, between whom and the fort a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Americans on this occaſion juſtly boaſted of their heroes. A ſerjeant, obſerving the flag ſtaff ſhot away in the beginning of the action, jumped from one of the embraſures upon the beach, took up the flag, and fixing it upon a ſponge ſtaff, put it in its proper place, in the midſt of the dreadful fire already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.

                     <p>The thanks of congreſs were given to general Lee, and alſo to colonels Moultrie and Thomſon for their good conduct in this memorable action. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to the commanding officer, the fort from that time was called Fort Moultrie.</p>
                     <p>This year alſo, the Americans, having ſo frequently made trial of their valour by land, became deſirous of trying it by ſea alſo, and of forming a navy that might in ſome meaſure be able to protect their trade, and do eſſential hurt to the enemy. In the beginning of March, Commodore Hopkins was diſpatched with two ſhips, two brigs, and a ſloop to the Bahama Iſlands, where he made himſelf maſter of the ordnance and military ſtores; but the gunpowder, which had been the principal object, was removed.

<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028963_0216_0FDDBF0C1740A300"/>have been prodigious; ſince there were conveyed over land, and dragged up the rapids of St. Lawrence, no fewer than thirty large long boats, 400 batteaux, beſides a vaſt number of flat-bottomed boats, and a gondola of 30 tons. The intent of the expedition was to puſh forward, before winter, to Albany, where the army would take up its winter quarters, and next ſpring ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a junction with that under general Howe, when it was not doubted that the united force and ſkill of theſe two commanders would ſpeedily put a termination to the war.</p>
                     <p>By reaſon of the difficulties with which the equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this fleet had been attended; it was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of October before the expedition could be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.

It conſiſted of the Inflexible, a large veſſel with three maſts, carrying 18 twelve pounders; two ſchooners, the one carrying 14, the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er 12 ſix pounders; a large flat-bottomed radean with 6 twenty four and 6 twelve pounders; and a gondola with 8 nine pounders. Beſides theſe, were 20 veſſels of a ſmaller ſize, called <hi>gun-boats,</hi> carrying each a piece of braſs ordnance from nine to twenty four pounders, or howitzers. Several long boats were fitted out in the ſame manner; and beſides all theſe, there was a vaſt number of boats and tenders of various ſizes to be uſed as tranſports for the troops and baggage. It was man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a number of ſelect ſeamen, and the guns were to be ſerved by a detachment from the corps of artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; the officers and ſoldiers appointed for this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were alſo choſen out of the whole army.

                     <p>To oppoſe this formidable armament, the Americans had but an inconſiderable naval force, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of general Arnold. It conſiſted of a ſchooner

As Britain, therefore, had uniformly rejected their entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and now abandoned them to plunder without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, except on unconditional ſubmiſſion, it was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by war alone that their object was to be gained.</p>
                     <p>Another weighty conſideration was, that as long as they acknowledged the ſupremacy of Great Britain, their councils and generals would be equally deſtitute of authority civil or military;—the war they carried on muſt be feeble, irregular, and unſucceſsful;—orders would be given which nobody would obey, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies and mutinies formed which none could have a juſt power to puniſh or repreſs. Neither would any foreign power ſupport them againſt the hoſtile attempts of Great Britain, as long as they held themſelves to be her ſubjects.

<note n="*" place="bottom">Publiſhed in 1775.</note> the neceſſity, practicability and advantages of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. He obſerved that every body allowed it would inevitably happen at ſome future period; and urged ſeveral reaſons to evidence that the moment was
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028963_0219_0FDDBF1096748518"/>at hand. That no lurking affection for the ſovereign might impede the meaſure, kingly government and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary ſucceſſion were turned into ridicule. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe brought to his aid ſeveral paſſages in the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, from which he concludes, that the Almighty hath entered his proteſt againſt monarchical government. That the inſtitution of kings was the moſt proſperous invention the devil ever ſet on foot, for the promotion of idolatry. Kings were placed in ſuch a light, as tended not only to deſtroy all attachment to them, but, to make them diſtaſteful, their office was attempted to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered odious; from whence the tranſition to the royal perſon was eaſy. Nothing could have been better tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to accompliſh the end in view, than this perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. It was received with applauſe; read by almoſt every American; and recommended as a work replete with truth, and againſt which none but the partial and prejudiced could form any objections. In union with the feelings and ſentiments of the people, it produced ſurpriſing effects. It ſatisfied multitudes that it was their true intereſt immediately to cut the gordian knot by which the colonies had been bound to Great Britain, and to open their commerce as an independent people, to all the nations of the world.</p>
                     <p>Theſe arguments, reſounding from all quarters, ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onded by the enmity againſt the mother country, which was now bred in the minds of the people, ſoon decided the matter. The Maryland delegates were inſtructed to return to congreſs, and act as they found moſt proper for the intereſts of their country. In Pennſylvania it had been fairly debated in their provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial aſſemblies, where it was carried by vaſt majorities that the delegates ſhould agree to the determinations of congreſs: and John Dickinſon, one of the delegates from that province was diſplaced, becauſe he had
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028963_0219_0FDDBF1096748518"/>ſpoken and voted againſt the motion for independency, made in congreſs by Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, on the ſeventh of June.</p>
                     <p>On the firſt of July, congreſs reſolved itſelf into a committee of the whole, upon the ſubject of independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; but neither colonies nor members being unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, it was poſtponed till the next day. After a full diſcuſſion, the meaſure of declaring the colonies free and independent was approved, by nearly an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vote. And the fourth of July, 1776, announced to the world the erection of this new empire.

                                 <p>WHEN, in the courſe of human events, it becomes neceſſary for one people to diſſolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume among the powers of the earth, the ſeparate and equal ſtation to which the laws of nature and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's God entitle them, a decent reſpect to the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of mankind requires that they ſhould declare the cauſes which impel them to the ſeparation.</p>
                                 <p>We hold theſe truths to be ſelf evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among theſe are life, liberty, and the purſuit of happineſs— that to ſecure theſe rights, governments are inſtituted among men, deriving their juſt powers from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the governed; that whenever any form of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment becomes deſtructive of theſe ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboliſh it, and to inſtitute a new government, laying its foundation on ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and organizing its power in ſuch form, as to them ſhall ſeem moſt likely to effect their ſafety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028963_0220_0FDDBF12CAE1D7C8"/>Prudence, indeed, will dictate that government long eſtabliſhed ſhould not be changed for light and tranſient cauſes; and accordingly all experience had ſhewn, that mankind are more diſpoſed to ſuffer, while evils are ſufferable, than to right themſelves by aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the forms to which they are accuſtomed. But when a long train of abuſes and uſurpations, purſuing invariably the ſame object, evinces a deſign to reduce them under abſolute deſpotiſm, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off ſuch government, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide new guards for their future ſecurity. Such has been the patient ſufferance of theſe colonies, and ſuch is now the neceſſity which conſtrains them to alter their former ſyſtems of government. The hiſtory of the preſent king of Great Britain is a hiſtory or repeated injuries and uſurpations, all having in direct object the eſtabliſhment of an abſolute tyranny over theſe ſtates. To prove this, let facts be ſubmitted to a candid world.</p>
                                 <p>He has refuſed his aſſent to laws, the moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and neceſſary for the public good.</p>

                                 <p>He has refuſed to paſs other laws for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of large diſtricts of people, unleſs thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would relinquiſh the right of repreſentation in the legiſlature, a right ineſtimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</p>
                                 <p>He has called together legiſlative bodies at places unuſual, uncomfortable, and diſtant from the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of their public records, for the ſole purpoſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing them into compliance with his meaſures.</p>
                                 <p>He has diſſolved repreſentative houſes repeatedly,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028963_0220_0FDDBF12CAE1D7C8"/>for oppoſing, with manly firmneſs, his invaſions on the rights of the people.</p>
                                 <p>He has refuſed, for a long time after ſuch diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to cauſe others to be elected; whereby the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative powers, incapable of annihilation, have return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the people at large for their exerciſe; the ſtate remaining in the mean time expoſed to all the danger of invaſion from without, and convulſions within.</p>
                                 <p>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of theſe ſtates; for that purpoſe obſtructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refuſing to paſs others to encourage their migration hither, and raiſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of new appropriations of lands.</p>
                                 <p>He has obſtructed the adminiſtration of juſtice, by refuſing his aſſent to laws for eſtabliſhing judiciary powers.</p>
                                 <p>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their ſalaries.</p>
                                 <p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and ſent hither ſwarms of officers to haraſs our people, and eat out their ſubſtance.</p>
                                 <p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, ſtanding armies, without the conſent of our legiſlatures.</p>
                                 <p>He has affected to render the military independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of, and ſuperior to, the civil power.</p>
                                 <p>He has combined with others to ſubject us to a juriſdiction foreign to our conſtitution, and unacknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged by our laws; giving his aſſent to their acts of pretended legiſlation:</p>
                                 <p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>
                                 <p>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment for any murders which they ſhould commit on the inhabitants of theſe ſtates:</p>
                                 <p>

For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>
                                 <p>For impoſing taxes on us without our conſent:</p>
                                 <p>For depriving us, in many caſes, of the benefits of trial by jury:</p>
                                 <p>For tranſporting us beyond ſeas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>
                                 <p>For aboliſhing the free ſyſtem of Engliſh laws in a neighbouring province, eſtabliſhing therein an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary government, and enlarging its boundaries, ſo as to render it at once an example and fit inſtrument for introducing the ſame abſolute rule into theſe colonies:</p>
                                 <p>For taking away our charters, aboliſhing our moſt valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:</p>
                                 <p>For ſuſpending our own legiſlatures, and declaring themſelves inveſted with power to legiſlate for us in all caſes whatſoever.</p>
                                 <p>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war againſt us.</p>
                                 <p>He has plundered our ſeas, ravaged our coaſts, burnt our towns, and deſtroyed the lives of our people.</p>
                                 <p>He is, at this time, tranſporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, deſolation and tyranny, already begun with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of cruelty and perſidy, ſcarcely paralleled in the moſt barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>
                                 <p>He has conſtrained our fellow citizens, taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive on the high ſeas, to bear arms againſt their country, to become the executioners of their friends and breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or to fall themſelves by their hands.</p>
                                 <p>He has excited domeſtic inſurrections amongſt us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the mercileſs Indian ſavages, whoſe known
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028963_0221_0FDDBF1371756850"/>rule of warfare is an undiſtinguiſhed deſtruction of all ages, ſexes and conditions.</p>
                                 <p>In every ſtage of theſe oppreſſions, we have peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for redreſs in the moſt humble terms: our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated poſitions have been anſwered only by repeated injury. A prince, whoſe character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>
                                 <p>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts made by their legiſlature, to extend an unwarrantable juriſdiction over us. We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded them of the circumſtances of our emigration and ſettlement here. We have appealed to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to diſavow theſe uſurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correſpondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of juſtice and of conſanguinity. We muſt, therefore, acquieſce in the neceſſity, which denounces our ſeparation, and hold them, as we hold the reſt of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.</p>
                                 <p>We, therefore, the repreſentatives of the United States of America, in General Congreſs aſſembled, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by authority of the good people of theſe colonies, ſolemnly publiſh and declare, that theſe United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are abſolved from all allegiance to the Britiſh crown; and that all political connection between them and the ſtate of Great Britain is and ought to be totally diſſolved; and that, as free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſtates, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, eſtabliſh commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028963_0222_0FDDBF14EC305120"/>ſtates may of right do. And for the ſupport of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our ſacred honour.</p>

                     <p>On the 8th of July, at twelve o'clock, the declaration of independence was proclaimed at the ſtate-houſe in Philadelphia, amidſt the greateſt acclamations. The next day, in conſequence of general orders, it was read at the head of each brigade of the continental army at New York, and every where received with loud huz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zas, and the utmoſt demonſtrations of joy. The ſame evening, the equeſtrian ſtatue of the king was laid proſtrate on the ground, and the lead of which it was made was doomed to be run into bullets.</p>
                     <p>The declaration of independence was made at a time when no royal governour had even the ſhadow of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in any of the colonies; and when no Britiſh troops had any footing in the United States. A for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable force was indeed collected on the coaſts ready for invaſion, and in face of that armament this deciſive ſtep was taken. The Americans now knew the ground on which they ſtood, and every thing aſſumed a new appearance. The ſophiſtical diſtinctions between the limits of authority on the one ſide, and of liberty on the other, were done away. Every perſon was now able to form his own judgment; the queſtion being ſimply whether America ſhould be conquered or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.</p>
                     <p>The inſtitution of new forms of government began
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028963_0223_0FDDBF167968A3D8"/>to take place in the different ſtates, as had been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by congreſs, in the month of May this year. Although the kingly office was aboliſhed, yet, in moſt of the ſubordinate departments of government, ancient forms and names were retained. Each ſtate appointed a ſupreme executive head, with the title of governour or preſident. They agreed, likewiſe, in deriving the whole powers of government, either mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the people.</p>
                     <p>As a farther ſecurity for the continuance of republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can principles, in the American conſtitutions, they agreed in prohibiting any hereditary honours and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of ranks. All religious eſtabliſhments w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> aboliſhed. Some retained a conſtitutional diſtinction between Chriſtians and others, with reſpect to eligibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to office, but the idea of ſupporting one denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the expenſe of others, or of raiſing any one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of Proteſtants to a legal preeminence, was univerſally reprobated. The alliance between Church and State was completely broken, and each was left to ſupport it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf independent of the other. It was ſixteen months after this time, before the plan of confederation was ſo far digeſted as to be ready for communication to the ſtates. Nor was it ratified by all the ſtates till nearly three years more had elapſed.</p>
                     <p>Many difficulties occurred in ſettling the rational contributions from each ſtate. The value of lands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> finally fixed upon as the criterion. The repreſentati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> of the ſtates was not ſo eaſily ſettled, but the large ſtates yielded the point, for the preſent, and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that each ſtate ſhould have an equal ſuffrage; being fearful of weakening their exertions againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy.</p>
                     <p>As a radical change of the whole ſyſtem of the firſt conſtitution took place a few years after the termination of the war, it is neither neceſſary nor conſiſtent with
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028963_0223_0FDDBF167968A3D8"/>the limits of this work to give any account of it. Suffice it to ſay, that it anſwered the purpoſe of the times, "when the citizens of America were young in the ſcience of politics, and when a commanding ſenſe of duty, enforced by the preſſure of a common danger, precluded the neceſſity of a power of compulſion."</p>
                     <p>It is amuſing to recollect, at this diſtance of time, that one effect of independence was an averſion to every thing which bore the name and marks of royalty. Sign boards on which were painted the king's arms, or the crown and ſceptre, or the portraits of any branches of the royal family, were pulled down or defaced. Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and eſcutcheons of the ſame kind in private houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were inverted or concealed. The names of ſtreets, which had been called after a king or queen were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; and the half pence, which bore the name of George III. were either refuſed in payment, or degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to farthings. Theſe laſt have not yet recovered their value.</p>
                     <p>It was not long before the conſtancy both of the rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſubjects of the new empire were to undergo a ſevere trial. Hitherto they had been upon the whole ſucceſsful in their operations: but now they were doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to experience misfortune, miſery, and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the enemy over-running their country, and their own armies not able to face them in the field. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the repulſe the Britiſh had ſuſtained at Charleſton, they appeared off New York, with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable armament. This was compoſed of the fleet and army which had left Boſton, along with the new raiſed forces in Britain, and 13,000 Heſſians and Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deckers. The whole number deſtined to act on this occaſion was not leſs than 35,000 men; though all theſe never were at any time brought into one engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such a force, however, had never before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in any part of America; nor was it perhaps
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028963_0224_0FDDBF8550A72348"/>ever exceeded by any European army of equal number, whether we conſider the goodneſs of the troops, the abundant proviſion of all manner of military ſtores and materials, or the excellence and number of artillery of all kinds. It was beſides ſupported by a very numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fleet, well adapted for the ſervice, conſiſting of ſix ſhips of the line, thirty frigates, beſides other armed veſſels, and a vaſt number of tranſports. The fleet was commanded by lord Howe, and the land forces by his br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>her general Howe, men of approved valour and experience, who had already ſignalized themſelves in the ſervice of their country. General Howe, a conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable time before his brother arrived, had ſet ſail from Halifax, and lay before New York, but without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to commence hoſtilities until he ſhould be joined by his brother. The Americans had, according to cuſtom,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 25.</note> fortified New York and the adjacent iſlands in an extra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner. However, general Howe was ſuffered to land his troops on Staten Iſland, where he was ſoon joined by a number of the inhabitants. About the middle of July,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 14.</note> lord Howe arrived with the grand arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and being one of the commiſſioners appointed to receive the ſubmiſſion of the coloniſts, he publiſhed a circular letter to this purpoſe to the ſeveral governours who had been expelled from their provinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, deſiring them to make the extent of his commiſſion, and the powers he was inveſted with by parliament, as public as poſſible. Here, however, congreſs ſaved him trouble, by ordering his letter and declaration to he publiſhed in all the newſpapers, "That every one might ſee the inſidiouſneſs of the Britiſh miniſtry, and that they had nothing to truſt to beſides the exertion of their own valour."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="unknown:028963_0224_0FDDBF8550A72348"/>
Lord Howe next ſent a letter to general Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; but as it was directed "To George Waſhington, <abbr>eſq</abbr>" the general refuſed to accept of it, as not being directed in the ſtyle ſuitable to his ſtation. To obviate this objection, adjutant general Patterſon was ſent with another letter, directed "To George Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c." But though a very polite recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was given to the bearer, general Waſhington ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſed the letter; nor could any explanation of the adjutant induce him to accept of it. The only intereſting part of the converſation was that relating to the powers of the commiſſioners, of whom lord Howe was one. The adjutant told him, that theſe powers were very extenſive: that the commiſſioners were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to exert themſelves to the utmoſt, in order to bring about a reconciliation; and that he hoped the general would conſider this viſit as a ſtep towards it. General Waſhington replied, that it did not appear that theſe powers conſiſted in any thing elſe than granting pardons; and as America had committed no offence, ſhe aſked no forgiveneſs, and was only defending her unqueſtionable rights. Two days before adjutant gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Paterſon had the above-mentioned interview, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence was ſolemnly proclaimed by the civil authority, as if in defiance of all the then formidable appearances: after which, the king's arms, and an elegant picture of his majeſty, were deſtroyed. Upon thoſe proceedings, the epiſcopal clergy ſhut up their churches.</p>
                     <p>The whole continental army in and near New York, at this critical period,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 8.</note> amounted only to 17,225 men. Theſe were moſtly new troops, and were much ſcattered, ſome being 15 miles apart.</p>

This victory, though complete, was very far from being ſo deciſive as the congreſs imagined. Lord Howe, ſuppoſing that it would be ſufficient to intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the congreſs into ſome terms, ſent general Sullivan, who had been taken priſoner in the late action, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, with a meſſage, importing, that though he could not conſiſtently treat with them as a legal aſſembly, yet he would be very glad to confer with any of the members in their private capacity; ſetting for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But the congreſs were not ſo humbled as to derogate in the leaſt from the dignity of character they had aſſumed. They replied, that the congreſs of the free and independent ſtates of America could not conſiſtently ſend any of its members in another capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than that which they had publicly aſſumed; but as they were extremely deſirous of reſtoring peace to their country upon equitable conditions, they would appoint a committee of their body to wait upon him, and learn what propoſals he had to make.</p>
                     <p>This produced a new conference. The committee appointed by congreſs was compoſed of Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams, and Mr. Rutledge. They were very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely received by his Lordſhip; but the conference proved as fruitleſs as before independency had been declared; and the final anſwer of the deputies was, that they were extremely willing to enter into any treaty with Great Britain that might conduce to the good of both nations, but that they would not treat in any other character than that of independent ſtates. This poſitive declaration inſtantly put an end to all hopes of reconciliation; and it was reſolved to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the war with the utmoſt vigour.</p>

The public ſtores were moved to Dobbs's ferry, about 26 miles from the city. 12,000 men were ordered to the northern extremity of New York Iſland, and 4,500 were left in the city. Before the Britiſh landed, it was impoſſible to tell what place would be firſt attacked, for this reaſon works were erected for the defence of a variety of places, as well as of New York; and theſe were occupied by the remainder of the troops.

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028963_0228_0FDDBF1AD1C31E80"/>generals repaired to the houſe of Mr. Robert Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, a gentleman of the Quaker perſuaſion. The lady of the houſe entertained them moſt civilly, and regaled them with ſome cakes and wine. They were well pleaſed with the entertainment, and ſtayed there rather more than two hours; governour Tryon, ſeaſoning the repaſt, at times, by joking Mrs. Murray about her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican friends, for ſhe was known to be a ſteady ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the liberties of the country. In the mean time the Heſſians and the Britiſh, except a ſtrong corps which had marched to take poſſeſſion of the city, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained upon their arms inactive; which gave general Putnam the opportunity of eſcaping with about 3500 men, including the guards, who had been left to ſhift for themſelves, when colonel Glover had been ordered away from New York. Putnam, in order to avoid meeting any troops that might be advancing upon the direct road to the city, went by the road which lies along ſide the North River, and marched to the end, where it turns off ſhort to the right, and leads on to another and narrower, towards Blooming-dale. By this laſt road he ſecured his retreat; although nothing could have been eaſier than to have prevented his get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into it. A good body of troops, with a couple of field pieces, could have taken ſuch a poſition, in about twenty minutes or leſs, as would have certainly cut off Putnam's retreat. On this occaſion it was ſaid, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourouſly, that "Mrs. Murray ſaved the American army." On the day that general Howe's forces landed and the following one, they took 354 privates and 17 officers priſoners.</p>

The Britiſh general, therefore, deferred all farther at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack till the arrival of more troops, which he expected from New York. Upon the arrival of theſe troops, the Britiſh made diſpoſitions in the evening for attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the provincials early on the laſt of October; but an extreme wet night and morning prevented this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign from being carried into execution. General Waſhington having gained intelligence of this deſign from a deſerter, quitted his camp on the night of the 1ſt of November, and took higher ground towards the North Caſtle diſtrict. One of the provincial colonels, being drunk, ſet fire to the town of White Plains, as well as to the houſes and forage near the lines, unnec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſarily and without orders.</p>
                     <p>General Howe ſeeing that the Americans could not be enticed to an engagement,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nov.</hi> 5.</note> and that the nature of the country did not admit of their being forced to it, determined not to loſe time in a fruitleſs purſuit, and to take this opportunity of driving them out of the ſtrong holds in York Iſland and in the vicinity; an operation which their army could not now poſſibly prevent. In this, the Britiſh general met with complete ſucceſs. The Americans, on the approach of the king's forces, retreated from King's Bridge into Fort Waſhington, which, being attacked in four different places at once, was quickly reduced. The number of priſoners in the fort, and taken in lines, amounted to about 3000. They were conſidered by the articles of capitulation as priſoners of war, and the officers were allowed to keep their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and ſide arms. The loſs of the Britiſh, incluſive of killed and wounded, was about 1200. Shortly after this, lord Cornwallis, with a conſiderable force, paſſed over to attack Fort Lee, ſituated on the Jerſey ſide of North River. The garriſon, which conſiſted
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028963_0231_0FDDBF279477CEA0"/>of 2000 men, was ſaved by an immediate evacuation, but with the loſs of their artillery and ſtores.</p>
                     <p>General Waſhington retreated to Newark, where his whole force conſiſted of no more than 3500 men. It appears he now conſidered the cauſe in the greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The colonel anſwered, "If the lower counties are ſubdued, and give up, the back counties will do the ſame." Upon which the general ſaid, paſſing his hand over his throat, "My neck does not feel as though it was made for a halter. We muſt retire to Auguſta county in Virginia.

Lord Cornwallis having orders not to advance beyond Brunſwick, diſcontinued his purſuit: however he ſent an expreſs to general Howe at New York, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him, that, by continuing it briſkly, he could diſperſe the army under general Waſhington, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028963_0231_0FDDBF279477CEA0"/>Maryland brigades expired, and neither of them would ſerve an hour longer; he therefore wrote to general Lee, "Haſten your march as much as poſſible, or your arrival may be too late." On the 7th of December, lord Cornwallis's corps marched to Princeton, which the Americans quitted the ſame day. The purſuit was followed ſo cloſe, that the Britiſh reached the Delaware,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 8.</note> juſt as the rear guard of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Waſhington's army, under colonel Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, gained the oppoſite ſhore, about twelve o'clock at night. The Americans having taken care to ſecure all the boats, lord Cornwallis, whoſe rear diviſion halted within ſix miles of Trenton, was prevented from croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Pennſylvania next day as he intended. Had lord Cornwallis croſſed into Pennſylvania, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the conſequence would probably have been fatal to the Americans. General Waſhington, when he croſſed, had but 2,200 men: but the time of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice expiring, they left him in ſuch a manner, that the ſecond day after, he had but 1700.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Jerſies were laid entirely open to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of the Britiſh troops, and ſo fully were theſe provinces taken poſſeſſion of by the royal army, that its winter quarters extended from New Brunſwick to the river Delaware: and nothing could have prevented Philadelphia falling into their hands, had they had boats to have tranſported their army. Though they miſſed the boats, yet Trenton and the neighbourhood could have ſupplied materials, which induſtry might have ſoon conſtructed into ſufficient conveniencies for the tranſportation of troops over a ſmooth river, and of no great extent in ſome places. So critical was this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, that general Waſhington trembled for the fate of America, which nothing <hi>but the infatuation of the enemy could have ſaved.</hi>

As the retreating Americans marched through the Jerſies, ſcarcely one of the inhabitants joined them, whilſt numbers were daily flocking to the royal army, to make peace and obtain protection. Not only the common people changed ſides in this gloomy ſtate of public affairs, but ſome of the leading men in New Jerſey and Pennſylvania adopted the ſame expedient.

"The Maſſachuſetts council, inſtead of conforming ſolely to the words in the order, ſent him to Concord gaol; where he was lodged in a dungeon, twelve or thirteen feet ſquare, whoſe ſides were black with greaſe and litter of ſucceſſive criminals. Two doors, with double locks and bolts, ſhut him from the yard, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs prohibition from entering it, either for health, or the neceſſary calls of nature.

When he had tranſmitted an account of theſe and other matters to general ſir William Howe, on the 14th of February, and the ſame had been communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to general Waſhington, a letter was directly written on the 28th, in which the general ſays, "You will obſerve that exactly the ſame treatment is to be ſhown to colonel Campbell and the Heſſian officers, that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Howe ſhows to general Lee; and as he is only confined to a commodious houſe with genteel accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations,

The general, whilſt retreating before lord Cornwallis, had ſent gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Mifflin to Philadelphia to raiſe the Pennſylvania militia. The repreſentations of congreſs, and the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated addreſſes of general Mifflin to his fellow citizens, had the deſired effect, and the yeomanry of the back counties as well as thoſe of the lower, readily came forward in ſupport of the common cauſe.</p>
                     <p>During the royal ſucceſſes in the Jerſies, general Clinton with four brigades of Britiſh and Heſſian troops, with a ſquadron of men of war under ſir Peter Parker, was ſent to attempt Rhode Iſland. It was taken without the loſs of a man; the American force being incapable of making effectual reſiſtance, ſo that on the day when general Waſhington croſſed the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware, the Britiſh took poſſeſſion of the iſland, and at the ſame time blocked up commodore Hopkins's ſquad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and a number of privateers at Providence.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, congreſs proceeded with the moſt indefatigable diligence to recruit their army, and bound their ſoldiers to ſerve for a term of three years, or dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the continuance of the war. The army deſigned

In this allotment it was ſtipulated, that each ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ſhould have 100 acres; an enſign 150; a lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant 200; a captain 300; a major 400; a lieutenant colonel 450; and a colonel 509. No lands were promiſed to thoſe who enliſted only for three years. All officers or ſoldiers diſabled through wounds receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſervice, were to enjoy half pay during life. To defray the expenſe, congreſs borrowed five millions of dollars at five per cent. for payment of which the United States became ſurety. They likewiſe ſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to the court of France, to apply for aſſiſtance,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 10.</note> whoſe negociations will be hereafter mentioned. At the ſame time, in order to animate the people to vigorous exertions, a declaration was publiſhed, in which they ſet forth the neceſſity there was for taking proper methods to inſure ſucceſs in their cauſe: they endeavoured to palliate as much as poſſible the misfortunes which had already happened; and repreſented the true cauſe of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſtreſs to be the ſhort term of enliſtment.</p>
                     <p>This declaration, together with the imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Philadelphia, determined the Americans to exert themſelves to the utmoſt in order to reinforce general Waſhington's army. They ſoon received farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, however, by an exploit of that general againſt the Heſſians. As the royal army extended in different cantonments for a great way, general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, perceiving the imminent danger to which Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia was expoſed, reſolved to make ſome attempt on thoſe diviſions of the enemy which lay neareſt that city. Theſe happened to be the Heſſians, who lay in
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028963_0234_0FDDBF32518B7C50"/>three diviſions, the laſt only 20 miles diſtant from Philadelphia.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 25.</note> On the 25th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, having collected as conſiderable a force as he could, he ſet out with an intent to ſurpriſe that body of the enemy which lay at Trenton. His army was divided into three bodies; one of which he ordered to croſs the Delaware at Trenton Ferry, a little below the town: the ſecond at a good diſtance below, at a place called <hi>Bordentown,</hi> where the ſecond diviſion of Heſſians was placed; whilſt he himſelf, with the third, directing his courſe to a ferry ſome miles above Trenton, intended to have paſſed it at midnight, and attack the Heſſians at break of day. But by reaſon of various impediments, it was eight in the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could reach the place of his deſtination. The enemy, however, did not perceive his approach till they were ſuddenly attacked. Colonel Ralle, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, did all that could be expected from a brave and experienced officer; but every thing was in ſuch confuſion, that no efforts of valour or ſkill could now retrieve matters. The colonel himſelf was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded, his troops were entirely broken, their artillery ſeized, conſiſting of ſix pieces of braſs cannon; and 23 Heſſian officers, and 886 of the ſame nation taken priſoners. About 600 only eſcaped by the road leading to Bordentown. After this gallant exploit, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Waſhington again returned into Pennſylvania.</p>
                     <p>This action, though ſeemingly of no very deciſive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was ſufficient at that time to turn the fortune of wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither force, diſtreſs, artifice, or perſuaſion, had yet influenced congreſs to entertain the moſt diſtant idea of purchaſing peace, by returning to the condition of Britiſh ſubjects. However, affairs appeared ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate about this time, that ſome members, diſtruſtful of their ability to reſiſt the power of Great Britain, propoſed to authoriſe their commiſſioners at the court of France to transfer to that country the ſame monop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oly of their trade, which Great Britain had hitherto enjoyed. But upon mature conſideration, every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of conceſſion was rejected. The more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened members obſerved, that, "Though the friendſhip of ſmall ſtates might be purchaſed, that of France could not." It was therefore ſuppoſed, that the only meaſure, likely to induce France to an interference, would be an adherence to their former reſolution of independence, and proffered freedom of trade to all nations. This they reſolved to do, truſting the event to Providence, and riſking all conſequences. Copies of their reſolutions to this effect were ſent to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal courts of Europe. Theſe diſpatches fell into the hands of the Britiſh, who made no other uſe of them than publiſhing them to the world; which was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing congreſs wiſhed for.</p>
                     <p>On the 27th of December, the congreſs inveſted general Waſhington with almoſt dictatorial power throughout the United States,

                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 27.</note> for the limited term of ſix months, unleſs ſooner determined by their authority. He was empowered to diſplace and appoint all officers under the rank of brigadier general—to reform and new model the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary arrangements, in ſuch manner as he judged beſt for the public ſervice—to raiſe ſixteen battalions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry; 3000 light horſe; three regiments of artillery, and a corps of engineers, in addition to thoſe already voted by congreſs—to eſtabliſh their pay—to form
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028963_0235_0FDDBF34BB8624D8"/>magazines—to take whatever he may want for the uſe of the army, if the inhabitants will not fell it, on pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reaſonable price for the ſame—to enforce the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of continental currency—to preſent the names and offences of the diſaffected, together with the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to prove them.</p>
                     <p>Reinforcements came in from ſeveral quarters to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Waſhington, ſo that he was ſoon in a condition once more to paſs the Delaware, and take up his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at Trenton, where he was emboldened to maintain his ſtation, notwithſtanding the accounts that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the enemy's rapid advance towards him. Lord Cornwallis, accordingly, made his appearance in full force; and, on the evening of his arrival, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle town of Trenton contained the two hoſtile armies, ſeparated only by a ſmall creek, which was fordable in many places. This was, indeed, the criſis of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican revolution; and had his lordſhip made an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate attack, in purſuance of what is reported to have been the advice of ſir William Erſkine, general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's defeat ſeems to have been inevitable: but a night's delay turned the fate of the war, and produced an enterpriſe, the magnitude and glory of which, can only be equalled by its ſucceſs. General Waſhington having called a council of war, ſtated the calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous ſituation to which his army was reduced;
<note place="margin">1777. <hi>Jan.</hi> 2.</note> and having heard the various opinions of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, finally propoſed a circuitous march to Princeton, as the means of avoiding, at once, the imputation of a retreat, and the danger of a battle, with numbers ſo inferior, and in a ſituation ſo ineligible. The idea was unanimouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; and, as ſoon as it was dark, the neceſſary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were taken for accompliſhing it. A line of fires was kindled, which ſerved to give light to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, whilſt it obſcured them from the obſervation of the enemy: and by a providential interpoſition, the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028963_0235_0FDDBF34BB8624D8"/>weather, which had been for ſome time paſt warm, moiſt, and foggy, ſuddenly changed to a hard froſt; and, in a moment, as it were, rendered the road, which had been deep and heavy, firm and ſmooth as a pavement.
<note place="margin">1777. <hi>Jan.</hi> 3.</note> At break of day general Waſhington arriving near Princeton would have completely ſurpriſed the Britiſh, had not a party, which was on their way to Trenton, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried his troops when they were about two miles diſtant, and ſent back couriers to alarm their unſuſpecting fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſoldiers in their rear. Theſe conſiſted of the 17th, the 40th, and 55th regiments of Britiſh infantry, and ſome of the royal artillery, with two field pieces, and three troops of light dragoons. The centre of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, conſiſting of the Philadelphia militia, whilſt on their line of march, was briſkly charged by a party of the Britiſh, and gave way in diſorder. The moment was critical. General Waſhington puſhed forward, and placed himſelf between his own men, and the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, with his horſe's head fronting the latter. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, encouraged by his example, and exhortations, made a ſtand, and returned the Britiſh fire. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, though between both parties, was providentially uninjured by either. A party of the Britiſh fled into the college and were there attacked with field pieces which were fired into it. The ſeat of the muſes became for ſome time the ſcene of action. The party which had taken refuge in the college, after receiving a few diſcharges from the American field pieces, came out and ſurrendered themſelves priſoners of war. In the courſe of the engagement, ſixty of the Britiſh were killed, and a greater number wounded, and about 300 of them were taken priſoners. The reſt made their eſcape, ſome by puſhing on towards Trenton, others by returning towards Brunſwick. The Americans loſt only a few, but colonels Haſlet and Potter, and captain
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028963_0236_0FDDBF3634C2B6C0"/>Neal of the artillery, were among the ſlain. General Mercer received three bayonet wounds, of which he died in a ſhort time. He was a Scotchman by birth, but from principle and affection had engaged to ſupport the liberties of his adopted country, with a zeal equal to that of any of its native ſons. In private life he was amiable, and his character as an officer ſtood high in the public eſteem.</p>
                     <p>During the action in Princeton, the Britiſh in Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton were under arms, and on the point of making an aſſault on the evacuated camp of the Americans. With ſo much addreſs had general Waſhington moved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely off the ground with his whole force, ſtores, bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and artillery, unknown to, and unſuſpected by his adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>That part of the royal army, which having eſcaped from Princeton, retreated towards New Brunſwick, was purſued for three or four miles. Another party, which had advanced as far as Maidenhead, on their way to Trenton, hearing the frequent diſcharge of ſmall arms in their rear, wheeled round, and marched to the aid of their companions. The Americans, by deſtroying bridges, retarded theſe, though cloſe in their rear, ſo long as to gain time to themſelves to move off, in good order, to Plukemin.</p>
                     <p>Affairs now aſſumed a different aſpect. Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis found it neceſſary to return from the Delaware, to the defence of the magazines at Brunſwick. The provincials ſtill avoided any deciſive action; but, in a few days over-ran both the Jerſies and became maſters of the coaſt oppoſite Staten Iſland, at the ſame time that their principal poſts were choſen with ſuch judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it never was found practicable to diſlodge them. The royal army retained only the two poſts of Brunſwick and Amboy, both holding communication by ſea with New York. In th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028963_0236_0FDDBF3634C2B6C0"/>Cornwallis continued during the whole winter very much ſtraitened, the troops undergoing the hardſhips of a ſevere and inceſſant duty, whilſt their numbers were thinned by a continued ſeries of ſkirmiſhes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of little advantage on either ſide, farther than inuring the Americans to military ſervice, and weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the royal army, whoſe numbers could not be replac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame eaſe as the provincials.</p>
                     <p>The bad effects of the late diſorderly conduct of the royal army were now moſt ſeriouſly felt. The ſoldiers, particularly the Heſſians, had given full ſcope to the ſelfiſh and ferocious paſſions of human nature. The inhabitants were cruelly plundered, and in particular inſtances rapes and murders were committed. Such, in all ages, has been the complexion of the bulk of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that immediate and ſevere puniſhments are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly neceſſary to keep them from flagrant enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But it is certain that theſe culprits, in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, eluded puniſhment; either from the relaxation of diſcipline, or the want of due proof to lead to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. The whole province now joined as one man, to revenge their former injuries. Every load of forage and every article of proviſion which did not come from New York, was purchaſed at the price of blood. So hoſtile was the province now become, that ſuch as were incapable of bearing arms acted as ſpies, and watched continually for thoſe who bore them. Thus the Britiſh were conſtrained to act with as much circumſpection as if they had been beſieged by a victorious army, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being themſelves the conquerors. The char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of general Waſhington was exalted to the higheſt pitch among his countrymen, and in Europe he was held in ſuch eſtimation, as to be ſtiled the American Fabius, from the famous Roman general of that name, who defended his country againſt Hannibal with ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="130" facs="unknown:028963_0237_0FDDBF376F970B60"/>
For the cauſe of the decline of the Britiſh affairs, no fault was ever alleged, with the ſmalleſt ſhew of reaſon, on the part of the generats or the troops they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, except the diſorderly conduct of the ſoldiers already mentioned; and which, from the employment of the Heſſians in the ſervice originally, ſeemed to be altogether unavoidable. The ſeverity and inhumanity exerciſed towards the American priſoners in New York, operated powerfully againſt the royal cauſe. General Gates was heard to ſay, "Had general Howe ſeen to it, that the priſoners, and Jerſey inhabitants, when ſubdued, had been treated with as much humanity and kindneſs as general Carleton exerciſed towards his priſoners, it would have been all over with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans."</p>
                     <p>Many other cauſes, however, concurred to retard the progreſs of their arms, during the whole courſe of the war. Among theſe the principal may be ſuppoſed to ariſe from the vaſt extent of the American continent, with its uncommon diviſion into large tracts of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſome cultivated, and others in a ſtate of nature; the great length of ſea coaſt in its front, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe waſtes at the back of the inhabited countries, affording ſhelter to the provincials in all poſſible circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; the numberleſs impregnable poſts, and natural barriers, formed by the various combinations of woods, mountains, lakes, and marſhes. Added to theſe, the Britiſh found, to their coſt, the unanimity of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and the judicious application of their ſtrength, by ſuiting the defence of the country, to the nature, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and ability of the people, as well as to the natural advantages of the country itſelf; thereby rendering pitched battles uſeleſs, and conſining the operations of war entirely to the defence of poſts, making ſurpriſes, and fighting ſkirmiſhes. Add to this alſo, that the people were unfettered by ſtrong cities; ſo that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028963_0237_0FDDBF376F970B60"/>of the capital of a province had little or no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the reſt; and the army could retain no more territory than that which it immediately occupied, which was again loſt as ſoon as it departed to another quarter.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh likewiſe found the unanimity of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies, in the fidelity of their adverſaries to one anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. They very ſeldom had true information of the ſituation of affairs either in the American camps or councils: And perhaps this was not one of the leaſt cauſes of the frequent failure of their enterpriſes. Very few inſtances occurred, eſpecially in the firſt years of the war, of any of the provincial ſoldiers deſerting to the Britiſh. Thoſe who deſerted, generally went to their own homes or elſewhere into the country; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, on the other hand, numbers deſerted to the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, and carried with them ſuch intelligence as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them a favourable reception.</p>
                     <p>During the courſe of this campaign, attempts were made to ſtir up the Indians to make an attack on the back parts of the ſouthern colonies. They were now informed, that a Britiſh force was to land in Weſt Flor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ida; and after penetrating through the countries of the Creek, Chickeſaw, and Cherokee Indians, where they expected to be joined by the warriors of all theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were to attack the Carolinas and Virginia; whilſt another formidable armament, both of ſea and land forces, was to make a powerful impreſſion on the coaſts of theſe provinces. Circular letters to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were diſtributed by a Mr. Stewart, principal agent for Indian affairs, among the back ſettlers, requiring them to repair to the royal ſtandard as ſoon as it ſhould be erected in the country of the Cherokees, ſetting forth the plan of operations, and demanding ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a written declaration of their allegiance, that
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028963_0238_0FDDBF38F6F74618"/>they might be diſtinguiſhed from the enemies to the royal cauſe.</p>
                     <p>With this propoſal, the natural avarice, levity of temper and natural diſpoſition of the Indians, induced them to comply. Even the Six Nations, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly agreed to the obſervance of a ſtrict neutrality, now joined the general confederacy, and committed ſome acts of hoſtility, which, however, were afterwards diſowned by their chiefs. The Creeks began the war in the ſouthern parts with all that violence and barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity which diſtinguiſhes American ſavages; but finding themſelves not ſupported as had been promiſed, they ſuddenly ſtopped ſhort, excuſed themſelves as well as they could to the congreſs, and refuſed to aſſiſt the Cherokees, who applied to them for that purpoſe. The latter were then left to carry on the war alone, which they did for a ſhort time with the utmoſt fury and barbarity. The perpetrators were, however, ſoon checked, and their cruelties fully retaliated. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the adjacent provinces aſſembled, marched into the country of the Cherokees, and not only defeated them in every encounter, but demoliſhed their towns, deſtroyed their corn, and killed ſuch numbers, that the nation being nearly exterminated, the wretched ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors were glad to accept a peace upon any terms the victors choſe to preſcribe; none of the neighbouring nations daring to interpoſe in their behalf.</p>
                     <p>Thus ended, at preſent, all hopes from the aſſiſtance of the Indians. The effects of this expedition were exceedingly prejudicial to the royal cauſe, as it not only excited the utmoſt rancour of the Americans who had revolted, but even the well affected to the Britiſh government themſelves. Such as had on this occaſion declared for the cauſe of Britain, not only to a man expreſſed their abhorrence of ſuch cruel meaſures, but ſome of their chief leaders are ſaid to have avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028963_0238_0FDDBF38F6F74618"/>a recantation of their principles upon that very account.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe tranſactions were going forward in America,
<note place="margin">1776.</note> the people of Britain remained in a ſtate of torpid indifference, expecting daily to hear of the ſubmiſſion of the colonies, from the ſplendid accounts of conqueſt exhibited in the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, and the idea of the extreme imbecility of the Americans, which had been ſo induſtriouſly propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kept up. The high language of authority, dignity and ſupremacy, which had filled the mouths of many for ſome years, fed the vanity of thoſe who could not eaſily define, or who perhaps had never fully conſidered, the extent of the terms, or of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which they were capable of producing; and the flattering idea of leſſening the national burdens by an American revenue, whilſt it was fitted to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the meaneſt capacity, was not leſs ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in its operation upon thoſe of a ſuperior claſs and order. To the powerful principles of national pride and avarice, was added a laudable diſpoſition to ſupport thoſe national rights which were ſuppoſed to be invaded, and a proper indignation and reſentment to that ingratitude and inſolence which were charged upon the Americans, and to which only the preſent troubles were attributed, by thoſe who were moſt active in fomenting the principles of hoſtility, which at that time prevailed, far more than they had done at the beginning of this conteſt.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch circumſtances it is not to be wondered at, if a majority of the people gave at leaſt a kind of tacit approbation to the war; but as it was not attended with national antipathy or rivalſhip, eſtabliſhed enmity, or even a preſent competition for glory, they did not feel themſelves ſo much intereſted in its ſucceſs, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo anxious about its conſequence, as they
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028963_0239_0FDDBF3A5D81A278"/>would in thoſe of another nature. On the other hand, that great body of the people, who had at all times reprobated the meaſures which led to the preſent troubles, and who conſidered them as not leſs danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the conſtitution than ruinous to the power and glory of the nation, could not be ſuppoſed ſanguine in their wiſhes for a ſucceſs which they dreaded as liable to more fatal conſequences than any loſs or defeat. The great diſtance of the ſeat of war, alſo rendered its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects leſs intereſting. For diſtance produces in ſome degree the effect of time with reſpect to ſenſibility; and the ſlaughter, cruelties, and calamities, which would wring the heart, if they happened in the next county, are ſlightly felt at three or four thouſand miles diſtance. The diſtance alſo prevented all apprehenſion of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate danger; the expenſes of the conteſt were not yet ſenſibly felt; and the bulk of mankind never think of remote conſequences. For when, at length, the American privateers not only ſcoured the Atlantic ocean, but ſpreading their depredations through the European ſeas, brought alarm to the coaſt of Britain; when the deſtruction which befel the homeward bound richly laden Weſt India fleets, poured equal ruin upon the planters in the iſlands and the merchants at home; when an account of the failure of ſome capital houſe was almoſt the news of every morning; even in that ſtate of public loſs and private diſtreſs, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual phlegm prevailed, and the ſame tranquil counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and careleſs unconcern was preſerved, by thoſe who had not partaken of the calamity. A circumſtance which is not ſufficiently accounted for, even from the vaſt numbers who thought themſelves officially, or by connexion or principle bound to give countenance to the war, nor the great number of thoſe who profited by its continuance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="unknown:028963_0239_0FDDBF3A5D81A278"/>
Towards the end of the year 1776, the French and Spaniards began to ſhew a ſtrong attachment to the Americans. The continental privateers appeared in great numbers in their ports, and the prizes they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in were ſold openly, and without diſguiſe. The Britiſh court did not think it prudent at that time to puſh matters to extremities with the houſe of Bourbon; they, therefore, only made remonſtrances; the only effect of theſe was, that ſales were made leſs openly. In the Weſt Indies, however, the depredations were carried on to a much greater extent than in Europe, and avowedly patroniſed by all the French colonies. Even French ſhips took out American commiſſions; and, with a few, or ſometimes even no American ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors on board, made war on the Britiſh trade with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity. Letters of marque and repriſal were not granted againſt the inhabitants of the colonies until the ſpring of the year 1777; but the Britiſh ſhips of war took a vaſt number of prizes on their part, though this number was far from being able to balance the value of thoſe taken by the Americans; which during the year 1776, alone, amounted to more than a million ſterling.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the direct loſs by captures, the Britiſh trade ſuffered otherwiſe by the prodigious riſe of inſurance; that upon the Weſt Indies now riſing to no leſs than 23 per cent. The increaſing armaments of France and Spain alſo threatened an approaching war with theſe powers; ſo that towards the end of October, 1776, the king iſſued a proclamation for raiſing the bounty to ſeamen, who enliſted, to 5<abbr>
                           <hi>l,</hi>
                        </abbr> per man. Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen additional ſhips of the line were alſo ſuddenly put into commiſſion; and another proclamation was iſſued, recalling all ſeamen who were in any foreign ſervice. This was quickly followed by two others; the one laying an embargo on the exportation of proviſions
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028963_0240_0FDDBF3BF1083348"/>from Great Britain and Ireland, the other for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a general faſt.</p>
                     <p>The idea of being attacked by the combined powers of France and Spain, whilſt engaged in a conteſt with the colonies, began at laſt to awaken the fears of the people. Suſpicions of plots and treaſons occurred; and theſe were increaſed to a great degree by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of an enthuſiaſtic miſcreant, known by the name of <hi>John the Painter,</hi> but whoſe real name was <hi>James Aitken.</hi> This man was a native of Edinburgh, and bred a painter. Poſſeſſing an extraordinary ſpirit of rambling, with a ſtrong propenſity to vice, he had paſſed in the courſe of a few years through a variety of thoſe ſcenes and adventures which attend the moſt profligate and abandoned ſtate of a vagabond life.</p>
                     <p>Among his other exploits he had paſſed through ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral marching regiments of foot, from each of which he deſerted as ſoon as opportunity ſerved, after receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bounty money. In his various peregrinations through the different parts of England, he alternately committed highway robberies, burglaries, petty thefts, rapes, and worked at his trade, as occaſion invited, villany prompted, or fear or neceſſity operated. At laſt he paſſed over to America, where he remained for two or three years. His being of a melancholy ſolitary nature, which neither ſought for aſſociates in crimes, nor admitted of partners in pleaſure, as it contributed much to his preſervation for ſo long a time from the juſtice of thoſe laws which he was continually break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſerved equally to throw in utter darkneſs all thoſe parts of his life, which he did not himſelf think fitting or neceſſary to communicate. His tranſactions in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica are accordingly unknown, any farther, than that he traverſed, and worked at his trade, in ſeveral of the colonies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="unknown:028963_0240_0FDDBF3BF1083348"/>
As his pilgrimage on the continent, was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and during the progreſs of the troubles, it may well be imagined, that the violence of the language, and ſentiments held in political matters, by that claſs of the people with whom he lived and converſed, gave birth to that madneſs of enthuſiaſm in him, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards filled him with the moſt deadly antipathy to Britain. He accordingly returned to England, and ſoon after, if not originally, adopted the deſign of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſubverting the power of the government and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the ſole machinations of his own induſtry and ingenuity. This arduous taſk was to be accompliſhed by ſetting fire to the royal dock yards, and burning the principal trading cities and towns, with their ſhipping. In the proſecution of this atrocious deſign, he again traverſed a great part of the kingdom, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſtate of the ſeveral docks, and the manner in which they were guarded, which laſt he found as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as could be wiſhed. Having procured all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence he deſired, his next care was to provide fire works, machines, and combuſtibles proper for the execution of his purpoſe; and had it not been for his ignorance in the proper mode of applying or conſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe machines, it is probable that the naval power of Britain might have been irretrievably ruined.</p>
                     <p>One of theſe machines, which extinguiſhed of its own accord, was found in the hemp houſe at Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, which it had failed to ſet on fire. He ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, however, in his deſign of ſetting the rope houſe on fire; but the flames were ſoon ſubdued, without communicating to the other magazines.</p>
                     <p>His next attempt was at Briſtol, where, having failed two or three times in his endeavours to burn the ſhipping,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jan.</hi> 7. 1777.</note> he at laſt determined to ſecure their deſtruction by ſetting fire to the houſes next the qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y. In this he partly ſucceeded. Six or ſeven warehouſes were conſumed; but ſtill the
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028963_0241_0FDDBF4527F7DB78"/>ſhipping remained ſafe. So many attempts, which where abortive, were always diſcovered, and his machines being found, could not but excite the greateſt alarm. It could not be imagined that all this could proceed from the mere political enthuſiaſm of a wretched vag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abond. The two great parties into which Britain was divided, mutually accuſed each other. The moſt big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otted and furious on the one ſide attributed them to the diſaffection and republican principles of the other; whilſt thoſe of the ſame denomination on the other ſide were equally convinced, that they were the mere inventions or malicious acts of the tories, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of blackening their adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>Soon after the departure of this miſcreant from Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, he was taken up on ſome ſuſpicious circumſtances, but behaved with an uncommon air and boldneſs, nor did he appear in any manner embarraſſed in his defence. At laſt he was circumvented by another painter, called Baldwin, an American, who pretended to ſympathize with him under his misfortunes, and to hold principles ſimilar to his own: thus the whole hiſtory of his crimes was brought to light.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dodſley's Annual Regiſter for 1777.</note> "He told Baldwin that he had ſeen Mr. Silas Deane, when he was in France, who had given him ſome money; had encouraged him to ſet fire to the dock yards at Portſmouth, Plymouth, &amp;c. as the beſt means of diſtreſſing Great Britain; and had promiſed to reward him according to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he ſhould do to the American cauſe. He ſaid that Mr. Deane, as an earneſt of what ſhould follow, had given him a recommendation to and bills upon a merchant in London to the amount of 300<abbr>

                        </abbr> which, however, he had found it neceſſary to burn to prevent a diſcovery; and that in conſequence of this encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, he procured a paſs from the French king."

On his trial at Portſmouth, notwithſtanding the ſhock which the appearance and evidence of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended friend againſt him muſt have given, he behaved with the ſame boldneſs and addreſs he had hitherto manifeſted—made a good defence—ſhrewd obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the nature of the evidence, and the baſeneſs of the witneſs—and received ſentence of death with perfect indifference. He was afterwards executed at Portſmouth dock gate, and then hung in chains. "Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condemnation, and before being taken away to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, he denied his having recommendations and bills, and burning the ſame. It was whilſt working at Fitchfield, in Hampſhire, that he conceived the idea of ſetting ſire to the dock yards. He then went, as he ſaid, to France, and applied to Mr. Deane, who told him, that when the work was done he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. He added, that on his return, and after ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fire to the rope yard at Portſmouth, he went to London and waited on Dr. Bancroft, to whom he had a verbal recommendation from Mr. Deane, but that the doctor gave him no countenance, and did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of his conduct."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Gordon, Vol. II. p. 477.</note> He acknowledged his crime, to one of the principal officers at Portſmouth, whom he ſent for, and likewiſe gave ſome cautions with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the future preſervation of the royal dock yards from ſimilar dangers.

                     </argument>
                     <p>AS ſir William Howe now perceived that the army he commanded, however powerful in the field, was far from being ſufficient to effect the conqueſt of ſuch an extenſive and difficult country, or even to keep poſſeſſion of what he had gained, he reſolved to ſtrengthen it by every poſſible method. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028963_0242_0FDDBF465D8DEEE8"/>he collected as many of the refugees as could be perſuaded to enliſt into a body. Over theſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed officers, choſen from among themſelves, who for their attachment to the royal cauſe, had been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to abandon their properties, or who lived under his protection in New York Iſland; governour Tryon being choſen their commander.</p>
                     <p>A commiſſion of brigadier general had been confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on Mr. Oliver Delancy, a loyaliſt of great intereſt in New-York, and he was authoriſed to raiſe three battalions. Every effort was made to raiſe the men, both within and without the Britiſh lines, and alſo from among the American priſoners; but with all theſe exertions, only 597 were procured. Mr. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Skinner, a loyaliſt well known in Jerſey, was alſo appointed a brigadier, and authoriſed to raiſe five bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions; but all that he could raiſe by the middle of ſummer, amounted only to 517; by degrees, however, they were afterwards augmented conſiderably. Theſe new levied forces were to be ſtationed in New York and the adjacent iſlands, in order to give a freer ſcope of operation to the grand army; and allow it to exert its whole ſtrength to effect that for which it was orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inally deſtined; whilſt the vaſt numbers of large riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which every where interſected the country, laid it open to the naval power, to which the Americans had nothing to oppoſe, and by which they were all along exceedingly diſtreſſed.</p>
                     <p>With all theſe advantages, however, it was yet found impoſſible to effect any great or permanent conqueſt. The cauſes formerly mentioned ſtill continued to oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and to militate effectually againſt the royal army, and, indeed, to appearance, muſt have been too powerful for any number of men which Britain could be ſuppoſed to bring into the field. The utmoſt that could now be done, therefore, was to carry on a kind of predatory war,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028963_0243_0FDDBF47F1B8A728"/>and this, however it might diſtreſs particular places, or amuſe the people in Britain with ideas of conqueſt, could never contribute any thing effectual to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation of the country.</p>
                     <p>The provincials formed a plan, about the end of January, for taking Fort Independence, near King's Bridge, and by ſo doing to obtain a paſſage into New York Iſland. About 4000 militia of the Maſſachuſetts, Connecticut, and New York ſtates, in four diviſions, under generals Heath, Wooſter, Parſons, and Lincoln, were deſtined for the ſervice. General Heath, having the chief command, ſummoned the garriſon to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with threats in caſe of non-compliance. Nine days after the ſiege had commenced, the enemy, being reinforced, made a ſally, but were repulſed. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beſiegers retired, upon a report that ſome ſhips had gone up the North River. General Heath was much cenſured for his conduct in this expedition by many of thoſe who accompanied him. His ſummons, as he did not fulfil his threats, ſubjected the army to the ridicule of their enemies. The Americans ſuffered much from the weather, and not leſs from the failure of the expedition. Many of them afterwards croſſed the North River, and proceeded to Morriſtown, where general Waſhington wintered with his ſmall army.</p>
                     <p>About the time this fruitleſs expedition commenced, plundering had become ſo prevalent among the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can troops, that the commander in chief had it inſerted in general orders—"The general prohibits, both in the militia and continental troops, in the moſt poſitive terms, the infamous practices of plundering the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, under the ſpecious pretence of their being tories.

                     <p>It was thought by many a matter of aſtoniſhment, that the Britiſh ſuffered the dangerous interval between the diſbanding of one American army, and the raiſing of another, to paſs away without attempting ſomething of conſequence, againſt the remaining ſhadow of an armed force. Probably general Howe's information of the affairs of the provincials was as defective, at this time, as it had all along been to the royal commanders; or, perhaps, he did not chuſe to run any riſk of derang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miniſterial plan laid down for the campaign, eſpecially his intended junction with general Burgoyne, by making an attack on the American army, which, if not doubtful in its iſſue, he had reaſon to believe, from paſt experience, would at leaſt be attended with great loſs on his ſide.</p>
                     <p>Had general Howe made a quick movement and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the provincials at that time, the event would probably have been fatal to America. The recruiting ſervice went on ſo ſlowly, and was attended with ſo many untoward circumſtances, that general Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, far from being formidable in the month of March, obſerves, in a letter dated the 6th of that month, "If the enemy do not move, it will be a miracle: nothing but ignorance of our numbers, and ſituation, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us." He afterwards owned, that during the latter part of the winter, he and his army remained at the mercy of the royal troops, with ſometimes ſcarcely a ſufficient body of men to mount the ordinary guards, liable every moment to be diſperſed, if the enemy had thought proper to march againſt them. The general's whole force, including militia, at Morriſtown, and the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028963_0244_0FDDBF494E9EDFC8"/>ſeveral outpoſts, amounted often to not more than 1500 men: and it has been aſſerted, upon apparently good authority, that he repeatedly could not muſter more at Morriſtown than between three and four hundred. In writing officially upon the ſubject to the governour and council of Connecticut, the repreſentation he gave of affairs, drew tears from the eyes of thoſe who heard the letter read. Whilſt general Waſhington was at this low ebb with his army, gentlemen of five thouſand pounds fortune or more, and many others who were men of ſubſtance, though not equal to that, did duty as centinels at his doors and elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto there had been a great deficiency of arms and ammunition, as well as of men. Fifteen hundred of the new troops from Maſſachuſetts would have been upon their march to join the army, but the general court could not ſupply them with arms. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity was, however, of ſhort continuance. On the day of its commencement, or the following, a veſſel of 14 guns, from France, arrived at Portſmouth, with 11,987 ſtand of arms, and 1000 barrels of gunpowder. Congreſs, about the ſame time, were under a ſimilar diſtreſs to ſupply general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's army,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>March</hi> 24.</note> and met with timely relief by the arrival of a veſſel with 10,000 ſtand, beſides a great number of gun locks.</p>
                     <p>Though general Howe made no capital ſtroke at the commander in chief of the Americans; yet he concerted an operation againſt the poſt at Peek's Kill, which gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral McDougal occupied, where a conſiderable quantity of proviſions and ſtores was depoſited. A detachment of 500 men, under colonel Bird, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed by the Brune frigate to Peek's Kill,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>March</hi> 23.</note> nearly fifty miles from New York. The provincials, finding themſelves unable to reſiſt, ſet ſire to the ſtores, and the Britiſh ſoldiers completed the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028963_0244_0FDDBF494E9EDFC8"/>conflagration, and deſtroyed ſome ſmall craft laden with proviſions. Colonel Bird, hearing that a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement was expected by the Americans, re-embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame day.</p>
                     <p>The ſtores deſtroyed at Peek's Kill, being found greatly inferior in magnitude and importance to what the general had been led to expect, another expedition was undertaken againſt Danbury, on the borders of Connecticut, and contiguous to Courtland Manor, where it was ſaid immenſe ſtores had been collected. Major general Tryon, aſſiſted by general Agnew and ſir William Erſkine, with a detachment of 2000 men, embarked, paſſed the ſound, and having landed between Fairfield and Norwalk,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 26.</note> reached Danbury in twenty hours: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the country was riſing to intercept his return, and being deſtitute of carriages to remove the ſtores, general Tryon immediately gave orders to burn and deſtroy the whole. The troops accompliſhed theſe orders without injuring the property of ſuch as were reputed tories. 18 houſes, 800 barrels of pork and beef, 800 barrels of flour, 2000 buſhels of grain, 1700 tents, and ſome other articles were loſt to the Americans.</p>
                     <p>The royaliſts, on their return, were haraſſed by mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itia under generals Wooſter, Arnold, and Silliman, who retarded their march, until a greater force could be aſſembled to effect the deſign of cutting off their retreat. Wooſter hung upon the rear of the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whilſt Arnold, by croſſing the country, gained their front, in order to diſpute their paſſage through Ridgefield, nor could the excellent order and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance of the Britiſh forces, which had large covering parties, well furniſhed with field pieces, on their flanks and rear, nor the tumultuary manner in which the American militia, not very numerous, had aſſembled, prevent them from taking advantage of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:028963_0245_0FDDBF4AEA1B4430"/>every ſituation to interrupt the progreſs of the royal army.</p>
                     <p>In one of theſe ſkirmiſhes, general Wooſter, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced officer, was mortally wounded, whilſt fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all the vigour and fire of youth, though then ſeventy years old. He died a few days after, much honoured and regretted by his country.</p>
                     <p>General Arnold, with about 500 men, next oppoſed them in the town of Ridgefield, where, having barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoed the road, he kept up a briſk fire upon them, and ſuſtained their attack till they made a lodgement on a ledge of rocks on his left. After the Britiſh had gained this eminence, a whole platoon levelled at gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Arnold, when not more than 30 yards diſtant. His horſe was killed, but he eſcaped. Whilſt he was extricating himſelf from his horſe, which he did with great agility, a ſoldier ran up to ſtab him with his bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onet; upon which Arnold ſuddenly drew a piſtol, and ſhot his enemy dead as he approached.</p>
                     <p>Next day, the Americans, having received ſome reinforcements with cannon, haraſſed the rear of the Britiſh in ſeveral detached parties, and profited by every difficulty of ground, keeping up a ſcattering fire upon them until they got within protection of their ſhipping.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh accounts ſtate their own loſs to have been only 172 killed and wounded; of which the latter were more than two thirds: and that of the Americans to have been double the number. No officer of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction was loſt on the Britiſh ſide. Three field of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were wounded; one of whom was brigadier general Agnew. The Americans computed 2 or 300 men of the Britiſh to have been killed or wounded; and only 20 killed and 40 wounded on their ſide. Among the former, beſides general Wooſter, was Dr. Atwater, a gentleman of great reſpectability and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and colonel Lamb was among the latter.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:028963_0245_0FDDBF4AEA1B4430"/>Although the Britiſh accompliſhed the object of their expedition, yet the miſchief done to the Americans was not at all equivalent to the trouble and loſs they ſuſtained.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs, in acknowledgment of the merit and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of general Wooſter, reſolved that a monument ſhould be erected to his memory. They alſo reſolved, that a horſe, properly capariſoned, ſhould be preſented to general Arnold, in their name, as a token of their approbation of his gallant conduct.</p>
                     <p>In return for this incurſion, the provincials under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took a ſimilar one againſt Long Iſland, where they were informed that a quantity of forage, grain, and other neceſſaries lay at the little port called Sagg Harbour, protected only by a company of foot and an armed ſchooner.</p>
                     <p>This expedition was conducted by colonel Meigs, a brave and enterpriſing officer, who had attended Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold in his expedition to Quebeck, and had been taken priſoner in the attempt to ſtorm that place. On the 23d of May, he paſſed his detachment of 170 men, in whale boats, over the found which ſeparates Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut from Long Iſland, and landed on the north ſide of the iſland, under the convoy of two armed ſloops, and another unarmed to bring off priſoners; but having a narrow bay to croſs before they could reach the place of their deſtination, they were now obliged to carry their boats acroſs a neck of land before they could reach it. Having ſurmounted this difficulty, colonel Meigs, with about 150 men, landed on the ſouth branch of the iſland, within about four miles of Sagg Harbour, leaving their boats ſecured in the wood under a guard. They arrived at the place before day,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>April.</hi> 24.</note> and ſpeedily accompliſhed their purpoſe, notwithſtanding the reſiſtance of the ſoldiers, and the crews of the veſſels, together with
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028963_0246_0FDDBF4C60420E80"/>the vigorous efforts of the ſchooner, which kept up a continual fire of round and grape ſhot at not more than 150 yards diſtance. Twelve brigs and ſloops which lay at the wharf were burnt, and every thing on ſhore entirely deſtroyed. Six of the ſoldiers were ſlain; and ninety priſoners were brought off, conſiſting of the officer who commanded the men, with moſt of the maſters and crews of the veſſels which they had deſtroyed; and the party returned to Guildford, in Connecticut, in no longer ſpace than 25 hours after they had departed from it, having in that ſhort time traverſed 90 miles by land and water, beſides deſtroying the veſſels, without having a ſingle man either killed or wounded. Colonel Meigs had an elegant ſword pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him by congreſs for his good conduct in this expedition.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon for action was now far advanced, and towards the latter end of May general Waſhington be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat reinforced, quitted Morriſtown, and took a ſtrong poſition at Middlebrook; his army, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, did not exceed 7292 at the opening of the campaign.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 9.</note> Soon after this movement was effected, the Britiſh marched from Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, and extended their van as far as Somerſet court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, but in a few days returned to their former ſtation.</p>
                     <p>The great object of the campaign, on the ſide of New York, ſeems to have been, that ſir William Howe ſhould penetrate through the Jerſies to the Delaware, to clear thoſe provinces of the provincial troops, and reduce the inhabitants to ſuch a ſtate of ſubjection, that a ſafe and open communication between the army and the city of New York might be eſtabliſhed. The ſingle movement which the American general had now made, however, effectually prevented the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this deſign, or indeed of any thing elſe of
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028963_0246_0FDDBF4C60420E80"/>conſequence. His camp, winding along the courſe of the hills, was ſtrongly intrenched, fortified, and well covered with artillery. He commanded a view of the Britiſh encampment on the hills of Brunſwick, and a great part of the intermediate country towards that place and Amboy. His army alſo increaſed daily in numbers. Several bodies of the New England troops under generals Gates, Parſons, and Arnold, advanced to the borders of the North River, where they were ready to paſs over to the Jerſies, whenever there was occaſion; whilſt the Jerſey militia collected with the greateſt alacrity from all quarters; ſo that whatever poſition the royal army could take, it was ſtill watched on all ſides by its enemies. A miſtake, fortunate for the Americans, made the militia aſſemble in great force on this emergency. Signals had been agreed upon, and beacons erected on high places, to give inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous notice of the approach of the Britiſh. A few hours before the royal army began to march, the ſignal of alarm, on the foundation of a falſe report, had been made. The farmers, reſolved to try the effects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in preference to a ſecond ſubmiſſion, with arms in their hands, ran to the place of rendezvous from conſiderable diſtances. They had ſet out at leaſt twelve hours before the Britiſh, and on their appearance were collected in formidable numbers. General Howe left no means untried to induce his rival to quit the ſtrong poſition he had taken. He puſhed on detachments, and made feints as if he intended to paſs him, and croſs the Delaware. This manoeuvre proving ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, he advanced in front of general Waſhington's lines, where he continued for four days exploring the approaches to his camp, and accurately examining the ſituation of his poſts; hoping to find ſome unguarded place, upon which an attack might be made with ſome probability of ſucceſs; or that chance, inadvertence,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028963_0247_0FDDBF532DADB1F0"/>impatience, or error, might occaſion ſome movement or circumſtance, which might lead to a general engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All theſe hopes, however, were fruſtrated. General Waſhington knew the value of his ſituation; and as he could neither be provoked, nor ſurpriſed in ſuch a manner as to oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> him to quit the advantages he derived from it, ſo he had too much penetration and foreſight to loſe them by circumvention or artifice; and he had too long profited by this cautious conduct, of never committing the fortune of America to the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of a ſingle battle, to depart from it on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when it was not even demanded by any urgent neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>General Howe now found it neceſſary to change his meaſures. On the 19th of June, he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retreated with ſome apparent marks of precipitation;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 19.</note> and withdrawing his troops from Brunſwick, took the road with his whole army towards Amboy. The apparently retreating Britiſh, were purſued by large detachments of the Americans, commanded by generals Maxwell, lord Sterling and Conway, who gained ſome trifling advantages; whilſt ſome exceſſes, committed by the ſoldiers during their retreat, inflamed the provincials ſtill more with a deſire of retaliation and revenge. In this, and the former retreat to Brunſwick, farm houſes were burnt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, nor did they ſpare thoſe buildings which were dedicated to the Deity. At laſt, general Waſhington himſelf, with the whole army, left his ſtrong camp on the hills, and advanced to Quibbletown, to be near at hand for the ſupport of his advanced parties. This was no ſooner perceived by the Britiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 24.</note> than he marched back from Amboy with the utmoſt expedition, hoping to cut off ſome of the American detachments, or bring on a general engagement near Quibbletown; or if neither
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028963_0247_0FDDBF532DADB1F0"/>of theſe could be accompliſhed, it was intended, that lord Cornwallis, with his diviſion, ſhould take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable circuit, and thus gain poſſeſſion of ſome ſtrong paſſes, which would oblige the American general to quit the advantageous ground he had taken. In all this, however, he was fruſtrated, through the ſkill and vigilance of his rival. General Waſhington no ſooner perceived the real intent of the enemy, than he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his army from the plains, and with the utmoſt expedition regained his ſtrong camp, ſecuring the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, at the ſame time, ſo effectually, that nothing could be attempted againſt them. Lord Cornwallis, indeed, fell in with lord Sterling, who had poſted himſelf in a ſtrong ſituation with about 3000 troops, who ſeemed inclined to diſpute his paſſage. Theſe were broken, however, in a very ſhort time, with the loſs of a few men and three braſs field pieces; but the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the woods prevented the purſuit from being continued with any effect.</p>
                     <p>General Howe being now convinced that it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to induce general Waſhington to quit his ſtrong poſition, and hazard a general engagement; and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that it would be too hazardous to attempt paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Delaware, whilſt the country was in arms, and the American army in full force in his rear, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make an attempt on Philadelphia by ſea; which muſt be attended by theſe manifeſt advantages, that it would be impoſſible for general Waſhington to know where the ſtorm was to fall. He muſt, therefore, keep his poſt, and the king's army would make a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble progreſs, before he could be in a condition to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them; and ſuch a progreſs would not leave him that choice of poſts from which he had hitherto deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch advantage. In order more effectually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and perplex general Waſhington, the Britiſh general ordered ſome tranſports, with a ſhip cut down
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028963_0248_0FDDBF54A62F15E0"/>to act as a floating battery, up the North River, a little before the embarkation was completed; a feint which ſucceeded ſo far as to induce the American general to detach a conſiderable body of his army acroſs that river.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the preparations neceſſary for this expedition were going forward, the Americans found means to make amends for the capture of general Lee by that of general Preſcot, who was ſeized in his quarters in Rhode Iſland, together with his aid de camp, in much the ſame manner as general Lee had been. This was exceedingly mortifying to the general himſelf, as he had not long before ſet a price upon general Arnold, by offering a ſum of money to any one that apprehended him; which the latter anſwered by ſetting a lower price upon general Preſcot: the latter was, however, exchanged in the following year for general Lee.</p>
                     <p>The month of July was far advanced before the preparations for the expedition againſt Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia were completed;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 23.</note> and it was the 23d before the fleet was able to ſail from Sandy-Hook. The force employed in this expedition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 36 battalions of Britiſh and Heſſians, a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of light horſe, and a body of loyaliſts raiſed at New York. The remainder of theſe, with 17 battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and another body of light horſe, were ſtationed at New York under ſir Henry Clinton. Seven battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions were ſtationed at Rhode Iſland. After a week's ſailing, thoſe forces, amounting in all to about 16,000 men, arrived at the mouth of the Delaware; but there having received intelligence, that the navigation of the river was ſo effectually obſtructed, that no poſſibility of forcing a paſſage remained; or more probably that general Waſhington had marched within a ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Philadelphia; it was reſolved to proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſouthward to Cheſapeak Bay in Maryland, from
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:028963_0248_0FDDBF54A62F15E0"/>whence the diſtance to Philadelphia was not very great, and where the provincial army would find leſs advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the nature of the country than in the Jerſies.</p>
                     <p>The navigation from Delaware to Cheſapeak took up the beſt part of the month of Auguſt, and that up the bay itſelf was extremely difficult and tedious. At laſt, having ſailed up the river Elk, as far as was practicable,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 25.</note> the troops were landed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition at Turkey Point, and ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on their intended expedition.</p>
                     <p>General Waſhington having heard that the Britiſh fleet had put out to ſea after having looked into the Delaware, was confirmed in the opinion he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly entertained, that the whole was a feint, calculated to draw the American army farther from the North River, ſo as to prevent their being at hand to oppoſe a junction between Howe and Burgoyne. With this view, the American general took a middle ſtation; from which he could ſpeedily return to the North Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or advance to the relief of Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt both general Waſhington and congreſs were ſufficiently engaged, by their attention to the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and apprehenſion of the deſigns, of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fleet and army which was conducted by the brother generals and commiſſioners, they were alarmed with the news of general Burgoyne's ſucceſs on the Lakes and the abandonment of Ticonderoga by general St. Clair; which will be hereafter related in the account of the northern campaign. Theſe were events, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, that they could not fail to perplex their counſels, and impede their defenſive preparations in other parts. Congreſs, however, behaved with great firmneſs in this exigency. They directed general Waſhington to appoint other commanders, and to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſuch numbers of the militia from the eaſtern and
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:028963_0249_0FDDBF563864D808"/>central provinces, as he ſhould deem ſufficient for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the progreſs of the enemy.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh fleet, after leaving the capes of Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, were not heard of for near three weeks, except that they had been ſeen once or twice ſteering ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. It was therefore concluded that the object of the Britiſh was Charleſton, in South Carolina, and, as the army could not march in time for its relief, it was reſolved to attempt ſomething on New York Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, or, by uniting with the northern army, to give more effectual oppoſition to Burgoyne; whoſe affairs at this time were in a moſt proſperous train, as will be hereafter deſcribed. Conformably to this ſyſtem, a ſmall change of poſition took place. The day before this reſolution was adopted, the Britiſh fleet had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Cheſapeak; and intelligence thereof reached the American army in a few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Every appearance of confidence was aſſumed by them as they paſſed through Philadelphia, that the citizens might be intimidated from joining the Britiſh; and a number of the principal inhabitants, ſuſpected of diſaffection to the American cauſe, were taken into cuſtody, and ſent to Virginia.</p>
                     <p>Sir William Howe, ſoon after he had landed his troops in Maryland, put forth a declaration, in which he informed the inhabitants, that he had iſſued the ſtricteſt orders to the troops "for the preſervation of regularity and good diſcipline, and that the moſt exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary puniſhment ſhould be inflicted upon thoſe who ſhould dare to plunder the property, or moleſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of any of his majeſty's well diſpoſed ſubjects."
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 3.</note> The royal army ſet out from the eaſtern heads of the Cheſapeak on the 3d of September, leaving their tents and baggage behind, and truſted their future accommodation to ſuch quarters as
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028963_0249_0FDDBF563864D808"/>their arms might procure. They advanced till they were within two miles of the American army, which was then poſted near Newport. General Waſhington ſoon changed the poſition, and took poſt on the high ground near Chadd's Fort, on Brandywine Creek, with an intention of diſputing the paſſage. His army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 14,000 men, but the real effective force that could be brought into action did not exceed 8000; that of the Britiſh amounted to 16,000, when they left New York, but although the whole of theſe were not brought into action, the Britiſh were ſtill ſuperior in number to the provincials. General Waſhington was in a manner obliged to riſk an action for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Philadelphia. The opinion of the inhabitants, though founded on no circumſtances more ſubſtantial than their wiſhes, impoſed this ſpecies of neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>A general action was therefore hazarded. On the 11th of September,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 11.</note> at day break, the Britiſh army advanced in two columns. The right under general Knyphauſen, marched direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Chadd's Ford, which lay in the centre of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican lines, where they expected the principal attack, their right and left covering ſome leſs practicable fords for ſeveral miles on either hand. A heavy cannonade commenced about 10 o'clock on both ſides, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſpoſitions for paſſing the ford were made by the Britiſh general in order to deceive the Americans. This feint had the deſired effect. The American gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, ſuppoſing the whole force of the royal army to be in his front, detached large parties acroſs the river to impede or fruſtrate this deſign, and kept up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſeries of ſkirmiſhes with the Britiſh troops, ſometimes advancing, and at others obliged to retreat, until at laſt they were obliged to retreat with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loſs. In the mean time lord Cornwallis, at the head of the ſecond column, took a large circuit to the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028963_0250_0FDDBF57A8E5D170"/>left, until he gained the forks of the Brandywine, where, from the diviſion of the river, it could be more ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> forded. Having accordingly paſſed both branches about two in the afternoon, he took the ſhorteſt road down the river, in order to fall upon the right flank of the provincials.</p>
                     <p>General Waſhington having been appriſed of this movement, about two hours before, endeavoured as well as he could to provide againſt its effect, by detack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing general Sullivan, with as many troops as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſpare, to oppoſe Cornwallis. This taſk was exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> with great military ſkill. General Sullivan poſted his troops in the ſtrong grounds above Birmingham church, his flanks being covered with very thick woods, and his front with artillery very advantageouſly diſpoſed. The ardour of the Britiſh and Heſſian troops, however, overthrew every obſtacle. The action began about 4 o'clock, and the Americans, after a ſpirited oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were driven from their poſts, and purſued into the woods in their rear. Conſiderable reſiſtance was made by a part of the right wing, which had not been broken. Theſe took another ſtrong poſition in a wood, and were not diſlodged for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>As the main and collected body of the Britiſh army continued to advance; they fell in with a ſtrong party of the provincials which had not been engaged. Theſe had poſted themſelves advantageouſly, in order to cover that wing of the army which had been defeated, and maintained their ground ſo vigorouſly, that they could not be driven from it before the night was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advanced, when the darkneſs prevented the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors from reaping any benefit of their victory.</p>
                     <p>General Knyphauſen, at laſt, after having amuſed the provincials all day, made good his paſſage in the evening, when he found that they were already deeply engaged on the right. He carried the intrenchment,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:028963_0250_0FDDBF57A8E5D170"/>and took the battery and cannon, which defended Chadd's Ford; and at the ſame inſtant, ſome Britiſh troops who had been engaged in the woods, and at laſt made ſhift to penetrate through them, happening to make their appearance, the Americans were thrown into ſuch conſternation, that an immediate retreat or flight took place. General Weedon's brigade, and thoſe under general Green covered the retreat of the flying troops: and nothing but the darkneſs of the night prevented a total and ruinous defeat to the Americans.</p>
                     <p>Though on this occaſion the victory undoubtedly belonged to the Britiſh, it was far from being of that final and deciſive kind, which people had been led to expect in the event of a meeting between the Britiſh and American armies, on nearly equal terms, both as to numbers and the nature of the ground. Such had been the caſe at preſent; and though the Americans were inferior in force, yet the whole day was nearly conſumed before victory was obtained. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans loſt in this action, including officers, 300 killed, 600 wounded, and 400 taken priſoners. Among the latter was the baron de St. Ouary, who ſerved as a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unteer. They alſo loſt ten ſmall field pieces and one howitzer, of which all, but one, were braſs.</p>
                     <p>The loſs in the royal army was not in proportion, being ſomewhat under 500, of which the ſlain did not amount to one fifth. The officers ſuffered conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, eſpecially in wounded, though no one of higher rank than a captain was killed.</p>
                     <p>Here the celebrated marquis de la Fayette firſt bled in the cauſe of liberty, which he had eſpouſed with enthuſiaſtic ardour. His wound was ſlight, but it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared him to the Americans. General Woodford was likewiſe wounded. Monſieur du Coudray, a
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028963_0251_0FDDBF596EF4F348"/>French officer of high rank, and great abilities, was drowned about this time in the river Schuylkill, whilſt on his way to join the American army.</p>
                     <p>The evening after the battle of Brandywine, a party of the Britiſh was ſent to Wilmington, who took Mr. McKinley, the governour of the Delaware ſtate, priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. They alſo took a ſhallop lying in the creek, loaded with the rich effects of ſome of the inhabitants, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the public records of the county, and a large quantity of public and private money, beſides articles of plate and other things.</p>
                     <p>The Americans retreated firſt to Cheſter, and then to Philadelphia, where general Waſhington uſed the utmoſt diligence to repair his loſs. Within a few days he came out with a deſign to riſk another action, and advanced as far as the Warren tavern, on the Lancaſter road. Near that place both armies were on the point of engaging with their whole force,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 18.</note> but were prevented by a ſtorm of rain which laſted for a whole day and night. When the rain ceaſed, the Americans found that their ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was entirely ruined; ſo they retired to a place of ſafety.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh left their poſition near the White Horſe tavern, and began to march towards Reading, where the provincials had a quantity of ſtores, upon which, general Waſhington took a new poſition, and left the Britiſh in undiſturbed poſſeſſion of the roads leading to Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>General Howe having intelligence that general Wayne was lying in the woods with a corps of 1500 men and four pieces of cannon,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 20.</note> in the rear of the left wing of his army, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached general Grey, on the 20th of September, late at night, with two regiments and a body of light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, to ſurpriſe him. Grey gained Wayne's left
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028963_0251_0FDDBF596EF4F348"/>about one o'clock in the morning. Some out ſentries were very early miſſed by an American officer going his rounds, and an alarm being given, the general pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raded them in the light of their fires, inſtead of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing them to the back of their encampment. Thus the Britiſh were directed where to ruſh on with their bayonets, as ordered by their commander. About three hundred were killed and wounded on the ſpot. They took between 70 and 80 priſoners, including ſeveral officers, a great many arms, and eight waggons loaded with baggage and ſtores. The enterpriſe was conducted with ſuch addreſs that the loſs of the aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants did not exceed eight.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs, which after a ſhort reſidence at Baltimore had returned to Philadelphia, were obliged a ſecond time to conſult their ſafely by flight. They retired firſt to Lancaſter and then to Yorktown. Nothing now prevented ſir William Howe from taking poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Philadelphia. He therefore left the bulk of his forces in Germantown, and, with a ſmall part, made his triumphant entry into the city, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with a hearty welcome of numerous citizens,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 26.</note> who, either from principle, intereſt, or cowardice, had hitherto ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the claſs of active whigs.</p>
                     <p>Lord Howe was no ſooner acquainted with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his brother, than he took the moſt ſpeedy and effectual meaſures for conducting the fleet and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports round to the Delaware. The voyage was intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, tedious, and dangerous; and nothing leſs than his ſuperior ſkill and ability, which was exerted in the conduct and management of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> great a number of ſhips, could have prevented the loſs from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; but, as the paſſage to Philadelphia was yet impracticable, the fleet drew up and anchored along
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:028963_0252_0FDDBF5AE5200358"/>the ſhore of Pennſylvania from Reedy Iſland to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle.</p>
                     <p>The firſt object of the Britiſh troops, after taking poſſeſſion of the city, was to cut off, by means of ſtrong batteries, the communication between the upper and lower parts of the river; which was executed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the oppoſition of ſome American armed veſſels; one of which, the Delaware frigate, carrying 36 guns, was taken. The next taſk was to open a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with it by ſea; and this was a work of no ſmall difficulty. A vaſt number of batteries and forts had been erected, and immenſe machines formed like <hi>chevaux de frixe,</hi> from whence they took their name, funk in the river to prevent its navigation. As the fleet now cooperated with the army, this work, however difficult, was accompliſhed; nor did the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials give much oppoſition, as well knowing that all places of this kind were now untenable. General Waſhington, however, took the advantage of the royal army being divided to attack the camp of the principal diviſion of it that lay at Germantown,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 4.</note> in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia. In this he met with very little ſucceſs; for though he reached the place of deſtination by three o'clock in the morning, the patroles had time to call the troops to arms. The morning was likewiſe extremely foggy. This, by concealing the true ſituation of the parties, who made the attack at different places, occaſioned miſtakes, and made ſo much caution neceſſary as to give the Britiſh time to recover from the effects of their firſt ſurpriſe, which the bold attack of the Americans had occaſioned. The latter, notwithſtanding, made a very reſolute aſſault: but they were received with ſo much bravery, that they were compelled to abandon the attempt, and retreat in great diſorder; with the advantage, however, of carrying off their cannon,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:028963_0252_0FDDBF5AE5200358"/>though purſued for a conſiderable way, after having upwards of 200 killed, and about 500 wounded, and upwards of 400 taken priſoners, among whom were 54 officers. On the Britiſh ſide, the loſs amounted to 430 wounded and priſoners, and 70 killed; but among the laſt were general Agnew and colonel Bird, with ſome other excellent officers.</p>
                     <p>There ſtill remained two ſtrong forts on the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware to be reduced. Theſe were Mud Iſland and Red Bank. The various obſtructions which the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans had thrown in the way rendered it neceſſary to bring up the Auguſta, a ſhip of the line, and the Merlin frigate, to the attack of Mud Iſland; but dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heat of action both were grounded. Upon this, the Americans ſent down four fire ſhips, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the whole fire from their galleys againſt them. The former were rendered ineffectual by the courage and ſkill of the Britiſh ſeamen; but during the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement both the Auguſta and Merlin took fire and were burnt to aſhes, and the other ſhips obliged to withdraw. The Americans, encouraged by this unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful attempt proceeded to throw new obſtructions in the way: but the Britiſh general having found means to convey a number of cannon and to erect batteries within a gunſhot of the fort by land, and bringing up three ſhips of the line which mounted heavy cannon, the garriſon, after making a vigorous defence for one day, perceiving that preparations were making for a general aſſault on the next, abandoned the place in the night. Thoſe who defended Red Bank followed their example, and abandoned it on the approach of lord Cornwallis. In the attacks on theſe forts the Britiſh loſt a conſiderable number of men. In that on Red Bank alone, there were not leſs than 400 men killed and wounded; and their leader, count Donop, was mortally wounded and taken priſoner. A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028963_0253_0FDDBF5C21572030"/>of the American ſhipping, now finding themſelves entirely deſtitute of any protection, ſailed up the river in the night time. Seventeen, however, remained, whoſe retreat was intercepted by a frigate and ſome armed veſſels; on which the Americans ran them aſhore and burnt them, to prevent their falling into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's hands.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt ſir William Howe was ſucceeding in every enterpriſe in Pennſylvania, intelligence arrived that general Burgoyne and his whole army had ſurrendered priſoners of war to the Americans at Saratoga, as will be related in the account of the northern campaign. General Waſhington ſoon after received a conſiderable reinforcement from the northern army, which had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed this great event. With this increaſed force he took a poſition at and near White Marſh. At the ſame time the Britiſh general had received a ſimilar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement from New York; and conceiving that general Waſhington, from the diſpoſition of his army, might perhaps incline to venture an engagement, marched from Philadelphia on the 4th of December at night;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 4.</note> and next morning took poſt on Cheſnut Hill, in the front of the right wing of the American army; but general Waſhington, though he ardently wiſhed to be attacked, would not relinquiſh a poſition from which he hoped for repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the adverſities of the campaign. General Howe remained three days in the neighbourhood,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 7.</note> and explored the right and left wings of their camp, ſuppoſing that ſome part of it might be found liable to an attack. Every part was found equally inacceſſible; and though frequent ſkirmiſhes enſued, and the royal army advanced within a mile of the American lines, nothing could entice or provoke general Waſhington to leave his poſition. General Howe, therefore, gave up the thoughts of any farther
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028963_0253_0FDDBF5C21572030"/>attempt for the ſeaſon, as his officers and ſoldiers ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the moſt grievous ſeverities of the weather from the want of tents, and other field equipage; he, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, on the 8th of December, began his march for Philadelphia, in full view of the Americans, without being in the leaſt incommoded on his return.</p>
                     <p>Three days after,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 11.</note> the American army marched from White Marſh to Swedes' Ford, and afterwards to Valley Forge,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 19.</note> on the Shuykill, about 15 miles from Philadelphia, where they remained in huts during the winter. In this march the army might have been tracked by the blood of their feet, upon the hard frozen road, occaſioned by the want of ſhoes and ſtockings. This extreme want of clothing put the general under the neceſſity of granting warrants to impreſs what the holders would not willingly part with, agreeably to the power with which congreſs had inveſted him.</p>
                     <p>About this time the Britiſh fleet at Philadelphia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an alarm of ſo uncommon a nature, that ſome account of it becomes neceſſary. Early in the war, Mr. David Buſhnel of Saybrook, in Connecticut, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a machine for ſubmarine navigation, different from any thing hitherto deviſed by the art of man. This machine was ſo conſtructed as that it could be rowed horizontally, at any given depth, under water, and could be raiſed or depreſſed at pleaſure. To this machine, called the <hi>American Turtle,</hi> was attached a magazine of gun powder, which was intended to be faſtened under the bottom of a ſhip, with a driving ſcrew, in ſuch a way as that the ſame ſtroke which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged it from the machine ſhould put the internal clock work in motion. This being done, the ordinary operation of a gun lock, at the diſtance of half an hour, or any determinate time, would cauſe the powder to explode and leave the effects to the common laws of
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028963_0254_0FDDBF5DA08C2740"/>nature. The ſimplicity, yet combination diſcovered in the mechaniſm of this wonderful machine, have been acknowledged by thoſe ſkilled in phyſics, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly hydraulics, to be not leſs ingenious than novel. Mr. Buſhnel invented ſeveral other curious machines for the annoyance of the Britiſh ſhipping, but from accidents, not militating againſt the philoſophical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, on which their ſucceſs depended, they but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially ſucceeded. He deſtroyed a veſſel in the charge of commodore Symmonds. One of his kegs alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed a veſſel near the Long Iſland ſhore. About Chriſtmas 1777, he committed to the Delaware river a number of kegs, deſtined to fall among the Britiſh fleet at Philadelphia; but this ſquadron of kegs, having been ſeparated and retarded by the ice, demoliſhed but a ſingle boat. This cataſtrophe, however, produced an alarm, unprecedented in its nature and degree; which has been humourouſly deſcribed by the late honourable Francis Hopkinſon, in a ſong, ſtyled "The Battle of the Kegs."</p>
                     <p>The iſſue of the campaign upon the Delaware af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded room for the moſt ſerious reflections to the Britiſh. Their arms were crowned with the moſt brilliant ſucceſs. Two very conſiderable victories were obtained. In all leſſer actions, excepting the affair at Red Bank, they were equally triumphant. Yet with all this tide of ſucceſs, all the fruit they derived from their victories at the cloſe of the campaign, amounted to no more than ſimply a good winter lodging for their army in the city of Philadelphia; whilſt the troops poſſeſſed no more of the adjacent country than what they immediately commanded with their arms. It was ſtill more diſcouraging, that general Waſhington had given repeated proofs that however he might engage them when he thought it to his advantage, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the royal army to bring him to action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:028963_0254_0FDDBF5DA08C2740"/>his conſent. This gave occaſion to much unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in Britain, where the news of the firſt ſucceſſes had cauſed the greateſt exultation, which was now ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by very gloomy reflections on the peculiar and fatal circumſtances, which, from the nature of the country, and other operating cauſes, had diſtinguiſhed this war, from all others in which they had ever been concerned, and in which victory and deſeat were near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly productive of the ſame conſequences.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>ONE great object in the miniſterial plan for the campaign of 1777, was, to effect a free commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between New York and Canada, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the navigation of the intermediate lakes. On the other hand, the Americans were very early attentive to their ſecurity in that quarter, and had placed every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible obſtruction in their way.</p>
                     <p>This expedition had been projected by the Britiſh miniſtry as the moſt effectual method that could be taken to cruſh the colonies at once. The four provinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of New England had originally begun the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy again Britain, and were ſtill conſidered as the moſt active in the continuation of it; and it was thought, that any impreſſion made upon them, would contribute in an effectual manner to the reduction of all the reſt. For this purpoſe, an army of 4000 choſen Britiſh troops and 3000 Germans were put under the command of general Burgoyne; general Carleton was directed to uſe his intereſt with the Indians to perſuade them to join in this expedition; and the province of Quebeck was to furniſh large parties to join in the ſame. Thoſe who commanded under general Burgoyne were, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philips of the artillery, generals Fraſer, Powell, and Hamilton, with the German officers generals Reideſel and Speecht, all officers of diſtinguiſhed merit. The
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:028963_0255_0FDDBF636E9EC4C8"/>ſoldiers were all excellently diſciplined, and had been kept in their winter quarters with all imaginable care, in order to prepare them for the expedition on which they were going. The braſs train of artillery that was ſent out, was perhaps the fineſt, and the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſupplied, both as to officers and men, that had ever been allotted to ſecond the operations of an equal force. To aid the principal expedition, another was projected on the Mohawk River, under colonel St. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who was to be aſſiſted by ſir John Johnſon, ſon to the famous ſir William Johnſon who had ſo greatly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the war of 1755.</p>
                     <p>A conſiderable force was left in Canada for its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurity, and ſir Guy Carleton's authority was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to the limits of that province. His military command extended before to every part of America, whither he might find it ſitting to conduct the army under his direction. Though the Britiſh miniſtry at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the preſervation of Canada to his abilities, yet he was now called upon to act a ſecondary part in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to the grand expedition committed to general Burgoyne. His behaviour in this trying and difficult ſituation was conformable to the greatneſs of his ſoul. He ſhewed that reſentment could not warp him from his duty, and he applied himſelf with the ſame diligence and energy, to forward and ſupport the expedition in all its parts, as if the arrangement had been entirely his own.</p>
                     <p>Lieutenant general Burgoyne arrived in Quebeck on the 6th of May,

                           <hi>May</hi> 6.</note> and exerted all diligence to proſecute in due time the objects of the expedition. He proceeded up Lake Champlain, and, on the 21ſt of June, having landed near Crown Point,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 21.</note> he encamped on the weſtern ſide of the lake, where being joined by a conſiderable body of Indians, the general made a ſpeech,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028963_0256_0FDDBF6454A6B288"/>in which it is ſaid he exhorted theſe new allies, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectually, to lay aſide their ferocious and barbarous manner of making war; to kill only ſuch as oppoſed them in arms; and to ſpare priſoners, with ſuch women and children as ſhould fall into their hands. After iſſuing a proclamation, in which the force of Britain, and that which he commanded, was ſet forth in very oſtentatious terms, the campaign opened with the ſiege of Ticonderoga. The place was very ſtrong, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned by 2546 continentals, and 900 militia, under general St. Clair; nevertheleſs, the works were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, that even this number was ſcarce ſufficient to defend them properly. They had therefore omitted to fortify a rugged eminence called <hi>Sugar Hill,</hi> the top of which overlooked and effectually commanded the whole works; imagining, perhaps, that the difficulty of the aſcent would be ſufficient to prevent the enemy from taking poſſeſſion of it. On the approach of the firſt diviſion of the army, the provincials abandoned and ſet fire to their out works; and ſo expeditious were the Britiſh troops, that by the 5th of July every poſt was ſecured which was judged neceſſary for inveſting it completely.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 6.</note> A road was ſoon after made to the very ſummit of that eminence which the Americans had ſuppoſed could not be aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſo much were they now diſheartened, that they inſtantly abandoned the fort entirely, taking the road to Skeneſborough, a place to the ſouth of Lake George; while their baggage, with what artillery and military ſtores they could carry off, were ſent to the ſame place by water. But the Britiſh generals were determined not to let them paſs ſo eaſily. Both were purſued and both overtaken. Their armed veſſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided only of five galleys; two of which were taken, and three blown up; on which they ſet fire to their boats and fortifications at Skeneſborough. On this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:028963_0256_0FDDBF6454A6B288"/>the provincials loſt 200 boats, 130 pieces of cannon, with all their proviſions and baggage. Their land forces under colonel Francis made a brave defence againſt general Fraſer;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 7.</note> and ſuperior in number, had almoſt overpowered him, when general Reideſel with a large body of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans came to his aſſiſtance. The Americans were now overpowered in their turn; and their commander being killed, they fled on all fides with great precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this action 200 were killed, as many taken priſoners, and above 600 wounded, many of whom periſhed in the woods for want of aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>During the engagement general St. Clair was at Caſtleton, about ſix miles from the place; but inſtead of going forward to Fort Anne, the next place of ſtrength, he repaired to the woods which lie between that fortreſs and New England. General Burgoyne, however, detached colonel Hill with the ninth regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order to intercept ſuch as ſhould attempt to retreat towards Fort Anne. On his way he met with a body of the Americans, ſaid to be ſix times as number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as his own; but after an engagement of three hours, they were obliged to retire with great loſs. After ſo many diſaſters, deſpairing of being able to make any ſtand at Fort Anne, they ſet ſire to it and retired to Fort Edward. In all theſe engagements the loſs of killed and wounded in the royal army did not exceed 200 men.</p>
                     <p>General Burgoyne was now obliged to ſuſpend his operations for ſome time, and wait at Skeneſborough for the arrival of his tents, proviſions, &amp;c. but employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this interval in making roads through the country about St. Anne, and in clearing a paſſage for his troops to proceed againſt the Americans. The direct diſtance from Fort Anne, where the batteaux navigation ended, or even from Skeneſborough to Fort Edward, was no
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:028963_0257_0FDDBF65D23A4A50"/>more than what in eaſy ground, or a cultivated country, would be termed a moderate ride for exerciſe; yet ſuch is the ſavage ſtate of that country, and ſuch were the difficulties thrown in the way by the provincials, that the progreſs of the army thither was rendered very tedious and laborious; ſcarcely indeed exceeding one mile a day; a circumſtance, to after ages, and in a cultivated ſtate of the country, perhaps hardly credible. Almoſt every part of the paſſage was a wilderneſs. The provincials had cut large trees on both ſides of the road, in ſuch a manner as to fall acroſs and lengthways, with their branches interwoven; ſo that the troops had ſeveral layers of theſe frequently to remove, in places where they could not poſſibly take an oppoſite direction. The face of the country was likewiſe ſo broken with creeks and marſhes, that, in this ſhort ſpace, they had no fewer than forty bridges to conſtruct, beſides others to repair; one of which was of log work, two miles in length. In ſhort, after undergoing the utmoſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that could be undergone, and making every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion that man could make, he arrived with his army before Fort Edward about the end of July.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 30.</note> Here general Schuyler had been for ſome time endeavouring to recruit the ſhattered American forces, and had been joined by general St. Clair with the remains of his army; the garriſon of Fort George alſo, ſituated on the lake of that name, had evacuated the place and retired to Fort Edward on Hudſon's River.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the great ſucceſs of the Britiſh general, the people, far from ſhewing the leaſt diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſubmit, ſeemed only to conſider how they might make the moſt effectual reſiſtance. For this purpoſe, the militia was every where raiſed and draughted to join the army at Saratoga; and ſuch numbers of vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unteers were daily added, that they ſoon began to
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028963_0257_0FDDBF65D23A4A50"/>recover from the alarm into which they had been thrown.</p>
                     <p>The terror excited by the Indians, likewiſe, inſtead of diſpoſing any of the inhabitants to court the Britiſh protection, had a tendency directly oppoſite. They had no other means of ſecurity, but to abandon their habitations and take up arms. The friends of the royal cauſe, as well as its enemies, ſuffered from their indiſcriminate barbarities. The murder of Miſs M'Rea, eſpecially, excited univerſal horrour. This young lady, in the innocence of youth, and the bloom of beauty— ſhe daughter of a ſteady loyaliſt, and engaged to be married to a Britiſh officer, was, whilſt dreſſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her promiſed huſband, murdered by her ſavage conductors, the auxiliaries of the Britiſh army. Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was thereby given to inflame the populace, and to blacken the royal cauſe. The cruelties of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and the cauſe in which they were engaged, were aſſociated together, and preſented in one view to the alarmed inhabitants. This melancholy ſtory, though true, was no premeditated barbarity. The circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were as follow: Mr. Jones, her lover, from an anxiety for her ſafety, engaged ſome Indians to remove her from among the Americans, and promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the perſon who ſhould bring her ſafe to him, with a barrel of rum. Two of the Indians who had conveyed her ſome diſtance on the way to her intended huſband, diſputed which of them ſhould preſent her to Mr. Jones. Both were anxious for the reward; and one of them killed her with his tomahawk, to prevent the other from receiving it. General Burgoyne obliged the Indians to deliver up the murderer, and threatened to put him to death. His life was only ſpared, upon the Indians agreeing to terms, which the general thought would be more efficacious than an execution, in preventing ſimilar miſchiefs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="unknown:028963_0258_0FDD5F44473B0F18"/>
The wiſdom and propriety of general St. Clair's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from Ticonderoga was ſoon after evident, even to thoſe, who cenſured his conduct; as the army, ſaved by that means, ſtood as a barrier between the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and general Burgoyne. This abated the panic of the people, and became a centre of rendezvous for them to repair to: And when an inquiry into his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct took place afterwards, all the charges againſt him were found groundleſs, and he was honourably acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the mean time general Gates was placed at the head of the northern army. At the ſame time general Arnold repaired to Saratoga with a conſiderable train of artillery; but receiving intelligence that colonel St. Leger was proceeding with great rapidity in his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on the Mohawk River, he removed to Still Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a place about half way between Saratoga and the junction of the Mohawk and Hudſon's River.</p>
                     <p>Colonel St. Leger had advanced in the beginning of Auguſt as far as Fort Schuyler, formerly called Fort Stanwic; the ſiege of which he preſſed with great vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. On the 6th of Auguſt, underſtanding that a ſupply of proviſions,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 6.</note> eſcorted by 800 or 900 men, under general Harkimer, was on the way to the fort, he diſpatched ſir John Johnſon with a number of tories and Indians, who ſurpriſed the Americans and took the convoy. A ſcene of great confuſion followed. Some of Harkimer's men ran off, but others poſted themſelves behind logs, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to fight with bravery and ſucceſs. The loſs on the ſide of the Americans was 160 killed, beſides many wounded.
<note n="*" place="bottom">The Britiſh accounts ſtate 400 killed and 200 taken priſoners. Dodſley's Annual Regiſter for 1777.</note> General Harkimer was among the former. Several of the principal people in that part of the country were among the killed and wounded. Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Willet, the ſecond in command in the fort, under
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028963_0258_0FDD5F44473B0F18"/>general Ganſevoort, ſallied out with 250 men, about the time of this battle, and routed two of the Indian and tory encampments, carrying off proviſions, baggage, arms and five colours, which on their return to the fort were diſplayed under the continental flag.</p>
                     <p>Colonel St. Leger now endeavoured to induce the garriſon to ſurrender, by ſtating the impoſſibility of their receiving relief, and threatening them in caſe of reſiſtance; but the commander replied, that he was determined to defend it to the laſt extremity, againſt all enemies whatever, without any concern for the conſequences of doing his duty: And ſo little were the garriſon intimidated, that colonel Willet and lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Stockwell, paſſed by night through the beſiegers' works, and, eluding the vigilance of the enemy, made their way through the greateſt dangers and diſſicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to haſten the march of general Arnold to their aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Thus the affairs of Colonel St. Leger ſeemed to be in no very favourable ſituation notwithſtanding his late ſucceſs, and they were ſoon totally ruined by the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Indians. They had been alarmed by the report of general Arnold's advancing with 2000 men to the relief of the fort; and whilſt the colonel was attempting to give them encouragement, another report was ſpread, that general Burgoyne had been defeated with great ſlaughter, and was now flying before the provincials. On this he was obliged to do as they thought proper; and the retreat could not be effected without the loſs of the tents and ſome of the artillery and military ſtores.</p>
                     <p>General Burgoyne, in the mean time, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the difficulties he had already ſuſtained, found that he muſt ſtill encounter more. The roads he had made with ſo much labour and pains were deſtroyed, either by the wetneſs of the ſeaſon or by the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans;
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028963_0259_0FDDBF674EDB5C28"/>ſo that the proviſions he brought from Fort George could not ſtrive at his camp without the moſt prodigious toil. On hearing of the ſiege of Fort Schuyler by colonel St. Leger, he determined to move forward, in hopes of encloſing the enemy betwixt his own army and that of St. Leger, or of obtaining the command of all the country between Fort Schuyler and Albany; or, at any rate, a junction with colonel St. Leger would be effected, which could not but be attended with the moſt happy conſequences. The only difficulty was the want of proviſions; and this it was propoſed to remedy by reducing the provincial magazines at Bennington. For this purpoſe, colonel Baum, a German officer of great bravery, was choſen with a body of 500 men. The place was about twenty miles from Hudſon's River; and to ſupport colonel Baum's party, the whole army marched up the river's bank, and encamped almoſt oppoſite to Saratoga, with the river betwixt it and that place. An advanced party was poſted at Batten Kill, between the camp and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington, in order to ſupport colonel Baum. In their way the Britiſh ſeized a large ſupply of cattle and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, which were immediately ſent to the camp; but the badneſs of the roads retarded their march ſo much, that inrelligence of their deſign was ſent to Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington. Underſtanding now that the American force was greatly ſuperior to his own, the colonel acquainted the general, who immediately diſpatched colonel Brey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with a party to his aſſiſtance; but through the ſame cauſes that had retarded the march of colonel Baum, this aſſiſtance could not arrive in time. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Starke, in the mean time, who commanded at Bennington, determined to attack the two parties ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arately; and for this purpoſe advanced againſt colonel Baum,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 16.</note> whom he ſurrounded on all ſides and attacked with the utmoſt
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028963_0259_0FDDBF674EDB5C28"/>violence. The troops defended themſelves with great valour, but were to a man either killed or taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; among the latter was colonel Baum. Colonel Breyman, after a deſperate engagement, had the good luck to effect a retreat through the darkneſs of the night, which otherwiſe he could not have done, as his men had expended all their ammunition, being 40 rounds to each. In theſe two actions the Americans took 4 braſs field pieces, 12 braſs drums, 250 dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon ſwords, 4 ammunition waggons, and about 700 priſoners. The loſs of the Americans, incluſive of their wounded, was about 100 men.</p>
                     <p>General Burgoyne, thus diſappointed in his attempt on Bennington, applied himſelf with indefatigable dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to procure proviſions from Fort George; and having at length amaſſed a ſufficient quantity to laſt for a month, he threw a bridge of boats over the river Hudſon, which he croſſed about the middle of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, encamping on the hills and plains near Saratoga. As ſoon as he approached the provincial army, at this time encamped at Stillwater, under general Gates, he determined to make an attack; for which purpoſe he put himſelf at the head of the central diviſion of his army, having general Fraſer and colonel Breyman on the right,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 19.</note> with generals Reide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Philips on the left. In this poſition he advanced towards the Americans on the 19th of September. But the Americans did not now wait to be attacked: on the contrary, they attacked the central diviſion with the utmoſt violence; and it was not until general Philips with the artillery came up, and at 11 o'clock at night, that they could be induced to retire to their camp. In this action a continual blaze of ſire was kept up, and both armies ſeemed to be determined on death or victory. The Americans and Britiſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately drove, and were driven by each other. Men,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028963_0260_0FDDBF69083DF858"/>and particularly officers, dropped every moment, and on every ſide. Several of the Americans placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on high trees, and as often as they could diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh an officer's uniform, took him off by deliberately aiming at his perſon. The Britiſh troops loſt about 500 in killed and wounded, and the Americans about 319. The former were very much alarmed at the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate reſolution ſhown by the Americans, but this did not prevent them from advancing towards them, and poſting themſelves the next day within cannon ſhot of their lines. But their allies the Indians began to deſert in great numbers; and at the ſame time the general was in the higheſt degree mortified by having no intelligence of any aſſiſtance from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 21.</note> as had been ſtipulated. He now received a letter from him, by which he was informed that ſir Henry intended to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion on the North River in his favour. This afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but little comfort: however, he returned an anſwer by ſeveral truſty perſons, whom he diſpatched different ways, ſtating his preſent diſtreſſed ſituation, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to preſs the immediate execution of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed co-operation, and mentioning that the proviſions and other neceſſaries he had would only enable him to hold out till the 12th of October.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Americans, in order to cut off the retreat of the Britiſh army in the moſt effectual manner, undertook an expedition againſt Ticonderoga; but were obliged to abandon the enterpriſe after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurpriſed all the out poſts, and taken a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of boats, with ſome armed veſſels, and a number of priſoners.</p>
                     <p>The army under general Burgoyne, however, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to labour under the greateſt diſtreſſes; ſo that in the beginning of October he had been obliged to
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028963_0260_0FDDBF69083DF858"/>diminiſh the ſoldiers' allowance. On the 7th of that month he determined to move towards the Americans.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 7.</note> For this purpoſe he ſent a body of 1500 men to reconnoitre their left wing; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, if poſſible, to break through it in order to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a retreat. The detachment, however, had not proceeded far when a dreadful attack was made upon the left wing of the Britiſh army, which was with great difficulty preſerved from being entirely broken by a reinforcement brought up by general Fraſer, who was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the attack, and, on account of his diſtinguiſhed merit, was the ſubject of particular regret. After the troops had with the moſt deſperate efforts regained their camp, it was moſt furiouſly aſſaulted by general Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold; who, notwithſtanding all oppoſition, would have forced the intrenchments, had he not received a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wound, which obliged him to retire. Thus the attack failed on the left, but on the right the camp of the German reſerve was forced, colonel Breyman kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his countrymen defeated with great ſlaughter, and the loſs of 9 pieces of braſs artillery and all their baggage. This day was fatal to many brave men. Sir James Clark, Burgoyne's aid de camp, was mortally wounded. The general himſelf had a narrow eſcape, a muſket ſhot paſſing through his hat, and another through his waiſtcoat. Majors Williams and Ackland were taken, and the latter was wounded. The loſs of the Americans was inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>This was by far the heavieſt loſs the Britiſh army had ſuſtained ſince the action at Bunker's Hill. The liſt of killed and wounded amounted to near 1200, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of the Germans; but the greateſt misfortune was, that the Americans had now an opening on the right and rear of the Britiſh forces, ſo that the army was threatened with entire deſtruction. This obliged general Burgoyne once more to ſhift his poſition, that
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028963_0261_0FDDBF6F4DA4C470"/>his opponents might alſo be obliged to alter theirs. This was accompliſhed on the night of the 7th, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any loſs, and all the next day he continued to offer the Americans battle; but they were now too well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of obtaining a complete victory, by cutting off all ſupplies from the Britiſh, to riſk a pitched battle. Wherefore they advanced on the right ſide, in order to incloſe him entirely; which obliged the general to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a retreat towards Saratoga. But the Americans had now ſtationed a great force on the ford at Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's River, ſo that the only poſſibility of retreat was by ſecuring a paſſage to Lake George; and to effect this, a body of workmen were detached, with a ſtrong guard, to repair the roads and bridges that led to Fort Edward. As ſoon as they were gone, however, the Americans ſeemed to prepare for an attack; which rendered it neceſſary to recal the guard, and the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being of courſe left expoſed, could not proceed.</p>
                     <p>The royal troops were under arms the whole day of the 8th,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 8.</note> in continual expectation of an action, and were cannonaded during the greateſt part of it; but all that happened was a ſucceſſion of ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes which occaſioned loſs on both ſides. General Lincoln was wounded in his leg by a random ſhot, when riding in company with general Gates. About ſunſet, a ſtrange ſpectacle was preſented to view. The corpſe of general Fraſer was brought out of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Britiſh camp, and carried up the hill, attended only by the officers who had lived in his family, for he deſired it might be carried, without parade, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of his corps, to the great redoubt, and there bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. It neceſſarily paſſed within view of both armies: generals Burgoyne, Philips, and Reideſel, ſtanding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, were unable to reſtrain their natural propenſity to pay their laſt attention to his remains—jealous leſt their conformity to his requeſt might be conſtrued into
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028963_0261_0FDDBF6F4DA4C470"/>neglect—they followed the corpſe to the grave. The inceſſant cannonading during the ſolemnity;—the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy attitude, and unaltered voice with which the chaplain, Mr. Brudenell, officiated, though frequently covered with duſt, thrown up on all ſides of him by the ſhot; —the mute but expreſſive mixture of ſenſibility and indignation upon every countenance, together with the duſkineſs of the evening, might make one of the fineſt ſubjects for the pencil of a maſter that the field ever exhibited. But had general Burgoyne acquainted the American commander with the intended proceſſion, there is no doubt but the magnanimity and generoſity of general Gates would have varied the ſcene, and done due honour to the memory of his brave enemy.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the boats which conveyed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions down Hudſon's River were expoſed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fire of the American markſmen, who took many of them; ſo that it became neceſſary to convey the proviſions over land. In this extreme danger, it was reſolved to march by night to Fort Edward, forcing the paſſages at the fords either above or below the place; and, in order to effect this the more eaſily, it was reſolved that the ſoldiers ſhould carry their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions on their backs, leaving behind their baggage and every other incumbrance. But before this could be executed, intelligence was received that the Americans had raiſed ſtrong intrenchments oppoſite to theſe fords, well provided with cannon, and that they had likewiſe taken poſſeſſion of the riſing ground between Fort George and Fort Edward, which in like manner was provided with cannon.</p>
                     <p>"On the morning of the 11th of October, general Gates called the general officers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 11.</note> and informed them of his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived certain intelligence, which might be depended upon, that the main body of Burgoyne's army was
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028963_0262_0FDDBF7230027378"/>marched off for Fort Edward with what they could take, and that a rear guard only was left in the camp, who after a while were to puſh off as faſt as poſſible, leaving the heavy baggage behind. On this it was concluded to attack the camp in half an hour. The officers repaired to their commands. General Nixon's, being the eldeſt brigade, croſſed the Saratoga creck firſt. Unknown to the Americans, Burgoyne had a line form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behind a parcel of bruſh wood to ſupport the poſt of artillery, where the others meant to make their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. General Glover was on the point of following Nixon, when he ſaw a Britiſh deſerter whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. The ſoldier told him the truth, that the whole army was in camp; that a ſmall detachment had been ſent off a day or two ago, but had returned, on finding the paſſes occupied by the Americans. General Glover diſpatched his aid de camp to general Gates with the deſerter behind him, and at the ſame time ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to general Nixon, which reached him in the critical minute; before he could re-croſs, the fog, which had prevailed, cleared off, and his rear was gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the enemy's cannon, which killed ſeveral of his men: a quarter of an hour later would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have proved fatal to his whole brigade, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a new turn of affairs in favour of the royal army. Thus the riſe and fall of mighty empires may depend upon the minuteſt incidents. Are theſe to be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as blind unmeaning caſualties? Are they not rather the direct acts of a Divine Being, for the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of his own purpoſe, by a Providence ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the jarring devices of mortals?</p>
                     <p>All this time the American army was increaſing by the continual arrival of militia and volunteers from all parts. Their parties extended all along the oppoſite bank of Hudſon's River, and ſome had even paſſed it in order to obſerve the leaſt movement of the Britiſh
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:028963_0262_0FDDBF7230027378"/>army. The whole force under general Gates was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted at 16,000 men, whilſt the army under general Burgoyne ſcarce amounted to 6000; and every part of their camp was reached by the grape and rifle ſhot of the enemy, beſides a diſcharge from their artillery, which was almoſt inceſſant. In this ſtate of extreme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and danger, the army continued with the greateſt conſtancy and perſeverance till the evening of the 13th of October.

                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 13.</note> General Burgoyne finding that the troops had only three days proviſion in ſtore, on ſhort allowance, and no apparent means of retreat remaining, called into council all the generals, field officers, and captains commanding corps. There was not a ſpot of ground in the whole camp for holding the council of war, but what was expoſed to cannon or rifle ſhot. While the council was deliberat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an eighteen pound ball croſſed the table. By the unanimous advice and concurrence of the council, the general was induced to open a treaty with general Gates. The firſt propoſals of the latter were rejected, and the ſixth article with diſdain, wherein it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that the Britiſh army ſhould lay down their arms in the intrenchments. Burgoyne's counter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals were unanimouſly approved; and being ſent to Gates were agreed to, on the 15th, without any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial alteration. The propoſals not being ſigned by either party, and captain Campbell returning in the night of the 16th to Burgoyne, with the news of the reduction of Fort Montgomery and other intelligence, the general ſubmitted it to conſideration, whether it was conſiſtent with public faith, and, if ſo, expedient to ſuſpend the execution of the treaty, and truſt to events. The opinion of different officers was aſked in regard to the condition of their reſpective corps, and what might be expected from them ſeverally in deſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate caſes. Some entertained doubts of part of the
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028963_0263_0FDDBF73875482B8"/>troops, if the negociation ceaſed; and others of a greater part for want of bodily ſtrength, if deſperate enterpriſes were to be afterward undertaken. The majority of the council determined, that the public faith was <hi>bona ſide</hi> plighted.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their lines, to the tune of Yankee Doodle.</p>
                     <p>The terms granted were moderate: the army were allowed to march out with all the honours of war and its camp artillery, to the verge of the river, where they were to depoſit their arms. The troops were to be allowed a free paſſage to Europe, on condition of their not ſerying again in North America during the war. The army were not to be ſeparated, particularly the men from the officers; roll calling, and other duties of regularity to be admitted; the officers on parole to be allowed to wear their ſide arms, and to be quartered according to their rank; all private property to be
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028963_0263_0FDDBF73875482B8"/>held ſacred, and the public delivered upon honour; no baggage to be ſearched or moleſted; all perſons, of whatever country, appertaining to, or following the camp, to be fully comprehended in the capitulation; and the Canadians to be returned to their own country liable to its conditions. All theſe, as far as general Gates was or could be concerned, were executed with the utmoſt punctuality. Nay, ſo much attention was paid to the delicacy of military honour, that when the Britiſh troops went to the place appointed to lay down their arms, the provincials were ſtrictly kept within their lines, and not allowed to be ſpectators of ſo great humiliation on the part of Britain. Such conduct was the more praiſe worthy, as ſome late as well as former circumſtances, had highly enraged the militia. The extraordinary and ſevere meaſures purſued by the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh on the North River, as related below, might alſo have afforded much colour for a different mode of conduct.</p>
                     <p>When the arms were depoſited agreeably to treaty, the royal troops were ſerved with bread by the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, as they had none left, nor flour to make it. They had only one day's ſalt meat remaining.</p>
                     <p>The number of thoſe who ſurrendered at Saratoga amounted to 5791; the liſt of ſick and wounded left in the camp when the army retreated to Saratoga, to 528; and the number of thoſe loſt by other accidents ſince the taking of Ticonderoga, to near 3000. 35 braſs field pieces, 7000 ſtand of arms, clothing for an equal number of ſoldiers, with the tents, military cheſt, &amp;c. conſtituted the booty on this occaſion. The American forces, at the time of the convention, were in all 13,222, of which 4129 were militia. In commemoration of this event, congreſs voted that a gold medal ſhould be ſtruck and preſented in the name of the United States to major general Gates.</p>

Sir Henry Clinton, in the mean time, had ſailed up the North River,

Seventy large cannon were carried away, beſides a number of ſmaller artillery, and a great quantity of ſtores and ammunition; a large boom and chain reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acroſs the river from Fort Montgomery to a point of land called St. Anthony's Noſe, and which coſt not leſs than 70,000<abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> ſterling, were partly deſtroyed and partly carried away, as was alſo another boom of little leſs value at Fort Conſtitution. The loſs of the Britiſh army was but ſmall in number, though ſome officers of great merit were killed in the different attacks.</p>
                     <p>Another attack was made by ſir James Wallace with ſome frigates, and a body of about 3,600 land forces under general Vaughan. The place which now ſuffered was named Eſopus:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 13.</note> the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications were deſtroyed, and the town itſelf was wantonly reduced to aſhes, as that called Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental Village had been before.</p>
                     <p>Whether policy or revenge led to this deſtruction of property is uncertain, but it cannot admit of a doubt, that it had no tendency to relieve general Burgoyne. General Gates had expreſs upon expreſs, urging him to ſend down troops to oppoſe the ravages of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. On the 14th he wrote to governour Clinton; "I have ordered the commanding officer at Fort Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to ſend Van Shoak's regiment without delay to Albany—deſired brigadier general Ganſevort to repair to that city, and take the command of all the troops that may aſſemble there—and have ſent down the two Eſopus regiments, the Tryon county militia, and moſt of the militia of Albany county." But he would not weaken his hold of Burgoyne by any detachment of continentals from his own army, or of New England militia.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="185" facs="unknown:028963_0264_0FDDBF754697C650"/>
The paſſage of the North River was made ſo prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable by the advantages gained on the 6th of October, that ſir Henry Clinton, with his whole force, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to full 3000 men, might not only have reached Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, but general Gates's encampment, before the 12th; the day till which Burgoyne had agreed to wait for aid from New York, or at leaſt twenty four hours before Burgoyne's neceſſity compelled his ſubmiſſion to articles of capitulation. Why this opportunity was neglected has never been ſatisfactorily explained. Whilſt general Vaughan was buſied in deſtroying Eſopus, he might with a flood tide have reached Albany in four hours, as there was no force to hinder him. Had he proceeded thither, and burnt the ſtores, general Gates, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf afterwards declared, muſt have retreated into New England.</p>
                     <p>After the convention was ſigned, general Gates mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward to ſtop the devaſtations of the Britiſh on the North River, but they, on hearing the fate of general Burgoyne, retired to New York. About the ſame time thoſe of the Britiſh who had been left in the rear of the royal army, deſtroyed their cannon, and abandoning Ticonderoga, retreated into Canada. Thus the whole country, which had for ſeveral months experienced the confuſions of war, was inſtantaneouſly reſtored to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>The intelligence of this great event ſpread no leſs joy through the United States, than grief and dejection throughout Britain. The generality of the people in Britain had preſumed that all the northern parts of the United States would be ſubdued before the end of the campaign. The quality of the troops, the zeal, talents and courage of the commander, together with the good fortune which for ſome time followed him, juſtified their expectations in a great degree; but the cataſtrophe proved the folly of planning diſtant expeditions, the
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:028963_0265_0FDDBF7660A56818"/>ſucceſs of which depended upon the coincidence of circumſtances, which were, at moſt, only within the verge of poſſibility.</p>
                     <p>When the captured troops began their march to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the Americans lined the road and hill on each ſide. When paſſing through the centre of them, they were looked at, in this reverſe of fortune, with a generous ſedateneſs; not even the leaſt geſture was made uſe of by way of inſult. On their arrival at Boſton they were quartered in the barracks on Winter and Proſpect Hills. The general court of Maſſachuſetts paſſed proper reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions for the accomodation of priſoners; but from the feebleneſs of their authority, at that time, over the property of their fellow citizens, it was difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide immediately for ſo large a number of officers and ſoldiers, in ſuch a manner as their convenience requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or as from the articles of the convention they had a right to expect. The officers remonſtrated to general Burgoyne, that ſix or ſeven of them were crowded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one room, without any regard to their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ranks, in violation of the 7th article of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Notice of this being forwarded to general Gates, he ſent general Burgoyne's letter to congreſs. Taking hold of the declaration of the general, that "the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic faith was broken," and eager to juſtify the meaſures they were deſirous of adopting, they concluded from thence, that the captured troops, on their embarkation, would make a junction with the Britiſh garriſons in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. The declaration of the general, whilſt in the power of congreſs, was conſtrued by them as deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecurity which they before had in his perſonal honour; alleging, that, in every event, he might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his previous notice to juſtify his future conduct. They therefore poſtponed the embarkation of the troops, making a nice diſtinction between the ſuſpenſion and abrogation of the convention; and alleged, that ground
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028963_0265_0FDDBF7660A56818"/>for ſuſpecting an intention to violate it, was a juſtifying reaſon for ſuſpending its execution on their part, till it was properly ratified by the court of Great Britain. General Burgoyne explained the intention and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the paſſage objected to in his letter, and pledged himſelf that his officers would join with him in ſigning any inſtrument that might be thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for confirming the convention; but congreſs would never recede from their reſolution. If was eaſily ſeen, that the meaſure which they had adopted was not ſo lightly taken as to be eaſily given up; and that expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and ſecurities could produce no effect on their determination.</p>
                     <p>The capture of Burgoyne gave new ſtrength to the minority of the Britiſh parliament; prevented the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment there from acting with collected force, which an union of ſentiments would have enabled it to do; encouraged the Americans by well grounded hopes of final ſucceſs, and ſoon procured them powerful friends in Europe.</p>
                     <p>The American privateers and continental ſhipping ſent in a number of Britiſh prizes into their own har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours this year, and inſulted the coaſt of Britain in a manner never before ventured upon by her hardieſt enemies; ſo as to produce the appointment of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, for the firſt time ever known, to protect the linen ſhips from Dublin and Newry. The General Mifflin privateer, after making repeated captures, arrived at Breſt, and ſaluted the French admiral, who returned the ſalute in form, as to the veſſel of a ſovereign and independent ſtate. Though lord Stormont, on his threatening to return immediately to Great Britain, unleſs ſatisfaction ſhould be given, obtained an order for American privateers and their prizes to leave the French ports, the ſame was evaded. However, the king's ſhips captured many valuable prizes in the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028963_0266_0FDDBF77DD499AB8"/>Weſt Indies and on the American coaſt. But the balance of property was greatly in favour of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans. The continental frigate Hancock, of 32 guns, moſtly twelve pounders, commanded by captain Manly, was taken on the 8th of July, by ſir George Collier, of his majeſty's ſhip the Rainbow. The Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock's complement was 290 men, nearly as many as the Rainbow's. The Flora frigate, likewiſe, gave chace to the Fox of 28 guns, on the 7th of July, and afterwards captured her. The Fox had been taken ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by captain Manly, on the banks of Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                     <p>On the firſt of December the ſhip Flamand, captain Landais, arrived at Portſmouth from Marſeilles with a rich ſupply of warlike ſtores. Among other articles were 48 pieces of braſs cannon, four pounders, with carriages complete, and 2000 balls; 19 nine inch mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, with 250 bombs; a quantity of intrenching tools; 3000 fuſees; 1100 of another quality for dragoons; 18,000 pounds of gun powder, and 61,000 of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
                     <p>During this year and ſome time after, the views of a few factious men were bent on rendering the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief unpopular, and thus pave the way for his removal from the command of the American army. But his fellow citizens had ſuch unlimited and well grounded confidence in his patriotiſm and abilities, that the machinations of his enemies tended, in the end, only to eſtabliſh more firmly that authority which they induſtriouſly laboured to ſubvert.</p>
                     <p>The plan ſeems to have been to engage the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts aſſembly and Virginia houſe of burgeſſes, to give inſtructions to their delegates in congreſs, to more for an inquiry into the cauſes of the ill ſucceſs of the campaign of 1776: and then contrive that ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028963_0266_0FDDBF77DD499AB8"/>ſhould be agreed to, as would either remove general Waſhington or produce his reſignation.</p>
                     <p>The following paſſages in two of the general's letters to a correſpondent, who applied to him on this ſubject, are too valuable to be omitted. In the firſt letter, dat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Valley Forge, January 23d, 1778, he writes "Wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a ſerious deſign of placing general Lee (before cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation) at the head of the army, had ever entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head of a member of congreſs or not, I never was at the trouble of enquiring. I am told a ſcheme of that kind is now on foot by ſome, in behalf of anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gentleman—whether true or falſe—ſerious or mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to try the pulſe—I neither know nor care. Neither intereſted, nor ambitious views, led me into the ſervice. I did not ſolicit the command; but accepted it after much entreaty, with all that diffidence, which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious want of ability and experience, equal to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of ſo important a truſt muſt naturally excite in a mind not quite devoid of thought: and after I did engage, purſued the great line of my duty, and the object in view (as far as my judgment could direct) as pointedly as the needle to the pole. So ſoon as the public gets diſſatisfied with my ſervices, or a perſon is found better qualified to anſwer her expectation, I ſhall quit the helm with as much pleaſure, and retire to a private ſtation with as much content, as ever the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried pilgrim felt upon his ſafe arrival at the holy land, or haven of hope; and ſhall wiſh moſt devoutly, that thoſe who come after may meet with more proſperous gales than I have done, and leſs difficulty. If the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the public has not been anſwered by my endeavours, I have more reaſons than one to regret it; but at preſent I ſhall only add, that a day may come, when the public cauſe is no longer to be benefited by a concealment of our circumſtances, and till this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od arrives, I ſhall not be among the firſt to diſcloſe ſuch
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028963_0267_0FDDBF794ED46EB8"/>truths as may injure it, however my character in the mean while may ſuffer." On the 15th of February he had occaſion for writing—"I can aſſure you that no perſon ever heard me drop an expreſſion that had a tendency to reſignation. The ſame principles that led me to embark in the oppoſition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain, operate with additional force at this day; nor is it my deſire to withdraw my ſervices, while they are conſidered of importance in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.

                     <p>SOON after the intelligence of the capture of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne's army reached Europe, the king of France concluded at Paris treaties of alliance and commerce with the United States. This important tranſaction was the fruit of long negociation. The coloniſts had taken up arms, uninfluenced by the enemies of Great Britain, and conducted their oppoſition for ſeveral months after they had raiſed troops, without any reference to foreign powers. As they began the conteſt with no other view than to obtain a redreſs of grievances, they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no inclination, in the firſt period of their oppoſition, to involve the mother country in a war, nor to aſk aid from her enemies. But when the policy of Great Britain attempted to deprive the Americans of arms, it became indiſpenſible for them to ſeek foreign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions. For this purpoſe, Silas Deane was ſent to Paris, early in the year 1776, as a political and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical agent, with inſtructions to ſolicit the friendſhip of the French king, Louis XVI. and to procure milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtores. Soon after his arrival, he was inſtructed to found count de Vergennes, the French miniſter for foreign affairs, on the ſubject of the American contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. In the month of June, Mr. Deane obtained a
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028963_0268_0FDDBF7AD42C94D0"/>ſupply of arms, ammunition, and ſoldiers' clothing, ſufficient for loading three veſſels. It is not yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly known what agency the court of France had in furniſhing theſe ſupplies, or whether they were ſold or given as preſents. However, the buſineſs was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, that it might aſſume ſuch a complexion as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances might render expedient. And, during the whole negociation, Great Britain was amuſed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of the moſt pacific diſpoſitions on the part of France, whilſt the Americans were ſupplied with the means of defence.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs having agreed upon the plan of the treaty which they intended to propoſe to his moſt Chriſtian majeſty, elected Dr. Franklin, Silas Deane, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Lee to ſolicit its acceptance. It was reſolved, that no member ſhould be at liberty to divulge any thing more of theſe tranſactions than "that congreſs had taken ſuch ſteps as they judged neceſſary for obtaining foreign alliances." The ſecret committee was directed to make an effectual lodgement of 10,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, ſubject to the order of theſe commiſſioners. Dr. Franklin, who was employed as agent in the buſineſs, and afterwards as miniſter plenipotentary at the court of France, enjoyed a greater proportion of foreign fame, than any other native of America. He was eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed as a politician, and a ſcholar, and, if poſſible, more ſo as a man and a citizen. His genius was vaſt and comprehenſive, and could with equal eaſe inveſtigate the myſteries of philoſophy and the laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths of politics. Shortly after his appointment he failed for France. His high rank in literature and his agreeable manners, had procured him the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and veneration when in that country, on his trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, in 1767; and now his increaſed ſame ſmoothed the way for his reception in a public character. The three agents having rendezvouſed at Paris, opened their
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:028963_0268_0FDDBF7AD42C94D0"/>buſineſs in a private audience with count de Vergennes on the 28th of December 1776. Inſtead of graſping at too much, the French miniſter aimed at nothing more than, by granting generous terms to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, to perpetuate the ſeparation of the colonies from Great Britain. France was at this period no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for war. The peace of Europe was ſuppoſed to be unſtable, from a prevailing belief that the death of the elector of Bavaria was an event extremely probable. But the principal reaſon that induced a delay, was an opinion, that the diſpute between the mother country and the colonies would be compromiſed.</p>
                     <p>In theſe circumſtances the French court obſerved a middle line of conduct. They avoided equally an haughty reſerve, which would have diſcouraged the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, or a legal countenance of their deputies, which might, by alarming the rulers of Great Britain, have induced them to a compromiſe with their colonies, or have brought on an immediate rupture between France and England. The French government, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were not over haſty in openly eſpouſing their cauſe. They prohibited, threatened, and even puniſhed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans; whilſt private perſons were winked at, in encouraging, ſupplying, and ſupporting them.</p>
                     <p>The Americans in the mean time aſſiduouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their agents at the courts of Spain, Vienna, Pruſſia, and Tuſcany, in order, if poſſible, to conclude alliances with them, or at leaſt to procure an acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgment of their independency. As it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that Britain intended to apply for aſſiſtance to Ruſſia, the American commiſſioners were enjoined to uſe their utmoſt influence with the German princes to prevent ſuch auxiliaries from marching through their territories, and to endeavour to procure the recal of the German troops already ſent to America. To France they offered a ceſſion of ſuch Weſt India iſlands as
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:028963_0269_0FDDBF83DB1067E0"/>ſhould be taken by the united ſtrength of France and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; and ſhould Britain by their joint endeavours be diſpoſſeſſed of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, and Nova Scotia, theſe territories ſhould be divided betwixt the two nations, and Great Britain be totally excluded from the fiſhery. The propoſals to the Spaniſh court were, that in caſe they ſhould think proper to eſpouſe their quarrel, the American ſtates ſhould aſſiſt in reducing Penſacola under the dominion of Spain, provided their ſubjects were allowed the free navigation of the river Miſſiſippi and the uſe of the harbour of Penſacola; and they further offered, that, if agreeable to Spain, they would declare war againſt Portugal, ſhould that power expel the American ſhips from its ports.</p>
                     <p>At this time the congreſs did not ſo much expect any direct aid from France, as the indirect relief of a war between that country and Great Britain. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote which, they reſolved that "their commiſſioners at the court of France ſhould be furniſhed with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and commiſſions, and authoriſed to arm and fit for war in the French ports any number of veſſels, not exceeding ſix, at the expence of the United States, to war upon Britiſh property, provided they were ſatisfied this meaſure would not be diſagreeable to the court of France." This reſolution was carried into effect, and, in the year 1777, marine officers, with American com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, both failed out of French ports, and carried prizes of Britiſh property into them. They could not procure their condemnation in the courts of France, nor ſell them publicly, but they found means to turn them into money.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt private agents on the part of the United States were endeavouring to embroil the two nations, the American commiſſioners were ſtill urging the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the treaty propoſed by congreſs. They received aſſurances of the good wiſhes of the court of
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028963_0269_0FDDBF83DB1067E0"/>France, but were frequently informed that the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the tranſaction required farther conſideration, and were enjoined to preſerve the moſt profound ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſy. Matters remained in this uncertain ſtate from December 1776 till December 1777. The defeat on Long Iſland, the reduction of New York, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous events of 1776, which have been already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſunk the credit of the Americans very low. The ſubſequent ſucceſſes at Trenton and Princeton effaced thoſe impreſſions, but the fate of Burgoyne turned the ſcale. This great event convinced the French, and might have convinced the Britiſh, that the oppoſition of the Americans was not the work of a few factious leaders who had uſurped the reins of power, but that it was the work of the people, whoſe efforts were likely to prove finally ſucceſsful. Louis, therefore, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eſpouſe their cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſioners of congreſs were informed, on the 16th of December, 1777, by M. Gerard, one of the ſecretaries of the king's council of ſtate, "That it was decided to acknowledge the independence of the United States, and to make a treaty with them. That his moſt chriſtian majeſty deſired the treaty once made ſhould be durable, and their amity to ſubſiſt forever, which could not be expected, if each nation did not find an intereſt in its continuance, as well as in its commencement. It was therefore intended that the terms of the treaty ſhould be ſuch as the new formed ſtates would be willing to agree to if they had been long ſince eſtabliſhed, and in the fulneſs of ſtrength and power; and ſuch as they ſhould approve of when that time ſhould come. That his moſt chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was fixed in his determination not only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but to ſupport, their independence. That in doing this he might probably ſoon be engaged in a war, yet he ſhould not expect any compenſation from
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028963_0270_0FDDBF83E0AC4200"/>the United States on that account, nor was it pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he acted wholly for their ſakes, ſince beſides his real good will to them, it was manifeſtly the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of France, that the power of England ſhould be diminiſhed, by the ſeparation of the colonies from its government. The only condition he ſhould require and rely on would be, that the United States in no peace to be made, ſhould give up their independence and return to the obedience of the Britiſh government."</p>
                     <p>Conformably to the preliminaries propoſed by M. Gerard,
<note place="margin">1778. <hi>Feb.</hi> 6.</note> his moſt chriſtian majeſty Louis XVI. on the 6th of February, 1778, entered into treaties of amity and commerce with the United States of America, on the footing of the moſt perfect equality and reciprocity; and copies of them were ſent to congreſs, in order to counteract any propoſals that might be made in the mean time by the Britiſh miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>This event, though foreſeen by many, and often foretold, was diſbelieved by the Britiſh miniſtry; their zeal to reduce the colonies to ſubmiſſion, blinded them to danger from any other quarter. Tranſported with indignation againſt their late fellow ſubjects, they were ſo infatuated with the American war, as to ſuppoſe that the fear of future evils would induce the court of France to forego the opportunity of ſecuring great and immediate advantages, and at the ſame time, humbling a powerful rival.</p>
                     <p>The alliance between France and America had not been concluded three days before the Britiſh miniſters were ſecretly acquainted with the unwelcome news; and eight days after, lord North introduced his concil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iatory propoſitions.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Feb.</hi> 17.</note> His plan was to enable the crown to appoint commiſſioners to treat with the colonies concerning the means of putting an end to the preſent conteſt between
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028963_0271_0FDD5F3CE9913C40"/>them and Great Britain. Five perſons were to be inveſted with ample powers; and authoriſed to treat with congreſs as a lawful aſſembly, repreſenting America—with any of the provincial aſſemblies— and with any individuals. They were to be empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to order a ſuſpenſion of arms; to ſuſpend the operation of laws; and to grant pardons, immunities and rewards. The title of Independent States might be allowed till the treaty had been ratified by the king and parliament. The commiſſioners were to negociate, upon a re-union of the empire, for a reaſonable contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to its common exigencies; but this demand was not to be inſiſted on, and to be given up rather than not terminate the quarrel. His lordſhip ſaid in his ſpeech, that ſir W. Howe had been, in the late ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and in the whole courſe of the campaign, not only in the goodneſs of troops, and in all manner of ſupplies, but alſo in point of numbers, much ſuperior to the American army which oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed him in the field; that general Burgoyne had been in numbers, until the affair at Bennington, near twice as ſtrong as the army of the enemy: that he promiſed a great army ſhould be ſent out; and that a great army had accordingly been ſent out, to the amount of 60,000 men and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The ſpeech was long, able, and eloquent, and kept him up two full hours.—A dull melancholy ſilence for ſome time ſucceeded. It was heard with profound attention; but without a ſingle mark of approbation. Aſtoniſhment, dejection and fear, overclouded the whole aſſembly. It was conjectured that ſome power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motive had induced miniſtry to adopt ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of meaſures. The idea was confirmed by the poſitive aſſertion of Mr. Fox, that a treaty had been ſigned at Paris, between the colonies and France, by which ſhe recognized their independence. Some of the country gentlemen being piqued at lord North's
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028963_0272_0FDDBF86D5E77BA0"/>having ſaid, that "they had not been miſled or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived," roſe with great warmth, and aſſerted with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, that they had been groſsly deceived and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the uniform language of government for three years paſt. In general the party declared, that as the point of taxation, which could be the only rational ground of the war, was now given up, peace ſhould be procured by any means, and in the ſpeedieſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner."</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip ſhould have early attended to the hints contained in the letter to Dr. Fothergill, which the doctor got tranſcribed and ſent him, but the miniſter thought the doctor's correſpondent too ſanguine. The intimation that a foreign power might interfere, ſhould have produced a determination to treat immediately— a meſſage to the American commiſſioners aſſuring them of it—and the introduction, if poſſible, of the paſſing of the conciliatory bills before the delivery of the preliminaries to the commiſſioners on the 16th of December; whereas they were not paſſed till the 2d of March.</p>
                     <p>The day before the conciliatory propoſitions were introduced, a particular incident happened in the houſe of lords. After the Saratoga convention, general Gates wrote a very pathetic and intereſting letter to the earl of Thanet, with whom he had formerly lived upon a footing of great intimacy. It related chiefly to the ſituation of affairs between Great Britain and America. He lamented the misfortunes that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen his native country, and the danger to which it was expoſed; and then ſtated the neceſſity of ſpeedily applying the only remedy remaining, for the cure of the many evils that afflicted or threatened Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain. This remedy he declared to be an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of American independence, which he ſaid the United States never would part with. "A wiſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter,"
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028963_0273_0FDDBF9212032138"/>he added, "by reſcinding the reſolutions paſſed to ſupport that ſyſtem which no power on earth can eſtabliſh, will endeavour to preſerve ſo much of the empire in proſperity and honour, as the circumſtances of the times, and the mal-adminiſtration of thoſe who ruled before him, have left to his government. The United States of America are willing to be the friends, but never will ſubmit to be the ſlaves of the parent country. They are by conſanguinity, by language, and by the affection which naturally ſprings from theſe, more attached to England than to any other country under the ſun. Therefore ſpurn not the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which yet remains; inſtantly withdraw your fleets and armies; cultivate the commerce and friendſhip of America. Thus, and thus only can England hope to be great and happy. Seek that in a commercial alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; ſeek it ere it be too late; for there only you muſt expect to find it." The earl of Thanet produced this letter in the houſe; and after ſome controverſy it was read: and the duke of Richmond moved that it ſhould lie upon the table. The motion was rejected after a warm debate, to the concern of ſeveral, who flattered themſelves that the letter might have afforded an opening to a favourable accommodation.</p>
                     <p>The conciliatory bills were hurried through both houſes of parliament, and before they paſſed into acts, were copied and ſent acroſs the Atlantic, to lord and general Howe: and on their arrival, were ſent by a flag to congreſs at Yorktown, who were as yet uninformed of the concluſion of the treaty with France;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 21.</note> nor had they received any information from their commiſſioners at Paris for upwards of a year. One packet had in that time been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but the letters therein had been taken out before it was put on board the veſſel which brought it from France, and blank paper put in their ſtead. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028963_0274_0FDDBF92166C4F88"/>of congreſs appointed to examine the bills, made a report, which was unanimouſly adopted. By this they rejected the propoſals of Great Britain.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs finding that the royal commiſſioners were induſtriouſly circulating theſe bills in a partial and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret manner, ordered them to be printed in all the news papers, with the reſolutions of congreſs upon them, which were in ſubſtance as follows: That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſumed to make a ſeparate agreement with Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain ſhould be deemed a public enemy; that the United States could not with any propriety keep correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the commiſſioners until their independence was acknowledged, and the Britiſh fleet and armies removed from America. At the ſame time, the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were warned not to ſuffer themſelves to be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſecurity by any offers that might be made; but to uſe their utmoſt endeavours to ſend their quotas with all diligence into the field.</p>
                     <p>On this occaſion governour Tryon incloſed ſeveral copies of the bills to general Waſhington, in a letter, entreating him to allow them to be circulated; to which the general returned for anſwer a copy of a news paper, in which the bills, together with the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of congreſs, were inſerted: and governour Trumbull, upon a ſimilar letter and application, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned an anſwer to the following effect: There was a day when even this ſtep, from the then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged parent ſtate, might have been accepted with joy and gratitude; but that day is paſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocably; and there are inſuperable bars to the very idea of concluding a peace with Great Britain, on any other conditions, than the moſt abſolute, perfect, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon for action was now approaching; and congreſs was indefatigable in its preparations for a new campaign, which it was confidently ſaid would be the
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:028963_0274_0FDDBF92166C4F88"/>laſt. Among other methods taken for this purpoſe, it was recommended to all the young gentlemen of the colonies to form themſelves into bodies of cavalry to ſerve at their own expence during the war. General Waſhington at the ſame time, to remove all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances from his army, lightened the baggage as much as poſſible, by ſubſtituting ſacks and portmanteaus in place of cheſts and boxes, and uſing pack horſes inſtead of waggons. On the other hand, the Britiſh army, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to be reinforced by 20,000 men, thought of nothing but concluding the war according to their wiſhes before the end of the campaign. It was with the utmoſt concern, as well as indignation, therefore, that they received the news of lord North's concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory bills. This m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ture was univerſally looked upon as a national diſgrace; and ſome even tore the cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades from their hats, and trampled them under their feet as a token of their indignation.</p>
                     <p>On the 3d of May, 1778, Mr. S. Deane arrived in America expreſs from France, and brought with him copies of the two treaties of alliance and commerce with France, to be ratified by congreſs. This joyful news was quickly announced to the people in a gazette, wherein the chief articles of the treaty were mentioned, together with the pleaſing accounts from other parts, ſetting forth that almoſt all the European powers view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed America with an eye of friendſhip. The treaties were duly weighed, and conſidered ſeparately the next day, and upon each it was unanimouſly reſolved, "That the ſame be, and is hereby accepted." The next reſolution was, That this congreſs entertain the higheſt ſenſe of the magnanimity and wiſdom of his moſt chriſtian majeſty, ſo ſtrongly exemplified in the treaty of amity and commerce; and the commiſſioners repreſenting theſe ſtates, at the court of France, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to preſent the grateful acknowledgments of this
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:028963_0275_0FDDBF921AEAB770"/>congreſs to his moſt chriſtian majeſty, for his truly magnanimous conduct reſpecting theſe ſtates, in the ſaid generous and diſintereſted treaties, and to aſſure his majeſty, on the part of this congreſs, it is ſincerely wiſhed, that the friendſhip ſo happily commenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween France and theſe United States may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual."</p>
                     <p>The congreſs, after receiving the treaties, had a ſtronger feeling of their own importance than before, and reſolved, "That the commiſſioners appointed for the courts of Spain, Tuſcany, Vienna, and Berlin, ſhould live in ſuch ſtyle and manner at their reſpective courts, as they may find ſuitable and neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the dignity of their public character."</p>
                     <p>On the eighth of May, they agreed to a draught of "An addreſs to the inhabitants of the United States of America." In this publication, when they come to the French treaty, they ſay, "You have ſtill to expect one ſevere conflict. Your foreign alliances, though they ſecure your independence, cannot ſecure your country from deſolation, your habitations from plunder, your wives from inſult or violation, nor your children from butchery. Foiled in the principal deſign, you muſt expect to feel the rage of diſappointed ambition. Ariſe then! to your tents, and gird you for battle! It is time to turn the headlong current of vengeance upon the head of the deſtroyer. They have filled up the meaſure of their abominations, and, like ripe fruit, muſt ſoon drop from the tree. Although much is done, yet much remains to do. Expect not peace, whilſt any corner of America is in the poſſeſſion of your foes. You muſt drive them away from this land of promiſe, a land flowing indeed with milk and honey. Your brethren at the extremities of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent already implore your friendſhip and protection. It is your duty to grant their requeſt. They hunger
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028963_0275_0FDDBF921AEAB770"/>and thirſt after liberty. Be it yours to diſpenſe to them the heavenly gift. And what is there to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it?"</p>
                     <p>The alliance between France and America was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly announced to the Britiſh court, on the 13th of March, in a reſcript delivered to lord Weymouth, by the French ambaſſador: And the communication was made under the pretence of cultivating a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding between France and Great Britain.</p>
                     <p>The reception of this reſcript was notified by the miniſter to the houſe of commons on the 17th; and was accompanied with a meſſage from the king, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that he ſhould be under the neceſſity of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo unprovoked and ſo unjuſt an aggreſſion on the honour of his crown and the eſſential intereſts of his kingdom, and expreſſing his firm confidence on the zealous and affectionate ſupport of his faithful people. An addreſs was moved for in anſwer to it, to aſſure the king of the readineſs of the people to ſtand by him in afferting the dignity of his crown, and the honour of the nation, and to ſubmit with cheerfulneſs and ſpirit to the expenſes that would be requiſite, which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after a long debate. In the houſe of lords, the debates upon the like occaſion were attended with an acrimony of language, and a freedom of thought, that ſeemed to ſcorn all reſtraint; but the queſtion for an addreſs was carried by a majority of near three to one.</p>
                     <p>On the 21ſt of March, a public audience and recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was given to the American deputi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="unknown:028963_0276_0FDE9E2E8DFDC598"/>day before it was exhibited, the French ambaſſador, in conſequence of orders to quit London, ſet out for Paris.</p>
                     <p>An inquiry into the ſtate of the nation had been propoſed ſome time back, and continued with unabat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſiduity in both houſes. It was warmly contended by the members in oppoſition, that the preſent miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ought to be removed on account of their number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs blunders and miſcarriages in every inſtance. Sev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of the moſt reſpectable members in oppoſition, and even ſome of the oppoſite party, were of opinion, that the only way to extricate the nation from its trouble was to acknowledge the independency of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica at once; and thus do with a good grace what muſt inevitably be done at laſt, after expending much more blood and treaſure than had yet been laviſhed in this unhappy conteſt. Their independence, they ſaid, was not only already eſtabliſhed, but had obtained ſuch time to ſix and ſettle upon its foundations, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared now too firm to be ſhaken by the utmoſt efforts of Britain, even ſuppoſing it were left, without any foreign ſupport, merely to the exertions of its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtrength. But in that ſituation, to form any hope of being equal to its overthrow, under the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and ſupport of the Houſe of Bourbon, was, they ſaid, an idea only fit to be entertained by bedlamites.</p>
                     <p>On this occaſion lord Chatham made his laſt and moſt affecting ſpeech in the houſe of lords, "My lords," ſays he, "the times are alarming; the ſtate is indeed in danger! and nothing but the poor condition of my health could ſo long have prevented me from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to my duty in parliament at this very import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant period. But advice is now ſo neceſſary, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſorely preſſed by the hand of infirmity, I have made an effort, almoſt beyond my conſtitution, to come
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028963_0276_0FDE9E2E8DFDC598"/>down to the houſe to give my beſt advice to your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and to expreſs my indignation at the puſillanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the diſgraceful idea of giving up the dependence of America on the ſovereignty of Britain. Feeble as I am, I rejoice that I am yet alive, that the grave has not altogether cloſed on me, before I had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of giving my vote againſt ſo impolitic a meaſure, as the acknowledgment of the independence of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</p>
                     <p>"That our public affairs have, for ſome years paſt, been ſhamefully managed, I have frequently endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to convince your lordſhips; and although I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the meaſures which have for ſome time been adopted by the majority of this houſe, yet I have been always againſt the independence of America, and nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would ſupport meaſures carried on in unrecanted error; but after a full recantation of theſe erroneous meaſures, and after a repeal of all the oppreſſive acts, it is the duty of every lever of his country, of every good citizen, to take care, while, on the one hand, he preſerves the rights and privileges of the colonies, he does not, on the other, tarniſh the luſtre of his royal maſter's crown, nor ſink the glory of the Britiſh nation. The tendency and plain language of the preſent motion is, to diſgrace our ſovereign, and to bring reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us as a nation. It is, in a manner, totally to anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate this once great empire. I chuſe to ſpeak my ſentiments, even though there may be danger in doing ſo. I always hated reſerve; and never did approve of halting between two opinions, when there was no mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle path to ſteer with certainty. The perfidy of France ought to rouſe us, and make us ſtrain every nerve, open every vein, to preſerve our national charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to preſerve us from being ſcoffed and laughed at by foreigners. It is now abſolutely neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for peace or war; and when the former cannot
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:028963_0277_0FDE9E30DF336D40"/>be preſerved with honour, the latter ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced without heſitation. What is life without rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation? And does that perſon deſerve the name of a <hi>man,</hi> of an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who would not lay down his life, to preſerve the ancient dignity of his country? We may poſſibly fail in the attempt, but ſtill let us make an effort, one united effort, to prevent ſuch national diſgrace. If we fall in the attempt, Europe will at leaſt be convinced, that we had as much virtue left as to fall like men.</p>
                     <p>"But, it is ſaid, we ought to make peace with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica on any terms, and bring home our troops in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to protect ourſelves; in ſhort, that we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a foreign ambaſſador inſolently to tell <hi>us,</hi> that his maſter had made a bargain for that commerce which was <hi>our</hi> natural right, and entered into a treaty with <hi>our own</hi> ſubjects, without ſo much as reſenting it.— Merciful God! to what a low ebb muſt this once great empire be now reduced, when any of her ſenators (pointing to the duke of Richmond) can raiſe up his head, and with a grave face openly hold forth ſuch tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id, ſuch daſtardly counſels?—This never was the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Britain, and never ſhall be mine.—What! can it be poſſible that we are the ſame people, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixteen years ago were the envy and admiration of all the world? Is not this England?—Is not this the ſenate of Great Britain? And can we forget that we are Engliſhmen? Can we have forgot that the nation has ſtood the Daniſh irruptions—the Scotch inroads— the Norman conqueſts—the Spaniſh armada—and the various efforts of the Bourbon compacts?—Why are we blinded by deſpair? Why ſhould we ſit down in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious tameneſs; and, with a deſponding face, ſay to France, "Take from us what you will; take all we have; but do, pray, let us live and die in peace."— Shame upon ſuch diſgraceful, ſuch pitiful counſels!
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:028963_0277_0FDE9E30DF336D40"/>My God! How are we altered! What can have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſo ſudden an alteration? Is the king ſtill the ſame? I hope he is; but I fear there is ſomething in the dark, ſomething rotten near him, ſomething lurking between him and his people, which has thus diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered his empire, and tarniſhed his glory. But I truſt that we have ſtill reſources, and ſtill have courage to puniſh the perfidy of France. Why then ſhould we now give up all? and that too without a blow; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an attempt to reſent the inſults offered to us? If France and Spain are for war, why not try the iſſue with them? For, I again ſay, if we ſhould fall in the attempt, let us fall decently; and if we cannot live with honour, let us die like men. Heaven forbid that we ſhould be permitted to live one day for the purpoſe of making ſcourges for our own backs!</p>
                     <p>"At preſent I cannot point out the means for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the war; but I wiſh to recall to your lordſhips remembrance, the extent and revenue of the crown when king George III. came to take poſſeſſion of it. Your lordſhips will then be ſatisfied, that the internal reſources of the kingdom are great."</p>
                     <p>He then aſſerted the American provinces to be the inheritance of the crown, which the houſe had no right to vote away: And that before he would give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the preſent motion, the riſing hopes of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blood ſhould be brought to the houſe of lords to grant their conſent to giving up what they have a legal and natural right to expect to poſſeſs.</p>
                     <p>"Feeble and ſhattered as I am," ſays he, "yet ſo long as I have ſtrength to raiſe myſelf on my crutches, —ſo long as I can lift my hand, or utter a ſyllable, I will vote againſt the giving up the dependence of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica on the ſovereignty of Great Britain. Even if I ſhould ſtand ſingle, I will, to the laſt moment of my exiſtence, vote againſt a meaſure ſo diſhonourable to
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028963_0278_0FDE9E3267D67C80"/>my country. From my bad ſtate of health, I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that my abilities are not now ſuch as to inſure ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs even to the beſt concerted meaſures; but I ſhall always be ready, when called upon, to give an honeſt advice to my beloved ſovereign.</p>
                     <p>"I wage war with no ſet of men, nor do I wiſh to get into any of their employments. I think the king has a right to chuſe his own ſervants; but if they ſhall betray the truſt repoſed in them, I ſhall always be for an inquiry into their conduct; and, if they are found guilty, I hope there is ſtill ſpirit enough in the nation to bring miniſters to condign puniſhment. I truſt in God, however, that his majeſty will be directed to make a proper choice of his ſervants. There never was a king who ſtood more in need of honeſt and able min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters.—But I feel my conſtitution fails me.—I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways much indebted to your lordſhips for your indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. If my health would permit, if my frail carcaſe could be ſupported, I could ſpeak forever on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, when the dignity of my king and the honour of my country are at ſtake. The good of the nation is my ſole ambition, and although I do earneſtly pray for an honourable peace, yet I hope never to live ſo long as to ſee ſuch diſgrace brought on the kingdom as muſt ariſe from a peace produced by puſillanimous counſels, which any peace with America as independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtates muſt be; I feel my mind agitated at the thoughts of it. My ſoul revolts—it ſpurns at the idea of American independency; and therefore I will, on every occaſion, give it a negative."—Here his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's ſpeech was cut ſhort by extreme weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>The duke of Richmond, after paſſing the higheſt compliments on the great ſucceſs of lord Chatham's adminiſtration, appealed to the noble lord himſelf if ſuch ſucceſſes could be attained, even by the talents of a Chatham, unaſſiſted by circumſtances. Could he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028963_0278_0FDE9E3267D67C80"/>a conqueſt without means, without an army, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a navy, without money, without a revenue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out credit? He begged leave to recal to the noble lord's memory, that, when he was called to the management of affairs, the empire was in a flouriſhing ſtate; the finances were delivered to him in the higheſt ſtate of improvement to which the abilities of a Pelham could raiſe them. The national debt was ſeventy millions leſs when he came to the helm than when he left it. Could any analogy be deduced from thoſe times to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? America was then with us; ſhe is now againſt us. Our commerce was then extended and profitable; we have ſince loſt the moſt profitable branches of our trade. The African trade was diminiſhed £1,400,000 a year. Our merchant ſhips were now deſtroyed by thoſe who then protected and employed them. We have loſt ſhipping to the value of £2,600,000 in the conteſt with America, as had been proved at their lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's bar. Theſe were circumſtances unknown in other times, and required new meaſures. The braveſt princes, and the proudeſt ſtates, have been obliged to temporize, and ſubmit to circumſtances; and this was a moment for us to imitate them. But, in fact, what was the ſhocking humiliation? Acknowledge the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of America, and you have no farther quarrel with France. And what was the mighty difference between <hi>dependence</hi> and <hi>independence?</hi> It was a quarrel about words, a mere difference about ſounds: For, if we gave up taxation, if we gave up the appointment of governours, and other officers in the provinces, if we did not inſiſt on keeping up a ſtanding army there, they would only ſtand bound to us by inclination and intereſt, and the name of <hi>dependence</hi> and <hi>independence</hi> could only be deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the ſame connexion. He might be called daſtardly and puſillanimous, for adviſing peace; but he would ſhew his courage, by perſiſting in the ſame plan, in
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028963_0279_0FDE9E33EC7C32E8"/>ſpite of ſuch painful and undeſerved appellations; and he held himſelf amply juſtified in wiſhing to ſave his country, by recommending a pacification on any terms, when ſo great a man as lord Chatham had publicly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, he did not know the means of ſaving it by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war. The miniſters who had adviſed the violent meaſures againſt America, were the perſons who had deprived the heirs of the crown of their inheritance, and not thoſe who recommended a ſalutary acquieſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under the loſſes which they had rendered inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which muſt increaſe by reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Lord Chatham roſe to reply; but, after two or three unſucceſsful attempts to ſtand, fell down in a ſwoon on his ſeat. Being carried out he recovered a little, but continued in a languiſhing condition till the 12th of May, when he expired, in the 70th year of his age; and left behind him the character of one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt orators and ſtateſmen that any country has ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. His remains were interred at the public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe; and both parties ſeemed inclined to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, by the honours they paid to his memory, for the neglect with which he had been treated during the latter part of his life.</p>
                     <p>When the ſentiments expreſſed in the laſt ſpeech of lord Chatham are conſidered, it cannot appear any way extraordinary that inferior politicians, and the great body of the people, foſtered prejudices to a ſtill great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extent, concerning the dependency of the colonies on the mother country; or that the point of honour, which had before precipitated the nation into the war, now predominated over every ſuggeſtion of prudence and intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly the king and parliament of Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain determined at once to reſent the arrogance of France, and proſecute hoſtilities with America, with more vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our than ever, ſhould the terms now offered be rejected.</p>

From this time the Britiſh and French were buſied in fitting out their reſpective fleets. Though war was not actually declared, yet there could be no doubt but that theſe rival nations were in a ſtate of hoſtility. A French ſquadron, conſiſting of 12 ſhips of the line and 4 frigates,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 13.</note> commanded by count D'Eſtaing, ſailed from Toulon for America, on the 13th of April. On the 4th of May authentic intelligence of the ſailing of the French fleet arrived at St. James's. On the 8th, a fleet of 12 ſail of the line was ready for ſea, under admirals Byron and Hyde Parker. A foul wind detained them until the 20th, when they ſailed from Portſmouth. The Britiſh min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, being uncertain whither D'Eſtaing's ſquadron was deſtined, ſent an expreſs with orders for the return of the fleet, ſo that they put into Plymouth. At length, on the 5th of June they were relieved from their doubts; and admiral Byron ſet ſail on the 9th, for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, to command in that ſtation, in the room of lord Howe, who had required permiſſion to reſign.</p>
                     <p>The fleet deſtined for the defence of the iſland of Great Britain was put under the command of admiral Keppel, an officer of diſtinguiſhed merit; that of France was conducted by admiral D'Orvilliers.</p>
                     <p>The fleets met on the 27th of July, when a running fight took place, but no deciſive action. Admiral Keppel was afterwards accuſed of not having done his duty, by admiral Palliſer, the ſecond in command. He was therefore tried, but was honourably acquitted. Palliſer himſelf was likewiſe tried for diſobedience of orders, and was partly acquitted and partly condemned. The event of this engagement became a ſource of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere criticiſm in Britain; and the arguments were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with a warmth and vehemence that ſet the whole nation into a ferment of the moſt outrageous nature. Such was the height of paſſion that prevailed
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028963_0280_0FDE9E3CDD433218"/>through all claſſes of ſociety, that the critical circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the nation were wholly forgotten, and the attention of the public was entirely abſorbed in this diſpute. The diſcontent originating from this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had another very ſerious effect. The miniſtry were at a loſs to get an officer to head the navy. Sir Charles Hardy, an able commander, but who had been twenty years retired from actual ſervice, was appointed, rather becauſe nobody elſe would accept of it, than any great expectations of his activity or ſucceſs. Nothing of conſequence happened during his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but ſome unavailing parades of the French fleet in the Channel, without effecting or ſeeming to wiſh the attempting any thing.</p>
                     <p>General ſir Henry Clinton arrived at Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 8.</note> on the 8th of May, to take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the army, in the room of ſir William Howe; who returned to England, to the great regret of the Britiſh officers and ſoldiery in general. In the beginning of June, the three commiſſioners from Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain, being the earl of Carliſle, Mr. Eden, and governour Johnſtone, arrived in the Delaware, and joined ſir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Clinton, who was included in the commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſioners immediately diſpatched a letter, with the acts of parliament, a copy of their commiſſion,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 9.</note> and other papers, to the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the congreſs; but their ſecretary, Dr. Adam Ferguſon, who was intended to convey the papers and to act as an agent for conducting the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation upon the ſpot with the congreſs, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed a paſſport for that purpoſe, they were obliged to forward them by common means.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſioners propoſed, even at this outſet, ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral conceſſions and arrangements, which, at an earlier period would have reſtored peace and felicity to the whole empire. They offered to conſent to an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028963_0280_0FDE9E3CDD433218"/>ceſſation of hoſtilities by ſea and land.—To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore a free intercourſe, and renew the common bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of naturalization through the ſeveral parts of the empire.—To extend every freedom to trade, that the reſpective intereſts on both ſides could require.—To agree, that no military force ſhould be kept up in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtates of North America, without the conſent of the general congreſs, or of the particular aſſemblies.—To concur in meaſures calculated to diſcharge the debts of America, and to raiſe the credit and value of the paper circulation.—To perpetuate the common union, by a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents, from the different ſtates, who ſhould have the privilege of a ſeat and voice in the parliament of Great Britain; or if ſent from Britain, in that caſe to have a ſeat and voice in the aſſemblies of the different ſtates to which they might be deputed reſpectively, in order to attend to the ſeveral intereſts of thoſe by whom they were deputed.—And, in ſhort, to eſtabliſh the power of the reſpective legiſlatures in each particular ſtate, to ſettle its revenue, its civil and military eſtabliſhment, and to exerciſe a perfect freedom of legiſlation and internal government; ſo that the Britiſh ſtates throughout North America, acting with Great Britain in peace and war, under one common ſovereign, might have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege, that was ſhort of a total ſeparation of intereſt, or conſiſtent with that union of force, on which the ſafety of the common religion and liberty depends.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſioners, not being aware that the ſtyle and manner of thinking in the United States had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone a far greater revolution than that of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and that with their new ſituation new attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had taken place, vainly endeavoured, in their letter, to prepoſſeſs congreſs with the ancient national antipathy to France.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="214" facs="unknown:028963_0281_0FDE9E4424600AD0"/>
A decided negative having been already given, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the arrival of the Britiſh commiſſioners, to the overtures contained in the conciliatory bills, there was little ground left for farther deliberation: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe papers produced very conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, which were renewed on different days, from the 11th to the 17th of June, in the congreſs, yet the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which they returned, through the medium of their preſident, Henry Laurens, <abbr>eſq.</abbr> was ſufficiently brief, however concluſive. They obſerved to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, that, nothing but an earneſt deſire to ſpare the farther effuſion of human blood could have induced them to read a paper containing expreſſions ſo diſreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful to his moſt chriſtian majeſty, the good and great ally of theſe ſtates, or to conſider propoſitions ſo derogatory to the honour of an independent nation. They obſerved, that the acts of the Britiſh parliament, the commiſſion from their ſovereign, and their letter, ſuppoſed the people of theſe ſtates to be ſubjects of the crown of Great Britain, and were founded on the idea of dependence, which was totally inadmiſſible. They informed them that they were inclined to peace, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the unjuſt claim from which the war originated, and the ſavage manner in which it had been conducted. They would therefore be ready to enter upon the conſideration of a treaty of peace and commerce, not inconſiſtent with treaties already ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, when the King of Great Britain ſhould demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate a ſincere diſpoſition for that purpoſe. But the only ſolid proof of that diſpoſition would be an explicit acknowledgment of the independence of theſe ſtates, or the withdrawing of his fleets and armies.</p>
                     <p>Such were the conditions which a concurrence of events induced on the one ſide, and which the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame cauſes rendered inadmiſſible on the other. The congreſs, at the ſame time, iſſued an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imous
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:028963_0281_0FDE9E4424600AD0"/>approbation of general Waſhington's conduct in refuſing a paſſport to Dr. Ferguſon.</p>
                     <p>Although the congreſs, as a body, did not enter into any litigation with the commiſſioners upon the general ſubject of their miſſion, yet ſome of their members, particularly Mr. Drayton, one of the delegates for South Carolina, and others, perhaps not officially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with them, entered the liſts of controverſy in the public papers, with no ſmall degree of acrimony as well as ability. For, as the commiſſioners ſeemed to carry along with them an idea, which at the time of their appointment, was endeavoured with great care to be eſtabliſhed in Britain, viz. "that the bulk of the Americans were well affected to the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the greater part of the remainder were only held in a ſtate of deluſion by the congreſs," they accordingly, upon the failure of their negociation with that body, directed their future publications in the manner of appeals to the people at large; ſeeming thereby to realize in ſome degree, the charge ſo repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly made by their antagoniſts, that their only object was under the inſidious appearance of conciliation, to excite either a ſeparation among the colonies, or the people to tumult againſt their reſpective governments. And, as the congreſs not only permitted, but affected to forward, the publication of all matters upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſo the writers already mentioned, undertook to obviate the effect which thoſe iſſued by the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might have upon the people at large.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrongeſt argument which they held out upon this occaſion to the people was, that as they had already concluded a ſolemn treaty with France, on the footing of, and for the eſtabliſhment of their independency— that if they now treated with the commiſſioners upon the ground of dependence, they ſhould at once break their faith with France, forfeit their credit with all
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:028963_0282_0FDE9E45A7E31EE0"/>foreign nations, be conſidered as a faithleſs and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous people, and for evermore be cut off even from the hope of foreign ſuccour or reſource. At the ſame time they would be thrown totally on the mercy of thoſe who had already purſued every meaſure of fraud, force, cruelty, and deceit for their deſtruction; as neither the king, the miniſters, nor the parliament of Britain, would be under a neceſſity of ratifying any one condition which they might agree upon with the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, or if they found it neceſſary to ratify them for preſent purpoſes, it would be only to call a new par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to undo the whole. Nothing, they ſaid, could be truſted to an enemy whom they had already found ſo faithleſs, and ſo obſtinately perſevering in malice and cruelty. The fraudulent intention of the propoſed negociation, they ſaid, was ſtrongly evinced, by the commiſſioners' holding out conditions which went far beyond their avowed powers; being neither warranted by the commiſſion, nor by the acts of parliament which they preſented.</p>
                     <p>The peremptory denial of congreſs to the firſt offers of accommodation not only proved very morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to the commiſſioners, but excited their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to no ſmall degree. The individuals with whom they converſed on the ſubject of the conciliatory bill, generally returned for anſwer, that the day of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation was paſt; and that the haughtineſs of Britain had extinguiſhed all filial regard in the breaſts of the Americans. In their attempts to treat with the people at large, governour Johnſtone diſtinguiſhed himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the other commiſſioners, by endeavouring to obtain the object on which he had been ſent, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a private correſpondence with ſome of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of congreſs, or other influential characters, and drew upon himſelf of conſequence, a greater ſhare of the reſentment of congreſs. They accuſed him as a
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028963_0282_0FDE9E45A7E31EE0"/>ſpy, whoſe only view was to ſow diſſenſion among them; nay, who had attempted to bribe Joſeph Reed, <abbr>eſq.</abbr> Robert Morris, <abbr>eſq.</abbr> alſo George Waſhington, <abbr>eſq.</abbr> and preſident Laurens, to deſert the cauſe of their country, and betray it to the Britiſh; abſolutely refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the ſame time, to have any connexion with him as a commiſſioner. The proceedings in this buſineſs were expreſſed in the form of a declaration, a copy of which was ordered to be ſigned by the preſident, and ſent by a flag to the commiſſioners at New York.</p>
                     <p>Theſe proceedings produced a very angry and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent declaration from governour Johnſtone, in which the immediate operations of paſſion and diſappointment were too conſpicuous. The language of his publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but poorly agreed with the high and flattering compliments he had ſo lately laviſhed on the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans in thoſe very letters which were laid before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and which were the ſubject of the preſent conteſt. It was dated the 26th of Auguſt, and tranſmitted to congreſs; together with a declaration of the ſame date from lord Carliſle, ſir Henry Clinton, and Mr. Eden, which went to a ſolomn and total diſavowal, ſo far as as related to the preſent ſubject, of their having had any knowledge, directly or indirectly, of thoſe matters ſpecified by congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Thus were all hopes of further negociation with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs at an end. And the iſſue of this laſt effort which Great Britain made by way of negociation, to regain her colonies, convinced France of the ſincerity of her ally, and promiſed to ſecure the ſucceſs of her favourite ſcheme, to leſſen the power of Great Britain, beyond the reach of accident.</p>
                     <p>It would ſwell this work to an enormous ſize, were we to enter minutely into the paper war which enſued: we ſhall therefore now proceed to give an account of
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:028963_0283_0FDE9E472C8965D0"/>thoſe more ſerious operations which the arrival of the commiſſioners had ſcarcely interrupted.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the year, ſome ſucceſsful preda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory excurſions had been made by the Britiſh into the Jerſeys, and on the banks of the Delaware, by which the Americans ſuſtained a prodigious loſs. In one of theſe, the Britiſh deſtroyed at Bordentown four ſtore houſes; and before their return to Philadelphia they burned two frigates, nine ſhips, ſix privateer ſloops, twenty three brigs, with a number of ſloops and ſchooners.</p>
                     <p>In the end of May, an excurſion from Rhode Iſland was made by 500 Britiſh and Heſſians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of lieutenant colonel Campbell.

They deſtroyed about 70 flat bottomed boats, and burned a quantity of pitch, tar, and plank. They alſo ſet fire to the meeting houſe at Warren, and ſeven dwelling houſes. At Briſtol they burned the church and 22 houſes. Several other houſes were plundered, and ſome of the ſoldiers ſtripped the women of their ſhoe buckles, gold rings, and handkerchiefs. They carried off peaceable and defenceleſs inhabitants of the country, to be exchanged for an equal number of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers taken on their ſide in arms. Of this the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can general having made a complaint, it was replied, "that by the laws of America, every inhabitant from ſixteen to ſixty was liable to be called on to take up arms, and was therefore to be conſidered at all times, and treated as a ſoldier. It could be no injuſtice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to carry off, and detain as priſoners of war, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as could be taken, whether armed or not, to be exchanged for ſoldiers or ſailors."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="219" facs="unknown:028963_0283_0FDE9E472C8965D0"/>
The deſign of evacuating Philadelphia was put in execution on the 18th of June, at 3 o'clock in the morning, Mr. Eden, one of the commiſſioners, having brought with him ſecret inſtructions from England for that purpoſe. The troops proceeded to Glouceſter Point, three miles down the river, and before ten the whole had paſſed in ſafety acroſs the Delaware into New Jerſey.</p>
                     <p>General Waſhington having penetrated into their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of evacuating Philadelphia, had previouſly detached general Maxwell's brigade, to co-operate with the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey militia, in obſtructing their progreſs, until he could overtake them with his army. This detachment was afterwards ſtrengthened by a body of 600 men under colonel Morgan; but being unable to cope with the Britiſh force, could do nothing but break down the bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, after abandoning a ſtrong poſt they had occupied, with a view to diſpute the paſſage of the enemy. The troops therefore, purſued their march for ſome time without any interruption from the Americans, though greatly encumbered with a vaſt quantity of baggage, the number of loaded horſes and wheel carriages being ſo great as to occupy a line of twelve miles in length, though in this were included the proviſions neceſſary for their whole retreat, and which could not have been procured in a country ſo extremely inimical to the Britiſh cauſe. The march was exceedingly retarded by the heat of the weather, which at that time was exceſſive, the cloſeneſs of the narrow roads through the woods, and the conſtant labour of renewing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing bridges, in a country every where interſected with creeks and marſhy brooks.</p>
                     <p>The ſlow advance of ſir Henry Clinton led general Waſhington to ſuſpect, that he had a deſign of bringing on a general action, if he could draw the Americans into the low country. Having halted within five miles
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:028963_0284_0FDE9E540AC21EB0"/>of Princeton, he repreſented to the general officers that the enemy's force was between 9 and 10,000 rank and file—the American army on the ground 10,684 rank and file,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 24.</note> beſides the advanced brigade under general Maxwell of about 1200, and about 1200 militia, and propoſed, "Will it be adviſeable to hazard a general action?" They anſwered in the negative, but recommended a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 1500 men, to be immediately ſent, to act as occaſion might ſerve, in conjunction with the troops and militia already hanging about the left flank and rear of the enemy.</p>
                     <p>After various movements on both ſides, ſir Henry Clinton, with the royal army, arrived at a place called Freehold; where judging that the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans would attack him,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 27.</note> he encamped in a very ſtrong ſituation. Here general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington determined to make an attack as ſoon as the army had begun its march. The night was ſpent in making the neceſſary preparations, and Lee, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been lately exchanged had joined the army, was ordered to have his diviſion ready by daybreak. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ir Henry Clinton, apprehending that the chief object of the Americans was the baggage, committed it to the care of general Knyphauſen, whom he ordered to ſet out early in the morning, whilſt he followed with the reſt of the army ſome hours after, in the road towards Middletown, a place diſtant about twelve miles, in a high and ſtrong country. The attack was accordingly made; but the Britiſh general had taken ſuch care to arrange his troops properly,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 28.</note> and ſo effectually ſupported his forces when engaged with the Americans, that general Lee, although his troops behaved with great ſpirit, thought proper to retreat; and they were with difficulty preſerved from a total defeat by the advance of general Waſhington
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:028963_0284_0FDE9E540AC21EB0"/>with the whole army; who intended to have renewed the engagement the next day; but the Britiſh troops marched away in the night, without the loſs of either their covering party or baggage; and with ſuch ſilence, that general Poor, who lay very near them, knew noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their departure until it was too late to urge a purſuit.</p>
                     <p>From the diſcordant accounts of this battle, it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to collect the real truth. By the conſequences it is natural to ſuppoſe that very little was gained on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. Both parties, however, ſeem to have exerted themſelves to the utmoſt, as by the Britiſh accounts it appears that fifty-nine of their ſoldiers died of mere fatigue, without any wound; and the like happened to ſeveral American ſoldiers, notwithſtanding their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much accuſtomed to the climate. The loſs of the Americans in killed and wounded, was about 250; that of the royal army, incluſive of priſoners, was about 350. Among the latter were four officers and about forty privates, all ſo badly wounded, that they could not be removed. Their other wounded they carried off. Lieutenant colonel Monckton, one of the Britiſh ſlain, on account of his ſingular merit, was univerſally lamented. Colonel Bonner of Pennſylvania, and major Dickenſon of Virginia, officers highly eſteemed by their country, fell in this action.</p>
                     <p>In this action general Lee was charged by general Waſhington with diſobedience and miſconduct in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating before the Britiſh army. He was tried by a court martial, and ſentenced to be ſuſpended from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the American army for a twelvemonth. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were diſpleaſed with this ſentence, becauſe it had been ſubmitted to his diſcretion whether to attack or not, and likewiſe when and in what manner: and they thought that ſuſpenſion from command, was not a ſufficient puniſhment for his crimes, if guilty. They
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:028963_0285_0FDE9E559A6DE268"/>therefore inferred his innocence from the lenient ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his judges.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh army purſued their march without any interruption to the neighbourhood of Sandy Hook, and on the 5th of July croſſed the narrow channel to Sandy Hook on a bridge of boats, and were afterwards ſafely conveyed to New York. During the march from Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia, the royal army was much reduced, upwards of 800 having deſerted, a great number of whom were Heſſians.</p>
                     <p>Soon after the battle of Freehold, or Monmouth, at it is ſometimes called, the American army took poſt at the White Plains, a few miles beyond King's Bridge; and the Britiſh, though only a few miles diſtant, did not moleſt them. They remained in this poſition from an early day in July till a late one in the autumn, and then the Americans retired to Middle Brook in Jerſey, where they remained in huts, as they had done at Valley Forge.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the French fleet from Toulon had arrived at Virginia. On the 7th of July, lord Howe received advice of its arrival. Count D'Eſtaing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored on the 8th at night at the entrance of the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware. The next morning he weighed and ſailed towards the Hook, and on the evening of the 11th an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored about four miles without it. Had not bad weather and unexpected impediments prevented, the count would have ſurpriſed Howe's fleet in the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, as the latter would not have had time to eſcape after being appriſed of his danger. The deſtruction of the fleet muſt have been the conſequence of ſuch a ſurpriſal, and that muſt have occaſioned the inevitable loſs of the royal army, which would have been ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed by the French ſquadron on the one ſide, and the American forces on the other, that the Saratoga cataſtrophe muſt have been repeated. Lord Howe's
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:028963_0285_0FDE9E559A6DE268"/>fleet conſiſted only of 6 ſixty-four gun ſhips, 3 of fifty, and 2 of forty, with ſome frigates and ſloops; whereas count D'Eſtaing's conſiſted of 12 ſail of the line and ſeveral large frigates. Among the former, one carried 90 guns, another 80, and ſix 74 guns each. The French fleet had, excluſive of its complement of ſailors, 6000 marines and ſoldiers on board.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh admiral had the advantage of poſſeſſing the harbour formed by Sandy Hook; the entrance of which is covered by a bay, and from whence the inlet paſſes to New York. As it could not be known wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the French would not attempt paſſing in force over the bar, it was neceſſary the Britiſh ſhould be prepared to oppoſe them. Accordingly, the commanders made every diſpoſition that conſummate military ſkill could ſuggeſt, for withſtanding the formidable power which threatened to aſſail them. On this occaſion a ſpirit diſplayed itſelf not only in the fleet and army, but through every order and denomination of ſeamen, that is not often equalled. Tranſported with indignation againſt the French for interfering in what they called a domeſtic quarrel, the Britiſh diſplayed a zeal and magnanimity which could not be exceeded. The crews of the tranſports haſtened with eagerneſs to the ſleet, that it might be completely manned. The maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and mates of the merchantmen at New York, took their ſtations at the guns with the common ſailors: others put to ſea in light veſſels, to watch the motions of their enemies. The light infantry, grenadiers, and even wounded officers contended ſo earneſtly to ſerve as marines on board the men of war, that the point of honour was obliged to be decided by lot.</p>
                     <p>During this time the Britiſh had the mortification of ſeeing the blockade of their fleet, and the capture of about twenty veſſels under Britiſh colours. On the 22d, the French fleet appeared under weigh. The
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:028963_0286_0FDE9E5720501840"/>Britiſh, in this anxious moment, ſuppoſed that count D'Eſtaing would force his way into the harbour; when nothing leſs than deſtruction or victory would have ended the conteſt. Had the firſt been their lot, the vaſt fleet of tranſports and the army muſt have fallen.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 22.</note> D'Eſtaing, however, left the Hook and ſailed for Newport. He was led to this meaſure by the advice of general Waſhington; the pilots likewiſe aſſured him that it was impoſſible to carry the large ſhips over the bar, on account of their draught of water.</p>
                     <p>By D'Eſtaing's departure the Britiſh had a ſecond eſcape. Had he ſtaid a few days longer, admiral By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's fleet would have fallen a defenceleſs prey into his hands. That ſquadron had met with unuſual bad weather, and being ſeparated in different ſtorms, and lingering through a tedious paſſage, arrived ſcattered, broken, ſickly, diſmaſted, or otherwiſe damaged, in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious degrees of diſtreſs, upon different and remote parts of the American coaſt. Between the departure of D'Eſtaing and the 30th of July, the Renown of 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> guns from the Weſt Indies, the Raiſonable and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion of 64 and the Cornwall of 74 guns, all arrived ſingly at Sandy Hook. A number of proviſion ſhips from Cork eſcaped alſo, together with their convoy. They went up the Delaware within fifty miles of Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia after lord Howe had quitted the river, before they obtained information of what had happened. Great rejoicings were made at New York, upon their ſafe arrival, eſpecially as proviſions were much wanted both by the fleet and army.</p>
                     <p>The next attempt of the French admiral was, in conjunction with the Americans upon Rhode Iſland, which had been in poſſeſſion of the Britiſh ſince De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1776. For this purpoſe, general Sullivan aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a body of troops in the vicinity of Providence,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028963_0286_0FDE9E5720501840"/>with a view to invade the iſland from the continent, whilſt the French fleet was to enter the harbour of Newport, near its ſouthern extremity, and after deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhipping by a powerful aſſault on the works fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſea, to place the Britiſh troops between two fires. The commanding officer, general Pigot, having been lately reinforced, had about 6000 troops, and had taken every precaution which the military art could furniſh, in order to obviate the very great danger in which he was. General Sullivan, however, having collected about 10,000 men, of whom one half at leaſt were volunteers from New England and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Auguſt</hi> 8.</note> paſſed over into the iſland on the 8th of Auguſt, when the French fleet alſo entered the harbour, cannonading the batteries as they paſſed along, and receiving their fire without any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial effect on either ſide. Their entrance, however, obliged the Britiſh commanders to burn three frigates, and ſink two others.</p>
                     <p>Lord Howe no ſooner received advice of the danger which threatened Rhode Iſland, than he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

The engagement was prevented by a violent tempeſt, in which both fleets ſuffered extremely, but the French much more than the Britiſh; the conſequence of which was, that D'Eſtaing, having returned to Newport on the 20th of Auguſt, was induced, by the advice of his
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:028963_0287_0FDE9E58A524C618"/>officers, the ſecond day after, to ſet ſail for Boſton to refit his ſhips, leaving general Sullivan to carry on the enterprize againſt Rhode Iſland as he thought proper.</p>
                     <p>The loſs ſuſtained by the French fleet was ſo conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable, that ſome of their capital ſhips were in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt danger of being taken.

                     <p>In the mean time the extreme bad weather had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented general Sullivan for ſome days from bringing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his artillery and ſtores; but on the 17th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, he began his operations by erecting batteries, and making approaches to the Britiſh lines. But general Pigot had taken ſuch meaſures, that without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a marine force it was altogether impoſſible to attack him with any probability of ſucceſs. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of D'Eſtaing, therefore, who had abandoned them
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:028963_0287_0FDE9E58A524C618"/>when maſter of the harbour, gave the greateſt diſguſt to the people of New England, and Sullivan began to think of a retreat, on the Britiſh fleet being ſeen off the coaſt. The garriſon, on perceiving his intentions, fallied out upon him with ſo much vigour, that it was not without difficulty that he could effect his retreat;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Auguſt</hi> 30.</note> which, however, he did in ſuch excellent order, that although he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly attacked by the Britiſh forces, wherever an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity occurred, he met with very inconſiderable loſs, nor did he leave a ſingle article behind. Nor was his good fortune inferior to his conduct; as ſir Henry Clinton arrived at Rhode Iſland immediately after his departure, with ſuch a force as muſt have decided the fate of the American army, had they been there at that time.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day that Sullivan abandoned Rhode Iſland lord Howe entered the bay of Boſton, where, to his great mortification, he found D'Eſtaing already arrived, and ſo effectually protected by batteries in Nantaſket road, that it was utterly impoſſible to attack him with any proſpect of ſucceſs; on which he proceeded for Rhode Iſland; but finding that place already out of danger, he returned to New York, where he reſigned the command of the fleet to admiral Gambier, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to England.</p>
                     <p>Sir Henry Clinton now returned to New York,

On the 5th of September, the party landed, and in a few hours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed 70 ſail of ſhipping, beſides a number of ſmall craft. They alſo burned wharves, ſtores, veſſels on the ſtocks, and a conſiderable number of dwelling houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. The royal troops proceeded to Martha's Vineyard.

                     <p>Another expedition took place up the North River, under lord Cornwallis and general Knyphauſen, the principal event of which was the deſtruction of a reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iment of American cavalry, commanded by lieutenant colonel Baylor, whilſt watching to intercept a Britiſh foraging party. The officer, who commanded the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which ſurpriſed them, was major general Grey. He had acquired the name of the "No flint general," from his common practice of taking out the flints, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the men to the uſe of the bayonet. Grey's men proceeded with ſuch ſilence and addreſs, that they out off a ſerjeant's patrol without noiſe, and ſurrounded the barn near Tapan, in which the dragoons were aſleep.

A few eſcaped, and others who were wounded, were reſtored in a courſe of time, to perfect health. Baylor himſelf was wounded, but not dangerouſly. He loſt in killed, wounded and taken 67 privates out of 104. About 40 were made priſoners. Theſe were indebted for their lives, it is ſaid, to the humanity of one of Grey's captains, who gave quarters to the whole fourth troop, though contrary to the orders of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior officers.</p>
                     <p>A third expedition was directed to Little Egg Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in New Jerſey, a place noted for priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,

It was conducted by captains Ferguſon and Collins, and ended in the deſtruction of the privateers and other veſſels, as well as the place it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Soon after this, another body of American troops, called Pulaſki's legion, were ſurpriſed, and 50 of them put to the ſword;

<pb n="229" facs="unknown:028963_0288_0FDE9E688FB7B650"/>The attack being in the night, little quarter could be given; more would probably have been granted, had not a French captain and ſome privates, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted from count Pulaſki, falſely reported that he had iſſued public orders to grant no quarter to Britiſh troops. The ſlaughter would not have ended ſo ſoon, had not Pulaſki haſtened with his cavalry to ſupport the infantry; and the Britiſh, being only 250 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, made a haſty retreat, and returned to their boats.</p>
                     <p>But however reprehenſible the conduct of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and Heſſians might have been in the mode of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their opponents, as abovementioned, their ſeverities were far exceeded by thoſe of their allies, the Indians and American refugees. As leaders in theſe ſcenes of deſtruction, the names of colonel Butler and Brandt muſt ſtand conſigned to perpetual infamy. The form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a Connecticut tory, had been an Indian agent in the wars in Canada; and had great influence with ſome of the northern Indians; the other was an half Indian by blood, and poſſeſſed the ferocity, cruelty, and deſperate courage, which are often found united in the ſavage ſtate. It is eaſy to conceive how miſerable the ſituation of thoſe unhappy captives muſt have been, who fell into their hands, where no ſubmiſſion could procure mercy, nor any condition, age or ſex, allay their fury.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of their ravages, the ruin of the fine ſettlement of Wyoming was particularly affecting. That diſtrict, ſituated on the eaſtern branch of the Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehannah, though naturally ſeeming to belong to Pennſylvania, had been peopled by a numerous colony from Connecticut. This, however, was ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Pennſylvanians, that, after much alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it became the cauſe of actual war between the two colonies, which was not terminated until the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with the mother country obliged both parties to ſuſpend their hoſtilities. The diſtrict conſiſted of eight
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:028963_0289_0FDE9E6A1807AC20"/>townſhips, each containing a ſquare of five miles, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſituated on both ſides of the river. The climate was mild, and the ſoil luxuriouſly fertile; every perſon poſſeſſed an abundance, the fruit of moderate labour and induſtry. So that upon the whole, this ſettlement exhibited ſuch a picture of primeval happineſs, as can ſcarcely be ſuppoſed to be exceeded, indeed very ſeldom equalled, in the preſent ſtate of humanity.</p>
                     <p>In theſe happy circumſtances, the population of Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oming had become ſo great, that it had already <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In this remote ſettlement, where government was feeble, the tories were under leſs control, and could eaſily aſſemble undiſcovered. However, at one time, 27 of them were taken and ſent to Hartford in Connecticut, but they were afterwards releaſed. Theſe and others of the ſame deſcription, inſtigated by revenge againſt the Americans, from whom ſome of them had ſuffered baniſhment and loſs of property, made a common cauſe with the Indians, and in the beginning of July 1778, attacked the Wyoming ſettlement with their combined forces, eſtimated at 1100 men, 900 of which were Indians. One of the ſmaller forts, moſtly garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by thoſe called tories, was by them given up, or, as it was ſaid, betrayed; another was taken by ſtorm, where although they maſſacred the men in the moſt inhuman manner, they ſpared the women and children.</p>

He ſuffered himſelf to be enticed by his kinſman to abandon the ſecurity afforded by this fortreſs. Under colour of holding a parley for the concluſion of a treaty, he was led into an agreement to march out to hold a conference in the open field, on the enemy withdrawing their force. Yet ſuch was his diſtruſt of the enemy's deſigns, that he marched out with 400 men, being nearly his whole force. On his arrival he found no body to treat with, and yet advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the foot of the mountain, where, at a diſtance, he ſaw a flag, the holders of which, ſeemingly afraid of treachery on his ſide, retired as he advanced, whilſt he, endeavouring to remove this pretended ill impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, purſued the flag, till his party was entirely encloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he was ſuddenly freed from his deluſion, by finding it attacked at once on every ſide. His beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this dangerous ſituation, was ſuch as could ſcarcely have been expected from his former conduct: he and his party fought with reſolution and bravery, keeping up a continual and heavy fire for three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an hour, and ſeemed to be gaining ground on his numerous enemies. In this critical moment, ſome ſudden impulſe of fear, or premeditated treachery in a ſoldier, which induced him to cry out that "the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel had ordered a retreat," determined at once the fate of the party. Univerſal confuſion enſued, and no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was given. Colonel Zebulon Butler, and about 70 of his men eſcaped; the latter got acroſs the river to Wilkeſborough, the colonel made his way to Fort King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, which was inveſted the next day on the land ſide.

With theſe, as objects of particular enmity, the ſlaughter was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and they were butchered with every circumſtance of the moſt deliberate, wanton and ſavage cruelty. A captain Bedlow, who had been taken priſoner, being ſtripped naked, had his body ſtuck full of ſharp pine ſplinters, and then a heap of knots of the ſame wood being piled around him, the whole was ſet on fire; and his two companions, the captains Ranſon and Durgee,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:028963_0290_0FDE9E6BA711CCF0"/>thrown alive into the flames. The remainder of the men, with the women and children, not demanding ſo much attention, were ſhut up as before, in the houſes, which being ſet on fire, they periſhed altogether in the flames.</p>
                     <p>A general ſcene of devaſtation was now ſpread through all the townſhips. Fire and ſword alternately triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     <p>Though the Americans were fully reſolved to take ample vengeance for the barbarities committed at Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oming, their attention was ſo much engaged by affairs of the utmoſt importance that they cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d not for ſome time undertake any thing of conſequence againſt thoſe who had been perpetrators of that horrid tragedy. A ſmall expedition, however, was, during the courſe of the ſummer, undertaken from Virginia, by colonel Clarke, with no more than 200 or 300 men. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was to reduce thoſe French ſettlements which had been planted by the Canadians on the upper Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſippi, ſituated in a fine fertile country called the <hi>Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> from a nation of Indians of that name. Much of the miſchief which had fallen upon the back ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was attributed to the governour of thoſe colonies, who, it was ſaid, had acted as an agent for the Britiſh, and beſides his paying a large reward for ſcalps, had been indefatigable in his endeavours to excite the Ohio and Miſſiſippi Indians to attack the defenceleſs parts of the colonies. In proſecution of this deſign, the troops were obliged to traverſe 1200 miles of a boundleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated deſert, in which they endured indeſcribable hardſhips and fatigue, both by land and water; and
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:028963_0291_0FDE9E6D2B79BED8"/>on the two laſt days of their march to the principal town of the ſettlement named Kaſkaſkias, they were without any ſubſiſtence. The town conſiſted of about 250 houſes, and was fortified in ſuch a manner as would have ſufficed to withſtand a much ſtronger en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy. The Americans were ſo diſtreſſed with hunger and fatigue that they were determined to ſucceed or periſh in the attempt. They arrived at the town about midnight; and ſo complete was the ſurpriſe, that the town and ſort were taken without oppoſition, before the people were well awake; and the inhabitants were ſo effectually ſecured, that not a ſingle perſon eſcaped to alarm the neighbouring ſettlements. The governour, Philip Rocheblave, was conſidered as ſuch an inveter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate enemy to the United States, that he was ſent to Virginia with all the written inſtructions he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Detroit, Quebeck, and Michillimackinack, for inſtigating and paying the Indians. The inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were obliged to take an oath of allegiance to the United States; and the conquerors took up their head quarters at Kaſkaſkias. The ſmaller towns were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued without difficulty; and the inhabitants, without compulſion, flocked in by hundreds, to take the oath to their new maſters.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe called tories, who had been the immediate actors in the maſſacre at Wyoming, now became the object of vengeance. In October 1778, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The enemy inhabited the country about the upper parts of the Suſquehannah, and were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with the Indians, as to be in a manner united to them. The difficulties which colonel Butler's men encountered in this expedition, could not be undergone but by men poſſeſſed of a great ſhare of hardineſs both
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:028963_0291_0FDE9E6D2B79BED8"/>of body and mind. They were obliged to carry their proviſions on their backs, and thus loaded, frequently to wade through creeks and rivers. They, however, accompliſhed the deſtruction of the Tory and Indian villages on both ſides of the Suſquehannah; but the inhabitants eſcaped. The fruits of a plentiful harveſt, together with the only ſaw mill and griſt mill in that whole country, ſhared the fate of the houſes, and every other article uſeful or neceſſary to man. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive expedition was completed in ſixteen days.

                     <p>An expedition was deſigned againſt the Virginia back ſettlers by Henry Hamilton, lieutenant governour of Detroit, but, by the ſpirited exertions of colonel Clarke, his plan was entirely deranged.

                     <p>Colonel G. Van Schaick, with 55 men, marched from Fort Schuyler to the Onon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dago ſettlements,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="236" facs="unknown:028963_0292_0FDE9E7A0C5BC1E0"/>kind were killed. Twelve Indians were killed, and thirty-four made priſoners; and their arms and ammunition were either deſtroyed or carried off.</p>
                     <p>The account of the war with the Indians being but little connected with the military tranſactions to be hereafter deſcribed, we ſhall in this place finiſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the ſavage ſcenes.</p>
                     <p>The expeditions againſt the Indians already related, were, however, but a ſmall part of the chaſtiſement to which theſe barbarians were deſtined. The languid manner in which the campaign at that time happened to be carried on at New York, afforded leiſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to pour forth upon them that exemplary vengeance which they had threatened. The objects of this ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance were the Six Nations, commonly called the Mohawks, whoſe confederacy ſeems to form in theſe deſerts the wide outlines of a republic. Theſe nations inhabit that immenſe and fertile tract of country which lies between New England, the middle ſtates and the province of Canada; and had long been renowned for the courage, conſtancy and fidelity, with which they had adhered to the Engliſh in their wars with the French; and had even aſſiſted them frequently againſt different nations of their own countrymen. They had been adviſed by congreſs, and they had promiſed to obſerve a neutrality in the war, but they ſoon departed from this line of conduct. The Oneidas and a few others were friends to the Americans, but a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority took part decidedly againſt them. Overcome by the preſents of ſir John Johnſon and other Britiſh agents, and their own native appetite for depredation, they invaded the frontiers, carrying ſlaughter and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clation wherever they went.</p>
                     <p>It was therefore thought expedient to diſpatch gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Sullivan on this expedition. The army, when joined on the 21ſt of Auguſt by general James Clinton,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:028963_0292_0FDE9E7A0C5BC1E0"/>amounted to 5000 men, including batteaux men, wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goners, &amp;c. The train of artillery conſiſted of ſix light field pieces and two howitzers; and, to quicken the celerity of the march, the army was furniſhed with 1400 horſes. All theſe preparations were made againſt 550 Indians, accompanied by about 250 tories, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than 800 in all, headed by Butler, Brandt, Guy Johnſon and Macdonald.</p>
                     <p>The Indians marched boldly towards their frontiers to meet the invaders. They poſſeſſed themſelves of a difficult paſs in the woods, between Chemung and Newtown, in the neighbourhood of Teago River, where they conſtructed a ſtrong breaſtwork, of about half a mile in extent, made of large logs; from whence other works of leſs-ſtrength reachee for a mile and a half to the top of a mountain in their rear, where a ſecond breaſtwork was formed. Here a fierce attack commenced on the 29th of Auguſt 1779, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for two hours. The Indians reſiſted with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common bravery; nor could the breaſtwork have been forced without the aſſiſtance of the artillery, which the provincial army had carried along with them. The Indians, however, on perceiving that ſome diſpoſitions were made for turning their flank, and thereby cutting off their retreat, no perſuaſions could prevail on them to ſtand their ground any longer. They fled with the utmoſt precipitation; and ſo complete was the victory obtained by general Sullivan on this occaſion, that the enemy never dared to make another ſtand to interrupt the deſolation of their country.</p>
                     <p>The next and greateſt difficulty which the invaders met with was want of proviſions. Several cauſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them from procuring above half the quantity neceſſary for the expedition, which it was not expected could be finiſhed in leſs than a month. But the violent deſire of being revenged on the barbarians
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:028963_0293_0FDE9E7B925F3B58"/>againſt whom they were ſent, with the animating ſpeeches of their commander, removed all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the propoſal of ſhort allowance was received with the loudeſt ſhouts of approbation; and the ration for twenty-four hours was fixed at half a pound of flour, and as much beef per day; the reduction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending even to ſalt.</p>
                     <p>In attempting to proceed into the Indian country, Sullivan found to his ſurpriſe that no guides could be found to direct him; and the only method he had of finding his way to their towns, was that which direct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>All theſe difficulties were, however, overcome; the towns were found out, and ſuch a ſcene of deſolation begun as muſt be read with horrour, and which noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not even the implacable nature of their enemies, could juſtify. Forty of their towns, the largeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 128 houſes, were deſtroyed; their corn, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted at no leſs than 160,000 buſhels, ſhared the ſame fate; their fruit trees were cut down, and themſelves purſued and ſlaughtered, till there was not, as far as the conquering army could perceive, a ſingle houſe, field of corn, or inhabitant remaining in the whole country. Several officers, however, particularly gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Hand and colonel Durbin, wiſhed the general to ſpare the fruit trees; but he, when requeſted to retract his orders, continued relentleſs, and ſaid, "The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians ſhall ſee that there is malice enough in our hearts to deſtroy every thing that contributes towards their ſupport." Some of theſe officers, already mentioned,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:028963_0293_0FDE9E7B925F3B58"/>when ſent out, would not ſee any apple or peach trees, ſo that a few were left to bloſſom and bear for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of friend or foe that might chance to paſs that way. In this expedition it was remarked, that the Indians had attained to a much higher degree of knowledge of the uſeful arts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In ſome places the houſes were not only large, but elegant, and built of frame work. The ſize of corn, ſome ears of which were twenty-two inches in length, and the high degree of cultivation of their grounds, alſo excited wonder; and ſo numerous were the fruit trees, that in one orchard, alone, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is not known how many of the Americans were leſt; but the general brought back only 300 horſes out of 1400 which he had taken with him. After this expedition, the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, although not reſtored to perfect tranquility, were greatly freed from the calamities, in which they had been lately involved.</p>
                     <p>Before, and after, the termination of the above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, ſome detached parties diſtreſſed ſeveral ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the United States. A party of 60 Indians, and 27 white men, under Brandt, attacked the Miniſink ſettlement, and burnt ten houſes, twelve barns,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 23.</note> a fort and two mills, and carried off much plunder, together with ſeveral priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The militia from Goſhen and the vicinity, to the amount of 149, purſued the invaders with ſo little cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they were themſelves ſurpriſed and defeated. About the ſame time, general Williamſon and colonel Pickens, both of South Carolina, burned and deſtroyed
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:028963_0294_0FDE9E7D1E7F01C0"/>the corn of eight towns, adjacent to the frontiers of that ſtate, and forced the Indians to remove into more remote ſettlements.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame month colonel Broadhead carried deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation into the ſettlements of the Mingo, Munſey and Seneca Indians. He left Pittſburgh with 605 men, and, having penetrated about 200 miles from the fort, deſtroyed a number of Indian huts and about 500 acr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the months of Auguſt and October 1780, the frontiers of the ſtate of New York ſuffered conſiderably from Indians and their tory aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates.
<note place="margin">1780.</note> The principal part of Canijohary, a fine ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about 56 miles from Albany, was deſtroyed. They burned 27 houſes at Schoharie, and 20 at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Creek. In another irruption they attacked Stone Arabia, Canafioraga and Schohavie. A great extent of country about the Mohawk River was likewiſe laid waſte, numbers of the ſettlers killed, and many made priſoners.</p>

The invaders, in this expedition, defeated a party of the enemy, with ſuch deciſion that only three Indians eſcaped after having been once ſeen. A new and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful mode of fighting them was introduced. The American militia, after firing three rounds, ruſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on horſeback, and charged the Indians with drawn ſwords. The vanquiſhed Cherokees ſued for
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:028963_0294_0FDE9E7D1E7F01C0"/>peace, on the moſt ſubmiſſive terms, and obtained it, upon promiſing to deliver up ſuch as ſhould inſtigate them to make war upon the United States. General Pickens had the good fortune not to loſe a ſingle man upon this occaſion, and had only two wounded.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of the war, in 1782, there was a barbarous and unprovoked maſſacre of ſome civilized Indians,
<note place="margin">1782.</note> who had been ſettled near the Muſkingum. Theſe, under the influence of ſome pious miſſionaries of the Moravian perſuaſion, had been formed into ſome degree of civil and relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious order. They abhorred war, and would take no part therein. They ſaid that "The Great Being did not make men to deſtroy men, but to love and aſſiſt each other." From a love of peace, they adviſed thoſe of their own colour, who were bent on war, to deſiſt from it. They were alſo led by humanity, to inform the white people of their danger, when they knew that their ſettlements were about to be invaded. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the hoſtile Indians to ſuch a degree, that they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ried theſe pacific people quite away from Muſking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um to a bank of Sanduſky creek. They, finding corn dear and ſcarce in their new habitations, obtained lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to come back in the fall of the ſame year to Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingum, that they might collect the crops they had planted before their removal.</p>
                     <p>When the white people, at and near Monongahela, heard that a number of Indians were at the Moravian towns on the Muſkingum, they gave out that their intentions were hoſtile. Without any farther inquiry, 160 of them croſſed the Ohio, and put to death theſe harmleſs, inoffenſive people, though they made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. In conformity to their religious principles, theſe Moravians patiently ſubmitted to their hard fate, without attempting to deſtroy their murderers. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 90 of this pacific ſect were killed by men,
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:028963_0295_0FDE9E7EA5D103D8"/>who; whilſt they called themſelves Chriſtians, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more deſerving of the name of Savages th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> thoſe whom they inhumanly murdered.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this unprovoked maſſacre, a party of the Americans ſet out for Sanduſky, to deſtroy the Indian towns in that quarter; but the Delawares, Wyand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> and other Indians defeated them; ſome were killed, and ſeveral were taken priſoners. Among the latter was colonel Crawford and his ſon in law. The colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel was ſacrificed to the manes of thoſe Indians who were maſſacred at the Moravian towns; and the other priſoners were tomahawked.</p>
                     <p>In this manner the ſavage war was carried on in America. The deſolation, and cruelty inflicted by the Indians, and retorted by the Americans, were ſufficient to excite compaſſion in the moſt obdurate hearts.</p>
                     <p>TILL the autumn of 1778, the ſeat of war betwixt the Britiſh and Americans had been chiefly confined to New York,
<note place="margin">1778.</note> the Jerſies, Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, and the borders of Connecticut; whilſt the ſouthern colonies enjoyed a profound tranquillity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only ſome petty hoſtilities between the colonies of Georgia and Eaſt Florida. The Americans had in the beginning of the year projected the conqueſt of Weſt Florida. Captain Willing, with a party of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute men, had made a ſucceſsful incurſion into the country called Natches, and greatly alarmed the whole colony of Weſt Florida; and, although the people were totally in his power, granted them every condition which they required for their preſent and future ſecurity. His views, however, were thought at this time not to have been entirely confined to the reduction of theſe ſettlements, but to have extended to the opening of a correſpondence with the Spaniards at New Orleans, as it was known that the court of Spain was about to make a declaration in favour of the Americans. This
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:028963_0295_0FDE9E7EA5D103D8"/>drew the attention of the Britiſh commander ſo much to the ſouthward, that he reſolved upon an immediate conqueſt of Georgia; which was alſo deſirable on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the quantity of rice it produced. It was likewiſe known that the continental credit in Europe was chiefly upheld by the ſouthern colonies, from whom France took off ſuch quantities of their moſt valuable productions, that their trade ſeemed little affected by the war, farther than what it ſuffered from the Britiſh cruizers.</p>
                     <p>The motives juſt mentioned, and perhaps ſome oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, now induced the Britiſh commanders to take the reſolution, which afterwards proved fatal to their proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, of dividing their force, by ſending a detachment to the ſouthward. The conduct of the expedition was committed to lieutenant colonel Archibald Campbell, a brave and able officer, whoſe ſevere and tedious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment in Concord gaol has been already related. He embarked at New York for Savannah, with a force of about 2000 men,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nov.</hi> 27.</note> eſcorted by a ſmall ſquadron of ſhips of war, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by commodore Hyde Parker; whilſt general Prevoſt, who commanded in Eaſt Florida, was directed to ſet out with all the force he could ſpare. The armament arrived at the iſland Tybee the 23d of December,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 23.</note> and lieutenant colonel Campbell being informed by two men whom he ſeized, that the batteries for the defence of the town were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and out of repair, and at the ſame time receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch exact accounts of the ſituation of two armed gallies, as effectually to cut off their retreat. The troops effected a landing, under the conduct of captain Stanhope, who acted as a volunteer on the occaſion, at a place which ſeemed capable of defence againſt a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior force. The loſs upon the occaſion was only 7 men, one of which was a very brave officer, captain
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:028963_0296_0FDE9E882814D188"/>Cameron, of the light infantry. The ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Americans, under major general Robert Howe, diſplayed equal want of reſolution in the men, and of military ſkill in the commander. Having taken what he ſuppoſed to be a very ſtrong poſt, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to amuſe himſelf with an idle cannonade, to which the Britiſh never anſwered a ſingle gun, until part of the light infantry, privately conducted by a negro through a woody ſwamp, were ready to fall upon their rear, at the ſame time that they found themſelves attacked in front and in flank by the remainder of the army, with a well directed artillery. The Americans retreated with ſuch rapidity, that only about 80 were killed and 30 more drowned in an attempt to croſs a ſwamp. Thirty eight commiſſioned officers, 415 non commiſſioned officers and privates, 48 pieces of cannon, 23 mortars, the fort with its ammunition and ſtores, a large quantity of proviſions, with the town of Savannah itſelf, and all the ſhipping, inſtantly fell into the hands of the victors. The broken remains of the American army retreated up the river Savannah for ſeveral miles, and then took refuge in South Carolina.</p>
                     <p>In ten days the whole province of Georgia was reduced,
<note place="margin">1779.</note> Sunbury alone excepted; and this was alſo brought under ſubjection by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Prevoſt in his march northward. Every proper method was taken to ſecure the tranquility of the country; and rewards were offered for apprehending committee and aſſembly men, or ſuch as they judged inimical to the Britiſh cauſe. Such was the moderation, prudence and policy of lieutenant colonel Campbell, that he effected what had never happened in America after the declaration of independence. He not only ſecured the ſubmiſſion of the inhabitants, but, for a time, ſubverted every trace of republican government, and ſaw a legiſlative body convened under the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:028963_0296_0FDE9E882814D188"/>of Great Britain. On the arrival of general Prevoſt, the command devolved on him as ſenior officer; and the conqueſt of Carolina was next projected.</p>
                     <p>The affairs of the United States were at this period in the moſt diſtreſſed, deplorable, and ruinous condition. Idleneſs, diſſipation, and extravagance, ſeemed to have engroſſed the attention of the generality of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſons of liberty; and ſelf intereſt, ſpeculation, and an inſatiable thirſt for riches appeared to have got the better of every other conſideration, and almoſt of every order of men. Party diſputes and perſonal quarrels were too much the general object, whilſt the moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concerns of the empire, a vaſt accumulation of debt, ruined finances, depreciated money, and want of credit, which naturally brings on the want of every thing, were but ſecondary conſiderations, and poſtponed by congreſs from time to time, as if their affairs had been in the moſt flouriſhing condition. The paper curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Philadelphia was daily ſinking, and at length fell ſo low as fifty per cent; yet an aſſembly, a concert, a dinner, or ſupper, which coſt two or three hundred pounds, did not only take men off from acting, but even from thinking of what ought to have been neareſt their hearts. Some of the moſt diſintereſted and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotic Americans felt more diſtreſs from this review of things, than they had done at any other time, from the diſappointments and loſſes in the courſe of the war.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time monſ. Gerard, the French am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, manifeſted a deſire, that the war might not be prolonged by too high and unreaſonable demands, and that the United States would reduce their ultimatum as low as poſſible. He ſtrongly recommended moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as the fate of the war was uncertain; and he hinted, that a deciſive naval engagement in favour of the Britiſh, might give a great turn to their affairs.</p>
                     <p>The South Carolina delegates had, towards the end of the former year, requeſted the congreſs to appoint
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:028963_0297_0FDE9E8D23F02E18"/>general Lincoln, on whoſe character they juſtly repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great confidence, to the command of all the forces to the ſouthward. Accordingly they made the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he repaired to Charleſton.</p>
                     <p>In the attempt of the Britiſh upon Carolina that was no ſmall probability of ſucceſs. The country con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a great number of friends to government, who now eagerly embraced the opportunity of declaring themſelves; moſt of the inhabitants of Georgia had joined the royal ſtandard; and there was not in the province any conſiderable body of provincial forces ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of oppoſing the efforts of regular and well diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined troops. On the firſt news of general Prevoſt's approach, the loyaliſts aſſembled in a body, imagining themſelves able to ſtand then ground until their allies ſhould arrive; but in this they were diſappointed. The Americans attacked and defeated them with the loſs of half their number. The remainder retreated into Georgia; and after undergoing many difficulties, at laſt effected a junction with the Britiſh forces.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, general Lincoln, with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able body of American troops, had encamped within 20 miles of the town of Savannah; and another ſtrong party had poſted themſelves at a place called <hi>Briar</hi>'s <hi>Creek,</hi> farther up the river of the ſame name. Thus the extent of the Britiſh government was likely to be circumſcribed within very narrow bounds. General Prevoſt therefore determined to diſlodge a party under general Aſhe, conſiſting of about 2000 men; and the latter, truſting to their ſtrong ſituation, and being remiſs in their guard,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 3.</note> ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſurpriſed; when they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly routed with the loſs of more than 300 killed and taken, beſides a great number drowned in the river or the ſwamps. The whole artillery, ſtores, baggage, and almoſt all the arms of this unfortunate party <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:028963_0297_0FDE9E8D23F02E18"/>ſo that they could no more make any ſtand; and thus the province of Georgia was once more freed from the provincials, and a communication opened with thoſe places in Carolina where the royaliſts chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided.</p>
                     <p>The victory at Briar's Creek proved of conſiderable ſervice to the Britiſh cauſe. Great numbers of the loyaliſts joined the army, and conſiderably increaſed its force. Hence general Prevoſt was enabled to ſtretch his poſts farther up the river, and to guard all the principal paſſes: ſo that general Lincoln was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a ſtate of inaction; and at laſt moved off towards Auguſta, in order to protect the provincial aſſembly, which was obliged to ſit in that place, the capital being now in the hands of the Britiſh.</p>
                     <p>Lincoln had no ſooner quitted his poſt, than it was judged a proper time by the Britiſh general to put in execution the grand ſcheme which had been meditated againſt Carolina. Many difficulties indeed lay in his way. The river Savannah was ſo ſwelled by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive rains of the ſeaſon, that it ſeemed impaſſable; the oppoſite ſhore, for a great way, was ſo full of ſwamps and marſhes, that no army could march over it without the greateſt difficulty; and, to render the paſſage ſtill more difficult, general Moultrie was left with a conſiderable body of troops in order to oppoſe the enemy's attempts. But in ſpite of every oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the perſeverance of the Britiſh troops at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. General Moultrie was obliged to retire tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards Charleſton; and the purſuing army, after having waded through the marſhes for ſome time, at laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in an open country, through which they marched with great rapidity towards the capital; whilſt general Lincoln made preparations to march to its relief.</p>
                     <p>Certain intelligence of the danger to which Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was expoſed animated the American general. A
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:028963_0298_0FDE9E8EAA3822D0"/>choſen body of infantry, mounted on horſeback for the greater expedition, was diſpatched before him; whilſt Lincoln himſelf followed with all the forces he could collect. General Moultrie too, with the troops he had brought from the Savannah, and ſome others he had collected ſince his retreat from thence, had taken poſſeſſion of all the avenues leading to Charleſton, and prepared for a vigorous defence. But all oppoſition proved ineffectual;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 12.</note> and the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh army was allowed to come within can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhot of Charleſton.</p>
                     <p>The town was now ſummoned to ſurrender, and the inhabitants would gladly have agreed to obſerve a neutrality during the reſt of the war, and would have engaged alſo for the reſt of the province. But theſe terms not being accepted, they made preparations for a vigorous defence. It was not, however, in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Britiſh commander at this time to make an attack with any proſpect of ſucceſs. His artillery was not of ſufficient weight; there were no ſhips to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the attack by land: and general Lincoln advancing rapidly with a ſuperior army, threatened to incloſe him between his own force and the town; ſo that ſhould he fail in his firſt attempt, certain deſtruction would be the conſequence. For theſe reaſons he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his forces from before the town, and took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of two iſlands, called <hi>St. James's</hi> and <hi>St. John's,</hi> lying to the ſouthward; where having waited ſome time, his force was augmented by the arrival of two frigates. With theſe he determined to make himſelf maſter of Port Royal, another iſland poſſeſſed of an excellent harbour and many other natural advantages, from its ſituation alſo commanding all the ſea coaſt from Charleſton to Savannah River. The American general, however, did not allow this to be accompliſhed without oppoſition. Perceiving that his opponent had
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:028963_0298_0FDE9E8EAA3822D0"/>occupied an advantageous poſt on St. John's iſland, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to his enterpriſe againſt Port Royal, he attempted to diſlodge them from it;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 20.</note> but, after an obſtinate attack, the provincials were obliged to retire with conſiderable loſs. On this occaſion the ſucceſs of the Britiſh arms was in a great meaſure owing to an armed float; which galled the right flank of the provincials ſo effectually, that they could direct their efforts only againſt the ſtrongeſt parts of the lines, which proved impregnable to their attacks. This diſappointment was inſtantly followed by the loſs of Port Royal, which general Prevoſt took poſſeſſion of, and put his troops into proper ſtations, waiting for the arrival of ſuch reinforcements as were neceſſary for the intended attack on Charleſton.</p>
                     <p>The profligate conduct of the refugees, and the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and ſoldiers of the Britiſh, in plundering the houſes of individuals, during this incurſion, is incredible. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes were ſeduced or forced from their maſters; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture and plate were ſeized without decency or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and the moſt infamous violations of every law of honour and honeſty were openly perpetrated.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt general Prevoſt was employed in the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions already related, ſir Henry Clinton ſent a naval and land force to make an inroad into Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 10.</note> under the command of ſir George Collier and general Mathews. The fleet having ſafely paſſed the capes of Virginia, a man of war with ſome armed tenders were left to block up James's River, whilſt ſir George Collier, ſhifting his pendant to a frigate, proceeded with the ſmaller ſhips of war and tranſports up Elizabeth River. The town of Portſmouth, and the remains of Norfolk on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide of the river, fell of courſe into their hands. The Americans burned ſome of their own veſſels, but others fell into the hands of the invaders. The Britiſh
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:028963_0299_0FDE9E902F127DC8"/>guards marched 18 miles in the night, and, arriving at Suffolk by morning, proceeded to the deſtruction of veſſels, naval ſtores, and magazines of proviſions. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery houſe in the town was conſigned to the flames, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the church and one dwelling houſe. Similar deſtruction took place at Kemp's Landing, Shepherd's Goſport, Tanner's Creek, and other places in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity. The frigates and armed veſſels at the ſame time carried ruin along the margin of the rivers. Three thouſand hogſheads of tobacco were taken at Portſmouth. Above 130 veſſels in all were either deſtroyed or taken, excluſive of thoſe which were on the ſtocks; and ſeveral thouſand barrels of pork, with other proviſions in proportion, which had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for general Waſhington's army, were deſtroyed; as were likewiſe all kind of ſtores which could not be carried off. The fleet and army, after demoliſhing Fort Nelſon, and ſetting fire to the ſtore houſes and other public buildings in the dock yard at Goſport, returned with their prizes and booty ſafe to New York, in the ſame month in which they had left it.</p>
                     <p>The ſucceſs with which this expedition was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, induced ſir Henry Clinton to attempt another. The provincials had been for ſome time engaged in erecting two ſtrong forts on the North River; the one at Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plank's Neck on the eaſt, and the other at Stoney Point on the weſt ſide. Theſe, when completed, would have been of the utmoſt ſervice to the Americans, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the principal paſs called <hi>King's Ferry,</hi> between the northern and ſouthern colonies. As theſe were nearly completed, but not yet defenſible, ſir Henry thought it a proper time to avail himſelf of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and to reap the fruits of their toil; general Waſhington being at too great a diſtance, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe incapable of giving any interruption.</p>

                        <pb n="251" facs="unknown:028963_0299_0FDE9E902F127DC8"/>
The troops embarked for this ſervice, were commanded by major general Vaughan,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 30.</note> and before they ſet ſail were joined by the force from Cheſapeak, with whom they proceeded up the North River. Next day general Vaughan, with the greater part of the army landed on the eaſt ſide of the river about eight miles from Verplanks; whilſt the remainder, under the conduct of general Pattiſon, and accompanied by the commander in chief, advancing farther up, landed within three miles of Stoney Point. On the appearrance of the ſhips, the Americans aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the place, after ſetting fire to a large block houſe; and though ſome ſhew of reſiſtance was made on the approach of the troops to take poſſeſſion of Stoney Point, they did not venture to ſtand an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
                     <p>On the oppoſite ſide of the river, the Americans had completed a ſmall but ſtrong fort called La Fayette, which was defended by four pieces of artillery, and a garriſon of between 70 and 80 men. But the little redoubt was effectually commanded by Stoney Point, which is ſituated at about 1000 yards diſtance on the oppoſite ſhore; and being exceedingly difficult of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach on its own ſide, at leaſt for the conveyance of artillery, the attack was accordingly intended from the other. For this purpoſe, a party under general Patti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with infinite fatigue and labour, during the night, overcame the difficulties of dragging the heavy artillery from a very bad landing place, up a ſteep precipice to the top of the hill, and by five in the morning had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a battery of cannon, and another of mortars, on the ſummit of the difficult rocks of Stoney Point, which poured a dreadful fire on Fort la Fayette; whilſt Vaughan with his diviſion, making a long circuit round the hills, arrived and cloſely inveſted it by land. In the mean time ſir George Collier advanced with the
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:028963_0300_0FDE9E9C1972A600"/>gallies and gunboats within reach of the ſort; and as ſoon as it was dark anchored two of his gallies above it, ſo as to prevent the eſcape of the garriſon by water. The garriſon, finding their ſire overpowered, and their eſcape cut off, ſurrendered themſelves priſoners of war next morning, without any other ſtipulation than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane treatment. Sir Henry Clinton, moving his main body up the North River, occaſioned the American ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to move from their encampment at Middlebrook towards Weſt Point, for which they were in fear, the garriſon being few, and the fort not completed. Sir Henry Clinton gave directions for completing the works of both the captured poſts. For their better ſupport, and with a view to farther operations, he encamped his army at Phillipſburgh, about half way down the river towards New York Iſland. By the loſs of theſe poſts, the provincials in the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys were under a neceſſity of making a circuit of above ninety miles through the mountains, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the countries eaſt of Hudſon's River.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of the hoſtile armies on both ſides, with reſpect to actual force, together with the want of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey and deficiency of military proviſions on the one ſide, neceſſarily limited the views of the oppoſite command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and prevented their undertaking any deciſive or extenſive operations. They were each in a ſtrong ſtate of defence, and neither had ſuch a ſuperiority <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> force as could compel the other to relinquiſh the advantages of his ſituation. General Waſhington was, beſides, in expectation of foreign aid; and it would have been inconſiſtent with his uſual caution and judgment, to have run the hazard, by any previous attempt, of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening his ſtrength to ſuch a degree as might render him incapable of profiting by the aſſiſtance of his ally, and the American arms and force of courſe contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible in his eyes. The campaign was accordingly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid,
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:028963_0300_0FDE9E9C1972A600"/>and its operations confined to the ſurpriſe of poſts and to deſultory excurſions; to the laſt of which, the Americans were now, as well as at all times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly expoſed, and upon no footing of equality with their enemy.</p>
                     <p>The numberleſs ſmall cruiſers, whale boats, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſmall craft from the Connecticut coaſts, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the Sound, lying between that ſtate and Long Iſland, were ſo watchful in their depredations, and their ſituation afforded them ſuch opportunities, that they had nearly deſtroyed the trade to and from New York on that ſide, to the great diſtreſs of the city, as well as of the fleet and army. Upon this account, ſir Henry Clinton and ſir George Collier, determined on a courſe of deſultory invaſions on that coaſt, with a view of curing the evil, by cutting off the means of depredation in the deſtruction of their privateers, and, as far as it could be done, of their other veſſels and materials for building,</p>
                     <p>Governour Tryon was appointed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the land forces,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 5.</note> conſiſting of about 2,600 men, and he was ſeconded by brigadier gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Garth, an officer of diſtinguiſhed merit and ability. The forces were landed at the town of New Heaven, which they inſtantly took poſſeſſion of, as well as of a battery which covered it, without any great loſs, though conſiderable reſiſtance was made by the inhabitants and militia. The fort with all the naval and military ſtores were deſtroyed; but the town, though at firſt doomed to deſtruction, was ſpared, as the militia had not attempted to moleſt the troops in their retreat. From New Haven the ſleet ſailed to Fairfield, where the troops were again landed and again oppoſed. Here the town was ſet on fire, and conſumed, with every thing of value; and the ſame deſolation took place at Norwalk, where the militia were more numerous, and
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:028963_0301_0FDE9E9DA0C95750"/>made a greater reſiſtance than in other places. Here the loſs of the Americans was great; both Norwalk and Greenfield, a ſmall town in the neighbourhood, were totally deſtroyed, with a conſiderable number of ſhips either finiſhed or on the ſtocks, and a ſtill greater number of whale boats and ſmall craft, with ſtores and merchandize to a large amount. The places taken were generally plundered: whigs and tories, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately, though not univerſally, had their money, plate, rings and other articles taken from them; and much of their furniture was wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>ly deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>The fires and deſtruction which accompanied this expedition, were ſeverely cenſured by the Americans, and apologiſed for by the Britiſh in a very unſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory manner. The latter, in their vindication, alleged that the houſes which they had burned gave ſhelter to the Americans, whilſt they fired from them, and on other occaſions concealed their retreat. Governour Tryon undertook to juſtify theſe meaſures on princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of policy. "I ſhould be very ſorry," ſaid he, "if the deſtruction of theſe villages would be thought leſs reconcileable to humanity, than the love of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, my duty to the king, and the laws of arms. The uſurpers have profeſſedly placed their hopes of ſevering the empire in avoiding deciſive actions—upon the waſte of the Britiſh treaſures, and upon the eſcape of their own property during the protracting of the war. Their power is ſupported by the general dread of their tyranny and threats, practiſed to inſpire a credulous multitude with a preſumptuous confidence in our forbearance; I wiſh to detect this deluſion."</p>
                     <p>Among other views of the Britiſh commander in the Connecticut expedition, it was ſuppoſed to be a probable method of drawing general Waſhington from his ſtrong poſts in the high lands into the low country, where he might be forced to a battle on diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:028963_0301_0FDE9E9DA0C95750"/>terms; but this cautious general, in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, avoided the ſnare. And although general Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons was cloſely connected with Connecticut, and, from his ſmall force, unable to make ſucceſsful oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the invaders, inſtead of preſſing general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington for a large detachment of continental troops, he wrote to him as follows; "The Britiſh may prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſtreſs the country exceedingly, by the ravages they will commit, but I would rather ſee all the towns on the coaſt of my country in flames, than that the enemy ſhould poſſeſs Weſt Point."</p>
                     <p>Theſe devaſtations, however, were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtopped by a peremptory order from general Clinton for the return of the troops,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 13.</note> on the 13th of July, only eight days after they began. The loſs ſuſtained by the Britiſh troops was very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling; not exceeding 150 in killed, wounded and miſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The expedition, however, ſeems not to have been attended with any great effect as to its immediate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for ſo bold and numerous did the American troops continue, that in a few days two of the royal ſloops of war were taken by them.</p>
                     <p>On the ſurpriſe of Stoney Point and Verplank, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Waſhington had taken poſt among the high grounds farther up the North River, only with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of watching the motions of the Britiſh army. No ſooner did he obſerve how ſir Henry Clinton had ſtrengthened theſe poſts, than he entertained the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſurpriſing them. Having received notice from a deſerter, that there was a ſandy beach on the ſouth ſide o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Stoney Point, running along the flank of the works, and only obſtructed by a ſingle abbatis, which might afford an eaſy and ſafe approach to a body of troops; he formed the plan of attacking both poſts at the ſame inſtant; the execution of which was intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to general Wayne and general Howe. The garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:028963_0302_0FDE9E9F2750E930"/>at Stoney Point conſiſted of a regiment of foot, Britiſh and loyaliſts, commanded by lieutenant colonel Johnſon. That in the oppoſite poſt, at Verplank's Neck, of nearly equal force, was under the command of lieutenant colonel Webſter. All the Maſſachuſett light infantry marched from Weſt Point under lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant colonel Hull, in the morning of the 15th of July,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 15.</note> and joined general Wayne, at San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Beach, 14 miles from Stoney Point. The roads were exceedingly bad and narrow, and the troops having to paſs over high mountains, through difficult defiles and moraſſes, were obliged to move in ſingle files the greateſt part of the way. By eight in the evening, the van arrived within a mile and a half of the enemy, where the men, being formed in two columns, remained till general Wayne and ſeveral of the principal officers returned from reconnoitring the works. General Wayne iſſued the moſt poſitive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to both columns, which they ſeem to have exactly obeyed, not to fire a ſingle ſhot on any account, but to place their whole reliance on the bayonet. At half paſt eleven at night the whole moved forward to the attack. Two attacks were, therefore, made on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſides of the fortification, to which the ſoldiers marched with unloaded muſkets and ſcrewed bayonets, whilſt a detachment in front amuſed the garriſon with a feint. They found the approaches more difficult than, from their knowledge of the place, they had been led to expect, the works being covered by a deep mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs, which at this time was overflowed by the tide.</p>
                     <p>But neither the deep moraſs, the formidable and double rows of abattis on the ſtrong works in front and flank, could damp the ardour of the Americans, who, in the face of an inceſſant and tremendous fire of muſket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and cannon loaded with grape ſhot, forced their way through every obſtacle, until the van of each col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umn
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:028963_0302_0FDE9E9F2750E930"/>met in the centre of the works, and the garriſon were obliged to ſurrender at diſcretion. General Wayne was wounded in the head by a muſket ball as he paſſed the laſt abbatis, but was gallantly ſupported and helped through the works by his two brave aids, Fiſhbourn and Archer. The killed and wounded of the Americans amounted to 98. Lieutenants Gibbons and Knox, who led the forlorn hope, eſcaped unhurt, although the firſt loſt 17 men out of 20, and the laſt nearly as many. The killed of the garriſon were 63, and the number of the priſoners 543. Two flags, two ſtandards, 15 pieces of ordnance, and a conſiderable quantity of military ſtores, fell into the hands of the conquerors.</p>
                     <p>For this heroic action, congreſs gave thanks to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Wayne, and paſſed reſolutions honourable to the officers and men concerned in it. They ordered a gold medal, emblematical of the action, to be preſented to the general, and ſilver ones to lieutenant colonel Fleury and major Stewart; the former having ſtruck the ſtandard with his own hand.</p>
                     <p>The attack upon Verplank, entruſted with general Howe, miſcarried, through delay occaſioned by high winds which prevented the tranſportation of the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. The enemy, likewiſe, broke down the bridges, and thereby cut off the communication by land.</p>
                     <p>The Americans evacuated Stoney Point, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed the cannon and ſtores, and demoliſhed the works: and the third day after the capture, ſir Henry Clinton regained poſſeſſion of it, and left a ſtrong gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon for its defence.</p>
                     <p>The ſucceſs of the late enterpriſe emboldened the Americans to make a ſimilar attempt on Paulus Hook, a fortified poſt on the Jerſey ſide, oppoſite to New York; but, although the heroiſm of the enterpriſe and the ſpirit with which it was executed deſerves applauſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 19.</note> after having
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:028963_0303_0FDE9EA0ACB392B0"/>completely ſurpriſed the poſts, the American com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, major Lee, finding it impoſſible to retain them, made an orderly retreat, with about 161 priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, among whom were ſeven officers.</p>
                     <p>Another expedition of greater importance was now projected on the part of the Americans. This was againſt a poſt on the river Penobſcot, on the borders of Nova Scotia, of which the Britiſh had lately taken poſſeſſion,

                           <hi>June</hi> 16.</note> and where they had began to erect a fort which threatened to be a very great inconvenience to the coloniſts. A fleet of 18 armed veſſels, beſides tranſports, were fitted out, and put under the conduct of commodore Saltonſtal. The land forces were commanded by general Lovel. The armament deſtined againſt it was ſo ſoon got in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that colonel Macleane, the commanding officer at Penobſcot, found himſelf obliged to drop the execution of part of his ſcheme; and inſtead of a regular ſort, to content himſelf with putting the works already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in as good a poſture of defence as poſſible. The Americans could not effect a landing without a great deal of difficulty, and bringing the guns of their largeſt veſſels to bear upon the ſhore.

                     <p>COUNT D'Eſtaing, as has been already obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had put into Boſton harbour to refit. Zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the cauſe of his maſter, he had publiſhed a proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamation to be diſperſed through Canada, inviting the people to return to their original friendſhip with France, and declaring that all who renounced their allegiance
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:028963_0304_0FDE9EA9E4A04820"/>to Great Britain, ſhould certainly find a protector in the king of France.

                     <p>The Britiſh took St. Lucia, and count D'Eſtaing took St. Vincent and Grenada.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 13.</note> Soon after the reduction of the latter, the count retired to Cape Francois. During his operations there, the Americans having repreſented his conduct as totally unſerviceable to them,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July,</hi> 1779.</note> he received or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Europe to aſſiſt the United States with all poſſible ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>In compliance with theſe orders, he directed his courſe towards Georgia, with a deſign, in conjunction with general Lincoln, to recover that province out of the hands of the enemy, and to put it as well as South Carolina, in ſuch a poſture of defence as would effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſecure them from any future attack. This ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be no difficult matter, from the litle force with which he knew he ſhould be oppoſed; and the next object in contemplation was no leſs than the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Britiſh fleet and army at New York, and their total expulſion from the continent of America. Full of theſe hopes the French commander arrived off the coaſt of Georgia, with a fleet conſiſting of twenty ſail of the line,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 1.</note> two of fifty guns and eleven frigates, and a large body of land
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:028963_0304_0FDE9EA9E4A04820"/>forces on board. His arrival was ſo little expected, that ſeveral veſſels, laden with proviſions and military ſtores, fell into his hands. The Experiment alſo, a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of 50 guns, commanded by ſir James Wallace, and three frigates, were alſo taken. On the 9th the fleet anchored off Tybee, at the mouth of the river Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah. On the continent the Britiſh troops were divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. General Prevoſt, with an inconſiderable part, remained at Savannah; but the main force was under colonel Maitland at Port Royal. On the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the French fleet, an expreſs was ſent to colonel Maitland: but it was intercepted by the Americans; ſo that before he could ſet out to join the commander in chief, the Americans had ſecured moſt of the paſſes by land, whilſt the French fleet effectually blocked up the paſſage by ſea. On the 15th, the French, with count Polaſki's light horſe, appeared ſo near the Britiſh lines as to ſkirmiſh with the piquets; and as the force under general Prevoſe did not admit of his having any other object in view than the mere defence of the town, he contracted his poſts within the cover of the artillery on the works.</p>
                     <p>D'Eſtaing ſent a ſummons to Prevoſt, commanding him, in the name of his moſt Chriſtian majeſty, to yield to a force he was utterly incapable of reſiſting. Though general Prevoſt, with the officers about him, were determined, even with the ſmall force they had, to defend the place to the laſt extremity, yet they thought it prudent to gain as much time as poſſible. By ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different meſſages, therefore, he found means to protract the time conſiderably, and at laſt was allowed a truce of 24 hours for deliberation. During this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval colonel Maitland, taking advantage of creeks and inlets, and marching over land, arrived with the troops from Port Royal.</p>

The face of affairs was now entirely changed, and inſtead of an eaſy conqueſt which preſented itſelf on the arrival of D'Eſtaing, a moſt obſtinate defence was reſolved on. The general returned a poſitive anſwer to the ſummons, that he was determined to defend the place to the laſt extremity; and the ſailors who had been all drawn from the ſhips to conſtruct and man the batteries, expreſſed their approbation by three checes, when the gun was fired as a ſignal for the recommence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hoſtilities.</p>
                     <p>On the day after delivering the ſummons D'Eſtaing was joined by general Lincoln, as he had been before by count Polaſki. The allies took ſeparate but adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing camps, and each began immediately to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches as in a regular ſiege. Their joint force h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Every man, without diſtinction, was employed in the hardeſt labour, and cheerfully underwent his ſhare of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon toil. At the time that the French ſummons was received, the lines were not only weak and imperfect but were not protected by above eight or ten pieces of cannon, while at the concluſion of the ſiege or blockade, the works, by the aſſiſtance of the ſhip guns, were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred with a numerous artillery amounting to near 100 pieces. Nor was the ſkill and dexterity with which they were uſed and directed by captain Moncrief, the engineer, at all inferior to the labour uſed in bringing them forward, as was owned both by friends and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>The allies were indefatigable in their efforts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the works, though without effect; nor did they ſpare any pains in carrying on their own, ſo that in a week they had puſhed a ſap within 300 yards of the abbatis. Few ſkirmiſhes took place, as the Britiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander wiſhed to ſpare his men; but in the few that were fought the allies were worſted.</p>

About midnight, between the 3d and 4th of October, the allies began a heavy bombardment, and at day light a violent cannonade from 37 pieces of heavy artillery, nine mortars from their land batteries, and 16 cannon from the water. Though this cannonade continued for five days, its deſtructive effects were felt only by the women, children and negroes, and by the houſes of the town; the works, ſo far from being demoliſhed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually acquired additional ſtrength, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the beſieged.—In this diſtreſs of the women and children, which was farther increaſed by the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes, in order to ſet the town on fire, general Prevoſt ſent a letter to D'Eſtaing requiring permiſſion for the women and children to leave the place; but after three hours, during which the diſcharge of cannon and ſhells continued, the allied commanders, from motives of policy, refuſed compliance, and they reſulved to give a general aſſault.</p>
                     <p>This attack was made in the morning of the 9th of October,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 9.</note> a little before day light, after a heavy diſcharge of cannon and mortars for ſeveral hours. The firing began on the left of the Britiſh lines, but ſoon after became general.</p>
                     <p>The nature of the ground on both flanks of the lines was ſo favourable to the approach of the aſſailants, that the defect could not be remedied by all the ſkill of the engineer: And as it was ſtill too dark for the Britiſh to diſcern the movements of the allies, and uncertain where the ſtorm would fall, each diviſion waited cooly in its poſt; expecting what ſhould happen. The grand attack was made however, to the right, whither D'Eſtaing in perſon led the flower of both armies, and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by all the principal officers of each. They advanced in three columns, under cover of a ſwampy hollow, which reached within a very little diſtance of ſome of the principal works. By reaſon of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:028963_0306_0FDE9EB0D57E55A8"/>of the night, they took a greater circuit, and went deeper into the bog than they needed to have done; a circumſtance, which, beſides a critical loſs of time, could not fail of producing ſome diſorder. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack was made with great ſpirit, and ſupported with obſtinate perſeverance. One redoubt, particularly, was the ſcene of much gallantry. It was obſtinately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſended by captain Tawſe. The aſſailants planted two ſtand of colours upon it; and at length the brave cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fell, gallantly fighting in his redoubt, his ſword being plunged, at the inſtant of death, in the body of the third man he had killed with his own hand.—But whilſt the combat was ſtill dubious and bloody, partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly at that redoubt, three batteries, which were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by the ſeamen, opened upon the allies in almoſt every direction, and made ſuch havock in their ranks as cauſed ſome little diſorder, or at leaſt a pauſe in the violence of their attack. At that inſtant, a body of grenadiers and marines advanced ſuddenly from the lines, and charged the allies with ſuch rapidity and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, throwing themſelves into the ditches and works a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that in an inſtant the redoubt and a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to the right of it, were totally cleared of them. The advantage was purſued with the greateſt vigour; the allies were inſtantly routed, and driven into the ſwamp with ſuch celerity, that three companies of the moſt active troops of the beſieged, could not, with all their exertion, come in for any ſhare of the honour. The purſuit was prevented by a thick fog and darkneſs, which hindered the Britiſh general from perceiving how far it was proper to venture his troops out of the town. As the day cleared, the works and ditches near the redoubt preſented a moſt ſhocking ſpectacle of kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wounded, ſaid by ſome ſoldiers and officers to have been only equalled at Bunker's Hill. At 10 o'clock, the allies requeſted leave to carry off their wounded
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:028963_0306_0FDE9EB0D57E55A8"/>and bury their dead; which, with ſome reſtrictions as to the former, was granted.</p>
                     <p>In this fatal attack, which laſted fifty five minutes, the loſs of the allies was computed at between 1000 and 1200 men in killed and wounded. The French owned 44 officers, and about 700 private men in killed and wounded.—The loſs of the Americans, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn made to general Lincoln, was 234 continentals killed and wounded. Count Polaſki, the celebrated conſpirator againſt the reigning king of Poland, was mortally wounded. Count D'Eſtaing was likewiſe wounded, but ſlightly.</p>
                     <p>The loſs on the Britiſh ſide was inconceivably ſmall; and no other officer was loſt except captain Tawſe, who had ſo bravely defended the redoubt where the ſtandards were placed.</p>
                     <p>General Prevoſt, lieutenant colonel Maitland, and major Moncrief deſervedly acquired great reputation by this ſucceſsful defence. The allies now thought of nothing but to get away with ſafety, and it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to maſk this with the appearance of continuing the blockade. Great civilities now paſſed between the French and the Britiſh; and numberleſs apologies were made for the refuſal with reſpect to the women and children. They were now preſſed to place themſelves in the ſituation they had formerly requeſted; and a particular ſhip of war and commander were named for the reception of Mrs. Prevoſt, her children and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But the anſwer was, that what had been refuſed and that in terms of inſult, could not in any circumſtance be deemed worth accepting. On the 18th of the month,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 18.</note> upon the clearing up of the fog, it was diſcovered that the French and Americans had abandoned their camps in the preceding night. Some purſuit was made, but without effect; the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans having broken down the bridges behind them, and
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:028963_0307_0FDE9EB25D38B680"/>purſued their route with great diſpatch. Count D'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing had reembarked his troops, artillery and baggage, and left the continent; and general Lincoln returned to South Carolina.</p>
                     <p>This expedition of D'Eſtaing on the American coaſt, though unſucceſsful as to its main object, was eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of benefit to the United States. It entirely diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed the meaſures already digeſted by the Britiſh commanders, and cauſed a conſiderable waſte of time, before they could determine on a new plan of operations. It alſo occaſioned the evacuation of Rhode Iſland; but this was rather a loſs than advantage to America. For the Britiſh had ſtationed near 6000 men, for two years and eight months, on that iſland, where they were loſt to every purpoſe of cooperation, and where they could render very little more ſervice to the royal cauſe, than could have been obtained by a couple of frigates cruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the vicinity.</p>
                     <p>During the ſiege of Savarmah, a remarkable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was effected by colonel John White of the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia line. Captain French had taken poſt with about 100 men near the river Ogechee, ſome time before the fiege began. There were alſo at the ſame place forty ſailors on board of five Britiſh veſſels, four of which were armed. All theſe men, together with the veſſels and 130 ſtand of arms, were ſurrendered to colonel White, captain Elholm, and four others, one of which was the colonel's ſervant. On the preceding night this ſmall party kindled a number of fires in different places, and adopted the parade of a large encampment. By theſe and a variety of deceptive ſtratagems, captain French was fully impreſſed with the opinion, that noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but an inſtant ſurrender, in conformity to a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſummons, could ſave his men from being cut to pieces by a ſuperior force. He therefore gave up, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="267" facs="unknown:028963_0307_0FDE9EB25D38B680"/>
The arms of France and America being almoſt ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery where unſucceſsful, the independency of the latter ſeemed yet to be in danger, notwithſtanding the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſo powerful an ally, when further encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given by the acceſſion of Spain to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy againſt Britain, in the month of June 1779.</p>
                     <p>The firſt effect of this appeared in the invaſion of the infant colony on the Miſſiſſippi; which being yet too weak for a particular government, was annexed to that of Weſt Florida; which was, however, too diſtant to afford any effectual protection. We have alſo taken notice of an expedition by the Americans, under cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Willing, into that country, though they did not ſtay to enforce their dominion. The few troops which were in the colony were ſuddenly attacked by Don Bernardo de Gulves,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                        </note> governour of Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſmia, with the whole force he could collect; who, having firſt publicly declared the independency of Britiſh America by beat of drum, at New Orleans, ſet out on his expedition. His meaſures were ſo well concerted, that major general Campbell, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Penſacola, did not receive the ſmalleſt intelligence of his proceedings, until the affair was almoſt over. The troops did not amount to 500 men; however, they ſtood a ſiege of nine days in a field redoubt at Batton Rouge, and capitulated on honourable terms, to which the Spaniſh governour ſtrictly adhered.</p>
                     <p>Their next enterpriſe, was againſt the Bay of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duras, where the Britiſh logwood cutters were ſettled. Theſe, finding themſelves too weak to reſiſt, applied to the governour of Jamaica for relief; who ſent them a ſupply of men, ammunition, and military ſtores, under captain Dalrymple. Before the arrival of this detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the principal ſettlement in thoſe parts, called <hi>St. George's Key,</hi> had been taken by the Spaniards and retaken by the Britiſh. In his way captain Dalrymple
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:028963_0308_0FDE9EBA2DC75088"/>fell in with a ſquadron from Admiral Parker in ſearch of ſome regiſter ſhips richly laden; but which, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating into the harbour of Omoa, were too ſtrongly protected by the fort to be attacked with ſafety. A project was then formed, in conjunction with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Honduras, to reduce this fort. The deſign was to ſurpriſe it; but the Spaniards having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 16.</note> they were obliged to fight. Victory quickly declared for the Britiſh; but the fortifications were ſo ſtrong, that the artillery, they had brought along with them were found too light to make any impreſſion. It was then determined to try the ſucceſs of an eſcalade; and this was execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo much ſpirit, that the Spaniards ſtood aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed without making any reſiſtance, and, in ſpite of all the efforts of the officers, threw down their arms and ſurrendered. The ſpoil was immenſe, being valued at three millions of dollars. The Spaniards chiefly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the loſs of 250 quintals of quickſilver; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity indiſpenſably neceſſary in the working of their gold and ſilver mines, ſo that they offered to ranſom it at any price; but this was refuſed, as well as the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the fort, though the governour offered 300,000 dollars for it. A ſmall garriſon was left for the defence of the place: but it was quickly attacked by a ſuperior force, and obliged to evacuate it, though not without deſtroying every thing that could be of uſe to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; ſpiking the guns, and even locking the gates of the fort and carrying off the keys. All this was done in ſight of the beſiegers; after which the garriſon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked without the loſs of a man.</p>
                     <p>The ſucceſsful defence of Savannah, together with the ſubſequent departure of count D'Eſtaing from the coaſt of the United States, freed the Britiſh from all apprehenſions for the ſafety of New York, and ſir Henry Clinton ſet ſail from that place in the end of
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:028963_0308_0FDE9EBA2DC75088"/>the year, with a conſiderable body of troops, intended for the attack of Charleſton in South Carolina.</p>

                     <p>The Randolph, an American frigate of 36 guns and 305 men,
<note place="margin">1778, <hi>March</hi> 7.</note> commanded by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Biddle, ſailed on a cruiſe from Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. The Yarmouth of 64 guns, diſcovered her and five other veſſels, and came up with her in the evening. Captain Vincent hailed the Randolph, to hoiſt colours, or he would fire into her; on which ſhe hoiſted American colours and immediately gave the Yarmouth her broadſide, which was returned, and in about a quarter of an hour ſhe blew up. Four men ſaved themſelves upon a piece of her wreck, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſted for five days upon nothing but rain water, which they ſucked from a piece of blanket. On the fifth day, captain Vincent of the Yarmouth, being in chaſe of a ſhip, happily diſcovered them, and humanely ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the chaſe, took them on board. Three days before this, the Alfred frigate, of 20 nine pounders, was taken by the Ariadne and Ceres. The Americans alſo loſt the Virginia frigate.</p>

The major, with a number of troops, on board a ſmall veſſel, made directly for the Pigot in the night, and ſuſtaining the fire of her marines, reſerved his own till he had run his jib-boom through her fore ſhrouds. He then fired ſome cannon, and threw in a volley of muſketry, loaded with bullets and buck ſhot, and immediately boarded her. The captain made a gallant reſiſtance, but was not ſeconded by his crew.

Of theſe the battle between Paul Jones and ſir Richard Pearſon is as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable as any. Jones had for ſome time infeſted the coaſt of Scotland. In April 1778, he ſailed from Portſmouth, New Hampſhire, as commander of the Ranger privateer, and landed in the night at White haven, in Cumberland, with a party of 30 men; and ſet fire to one of the ſhips in the harbour; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants extinguiſhed the fire before it reached <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Captain Pearſon, by four o'clock, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerning from the deck, that the ſquadron conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of three large ſhips, and a brig, (the cutter was not now with them) made the Counteſs of Scarborough a ſignal to join him, which was done about half paſt five. A little after ſeven, the Bon Homme Richard brought

                        </gap>, each veſſel uſing every poſſible means to gain an advantageous ſituation to rake the other. Captain perſon had infinitely the ſuperiority over the Bon Homme Richard in working the Serapis, and obtained advantages in ſpite of every effort of Jones to prevent it. Jones, to render ſuch ſuperiority uſeleſs, aimed at lying his ſhip athwart the hawſe of the other. Though he did not ſucceed to his wiſh, yet as the bowſprit of the Serapis ran between his poop and mizen maſt, he ſeized the opportunity of laſhing the veſſels together, when the wind driving the head of the Serapis againſt the bow of the Bon Homme Richard, they became ſo cloſe fore and aft, that the muzzles of their guns muched each others ſides. In this poſition they engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from half paſt eight till half paſt ten. But before it commenced, the Bon Homme Richard had received many 18lb. ſhot between wind and water, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very leaky. Her tier of 12 pounders was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilenced and abandoned. Her ſix 18 pounders, which were old, were of no ſervice, and were fired but eight times in all. During the ſucceeding action, Jones made uſe only of three nine pounders, whoſe fire was ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that of his men in the round tops. At the ſame time others threw ſuch a quantity and variety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matters into the decks, chains, and every part of the Serapis, that ſhe was on fire not leſs than 10 or 12 times in different parts, and it was with the greateſt difficulty that the ſame could be extinguiſhed. At half paſt nine, by ſome accident, the Serapis had a cartridge of powder ſet on fire, the flames of which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating from one to another all the way aft, blew up all the people and officers abaft the main maſt, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all thoſe guns uſeleſs for the remainder of the action.

                     <p>In the beginning of this ſummer the Britiſh houſe of commons formed itſelf into a committee of inquiry into the American war. Lord Howe and general Howe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The miniſtry ſtrongly oppoſed this, for a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of reaſons; one of which was, that government had laid no charge againſt the noble brothers; on the contrary, ſeveral parts of their conduct had met with its approbation. The only part of this inquiry, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to be taken notice of here, relates to the northern expedition, and the ſtrange evidence given by general Robertſon and Mr. Galloway, againſt lord and ſir William Howe.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of general Burgoyne, by the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saratoga, had been laid down as an inſuperable
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:028963_0311_0FDE9EC198E16E38"/>obſtacle againſt any inveſtigation of his conduct. His continual importunity had given offence, as well as his joining the oppoſition in condemning the conduct of miniſtry; ſo that it was probable he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the moſt humiliating circumſtances of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, had it not been that the northern expedition w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> ſo connected in its conſequences with the operations of the grand army, that they could not be ſeparated in the courſe of the inquiry concerning general Howe's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. The 20th of May being fixed upon for entering upon the inquiry, the following officers attended, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Sir Guy Carleton, earl Balcarras, captain Money, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quarter maſter general; earl of Harrington; major Forbes; captain Bloomfield of the artillery; and lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant colonel Kingſton, adjutant general; all of whom governour Carleton excepted, were preſent during the whole campaign, and eminently partook of the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and diſaſters attending the northern expedition.</p>
                     <p>From the unanimous teſtimony of theſe very reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able witneſſes, it appeared, that general Burgoyne poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the confidence and affection of his army, in ſo extraordinary a degree, that no loſs or misfortune could ſhake the one, nor diſtreſs or affliction weaken the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

By this evidence alſo, every cenſure or charge which had been laid againſt the commander, was totally overthrown or removed; leaving, however, the queſtion open, whether the general's orders for
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:028963_0311_0FDE9EC198E16E38"/>proceeding to Albany were peremptory or conditional; and leaving likewiſe ſome doubts behind, both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the deſign and mode of conducting the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, under the command of colonel Baume, to Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington. However, it particularly detected two falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, which till that time had been in full credit; the one that general Phillips, with a ſpecified part of the army, had offered at the time of the convention, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> Ticonderoga, and the other that the late general Fraſer had highly diſapproved of the meaſure of paſſing Hudſon's River. The witneſſes, on the contrary, were of opinion, that nothing leſs than the paſſing of that river and advancing to fight the enemy, could have ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified the army, or preſerved the general's character with it; and after all the misfortunes that had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was ſtill univerſally conſidered as a matter of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, and to have done otherwiſe would have been accounted an unpardonable failure. Their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony went likewiſe to the total ſubverſion of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious report, relative to the ſuppoſed natural deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſpirit which by ſome was attributed to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans. On the contrary, they declared freely, that the Americans ſhewed a reſolution, perſeverance, and even obſtinacy in action, which rendered them by no means unworthy of a conteſt with the brave troops who oppoſed them. Written evidence was alſo produced and ſupported, that the number of the American army, at the time of the ſurrender, amounted to 19,000 men, of which 13,000 or 14,000 were men actually carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſkets.</p>
                     <p>The examination of general Burgoyne's witneſſes was followed by the counter evidence of the American miniſter, againſt that brought by lord and ſir William Howe. General Robertſon and Mr. Galloway were the only witneſſes examined. The latter had been an

                     <p>On this, the oppoſition from time to time remarked, that the greater part of thoſe gentlemen's teſtimony was founded upon hearſay intelligence, and violent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:028963_0312_0FDE9ECA21A1F858"/>of facts, not only unſupported by collateral evidence, but what ſcarce any body could believe. It was alſo remarked, that the only officer produced had been very little, if at all, out of the Britiſh garriſons, ſince the commencement of the war, and was therefore little qualified, either to give ſatisfactory information relative to the diſpoſition of the people with whom he was ſo little converſant, or to give a critical opinion of military meaſures he had never ſeen. With regard to Mr. Galloway, they ſaid, that it was very ſingular, that, though bred a lawyer, and habituated to buſineſs, he could ſcarcely be brought to recollect any part of his own conduct in the moſt trying, ſignal, and poſſibly dangerous ſituation of his life, and the moſt conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſphere of action to which he had ever been exalted, namely, when he was a member of the congreſs; and yet, that the ſame perſon, a total ſtranger to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and only flying for refuge to the Britiſh army, ſhould all at once acquire an accuracy in military de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails, and the complicated buſineſs of a camp, which could ſcarcely be expected from a quarter maſter gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral; and as ſuddenly become poſſeſſed, along with the minut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The foregoing evidence, given in at the bar of the Houſe of Commons of Great Britain, may ſerve as a ſample of the information ſent to the Britiſh miniſtry, by their adherents on this ſide the Atlantic; upon which they were weak enough to form all their plans for the ſubjugation of America.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE beginning of the year 1780 preſented a moſt alarming appearance to Britain. Advantage was taken of her peculiar circumſtances, by the moſt
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:028963_0313_0FDE9ECF8FABFA68"/>ſagacious among the Iriſh, for the obtaining of thoſe privileges which might otherwiſe never have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. The doctrines of taxation without repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of unconditional ſubmiſſion, which miniſtry applied to America, were urged as matter of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Ireland; and it was openly ſaid that the chains <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Military aſſociations were propoſed and univerſally adopted. In every part of the kingdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, were never more prevalent. All ranks ſell in with the prevailing diſpoſition. The volunteers were admirably appointed, and amounted to above 50,000 in number. Government ſaw theſe proceedings with aſtoniſhment. They wiſhed to regulate this new and unexpected force, and to bring it to act under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the crown; but after a few feeble attempts, it was thought beſt to concur in a meaſure that could not be prevented. In a word, within the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years, Ireland obtained a free trade, and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be inſeparably annexed to the crown of Great Britain, but independent of its legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt Great Britain was endeavouring to allay the diſcontents of Ireland, and engaged in a war, not only with her revolted colonies, but with the powerful king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of France and Spain, ſuch a combination was entered into by the neutral powers, under the title of
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:028963_0314_0FDE9ED113C6B2C8"/>an <hi>Armed Neutrality,</hi> as indicated a general diſpoſition to take up arms in favour of America, ſhould the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment of her independence vet remain doubtful. This extraordinary aſſociation originated with the court of Peterſburgh, whom the Britiſh miniſtry looked upon as one of their beſt allies in the preſent criſis.</p>
                     <p>The principles ſhe had adopted for her conduct were, "That neutral ſhips ſhould enjoy a free naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even from port to port, and on the coaſts of the belligerent powers. That all effects belonging to the belligerent powers, ſhould be looked on as free <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſuch neutral ſhips, with an exception of places actually blocked up or beſieged, and with a promiſe that they do not carry to the enemy contraband articles." Theſe were limited by an explanation, ſo as to "comprehend only warlike ſtores and ammunition." Her imperial majeſty declared that "ſhe was fully reſolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe principles, and that with the view of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the commerce and navigation of her ſubjects, ſhe had given orders to fit out a conſiderable part of her naval force."</p>
                     <p>The declaration of the empreſs on this occaſion would, in other circumſtances, have been conſidered as a declaration of war. At preſent, however, the court of London, ſtanding alone and unſupported, was obliged to ſubmit. The propoſals of the empreſs were acceded to not only without the leaſt heſitation, but with the utmoſt applauſe of her juſtice and wiſdom, by all the other powers of Europe to whom they were preſented, Portugal alone excepted.</p>
                     <p>Though the powerful combination in favour of the Americans, of which this armed neutrality might be conſidered as a principal part, rendered the conteſt with them ultimately hopeleſs on the part of Great Britain, the war was nevertheleſs kept up with equal
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:028963_0314_0FDE9ED113C6B2C8"/>ſpirit by her commanders, and the ſame deluſive hopes of ſucceſs were held out by her miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly the conqueſt of the ſouthern colonies was now looked upon as an object within reach, and for this purpoſe an expedition was undertaken by ſir Henry Canton and admiral Arbuthnot, for which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His auxiliaries had already left him; the term of inliſtment of a great number of continental ſoldiers was expired; and the filling up of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by waiting for recruits from their reſpective ſtates, muſt neceſſarily be a work of conſiderable time.

They had a very tedious voyage; the weather was uncommonly bad; ſeveral of the tranſports were loſt, as were alſo the greater part of the horſes which they carried with them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for cavalry or other public uſes; and an ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhip likewiſe foundered at ſea. Having arrived at Savannah, in the end of January 1780, they endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to repair the damages ſuſtained on their voyage,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Feb.</hi> 10.</note> and proceeded from thence on the 10th of February, to North Ediſto, the place of debarkation which had been previouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. They had a favourable and ſpeedy paſſage thither: and though it required time to have the bar explored and the channel marked, the tranſports all entered the harbour the next day; and the army took poſſeſſion of St. John's iſland, about 30 miles from Charleſton, without oppoſition. Preparations were then made for paſſing the ſquadron over Charleſton bar, where the high water ſpring tides were only 19 feet deep: but no opportunity offered of going into the harbour till the 20th of March,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>March</hi> 20.</note> when it was effected without any accident, though the American gallies continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:028963_0315_0FDE9ED298A612E8"/>to prevent the boats from ſounding the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. The Britiſh troops had previouſly removed from John's to James's iſland; and on the 29th of the ſame month they effected their landing on Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton neck.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 1.</note> On the 1ſt of April they broke ground within 800 yards of the American works; and by the 8th the beſiegers' guns were mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in battery.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the army began to erect their batteries againſt the town, admiral Arbuthnot embraced the firſt favourable opportunity of paſſing Sullivan's iſland, upon which there was a ſtrong fort of batteries, the chief defence of the harbour. He weighed on the 9th, with the Roebuck, Richmond, and Romulus, blonde, Virginia, Raleigh, and Sandwich armed ſhip, the Renown bringing up the rear; and, paſſing through a ſevere fire, anchored in about two hours under James's iſland, with the loſs of 27 ſeamen killed and wounded. The Richmond's fore topmaſt was ſhot away, and the ſhips in general ſuſtained damage in their maſts and rigging, though not materially in their hulls. But the Acetus tranſport, having on board ſome naval ſtores, grounded within gun ſhot of Sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van's iſland and received ſo much damage that ſhe was obliged to be abandoned and burnt.</p>
                     <p>On the 10th, ſir Henry Clinton and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Arbuthnot ſummoned the town to ſurrender to his majeſty's arms;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 10.</note> but major general Lincoln, who commanded in Charleſton, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned them an anſwer, declaring it to be his intention to defend the place. The batteries were now opened againſt the town; and from their effect the fire of the American advanced works conſiderably abated. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the number of troops under the command of Lincoln were by far too few for defending works of ſuch extent as thoſe of Charleſton; and that many of
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:028963_0315_0FDE9ED298A612E8"/>theſe were men little accuſtomed to military ſervice, and very ill provided with clothes and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Lincoln had been for ſome time expecting rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements and ſupplies from Virginia and other places: but they came in very ſlowly. Earl Cornwallis, and lieutenant colonel Tarleton under him, were alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely active in intercepting ſuch reinforcements and ſupplies as were ſent to the American general. They totally defeated a conſiderable body of cavalry and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia which was proceeding to the relief of the town; and alſo made themſelves maſters of ſome poſts which gave them in a great degree the command of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by which means great ſupplies of proviſions fell into their hands.</p>
                     <p>Such was the ſtate of things, and Fort Sullivan had alſo been taken by the king's troops, when on the 11th of May general Clinton again ſummoned the town to ſurrender;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 11.</note> an offer being made, as had been done before, that if they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered, the lives and property of the inhabitants ſhould be preſerved to them. Articles of capitulation were then propoſed by general Lincoln; but the terms were not agreed to by general Clinton. At length, however, the town being cloſely inveſted on all ſides, and the preparations to ſtorm it in every part being in great forwardneſs, and the ſhips ready to move to the aſſault, general Lincoln, who had been applied to for that purpoſe by the inhabitants, ſurrendered it on ſuch articles of capitulation as general Clinton had before agreed to. This was on the 12th of May, which was one month and two days after the town had been firſt ſummoned to ſurrender.</p>
                     <p>By the articles of capitulation, the garriſon was to march out of town, and to depoſit their arms in front of the works, but the drums were not to beat a Britiſh march, nor the colours to be uncaſed. The continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:028963_0316_0FDE9EDDCB34B6A0"/>troops and ſeamen were to keep their baggage, and remain priſoners of war till exchanged. The militia and inhabitants of all conditions were to be conſidered as priſoners on parole, and while they adhered to their parole, were not to be moleſted in perſon or property. The militia were permitted to return to their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive homes. The officers of the army and navy were to retain their ſervants, ſwords, piſtols, and baggage unſearched. They were permitted to ſell their horſes, but not to remove them: and a veſſel was allowed to proceed to Philadelphia with general Lincoln's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches unopened.</p>
                     <p>According to ſir Henry Clinton's account, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of priſoners taken in Charleſton amounted to 5600 men, beſides nearly a thouſand ſailors in arms; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to general Lincoln's account tranſmitted to the congreſs, the whole number of continental troops taken priſoners amounted to no more than 2487. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, therefore, included in general Clinton's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, muſt have conſiſted of militia and inhabitants of the town. The captive officers were much more in proportion than the privates, and conſiſted of 1 major general, 6 brigadiers, 9 colonels, 14 lieutenant colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, 15 majors, 84 captains, 84 lieutenants, 32 ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond lieutenants and enſigns. Upwards of 400 pieces of artillery, together with arms and ammunition, were found in Charleſton. Several American frigates were alſo taken or deſtroyed in the harbour.</p>
                     <p>The loſs of Charleſton evidently excited a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alarm in America: and ſeveral popular writers, particularly the author of the celebrated performance entitled Common Senſe, in ſome other pieces made uſe of it as a powerful argument to lead them to more vigorous exertions againſt Great Britain, that they might the more effectually and certainly ſecure their independence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="285" facs="unknown:028963_0316_0FDE9EDDCB34B6A0"/>
Whilſt ſir Henry Clinton was employed in his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to Charleſton, and in the ſiege of that place, the garriſon at New York ſeem not to have been wholly free from apprehenſions for their own ſafety. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe froſt, accompanied with great falls of ſnow, began about the middle of December 1779, and ſhut up the navigation of the port of New York from the ſea, within a few days after the departure of admiral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buthnot and general Clinton. The ſeverity of the weather increaſed to ſo great a degree, that towards the middle of January all communications with New York by water were entirely cut off, and as many new ones opened by the ice. The inhabitants could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid to be in an inſular ſtate. Horſes with heavy carriages could go over the ice into the Jerſies from one iſland to another. The paſſage on the North Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, even in the wideſt part from New York to Paulus Hook, which was 2000 yards, was about the 19th of January practicable for the heavieſt cannon: an event which had been unknown in the memory of man. Proviſions were ſoon after tranſported upon ſledges, and a detachment of cavalry marched upon the ice from New York to Staten Iſland, which was a diſtance of 11 miles.</p>
                     <p>The city of New York being thus circumſtanced, was conſidered as much expoſed to the attacks from the continental troops: and it was ſtrongly reported that general Waſhington was meditating a great ſtroke upon New York with his whole force, by different attacks. Some time before this, major general Patti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, commandant at New York, having received an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs from many of the inhabitants, offering to put themſelves in military array, he thought the preſent a favourable opportunity of trying the ſincerity of their profeſſions. Accordingly he iſſued a proclamation, calling upon all the male inhabitants from 16 to 60 to
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:028963_0317_0FDE9EE00E6E9480"/>take up arms. The requiſition was ſo readily complied with, that in a few days 40 companies from the ſix wards of the city were enrolled, officered, and under arms, to the number of 2600, many ſubſtantial citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſerving in the ranks of each company. Other volunteer companies were formed; and the city was put into a very ſtrong poſture of defence.</p>
                     <p>No attack, however, was made upon New York, whatever deſign might originally have been meditated; but an attempt was made upon Staten Iſland, where there were about 1800 men, under the command of brigadier general Sterling, who were well intrenched. General Waſhington, whoſe army was hutted at Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Town, ſent a detachment of 2700 men, with ſix pieces of cannon, two mortars, and ſome horſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by lord Sterling, who arrived at Staten Iſland early in the morning of the 15th of January. The advanced poſts of the Britiſh troops retired upon the approach of the Americans, who formed the line, and made ſome movements in the courſe of the day; but they withdrew in the night, after having burnt one houſe, pillaged ſome others, and carried off with them about 200 head of cattle. Immediately on the arrival of the Americans on Staten Iſland, lieutenant general Knyphauſen had embarked 600 men to attempt a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and to ſupport general Sterling; but the floating ice compelled them to return. It is, however, imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, that the appearance of theſe tranſports, with the Britiſh troops on board, which the Americans could ſee towards the cloſe of the day, induced the latter to make ſo precipitate a retreat.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the ravages of war did not prevent the Americans from paying ſome attention to the arts of peace. On the 4th of May an act was paſſed by the council and houſe of repreſentatives of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts Bay for incorporating and eſtabliſhing a ſociety
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:028963_0317_0FDE9EE00E6E9480"/>for promoting the knowledge of the antiquities of America, and of the national hiſtory of the country; for determining the uſes to which its various natural productions might be applied, for encouraging medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſcoveries; mathematical diſquiſitions; philoſoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical inquiries and xperiments; aſtronomical, meteoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical, and geographical obſervations; improvements in agriculture, manufactures, and commerce; and in ſhort, for cultivating every art and ſcience which may tend to advance the intereſt, honour, dignity, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a free, independent, and virtuous people.</p>

                        </gap>. Lord Cornwallis, whilſt he marched up the north ſide of the river Santee, received intelligence that there were ſome Virginian troops, under the command of colonel Buford, near the borders of South Carolina. He therefore detached colonel Tarleton with 700 light cavalry, and a new corps of infantry called the Legion, mounted on horſeback, in order to rout and diſperſe that body, before it could receive any reinforcement from the neighbouring colonies. The Americans, confiding in their diſtance from the enemy, had been at no pains to chooſe a proper ſituation. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Tarleton, having marched 105 miles in 54 hours, preſented himſelf ſuddenly and unexpectedly before them at a place called Waxſau.
<note place="margin">

                        </gap> related. Doctor Gordon obſerves, in his hiſtory, that, whilſt the flags were paſſing and repaſſing concerning a ſurrender, "Tarleton kept his men in motion, and when the truce was ended, had nearly ſurrounded his adverſaries." The continental party made but a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſiſtance, "and ſoon begged quarter. A few, however, continued to fire. The Britiſh cavalry ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, but were not oppoſed by the main body of the continentais, who conceived themſelves precluded by their ſubmiſſion. The <hi>accidental</hi> firing of a few was an argument, however, for directing the Britiſh legion to charge thoſe who had laid down their arms. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this order, the unreſiſting Americans, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for quarters, were chopped in pieces."</p>
                     <p>Whatever may have been the attending circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this action, ſir Henry Clinton conceived it as entirely deciſive of the fate of South Carolina.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly he iſſued two proclamations, and alſo circulated a hand-bill amongſt the inhabitants of South Carolina, in order to induce them to return to their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and to be ready to join the king's troops. It was ſaid, that the helping hand of every man was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to re-eſtabliſh peace and good government: and that as the commander in chief wiſhed not to draw the king's friends into danger, whilſt any doubt could remain of their ſucceſs; ſo, now, that this was certain,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:028963_0319_0FDE9EE4261A7888"/>he truſted that one and all would heartily join, and by a general concurrence give effect to ſuch neceſſary meaſures for that purpoſe as from time to time might be pointed out. Thoſe who had families were to form a militia to remain at home, and occaſionally to aſſemble in their own diſtricts, when required, under officers of their own chooſing, for the maintenance of peace and good order. Thoſe who had no families, and who could conveniently be ſpared for a time, it was preſumed, would cheerfully aſſiſt his majeſty's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oops in driving their oppreſſors, acting under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of congreſs, and all the miſeries of war, far from that colony. For this purpoſe it was ſaid to be neceſſary that the young men ſhould be ready to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when required, and to ſerve with the king's troops for any ſix months of the enſuing twelve that might be found requiſite, under proper regulations. They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ight chooſe officers to each company to command them; and were to be allowed, when on ſervice, pay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>munition, and proviſions, in the ſame manner as the king's troops. When they joined the army, each man was to be furniſhed with a certificate, declaring that he was only engaged to ſerve as a militia-man for the time ſpecified; that he was not to be marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond North-Carolina and Georgia; and that, when the time was out, he was freed from all claims what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of military ſervice, excepting the common and uſual militia-duty where he lived. He would then, it was ſaid, have paid his debt to his country, and be entitled to enjoy undiſturbed that peace, liberty, and property, at home, which he had contributed to ſecure. The proclamations and publications of general Clinton appear to have produced ſome effect in South Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na; though they probably operated chiefly upon thoſe who were before not much inclined to the cauſe of American independence. Two hundred and ten of
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:028963_0320_0FDE9EEC4E5134F8"/>the inhabitants of Charleſton ſigned an addreſs to general Clinton and admiral Arbuthnot, ſoliciting to be re-admitted to the character and condition of Britiſh ſubjects, the inhabitants of that city having been hitherto conſidered as priſoners on parole; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their diſapprobation of the doctrine of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can independence; and expreſſing their regret, that after the repeal of thoſe ſtatutes which gave riſe to the troubles in America, the overtures made by his maj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty's commiſſioners had not been regarded by the congreſs. Sir Henry Clinton, in one of the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations iſſued at this time, declared, that if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould thenceforward appear in arms in order to prevent the eſtabliſhment of his majeſty's government in that country, or ſhould, under any pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>The Britiſh commander, amuſing himſelf with theſe flattering proſpects, thought of returning to New York, to which he was likewiſe induced by intelligence he had received that a French fleet commanded by M. de Fernay, with a number of land forces, might ſoon be expectation the American coaſt. He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked early in June, leaving lord Cornwallis with about four thouſand troops for the ſouthern ſervice. On his return to New York, he acquainted the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican miniſter that there were very few in the province who were not either priſoners to, or in arms with the Britiſh forces; and he exulted in the number of thoſe who came in from every quarter to teſtify their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, to offer their ſervices in ſupport of his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:028963_0320_0FDE9EEC4E5134F8"/>government, and who in many inſtances had brought as priſoners their former oppreſſors or leaders.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding theſe poſitive aſſertions, and the flattering appearances of loyalty in South Carolina, at the time of Sir Henry's departure from thence, it ſoon became obvious, that many of the inhabitants were ſo little ſatisfied with their preſent government, that they endeavoured to diſpoſe of their property on the beſt terms they could obtain, and totally to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the country. This conduct became ſo frequent and glaring, that lord Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>allis thought proper to iſſue a proclamation, ſtrictly forbidding all ſales and transfers of property, including even negroes, without a licenſe firſt obtained from the commandant of Charleſton; and likewiſe forbidding all maſters of veſſels from carrying any perſons whatever, whether black or white, out of the colony, without a written paſſport from the ſame officer.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the diſadvantages under which they laboured, the Americans ſeemed to entertain no doubts but that they ſhould be able to maintain their independency. The 4th of July was celebrated this year at Philadelphia with ſome pomp, as the anniverſary of American independence. A commencement for conferring degrees in the arts was held the ſame day, in the hall of the univerſity there; at which the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident and members of the congreſs attended, and other perſons in public offices. The chevalier de la Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerne, miniſter plenipotentiary from the French king to the United States, was alſo preſent on the occaſion. A charge was publickly addreſſed by the provoſt of the univerſity to the ſtudents; in which he ſaid, that he could not but congratulate them "on that auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious day, which, amidſt the confuſions and deſolations of war, beheld learning beginning to revive; and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated them with the pleaſing proſpect of ſeeing the
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:028963_0321_0FDE9EF1488DD5A8"/>ſacred lamp of ſcience burning with a ſtill brighter flame, and ſcattering its invigorating rays over the unexplored deſarts of this extenſive continent; until the whole world ſhould be involved in the united blaze of knowledge, liberty, and religion. When he ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his views forward, (he ſaid) and ſurveyed the riſing glories of America, the enriching conſequences of their determined ſtruggle for liberty, the extenſive fields of intellectual improvement and uſeful invention, in ſcience and arts, in agriculture and commerce, in religion and government, through which the unfetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind would range, with increaſing delight, in queſt of the undiſcovered treaſure which yet lay concealed in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms of the new world; or in the other fertile ſources of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge with which it abounded,—his heart ſwelled with the pleaſing proſpect, that the ſons of that inſtitution would diſtinguiſh themſelves, in the different walks of life, by their literary contributions to the embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and increaſe of human happineſs."</p>
                     <p>The firſt effort the Americans made in South Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olina, after the fall of Charleſton, was in the middle of July, when 133 of colonel Sumpter's corps attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and routed a detachment of the royal forces and militia,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 12.</note> which were poſted in a lane at Williamſon's plantation. This was the firſt advantage gained over the Britiſh ſince their landing in the province, in the beginning of the year. In a few days after, troops joining colonel Sumpter with great al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rity, from the northernmoſt frontier, and being now at the head of 600 men, he made a ſpirited attack on a party of the Britiſh at Rocky Mount, but, having no artillery, he was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. This active partizan, ſenſible that he could not keep the militia together without employing them, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked another royal detachment, conſiſting of the
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:028963_0321_0FDE9EF1488DD5A8"/>prince of Wales' regiment, and a large body of tories under colonel Byran, poſted at Hanging Rock, whom he almoſt totally deſtroyed; the above regiment being reduced from 278 men to 9; and the remainder of the loyaliſts in that quarter were diſperſed.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the part of the Britiſh army deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to active ſervice was advanced towards the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers under the command of lord Rawdon, who fixed his head-quarters at the town of Camden. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſituation of that place on the great river Santee, which afforded an eaſy communication with ſeveral remote parts of the country, induced lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis not only to make it a place of arms, but a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſtore houſe or repoſitory for the army in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended operations. He likewiſe ſpared no pains in arming and embodying the militia of the province, and in raiſing new military corps, under well affected leaders.</p>
                     <p>But, during theſe tranſactions, a great change in the aſpect of affairs took place in North Carolina. Beſides the ſuppreſſion of the loyaliſts, who were treated with little mercy, baron de Kalb, a German, long an officer in the French ſervice, and now a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor general in the American army, arrived in that province with 2000 continental troops, and was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſome bodies of militia from Virginia. The governours of the ſtate were likewiſe indefatigable in their exertions and preparations, at leaſt for defence if not for conqueſt. Troops were raiſed, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia every where drawn out; and beſides colonel Sumpter, Rutherford, Caſwell and other leaders, advanced to the frontiers, at the head of different bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies. Skirmiſhes took place on all ſides with various fortune; and the provincials became ſo ſtrong that lord Rawdon was obliged to contract his poſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="296" facs="unknown:028963_0322_0FDE9EF2CF8B9188"/>
It ſoon appeared that ſir Henry Clinton's idea of the loyalty of South Carolina was a deluſion; and that nothing could deter the inhabitants from adhering to the cauſe of congreſs, whenever an opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. The people, tired of the war, had ſubmitted to the Britiſh government with the expectation of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their condition, but they ſoon found their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; the officers, privates, and followers of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al army being more intent upon raiſing their fortunes by plunder, than in acquiring the affections of the people whom they had conquered. Accordingly, as the provincials increaſed in ſtrength, and approached nearer, numbers of thoſe who had ſubmitted to the Britiſh government, and others who were on parole, abandoned and hazarded all things, in order to join them. Colonel Liſle, who had exchanged his parcle for a certificate of being a good ſubject, carried off a whole battalion of militia, which had been raiſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He could indeed have made good his retreat to Charleſton, but he muſt have left 800 ſick men and a vaſt quantity of valuable ſtores to fall into the hands of the provincials. He likewiſe foreſaw, that excepting Charleſton and Savannah, a retreat would occaſion the loſe of the two provinces of Carolina and Georgia. In his own words, there was "little to loſe by a defeat, and much to gain by a victory." The intelligence which he had received that general Gates was encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a bad ſituation at Clermont about 13 miles from Camden, no doubt con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>irmed his determination. He accordingly marched from Camden about 10 o'clock at night with an intention to ſurpriſe general Gates;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Auguſt</hi> 15.</note> and making his diſpoſitions in ſuch a manner, as that his beſt troops and greateſt force ſhould be directed againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental regiments, laying little ſtreſs on the militia, if theſe were ſufficiently provided againſt.</p>
                     <p>It was very ſingular that the very ſame hour at which lord Cornwallis ſet out from Camden to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe general Gates, that general, ignorant of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis' arrival at Camden, ſhould ſet out from Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont to ſurpriſe him. About half an hour after two in the morning,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Auguſt</hi> 16.</note> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced parties of both armies met in the woods, and a ſiring commenced. Some of the cavalry of Armand's legion wounded by the firſt fire of the enemy, threw others into diſorder, and the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiled ſo ſuddenly, that the firſt Maryland regiment, in the front of the column, was broken, and the whole line of the army thrown into a general conſternation. This firſt impreſſion ſtruck deep. The light infantry, however, executed their orders; particularly thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colonel Pottersfield, who behaved with ſuch ſpirit, that the enemy was no leſs ſurpriſed at this unexpected
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:028963_0323_0FDE9EF454CD4970"/>meeting. A few priſoners were taken on both ſides, by whoſe information the reſpective commanders de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived a knowledge of circumſtances, of which both till then were ignorant. Colonel Pottersfield, in whoſe abilities and activity Gates had placed great dependence, received a muſket-ball which ſhattered the bones of his leg, in this firſt encounter. The American army ſoon recovered its order. Cornwallis alſo kept his ground; and frequent ſkirmiſhes enſued, with ſcarcely any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er effect than to diſcover the ſituation of the armies, to evince the intention of the generals, and to ſerve as a prelude to what was to occur in the morning.</p>
                     <p>The action began at break of day, in a ſituation very advantageous for the Britiſh troops, but very unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Americans. The latter were much more numerous; but the ground on which both armies ſtood was narrowed by ſwamps on the right and left, ſo that the Americans could not properly avail themſelves of their ſuperio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> numbers. There ſeems to have been ſome want of generalſhip in Gates, in ſuffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſurpriſed in ſo diſadvantageous a poſition; but this circumſtance was the effect of accident, as has been already related.</p>
                     <p>The attack was made by the Britiſh troops with great vigour, and in a few minutes the action was general along the whole line. It was at this time a dead calm, with a little hazineſs in the air, which, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the ſmoke from riſing, occaſioned ſo thick a darkneſs, that it was difficult to ſee the effect of a very heavy and well-ſupported fire on both ſides. The Britiſh troops either kept up a conſtant fire, or made uſe of bayonets, as opportunities offered; and after an obſtinate reſiſtance during three quarters of an hour, threw the Americans into total confuſion, and forced them to give way in all quarters. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental troops behaved remarkably well, but the militia
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:028963_0323_0FDE9EF454CD4970"/>were ſoon broken, and left the former to oppoſe the whole force of the Britiſh troops. General Gates did all in his power to rally the militia, but without effect: the continentals retreated in ſome order; but the rout of the militia was ſo great, that the Britiſh cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alry are ſaid to have continued the purſuit of them to the diſtance of 22 miles from the place where the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happened. The loſs of the Americans was very conſiderable; about 1,000 priſoners were taken, and more are ſaid to have been killed and wounded, but the number is not very accurately aſcertained. Eight pieces of braſs cannon, 2,000 ſtand of arms, a number of colours, and all the ammunition waggons of the Americans, were alſo taken. Of the Britiſh troops, the killed and wounded amounted to 324. Among the priſoners taken was major general baron de Kalb, who was mortally wounded, having exhibited great gallantry in the courſe of the action, and received 11 wounds. Beſides baron de Kalb, the Americans loſt ſeveral other officers, among whom were brigadier general Gregory killed, and general Rutherford taken. The Britiſh troops by which this victory was achieved, did not much exceed 2,000, while the American army is ſaid to have amounted to 6,000; of which, however, the greateſt part was militia.</p>
                     <p>Lieutenant colonel Tarleton, who had greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed himſelf in this action, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached the following day,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 17.</note> with ſome cavalry and light infantry, amounting to about 350 men, to attack a corps of Americans under general Sumpter. He executed this ſervice with great activity and military addreſs. He procured good information of Sumpter's movements; and by forced and concealed marches came up with and ſurpriſed him in the middle of the day on the 18th, near the Catawba fords. He totally deſtroyed or diſperſed his detachment, which
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:028963_0324_0FDE9D9DCDFF7348"/>conſiſted of 700 men, killing 150 on the ſpot, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two pieces of braſs cannon, 300 priſoners, and 44 waggons.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the military operations already related were going on in the ſouthern colonies, the hoſtile armies on the ſide of New York were ſo nearly poiſed that no great exploits could be performed on either ſide.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile the <hi>refugees</hi> were grown ſo numerous, that, through ſome miſtaken p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

Their knowledge of the adjoining coaſts afforded them ſuch advantages, that they generally proved ſucceſsful in their enterpriſes; but their want of any kind of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline or government, along with their peculiar, and frequently perſonal animoſity, leading them to exceſs, produced retaliation on the other ſide, ſo that the war was carried on with unrelenting cruelty on both ſides, without the leaſt tendency to conqueſt or reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>A few days before the arrival of ſir Henry Clinton from Charleſton, the generals Knyphauſen, Robertſon, and Tryon, paſſed over by night with 5,000 men from Staten Iſland in New Jerſey,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 6.</note> with a view of attacking ſome of general Waſhington's out poſts. On the following morning, though ſeverely haraſſed in their march by the militia, they proceeded to Connecticut Farms. This new and thriving ſettlement was burnt, together with the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian meeting houſe in that place. Whilſt the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

                        </gap>lty, juſtly excited the loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt complaint. The detachment next proceeded to Springfield. On approaching the bridge in front of the town, they were farther oppoſed by general Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, who, with a few continental troops, diſputed their paſſage. They halted till midnight, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to Elizabeth Town. Before they had retreated, the whole American army at Morris Town marched to oppoſe them. Whilſt this royal detachment was in Jerſey, ſir Henry Clinton had returned to New York, and having ſent a reinforcement to Knyphauſen, the whole advanced a ſecond time to Springfield. They were now oppoſed by general Green, with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body of continental troops. Colonel Angel, with 170 men and a piece of artillery, defended the bridge with great gallantry, againſt a vaſt ſuperiority of force, and though obliged at laſt to give way, found means to carry off his wounded, though nearly one fourth of the whole corps were by this time killed or diſabled: the Britiſh troops having ſuffered more in this trifling affair than can be imagined.</p>
                     <p>At this time general Green lay about a mile above Springfield; but his troops were ſo divided that he could not make any detachment ſufficient for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of colonel Angel, without hazarding the ſecurity of the poſt he himſelf occupied, and which was of much greater importance. The Britiſh troops, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having met with ſo unexpected a check from the handful of men at the bridge, did not venture to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack Green, but cloſed their expedition with burning the town of Springfield. The royal forces then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:028963_0325_0FDE9F01CF8F8D10"/>but were purſued by the enraged militia till they entered Elizabeth Town, and next day they ſet out on their return to New York.</p>
                     <p>The event of this ſhort campaign in the Jerſies ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, more than any thing that had yet happened, the utter impoſſibility of reducing the Americans by force of arms.

Theſe papers were incloſed in a packet to general Waſhington, accompanied with a letter from the priſoner. The letter was expreſſed in terms of dignity without inſolence, and of apology without meanneſs. He avowed himſelf to be major Andre, adjutant general of the Britiſh army, related the manner of his capture, and endeavoured to ſhow, that he did not come under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e deſcription of a ſpy. Theſe papers were forwarded by Jameſon.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner had Arnold received the major's letter, that he haſtened on board the Vulture, which lay ſome miles below Stoney and Verplank's Points; and Arnold had not been long gone, when Waſhington ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived at his quarters. Had the plot ſucceeded, the conſequences muſt have been ruinous to the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans. The forces under Arnold's command muſt have either laid down their arms, or have been cut to pieces. Their loſs, and the immediate poſſeſſion of Weſt Point and its dependencies, muſt have expoſed the remainder of Waſhington's army in ſuch a manner, to the joint exertion of the Britiſh forces, by land and water, that nothing but ruin could have been the reſult with reſpect to the Americans.</p>
                     <p>On the 29th of September, general Waſhington appointed a board of fourteen general officers, with the aſſiſtance of the judge advocate general, to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine major Andre's caſe, and to determine in what light it ought to be conſidered. Andre, diſdaining all ſubterfuge and evaſion, and ſtudying only to place his character in ſo fair a light, as might prevent its being ſhaded by preſent circumſtances, voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:028963_0329_0FDDBF98880A6538"/>more than he was aſked, and ſought not to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate any thing relating to himſelf, whilſt he concealed, with the moſt guarded and ſcrupulous nicety, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might involve others. The board ſhewed him every poſſible mark of indulgence, and ſufficiently witneſſed how much they felt for his ſituation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, public juſtice obliged them to declare, "that major Andre ought to be conſidered as a ſpy from the enemy; and that agreeable to the law and uſage of nations, it is their opinion he ought to ſuffer death."</p>
                     <p>Several letters paſſed between the generals Clinton and Waſhington relative to this unhappy affair; but nothing was capable of ſaving the unfortunate Andre. The major was ſuperior to the terrors of death; but the diſgraceful mode of dying, which the uſage of war had annexed to his unhappy ſituation, was infinitely dreadful to him. He was deſirous of being indulged with a profeſſional death, and had accordingly written the day before, a pathetic letter, fraught with all the feelings of a man of ſentiment and honour, in which he requeſted of general Waſhington, that he might not die on a gibbet. The general conſulted his officers on the ſubject. Pity and eſteem wrought ſo powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were all for ſhooting him, till Green in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on it, that his crime was that of a common ſpy; that the public good required his being hanged, and that, were he ſhot, the generality would think there were favourable circumſtances entitling him to notice and lenity. His obſervations convinced them that it was improper to grant the major's requeſt, whilſt a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar motive prevented its being divulged.</p>
                     <p>When major Andre was led out to the place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution at Tappan in the ſtate of New-York, as he went along he bowed himſelf familiarly to all thoſe with whom he had been acquainted in his confinement.

Soon after, recollecting himſelf, he added, "it will be but a momentary pang;" and, ſpringing upon the cart, he performed the laſt offices to himſelf with a compoſure that excited the admiration, and melted the hearts of all the ſpectators. Being told that the fatal moment was at hand, and aſked if he had any thing to ſay, he anſwered, "Nothing but to requeſt you will witneſs to the world, that I die like a brave man." The ſucceeding moments cloſed the affecting ſcene. "Though a regard for the public ſafety impoſed a neceſſity for inflicting the rigours of martial law, yet the rare worth of this unfortunate officer made his unhappy caſe the ſubject of univerſal regret.

Arnold was made a brigadier general in the king's ſervice, and publiſhed an addreſs to the inhabitants of America, dated from New-York, October 7, in which he endeavoured to juſtify his deſertion of their cauſe He ſaid, that when he firſt engaged in it, he conceived the rights of his country to be in danger, and that duty and honour called him to her defence. A redreſs of grievances was his only aim and object; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he acquieſced unwillingly in the declaration of independence, becauſe he thought it precipitate. But the reaſons that then were offered to juſtify that meaſure, no longer could exiſt, when Great Britain, with the open arms of a parent, offered to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them as children, and to grant the wiſhed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. From the refuſal of theſe propoſals, and the ratification of the French alliance, all his ideas of the juſtice and policy of the war were totally changed, and from that time, he had become a profeſſed loyaliſt. He acknowledged that "in theſe principles he had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retained his arms and command, for an opportunity to ſurrender them to Great Britain."</p>
                     <p>This addreſs was ſoon followed by another, inſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the officers and ſoldiers of the continental army. This was intended to induce them to follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and engage in the royal ſervice. He informed them, that he was authoriſed to raiſe a corps of cavalry and infantry, who were to be on the ſame footing with the other troops in the Britiſh ſervice. To allure the private men, three guineas were offered to each, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides payment for their horſes, arms and accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Rank in the Britiſh army was alſo held out to the American officers, who would recruit and bring in a certain number of men, proportioned to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent grades in military ſervice. Theſe offers were propoſed to unpaid ſoldiers, who were ſuffering from the want of both food and cloathing, and to officers
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:028963_0330_0FDDBF9F219BA728"/>who were in a great degree obliged to ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their own reſources, while they were ſpending the prime of their days, and riſking their lives in the unproductive ſervice of congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Though they were urged at a time when the paper currency was at its loweſt ebb of depreciation, and the wants and diſtreſſes of the American army were at their higheſt pitch, yet they did not produce the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended effect on a ſingle ſentinel or officer. Whether the circumſtances of Arnold's caſe added new ſhades to the crime of deſertion, or whether their providential eſcape from the deep laid ſcheme againſt Weſt Point gave a higher tone to the firmneſs of the American ſoldiery, cannot be unfolded: But either from theſe or ſome other cauſes, deſertion wholly ceaſed at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable period of the war.</p>
                     <p>The Americans, however, accounted for the conduct of Arnold in a different and in a more probable and ſatisfactory manner. They alleged that he had ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved himſelf in debts and difficulties by his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant manner of living in America, that he had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it very inconvenient for him to continue there: That after the evacuation of Philadelphia by the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh troops, Arnold, being inveſted with the command in that city, had made the houſe of Mr. Penn, which was the beſt in the city, his head-quarters. This he had furniſhed in an elegant and expenſive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and lived in a ſtyle far beyond his income. It was manifeſt, they ſaid, that he could at firſt have no great averſion to the French alliance, becauſe that when M. Gerard, miniſter plenipotentiary from the court of France, arrived at Philadelphia in July 1778, general Arnold early and earneſtly ſolicited that min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter, with his whole ſuite, to take apartments and bed and board at his houſe, until a proper houſe could be provided by the order of the congreſs. This offer
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:028963_0331_0FDDBFA164F8FF10"/>M. Gerard accepted, and continued with him ſome weeks. The French miniſter reſided upwards of 14 months in Philadelphia; during which time general Arnold kept up the moſt friendly and intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, and there was a continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange of dinners, balls, routs and concerts: So that M. Gerard muſt have believed, that in general Arnold he had found and left one of the warmeſt friends the court of France had in America. He was alſo one of the firſt in congratulating the chevalier de la Luzerne, the ſecond French miniſter. About this time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and accuſations were exhibited againſt him by the government of Philadelphia for divers mal-prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices; among which charges were, the appropriation of goods and merchandiſe to his own uſe, which he had ſeized as Britiſh property in Philadelphia in July, 1778. It was determined by a court-martial that his conduct was highly reprehenſible; but he was indulgently treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was therefore only reprimanded by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, general Waſhington. It was in theſe circumſtances, the Americans ſaid, bankrupted in rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation and fortune, loaded with debts, and having a growing and expenſive family, that general Arnold firſt turned his thoughts towards joining the royal arms.</p>

                     <p>During the foregoing tranſactions on the ſide of New York, lord Cornwallis had been prevented from
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:028963_0331_0FDDBFA164F8FF10"/>making any farther progreſs in Carolina for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, by the exceſſive heats and unhealthy ſeaſon which followed his victory at Camden. As oppoſition to the Britiſh government was ſtill far from being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, his lordſhip, about the middle of September,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 16.</note> iſſued a proclamation "for ſequeſtrating the eſtates of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons within the province, who were either actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in arms, who had abandoned their plantations with a view of joining or ſupporting the enemy, or who, by an avowal of rebellious principles and other criminal acts ſhould manifeſt a deſperate perſeverance in oppoſing the re-eſtabliſhment of his majeſty's gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment." For this purpoſe, he appointed a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner to take poſſeſſion of ſuch eſtates and property, the annual product of which, excepting the part allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the maintenance of the families of the parties, was to be applied to the public ſervice, in contributing towards the expenſes of the war.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time colonel Ferguſon had taken great pains to diſcipline ſome of the tory militia; and with a party of theſe, and ſome Britiſh troops, amounting in the whole to about 1,400 men, unencumbered with baggage or artillery, made incurſions into the northern parts of South Carolina. He deſigned to join lord Cornwallis at Charlotte. Ferguſon was tempted to ſtay near to the weſtern mountains longer than was neceſſary, under the hope of cutting off Clark in his retreat from Georgia. This delay gave an opportunity for the junction of ſeveral corps of militia, which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ruin. Colonel Williams of Ninety Six purſued him with 450 horſe. The inhabitants about the weſtern waters, north of North Carolina, and weſt of the Alleghany and Virginia, though not called upon to embody under any common authority, voluntarily muſtered under their reſpective colonels, and being all mounted, and unencumbered with baggage, their
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:028963_0332_0FDDBFA29F1D4178"/>motions were rapid. When they all joined at Gilbert Town, under the command of colonels Campbell, Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Shelby, and Sevier, they amounted to near 3,000. They ſoon found out Ferguſon's encampment, which was on an eminence of a circular baſe, called King's Mountain, ſituated near the confines of North and South Carolina. About 1,000 of their beſt men, mounted on their fleeteſt horſes, came up with Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon on the 7th of October, under the conduct of colonel Campbell. As they approached the royal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment, they divided their force. Some aſcended the mountain, whilſt others went round its baſe in oppoſite directions. The firing began about four o'clock in the afternoon. The picket gave way, and were purſued as they retired up the mountain to the main body. Ferguſon, with the greateſt bravery, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his men to the charge. The Americans retired from the approaching bayonet. Soon after theſe had retreated, Shelby with the other detachment, having completed the deſigned circuit, opportunely arrived, and from an unexpected quarter poured in a well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected fire. Ferguſon deſiſted from the purſuit, and engaged his new adverſaries. The Britiſh bayonet was again ſucceſsful, and cauſed them alſo to fall back. By this time the party commanded by Campbell aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the mountain, and renewed the attack from that eminence. Ferguſon preſented a new front, and was again ſucceſsful; but all his exertions were unavailing. The aſſailants retired only a little way, and, getting behind trees and rocks, renewed their ſire. And as often as one of the American parties was driven back, another returned to its ſtation. Major Ferguſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played as much bravery as was poſſible in his ſituation, but his unconquerable ſpirit diſdained either to flee or ſurrender. However, after having repulſed a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of adverſaries, pouring in their ſire from new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:028963_0332_0FDDBFA29F1D4178"/>this officer received a mortal wound. No chance of eſcape being left, and all proſpect of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful reſiſtance being at an end, the ſurvivors were forced to ſubmit. The bloody conflict laſted forty-ſeven minutes. The major, with 150 of his men, fell in the action; 810, including regulars, were made priſoners, 150 of whom were wounded, the remainder, about 440, eſcaped. The whole number of the Britiſh regulars was ſhort of one hundred. The Americans took 1,500 ſtand of arms. Very few of the aſſailants fell; but in their number was colonel Williams in Ninety Six diſtrict, who had been very active in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the re-eſtabliſhment of the Britiſh government.</p>
                     <p>Ten of the royal militia who had ſurrendered were hanged by their conquerors. They were provoked to this cruel meaſure, by the ſeverity of the Britiſh, who had lately hanged ſeveral of the captured Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, in South Carolina and Georgia. They alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged that the men who ſuffered were guilty of previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous felonies, for which their lives were forfeited by the laws of the land. The remainder of the priſoners, except about 130, were ſoon after enlarged upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conditions.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cornwallis was ſo confident of the ſucceſs of his ſchemes, that he did not wait for the arrival of colonel Ferguſon at Charlotte; but advanced towards Saliſbury, and obliged the militia for ſecurity to croſs the Yadkin and take poſt on its north bank. He halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhort of Saliſbury, and, hearing of colonel Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's fate, faced about and returned to Charlotte. This was the firſt misfortune which Cornwallis had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, and he ſoon found that major Ferguſon's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat operated as a check on the future exertion of the loyaliſts. Their timidity reſtrained them from riſking any more in ſupport of the royal cauſe; reſerving
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:028963_0333_0FDDBFA426E0BE58"/>themſelves till the Britiſh army, by its own unaſſiſted efforts, ſhould gain a decided ſuperiority.</p>
                     <p>Cornwallis retreated about the 14th of October to Wynſborough; which was the more needful, as major Davie's corps, being greatly increaſed, frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted his lordſhip's foraging parties and convoys. Riflemen alſo often penetrated near his camp, and from behind trees took care to make ſure of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Thus the late conquerors found their ſituation very uneaſy. As the Britiſh retreated, the militia took ſeveral waggons, loaded with ſtores and the knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks of the light-infantry and legion; and ſingle men repeatedly rode up within gun-ſhot of his army, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their pieces, and made their eſcape.</p>
                     <p>Sumpter, ſoon after the diſperſion of his corps on the 18th of Auguſt, collected a band of volunteers, partly from new adventurers, and partly from thoſe who had eſcaped on that day. With theſe, though for three months there was no continental army in the ſtate, he conſtantly kept the field in ſupport of American inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. He varied his poſition from time to time about Evoree, Broad and Tyger rivers, and had frequent ſkirmiſhes with his adverſaries. His ſpirit of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was ſo particularly injurious to the Britiſh, that they laid ſundry plans for deſtroying his force,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nov.</hi> 12.</note> without ſucceſs. He was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked at Broad River by major We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys, commanding a corps of infantry and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oons. In this action the Britiſh were defeated and their commander taken priſoner. Eight days after, he was attacked at Black Stocks near Tyger River, by lieutenant colonel Tarleton. The attack was begun with 170 dragoons and 80 men of the 63d regiment. A conſiderable part of Sumpter's force was ſtationed in a large log barn,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nov.</hi> 20.</note> from the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of which they fired with ſecurity. Many of the 63d regiment were killed. Tarleton then
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:028963_0333_0FDDBFA426E0BE58"/>charged with his cavalry, but being unable to diſlodge the Americans, retreated; and Sumpter was left in quiet poſſeſſion of the field. The loſs of the Britiſh in this action was conſiderable. Among their killed were three officers, major Money, lieutenants Gibſon and Cope. The Americans loſt very few; but general Sumpter received a wound, which for ſome months in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted his gallant enterpriſes in behalf of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Americans kept their poſition for ſeveral hours; but, knowing that the Britiſh would be reinforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed next morning, they croſſed the Tyger, carrying their wounded men with them.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Conwallis, in his account of this action, eſtimates the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Americans at 1,000, and their killed, wounded and taken at about 120; and 50 killed and wounded of the Britiſh. Nor does he mention that the Americans remained in the poſt any time after the action, but that they were driven with loſs over the river. <hi>Letter to fir Henry Clinton, December</hi> 3, 1780.</note>

                     <p>The victory at Camden was looked upon to be ſo deciſive with regard to the ſouthern colonies, that no farther obſtruction was thought to lie in the way of Lord Cornwallis from South Carolina to the Cheſapeak;

                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 15.</note> and under this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken notion, ſir Henry Clinton diſpatched general Leſslie from New York to the Cheſapeak with 3,000 men, in order to co-operate with, and act under his lordſhip, and to prevent any ſuccours from paſſing to the aſſiſtance of the ſouthern colonies. Cornwallis, however, being at too great a diſtance either to profit by a diverſion, or to form a junction with Leſslie, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were inſtantly ſent to that commander, to proceed to Charleſton. He arrived at Charleſton on the 13th of December, where he left one half of his troops, and ſoon after marched up the country and joined Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis with the remainder.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt Cornwallis was making preparations for a powerful invaſion of North Carolina, general Gates
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028963_0334_0FDDBFA5914EC170"/>had been induſtriouſly preparing to take the field. He had done every thing in his power to repair the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of his defeat, and was, by the month of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in a condition to face the enemy, when general Green was ſent to ſuperſede him in the command of the ſouthern army. General Greene upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions was the vindicator of Gates' reputation. In his letters and converſation, he uniformly maintained that his predeceſſor had failed in no part of his military duty, and that he had deſerved ſucceſs, though he could not command it.</p>
                     <p>The other events of the ſouthern campaign of 1780 conſiſted of a few unimportant ſkirmiſhes not worthy of being particularly mentioned. The whole campaign afforded ample evidence of the folly of proſecuting the American war.

                     <p>The event which occaſioned a formal declaration of war, was the capture of Henry Laurens, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> In the deranged ſtate of the American finances, that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had been deputed by congreſs to ſolicit a loan for their ſervice in the United Netherlands; and alſo to negociate a treaty between them and the United States.

He had thrown his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers overboard, but great part of them were recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered without having received much damage. Theſe the miniſtry carefully examined. Among them was found one purporting to be the plan of a treaty of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and commerce, between the ſtates of Holland and the United States of America. This had been origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally drawn up in conſequence of ſome converſation between William Lee, commiſſioner from the United States to the courts of Vienna and Berlin, and John de Neufville, merchant of Amſterdam, as a plan of a treaty deſtined to be concluded hereafter: But it had never been propoſed either by congreſs or by the ſtates of Holland, though it had received the approbation of the penſionary Van Berkel and of the city of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. Mr. Laurens himſelf was committed priſoner to the Tower on the 6th of October, on a charge of high treaſon.</p>
                     <p>This was followed by a very angry memorial to the ſtates general, which they received with great coolneſs,
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:028963_0340_0FDDBFBA92524AD8"/>and replied, that a full anſwer ſhould be given as ſoon as their conſtitution would admit. The conſequence of this was a declaration of war.

"Whatever may be thought of the policy of the meaſure, its boldneſs muſt be admired. Great Britain, already at war with the United States of America, the monarchies of France and Spain, deliberately reſolves on a war with Holland, and at a time when ſhe might have avoided open hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilities.

Great muſt have been her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources to ſupport ſo extenſive a war againſt ſo many hoſtile ſovereigns; but this very ability, by proving that her overgrown power was dangerous to the peace of Europe, furniſhed an apology for their combination againſt her."</p>
                     <p>The capture of the iſland of St. Euſtatius was the firſt and greateſt blow which the Dutch received in the war.
<note place="margin">1781.</note> The iſland is in itſelf barren and contemptible, but was long the ſeat of a moſt lucrative commerce, and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the grand free port of the Weſt Indies and America, and a general market and magazine for all nations. The iſland is a natural fortification, and very capable of being made ſtrong; but its inhabitants were more ſolicitous to cultivate commerce, than to improve the natural advantages of the iſland for their ſecurity. Its moſt favourable ſeaſons were during the times of warfare among its neighbours, owing to its neutrality, ſituation, and its unbounded freedom of trade. So ſtrong was the ſpirit of commerce in this place, that even when Holland was engaged in war, the ſame freedom of trade continued, and the enemy
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:028963_0341_0FDDBFBC103C5F40"/>were not only ſupplied with all kinds of common nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſaries, but even with naval and military ſtores, as if no rupture with the parent ſtate had taken place. It was in particular a moſt convenient channel of ſupply to the Americans.</p>
                     <p>Sir George Rodney and general Vaughan with a large fleet and army ſurrounded this iſland,
<note place="margin">

M. de Graaf, utterly ignorant of the rupture between Great Britain and Holland, could ſcarcely believe the officer who delivered the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to be ſerious. He returned for anſwer, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing utterly incapable of making any defence, he muſt of neceſſity ſurrender, only recommending the town and inhabitants to the clemency of the Britiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders. The wealth of the place excited the aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of the conquerors, who found the ſtore houſes filled with valuable commodities, and the very beach was covered with hogſheads of ſugar and tobacco. The value was eſtimated conſiderably above three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſterling. But this was only a part; for above 150 veſſels of all denominations, moſt of which were richly laden, were captured in the bay. A Dutch frigate of 38 guns and five ſmall armed veſſels ſhared the ſame fate. The neighbouring iſlands of St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin and Saba were in like manner reduced.</p>
                     <p>Admiral Rodney being informed that a fleet of about 30 large ſhips all richly laden with Weſt India commodities, had ſailed from Euſtatia for Holland juſt before his arrival, under convoy of a flag ſhip of 60 guns, he diſpatched the Monarch and Panther, with the Sybil frigate in purſuit of them. Theſe ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the convoy, when the Dutch admiral refuſing to

He died bravely in defence of his ſhip, when ſhe inſtantly ſtruck, and the whole convoy was taken.</p>
                     <p>The keeping the Dutch colours flying at Euſtatia, ſerved for ſome time as a decoy to French, Dutch, and American veſſels, a conſiderable number of which fell accordingly into the hands of the conquerors without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They ſtated their hard caſe to admiral Rodney and general Vaug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han, who returned for anſwer, "That the iſland was Dutch, every thing in it was Dutch, was under the protection of the Dutch flag, and as Dutch it ſhould be treated."</p>
                     <p>The ſeverity with which the victors proceeded, drew on them pointed cenſures not only from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſufferers, but from all Europe. The merchants and traders were ordered to give up their books, their letters, and inventories of all their effects, incluſive of an exact account of all money and plate in their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Jews were treated as objects of particular reſentment. They were ordered to give up the keys of their ſtores, to leave their wealth and merchandize be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and to depart the iſland without knowing the place of their deſtination. Nor did the policy of
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:028963_0342_0FDDBFC49B37AAA8"/>the unfortunate Hebrews now avail them. They were ſtripped, ſearched, and deſpoiled of ſuch money and jewels as they had ſecreted. Several Americans and native Dutch, as well as Jews, were ordered off the iſland. Many opulent perſons, in conſequence of theſe proceedings, were inſtantly reduced to extreme indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. In this diſtreſs, the aſſembly of the iſland of St. Chriſtophers gave refuge and aſſiſtance to many of the unhappy exiles.</p>
                     <p>To complete the work, nothing now remained but to diſpoſe of the goods which had been ſeized. For this purpoſe, public ſales were advertiſed; purchaſers from every nation were promiſcuouſly invited; aſſurances of protection given them without exception, and the iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and became the ſcene of the greateſt auction that perhaps was ever opened in the world. The goods were ſold for a mere trifle in proportion to their val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue; and the French were ſaid to have made the larger and moſt lucrative purchaſes. The greateſt part of the goods were conveyed to French and Daniſh iſland, and by the inhabitants of them diſpoſed of to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Great Britain, for ſupplying whom in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of commerce, St. Euſtatius had ſuffered to ſeverely.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the attention of the Britiſh commander directed to an object undoubtedly below his dignity, and highly derogatory, not only to the honour but to the intereſt of Britain; as, at this critical period, de Graſſe was ſailing for the Weſt Indies with that fleet and army which aſſiſted general Waſhington to decide the fate of America. A ſmall part of the French force was deſtined for the Eaſt Indies, but M. de Graſſe with the greater part ſailed for Martinico. The Britiſh fleet, then in the Weſt Indies, had been previouſly weakened by the departure of a ſquadron for the protection of the ſhips, which were employed

                     </argument>
                     <p>AT the beginning of the year 1781, an affair happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from which expectations were formed by ſir Henry Clinton, that ſome conſiderable advantage might be derived to the royal cauſe, viz. the revolt of the Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania line. The long continuance of the war, and the difficulties under which the congreſs laboured, had prevented their troops from being paid, or even prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly ſupplied with neceſſaries and conveniences. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Arnold's addreſs to his countrymen had no effect in detaching them from the unproductive ſervice of congreſs; but their complicated diſtreſſes at length broke out into deliberate mutiny. This event, which had long been expected, made its firſt threatening ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Pennſylvania line. The privates en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted in that ſtate were for the moſt part natives of Ireland, and were inferior to none in diſcipline, courage or attachment to the cauſe of independence. A great part of them were enliſted for three years or during the war; the three years were expired, and the men inſiſted that the choice of ſtaying or going remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, whilſt the officers contended that the choice was in the ſtate. On the firſt of January,
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:028963_0343_0FDDBFC5CF955D58"/>1,300 of theſe troops turned out and declared they would ſerve no longer, unleſs their grievances were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed. A riot enſued, in which an officer was killed and four wounded; five or ſix of the inſurgents were alſo wounded. They then collected the artillery, ſtores, proviſions, and waggons, and marched out of the camp. They paſſed by the quarters of general Wayne, who ſent a meſſage to them, requeſting them to deſiſt, or the conſequences would prove fatal. They refuſed, and proceded on their march till the evening, when they took poſt on an advantageous piece of ground, elected officers from among themſelves, and appointed a ſerjeant major, who had formerly deſerted from the Britiſh army, to be their commander. On the ſecond they marched to Middlebrook, and on the third to Princetown, where they fixed their quarters. On that day a flag of truce was ſent to them from the officers of the American camp, with a meſſage, deſiring to know what were their intentions. Some of them anſwered, that they had already ſerved longer than the time for which they were enliſted, and would ſerve no longer; and others, that they would not return, unleſs their grievances were redreſſed. But at the ſame time, they repeatedly and in the ſtrongeſt terms denied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influenced by the leaſt diſaffection to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can cauſe, or having any intentions of deſerting to the enemy.</p>
                     <p>Intelligence of this tranſaction was ſoon conveyed to New York. A large body of Britiſh troops were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ordered to hold themſelves in readineſs to move on the ſhorteſt notice, it being hoped that the American revolters might be induced to join the royal army. Meſſengers were alſo ſent to them from gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Clinton, acquainting them that they ſhould directly be taken under the protection of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that they ſhould have a free pardon for all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:028963_0344_0FDDBFC7571C7D18"/>offences; and that the pay due to them from the congreſs ſhould be faithfully paid them without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of military ſervice, unleſs it ſhould be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, upon condition of their laying down their arms and returning to their allegiance. It was alſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them to move beyond the South River; and they were aſſured, that a body of Britiſh troops ſhould be ready to protect them whenever they deſired it. Theſe propoſitions were rejected with diſdain; and they even delivered up two of ſir Henry Clinton's meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to the congreſs, who being tried were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Britiſh ſpies, and inſtantly executed. Joſeph Reid, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> preſident of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, and general Potter afterwards repaired to them at Princeton, and an accommodation took place: ſuch of them as had ſerved out their full terms were permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own homes, and others again joined the American army, upon receiving ſatisfactory aſſurances that their grievancies ſhould be redreſſed.</p>
                     <p>About 160 of the Jerſey troops mutinied in the ſame month, but by prudent and reſolute meaſures they were reduced to obedience. Two of the greateſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders were put to death on the ſpot, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners were ſelected from among the moſt active in the mutiny.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the natural alarm ſuch mutinies occaſioned, and the perilous ſituation of the republic, congreſs were for ſome time unable to give permanent relief to the army. Proviſions were partially ſupplied, and by expedients from one ſhort time to another. The moſt uſual was ordering an officer to ſeize on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions whereever found. Recourſe was ſo frequently had to coercion, both legiſlative and military, that the people not only loſt confidence in public credit, but became ſo impatient under all exertions of authority, for forcing their property from them, that it was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:028963_0344_0FDDBFC7571C7D18"/>they would proceed to dangerous inſurrections. Never was the patriotiſm of the American ſoldiery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in a more ſtriking view than in this calamitous period. It appears, indeed, wonderful how the army could have been kept together during a great part of this year. The American general Clinton in a letter to general Waſhington, dated at Albany, April 16th, 1781, wrote as follows; "There is not now (independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of Fort Schuyler) three days proviſion in the whole department for the troops in caſe of any alarm, for any proſpect of procuring any. The recruits of the new levies I cannot receive, becauſe I have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give them. The Canadian families I have ſeen obliged to deprive of their ſcanty pittance, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> to every principle of humanity. The quarter maſter's department is totally uſeleſs, the public armoury has been ſhut up for near three weeks, and a total ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every military operation has enſued. At this period of the war, there was little or no circulating medium, either in the form of paper or ſpecie; and in the neighbourhood of the American army there was a ſeal want of neceſſary proviſions.</p>
                     <p>The progreſſive depreciation of the American paper money was a forerunner of its diſſolution. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental bills continued paſſing and depreciating till the ſpring of this year, when ſuddenly and by general conſent they went out of circulation, without real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing the hopes of the enemies, or the fears of the friends, of independence.</p>
                     <p>Without paper currency the Americans could not have carried on the war to the preſent period. Its public benefit, in this inſtance, compenſated in the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of patriotic politicians, for the immenſe evils which it otherwiſe occaſioned. The tender laws on the one hand, and depreciation on the other, rendered it the bane of ſociety. All claſſes were infected. The
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:028963_0345_0FDDBFCE3AFA7320"/>mechanic, the farmer, the lawyer, the phyſician, the member of congreſs, and even a few of the clergy, in ſome places, were contaminated, and commenced ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulators. The morals of the people were corrupted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any thing that could have been believed prior to the event. All ties of honour, blood, gratitude, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and juſtice were diſſolved. Old debts were paid in ſeveral ſtates when the paper money was more than 70 for one in hard caſh; and in Virginia when 300 for one. Brothers defrauded brothers, children parents, and parents children. It has been obſerved by ſome that the <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Methodiſts</hi> in Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia were faithful to their engagements, and were not corrupted by handling paper money. Though theſe denominations excelled, there were many individuals, in all religious ſocieties throughout the United States, that preſerved their integrity. As a ſtriking inſtance of the nature and defects of a depreciating paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, the following is related out of many: A mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of Boſton ſold a hogſhead of rum, for twenty pounds, caſk included. The purchaſer did not ſettle for it, till after the ſeller applied to him for an empty hogſhead, for which he was charged thirty pounds. When they came to ſettle, the merchant found upon examining, that he had to pay a balance of ten pounds on that very caſk, which, with the rum it contained, he had ſold for twenty.</p>
                     <p>"By the ſcale of depreciation the war was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on five years, for little more than a million of pounds ſterling; and 200 millions of paper dollars were made redeemable by five millions of ſilver ones. In other countries, ſuch meaſures would probably have produced popular inſurrections, but in the United States they were ſubmitted to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any tumults. Public faith was violated, but in the opinion of moſt men public good was promoted."
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:028963_0345_0FDDBFCE3AFA7320"/>Gold and ſilver now ſucceeded this fictitious curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, being introduced into the United States by a ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eficial trade with the French and Spaniſh Weſt India Iſlands, and by means of the French army in Rhode Iſland: And the quantity which had found its way from the Britiſh troops was by no means contemptible. The king of France, likewiſe, gave the United States a ſubſidy of ſix millions of livres, and became their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for ten millions more, borrowed for their uſe in the United Netherlands.</p>
                     <p>A new ſyſtem of finance was adopted; and Mr. Robert Morris had the direction of all matters relative to the treaſury, the ſupplies of the army and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. The introduction of ſo much ſpecie, together with theſe judicious regulations, aided by the bank which had been erected in Philadelphia the preceding year, enabled congreſs to feed and clothe their troops, and put them in condition to take the field.</p>
                     <p>During the criſis of the American affairs, in the ſpring of 1781, the Britiſh ſeem to have planned the campaign ſo as to attack the Americans in a variety of places at once. Accordingly, in that year, the war raged not only in the vicinity of New York, but in Georgia, South and North Carolina, and in Virginia.</p>
                     <p>It has been already noticed that major general Leſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie had been detached from New York to Virginia, in the latter end of 1780, and ſoon after returned to Charleſtown, by orders from lord Cornwallis, in order to co-operate more effectually with the army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his lordſhip. Virginia was ſoon after invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another party from New York. On the 4th of January,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jan.</hi> 4.</note> ſome ſhips of war with a number of tranſports, on board which was a large body of troops under the command of brigadier general Arnold, arrived at Weſtover, about 140 miles from the capes of Virginia, where the troops immediately landed and marched to Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:028963_0346_0FDDBFD0E99785A0"/>which they reached without oppoſition, the militia that was collected having retreated on their approach. Lieutenant colonel Simcoe marched from hence with a detachment of the Britiſh troops to Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, where they deſtroyed one of the fineſt founde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for cannon in America, and a large quantity of ſtores and cannon. General Arnold, on his arrival at Richmond, found there large quantities of ſalt, rum, ſailcloth, and tobacco, the laſt of which he deſtroyed to a very great amount. The Britiſh troops afterwards attacked and diſperſed ſome ſmall parties of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans, took ſome ſtores and a few pieces of cannon, and on the 20th of the ſame month marched into Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</p>
                     <p>General Arnold having committed ſuch ravages in Virginia, as threatened to deſtroy the very ſinews of the war, general Waſhington, notwithſtanding his weakneſs at preſent, was obliged to detach 1,200 men, under the conduct of the marquis de la Fayette, to its relief; and the French at Rhode Iſland now thought an opportunity offered of atoning for their paſt inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, by cutting off Arnold's retreat from the Cheſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peak. They were farther encouraged to make this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by having lately acquired ſome addition to their own naval force, and the Britiſh fleet having ſuffered by a dreadful tempeſt, in which the Culloden, a new 74 gun ſhip, was totally loſt; the Bedford, of the ſame force, was diſmaſted; and the America driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſo far out to ſea, that ſhe was, for ſome time, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be loſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſcheme ſeems to have failed only through the delay of putting it in execution. D'Eſtouches, who, after the death of admiral de Ternay, commanded the French fleet, inſtead of inſtantly blocking up the Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apeak whilſt it was in his power, only ſent thither a

The Britiſh, however, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the fruits of victory ſo far as to oblige their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to return to Rhode Iſland without effecting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>A few days after this engagement, a convoy arrived from New York, having on board general Philips, with 2,000 choſen troops.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>March</hi> 26.</note> This officer, with his companions who were taken at Saratoga, had been, after long confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at laſt releaſed by a new cartel concluded ſome months before; and he was now appointed commander in chief of the Virginia forces.</p>
                     <p>Generals Philips and Arnold having joined their forces, carried every thing before them in Virginia. The beſt troops of the ſtate had gone to the ſouthward, ſo that only the militia remained to defend their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and theſe were defeated in every encounter. The long navigation of James' River, and its numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dependant branches and creeks, laid the country
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:028963_0347_0FDDBFD1E5A9FF90"/>open to them in every direction, for a very great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and the miſchief they did was in proportion. At Peterſburgh, on the ſouthern branch of this river called Appomatax, 4,000 hogſheads, of tobacco were deſtroyed. The damage done by the deſtruction of ſhipping and veſſels of every ſort, as well as of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks, warehouſes, and ſtores of every kind was almoſt incredible. About four miles above a place called Oſborne's, on the ſame branch of the river, a ſtale ſhip of 20 guns, another of 26 guns, a brigantine of 14 guns, beſides many other armed veſſels, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Two ſhips and ten ſmaller veſſels, loaded with 2,000 hogſheads of tobacco, cordage and floor fell into Arnold's hands. At Mancheſter, which lies up the Fork, on the north branch of the river, near 230 miles from its mouth, they deſtroyed 1,200 hogſheads of tobacco; the marquis de la Fayette, with his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

A magazine of flour, with a large range of rope walks, were deſtroyed at Warwick, together with the ſhips on the ſtocks and in the river. Along with theſe a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of warehouſes filled with tobacco and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; tanhouſes full of hides and bark, together with ſeveral fine mills, were all conſumed. After which the troops, having re-embarked on board their ſhips, fell down towards the mouth of the river.</p>
                     <p>During theſe deſtructive expeditions, which ended in the month of April, the war raged chiefly in the two Carolinas; of which an account will be given in the next chapter.</p>

He had commanded thoſe rifle men who oppoſed Burgoyne in the northern war, and who ſo much excelled the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in their own way, that, to uſe the expreſſion of that general, "they could not be brought within the ſound of a rifle ſhot."</p>

Within a few hours after general Greene took charge of the army at Charlotte Town a report was made of a gallant enterpriſe of lieutenant colonel Waſhington.

This was fortified by a block houſe, and encompaſſed by an abbatis, and was defended by upwards of one hundred of the inhabitants, who had ſubmitted to the Britiſh government. Lieutenant col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Waſhington advanced with his cavalry, and planted the trunk of a pine tree, ſo as to reſemble a field piece. The lucky moment was ſeized on. A corporal of dragoons rode up, and made a peremptory demand of an immediate ſurrender; when the garriſon, impreſſed with the expectation of an immediate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade in caſe of their refuſal, ſurrendered at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, without a ſhot being fired on either ſide. This favourable incident, in the juncture of affairs then exiſting, through the ſuperſtition to which moſt men are more or leſs ſubject, was viewed by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as an omen of ſucceſs under the new commander.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cornwallis now began to make very vigorous exertions, in order to penetrate into North Carolina. On the 11th of January his lordſhip's army was in motion,

In order to prevent this, lord Cornwallis detached lieutenant colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Tarleton, with 350 cavalty, part of the light inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the 7th regiment, the firſt battalion of the 71ſt regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and two three-pounders, to oppoſe the progreſs of Morgan, not doubting but that he would be able to perform this ſervice effectually.

Two pieces of artillery, two ſtandards, 800 muſkets, 35 baggage waggons, and upwards of 100 dragoon horſes fell into the hands of the Americans; whilſt the latter had only 12 men killed and 60 wounded.

<pb n="350" facs="unknown:028963_0349_0FDDBFD4D2AD95F0"/>junction with general Leſslie, who had been ordered to march towards him with a body of Britiſh troops from Wynneſborough. Conſiderable exertions were then made by part of the army, without baggage, to retake the priſoners in the hands of the Americans, and to intercept general Morgan's corps on its retreat to the Catawba. But that American officer, after his defeat of Tarleton, had made forced marches up into the country, and croſſed the Catawba the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great rain, which ſwelled the river to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to prevent the royal army from croſſing for ſeveral days; during which time the Britiſh priſoners were got over the Yadkin; whence they proceeded to Dan River, which they alſo paſſed, and on the 14th of February had reached Court-houſe, in the province of Virginia.</p>
                     <p>The Americans met with very providential eſcapes in this hot purſuit. The Britiſh reached the Catawba on the evening of the ſame day on which their fleeing adverſaries had croſſed it: And it is certain that if the riſing of the river had taken place a few hours earlier, general Morgan with his whole detachment and 500 priſoners would have ſcarcely had any chance of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. The ſame good fortune, attended with ſimilar circumſtances, protected them on paſſing the Yadkins.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cornwallis employed a halt of two days in collecting ſome flour, and in deſtroying ſuperfluous baggage and all his waggons, excepting thoſe laden with hoſpital ſtores, ſalt, and ammunition, and four reſerved empty in readineſs for ſick or wounded. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus freed from all unneceſſary incumbrances, he marched through North Carolina with great rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and penetrated to the remoteſt extremities of that province on the banks of the Dan.

                     <p>When lord Cornwallis arrived at Hillſborough, he erected the king's ſtandard, and invited, by proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all loyal ſubjects to repair to it, and to ſtand forth and take an active part in aſſiſting his lordſhip to reſtore order and government. He had been taught to believe that the king's friends were numerous in that part of the country: But the event did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the truth of the repreſentations that had been given. The royaliſts were but few in number, and ſame of them too timid to join the king's ſtandard. There were, indeed, about 350 who were proceeding to Hillſborough, under colonel Pyle, in order to avow their attachment to the royal cauſe; but they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, by whom a number of them are ſaid to have been killed when they were begging for quarter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making the leaſt reſiſtance. Meanwhile general Greene was marching with great expedition with the troops under his command, in order to form a junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with other corps of American troops, that he might thereby be enabled to put ſome effectual ſtop to the progreſs of the Britiſh. This enterpriſing and politic general, whilſt unequal even to defenſive opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, contrived to keep alive the courage of his party, to depreſs that of the loyaliſts, and to haraſs the fora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and detachments of the Britiſh, till reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:028963_0350_0FDDBFDE22111990"/>ſhould arrive. He lay ſeven days within ten miles of Cornwallis' camp, but took a new poſition every night, and kept it a profound ſecret where the next was to be. By theſe manoeuvres, Cornwallis could never gain information of his ſituation in time to profit by it. By various arts be avoided an action for three weeks, during which time he was often obliged to aſk bread from the common ſoldiers, having none of his own. Soon after this period, he was in condition to give battle to the enemy.</p>
                     <p>During theſe tranſactions, colonel Balfour, who commanded at Charleſton, equipped a ſmall force for an expedition to Cape Fear River. Major Craig was diſpatched on this ſervice with about 300 troops to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of January, under the convoy of a frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and two ſloops of war, commanded by captain Barclay. The troops landed about nine miles from Wilmington, and on the 28th of January entered that town, which, having the command of the river, was made a poſt of ſome ſtrength, and continued to be of importance whilſt Cornwallis remained in that country.</p>
                     <p>General Greene having effected a junction about the 10th of March with a continental reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iment of what were called <hi>eighteen months men,</hi>

The American army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the High Rock Ford on the 12th of the month, and on the 14th arrived at Guildford. Lord Cornwallis, from the information he had received of the motions of the American general, concluded what were his deſigns. As they approached more nearly to each other, a few ſkirmiſhes enſued between ſome advanced parties, in which the advantage was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

About four miles from Guildford, the advanced guard of the Britiſh army, commanded by lieutenant colonel Tarleton, fell in with a corps of the Americans, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of lieutenant colonel Lee's legion, ſome Back Mountain men and Virginia militia, with whom he had a ſevere ſkirmiſh, and was, at length, obliged to retreat.</p>
                     <p>The greater part of the country in which the action happened is a wilderneſs, with a few cleared fields interſperſed. The American army was poſted on a riſing ground about a mile and a half from Guildford court-houſe. It was drawn up in three lines: the front line was compoſed of the North Carolina militia, under the command of the generals Butler and Eaton; the ſecond line, of Virginia militia, commanded by the generals Stephens and Lawſon, forming two brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades; the third line, conſiſting of two brigades, one of Virginia and one of Maryland continental troops, commanded by general Hugar and colonel Williams. Lieutenant colonel Waſhington, with the dragoons of the firſt and third regiments, a detachment of light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry compoſed of continental troops, and a regiment of riflemen under colonel Lynch, formed a corps of obſervation for the ſecurity of their right flank.

                     <p>LORD Cornwallis, after his victory over general Greene at Guildford, proceeded, as has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, to Wilmington, where he arrived on the 7th of April. This march had the appearance of a retreat; and whilſt he remained at Wilmington his ſituation was not much mended. His force was not greatly above 1,000 effective men; ſo that it appeared equally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, if not impoſſible, to return to the aſſiſtance of lord Rawdon, of whoſe misfortunes he had heard, or to maintain his ground in the ſituation he then occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied. He therefore took the bold and hazardous reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution of marching into Virginia, and effecting a junction with general Philips. His lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſet out on the 25th of April,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 25.</note> after having ſent inſtructions to colonel Balfour at Charleſton to ſend tranſports and proviſions to Wilmington for the uſe of the troops, in caſe of any misfortune. The marquis de la Fayette, who kept on the north ſide of James' River, being informed of his deſign, made a rapid movement in order to get before
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:028963_0357_0FDDBFF092EEBDA0"/>the Britiſh. The vigilance of lord Cornwallis, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, diſappointed his antagoniſt.</p>
                     <p>On the 20th of May, his lordſhip arrived at Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg in Virginia, where he joined a body of Britiſh troops that had been under the command of major general Philips;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 20.</note> but the command of which, in conſequence of the death of that officer, who had been cut off by a fever a few lays before, had devolved upon brigadier general Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ad ſailed from Corke for Charleſton. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, together with lord Rawdon's report of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he had gained over general Greene, eaſed his mind of all anxiety for South Carolina, and inſpired him with hopes of a glorious campaign.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cornwallis having taken upon himſelf the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the army, found no enemy capable of oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the field. Having ſtationed a body of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oops at Portſmouth under general Leſslie, he advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Peterſburgh to James' River, which having croſſed, he paſſed through Hanover county, and croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the South Anna or Pamunkey River. The marquis
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:028963_0358_0FDDBFF21223C0C8"/>de la Fayette followed his motions, but at a guarded diſtance. The ſuperiority of the Britiſh army, eſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ially of their cavalry, which they eaſily ſupplied with good horſes from the ſtables and paſtures of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, enabled them to ſcour the country in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. Lieutenant colonel Tarleton and lieutenant colonel Simpcoe were ſent with ſeparate bodies of troops upon two diſtant expeditions. The former to Charlotteville to attempt capturing the governour and aſſembly of the State, and the latter to deſtroy ſtores as Point of Fork. Tarleton ſucceeded ſo far as to diſperſe the aſſembly, capture ſeven of its members, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a great quantity of ſtores at and near Charlo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville. Simpcoe was only in part ſucceſsful, for the Americans had removed the moſt of their ſtores from Point of Fork. In the courſe of theſe marches and countermarches immenſe quantities of property were deſtroyed, many unimportant ſkirmiſhes took place, and many partial conqueſts were made by the Britiſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any durable effect. The marquis de la Fayette acted with ſo much caution, made ſo judicious a choice of poſts, and ſhewed ſo much vigour and deſign in his movements, as to prevent any advantage being taken of his weakneſs. He effected a junction at Racoon Ford with general Wayne, who was at the head of 800 Pennſylvanians. Whilſt this junction was forming, the Britiſh got between the American army and its ſtores, which had been removed from Richmond to Albemarle old court houſe. The marquis had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to extricate himſelf from this difficulty. By forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed marches he got within a few miles of the enemy when they were two days march from Albemarle court houſe, and opened in the night a nearer road to the court houſe, which had been long diſuſed and was much embarraſſed. To the ſurpriſe of lord Cornwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:028963_0358_0FDDBFF21223C0C8"/>the marquis fixed himſelf next day between the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh army and the American ſtores.</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip now commenced a retrograde move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, accompanied with his detachments under Tarleton and Simpcoe, in two night's marches meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back upwards of 50 miles. When he reached Richmond the marquis was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hard after him.
<note place="margin">

                        </gap>arching of the light infantry and Pennſylvanians, they returned into the town. About this time the marquis was reinforced by baron de Steuben's troops, and by militia from the parts adjacent. He followed lard Cornwallis, and had the addreſs to impreſs him with an idea that the American army was much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than it really was. His lordſhip therefore retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Williamſburg. The day after the main body of the Britiſh army arrived there,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 26.</note> their rear was attacked by an Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican light corps under colonel Butler, and had 33 kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wounded.</p>
                     <p>According to a private letter ſent by Fayette to the preſident of Congreſs, his own troops at this period conſiſted only of 1,500 regulars, 400 new levies, and about 2,000 militia, in all 3,900; whilſt Cornwallis's amounted to 4,000 regulars, 800 of whom were mounted.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of theſe movements, beſides articles ſimilar to thoſe already mentioned, the Britiſh deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above 2,000 hogſheads of tobacco, with ſome braſs and a number of iron ordnance; but they were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no great number of inhabitants, and ſcarcely by any of the native Virginians. Lord Cornwallis, in his marches from Charleſton to Camden, from Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Dan River, from the Dan through North
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:028963_0359_0FDDBFFBF72FF1E8"/>Carolina to Wilmington, from Wilmington to Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and from Richmond to Williamſburg, made a route of more than 1,100 miles, without computing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations.</p>
                     <p>About the time lord Cornwallis reached Williamſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, he received intelligence from New York, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the danger to which that city was expoſed from a combined attack, that was ſaid to be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, by the allies. Sir Henry Clinton therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a detachment from earl Cornwallis, if not engaged in any important enterpriſe, and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him a healthy ſtation, with an ample defenſive force till New York ſhould be out of danger. Lord Cornwallis, in order to comply with this requiſition, determined to retire to Portſmouth, judging that he could more eaſily maintain that poſt, with a diminiſhed force, than his preſent poſition. For the execution of this project, he had to croſs James' River. The marquis de la Fayette, judging this to be a favourable opportunity for an attack, advanced on the Britiſh. General Wayne being informed that the main body of the Britiſh had croſſed the river,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>July</hi> 6.</note> puſhed forward with 800 men to haraſs their rear; but to his great ſurpriſe diſcovered the Britiſh army, about ſun-ſet, ready to receive him. With great preſence of mind he extricated himſelf from his perilous ſituation, by boldly attacking and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them for a while, and then retreating with the utmoſt expedition. Lord Cornwallis, having ſecured the cannon which his adverſary had left behind, would admit of no purſuit. He ſuſpected, from the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the circumſtances, that the whole was a ſcheme to draw him into an ambuſcade. The Britiſh paſſed the river at night, and retired to Portſmouth without moleſtation.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cornwallis had previouſly taken the neceſſary ſteps for forwarding a part of his command to New
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:028963_0359_0FDDBFFBF72FF1E8"/>York. But before they ſailed, an expreſs arrived from ſir Henry Clinton with a letter, expreſſing his preference of Williamſburg to Portſmouth for the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence of the army, and his deſire that Old Point Comfort or Hampton Road ſhould be ſecured as a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for line of battle ſhips. The commander in chief at the ſame time allowed his lordſhip to detain any part or the whole of the forces under his command, for completing this ſervice. It being a principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the campaign to fix on a ſtrong permanent poſt or place of arms in the Cheſpeak for the ſecurity of both the army and navy, and the places above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned having been found to be altogether incapable of anſwering the end, York Town, on the river of that name, and Glouceſter Point, on the oppoſite ſide of the river, were conſidered as moſt likely to accord with the views of the royal commanders. Lord Cornwallis availed himſelf of ſir Henry Clinton's permiſſion to retain the whole force under his command, and having evacuated Portſmouth, returned in Auguſt, with the army to that peninſula which lies between the great rivers James and York, and compoſes one of the richeſt and moſt beautiful parts of Virginia. York Town is ſituated on the river of that name, on the narroweſt part of the peninſula, where it is about five miles broad; Glouceſter Point is on the north and oppoſite ſide and projects ſo far into the river, that the diſtance betwixt the two is little more than a mile. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely command the navigation of the river which here is of ſufficient depth to admit ſhips of a very large ſize and burthen. Both theſe poſts therefore, were now fortified with the utmoſt care and diligence, and every method taken to make them equally ſtrong on the ſides of the land and water, the whole of his force amounting to 7,000 men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="372" facs="unknown:028963_0360_0FDDBFFD4F547810"/>
Whilſt his lordſhip was thus exerting himſelf to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his poſt impregnable, all the ſcattered operations of active hoſtility began at length to converge into a point, and the grand cataſtrophe of the American war opened to the world.</p>
                     <p>An eventual plan of the whole campaign had been fixed at Weathersfield, at an interview between general Waſhington,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 6.</note> Knox, and du Portal, on the part of the Americans, and the count de Rochambeau and the chevalier Chaſteleux, on the part of the French. This was to lay ſiege to New York in concert with a French ſleet which was to arrive on the coaſt in the month of Auguſt. It was agreed that the French troops ſhould march towards the North River. Letters were addreſſed to the executive offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of New Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts, Connecticut, and New Jerſey, requiring them to fill up their battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and to have their quotas 6,200 militia in readineſs within a week of the time they might be called for. Accordingly the French troops marched from Rhode Iſland in June, and early in the following month join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the American army. About the time this junction took place, general Waſhington marched his army from their winter encampment near Peekſkill, to the vicinity of King's Bridge. General Lincoln fell down the North River with a detachment in boats, and took poſſeſſion of the ground where Fort Independence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſtood. An attack was made upon him, but was ſoon diſcontinued. The Britiſh about this time retired with almoſt the whole of their forces to York Iſland. Flat bottomed boats ſufficient to tranſport 5,000 men were built near Albany, and brought down Hudſon's River to the neighbourhood of the American army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore New York. Every movement was made which was introductory to the commencement of the ſiege. It was not a little mortifying to general Waſhington,
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:028963_0360_0FDDBFFD4F547810"/>to find himſelf on the ſecond of Auguſt to be only a few hundreds ſtronger than he was on the day his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my firſt moved from their winter quarters. He bore this hard trial, however, with his uſual magnanimity, and contented himſelf with repeating his requiſitions to the ſtates, and at the ſame time urged them by ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery tie, to enable him to fulfil engagements entered into on their account, with the commander of the French troops.</p>
                     <p>The tardineſs of the ſtates, which at other times had brought them to the brink of ruin, was now accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of real ſervice. Had they ſent forward their recruits for the regular army, and their quotas of militia as was expected, the ſiege of New York would have commenced in the latter end of July, or early in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. Whilſt the ſeaſon was waſting away in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe reinforcements, lord Cornwallis as has been related, fixed himſelf near the capes of Virginia. His ſituation there, the arrival of a reinforcement of 3,000 Germans from Europe to New York, the delay in recruiting the army, and eſpecially the recent intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from count de Graſſe, that his deſtination was fixed to the Cheſapeak, concurred, about the middle of Auguſt,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 15.</note> to make a total change of the plan of the campaign.</p>
                     <p>The American commander ſtill kept up the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an intention to attack New York, in order to amuſe and deceive the Britiſh general. Whilſt this deception was played off, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied army croſſed the North River,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 24.</note> and paſſed on by the way of Philadelphia to York Town.</p>
                     <p>At the time that the attack on New York was in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious contemplation, a letter from general Waſhington detailing the particulars of the intended operations of the campaign, being intercepted, fell into the hands of
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:028963_0361_0FDDBFFED6FF0DF0"/>ſir Henry Clinton. After the plan was changed, the royal commander was ſo much under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the intelligence contained in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted letter, that he believed every movement to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Virginia to be a feint, calculated to draw off his attention from New York. Nor could he be brought to believe that the allies had fixed upon Virginia for the theatre of their intended operations, until the beſt opportunity for ſtriking them had elapſed. When general Waſhington arrived at Cheſter, he received the joyful news that count de Graſſe had arrived in the Cheſapeak on the 30th of Auguſt, with 28 ſail of the line from the Weſt-Indies.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 30.</note> The count on his paſſage fell in with and took a packet from Charleſton, having lord Rawdon on board, who was on his return to Great Britain.</p>
                     <p>Count de Graſſe, without loſs of time, blocked up York River with three large ſhips and ſome frigates, and moored the principal part of his fleet in Lynhaven Bay. Three thouſand French troops, brought in this fleet from the Weſt Indies, commanded by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de St. Simon, were diſembarked and ſoon after formed a junction with the continental troops under the marquis de la Fayette, and the whole took poſt at Williamſburg. Lord Cornwallis intended to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack this force, but before all the neceſſary arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were fixed upon, he received letters from ſir Henry Clinton announcing that he would do his utmoſt to reinforce the royal army in the Cheſapeak, or make every diverſion in his power, and that admiral Digby was hourly expected on the coaſt. On the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of this intelligence earl Cornwallis, not thinking himſelf juſtified in hazarding an engagement, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the reſolution of attacking the combined force of Fayette and St. Simon. And from an opinion that his inſtructions to ſtand his ground were poſitive, or
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:028963_0361_0FDDBFFED6FF0DF0"/>that effectual relief was probable, his lordſhip thought proper to riſk every thing on the iſſue of a ſiege. An attempt was made to burn or diſlodge the French ſhips in the river, but none to evacuate his poſts when that meaſure was practicable.</p>
                     <p>Admiral Greaves with 20 ſail of the line made an ineffectual effort for the relief of Lord Cornwallis. When he appeared off the capes of Virginia, M. de Graſſe with his ſuperior fleet went out to meet him, and an indeciſive engagement took place. The Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh were willing to renew the action; but de Graſſe declined it.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 7.</note> His chief object in coming out of the capes was to cover a French fleet of eight line of battle ſhips, which was expected from Rhode Iſland. Agreeably to a pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed plan, count de Barras, commander of this fleet, had ſailed for the Cheſapeak about the time de Graſſe ſailed from the Weſt Indies for the ſame place. To avoid the Britiſh fleet, he had taken a circuit by Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muda; and de Graſſe now came out to prevent the Britiſh from intercepting him, on his approach. Whilſt the hoſtile fleets were manoeuvring near the mouth of the Cheſapeak, count de Barras paſſed the Britiſh fleet in the night, and got within the capes of Virginia. After the French fleet had obtained ſuch a ſuperiority, admiral Greaves ſoon took his departure, and M. de Graſſe re-entered the Cheſapeak.</p>
                     <p>General Waſhington and count Rochambeau reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Williamſburg on the 14th of September. They with generals Chaſtelleux,

                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 14.</note> Du Portal, and Knox proceeded to viſit count de Graſſe on board the ſhip the Ville de Paris, and agreed on a plan of operations.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the combined armies were advancing to the ſiege of York Town, ſir Henry Clinton determined on an excurſion from New York to Connecticut, vainly
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:028963_0362_0FDDC00612B189A8"/>thinking that the alarm might recal part of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can force to the defence of that country. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this expedition was committed to general Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold, and its object was the town of New London in his native country.</p>
                     <p>"The troops employed therein, were landed in two detachments on each ſide of the harbour. The one was commanded by lieutenant col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Eyre,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 6.</note> and the other by general Arnold. The latter met with little oppoſition. Fort Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull, and a redoubt which was intended to cover the harbour, not being tenable, were evacuated, and the men croſſed the river to fort Griſwold on Groton hill. This was furiouſly attacked by lieutenant col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Eyre. The garriſon defended themſelves with great reſolution, but after a ſevere conflict of forty minutes, the fort was carried by the aſſailants. The Americans had not more than ſix or ſeven men killed, when the Britiſh carried their lines; but a ſevere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution took place afterwards, though reſiſtance had ceaſed. An officer of the conquering troops inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his entering the fort who commanded. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Ledyard anſwered, "I did, but you do now;" and preſented him his ſword. The colonel was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ran through the body and killed. Between 30 and 40 were wounded, and about 40 were carried off priſoners. On the ſide of the Britiſh 48 were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and 145 wounded: Among the latter was major Montgomery, and among the former was colonel Eyre. About 15 veſſels, loaded with the effects of the inhabitants, retreated up the river, and four others remained in the harbour unhurt; but all excepting theſe were burned by the communication of fire from the burning ſtores. Sixty dwelling houſes and 84 ſtores were reduced to aſhes. The loſs which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans ſuſtained by the deſtruction of naval ſtores,
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:028963_0362_0FDDC00612B189A8"/>of proviſions and merchandiſe, was immenſe. General Arnold having completed the object of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, returned in eight days to New York."

                     </p>
                     <p>Soon after general Waſhington had viſited the French admiral, count de Graſſe, the latter, wrote to the former, that in caſe a Britiſh fleet appeared, "he conceived that he ought to go out and meet them at ſea, inſtead of riſking an engagement in a confined ſituation." This alarmed the general. He ſent the marquis de la Fayette, with a letter to diſſuade him from the dangerous meaſure. This letter and the perſuaſions of the marquis had the deſired effect.</p>
                     <p>The combined forces proceeded on their way to York Town, partly by land, and partly down the Cheſapeak. The whole, together with a body of Virginia militia under the command of general Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, amounting in the aggregate to 12,000 men, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouſed at Williamſburg on the 25th of September,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 25.</note> and in five days after, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to the inveſtiture of York Town. The French fleet at the ſame time moved to the mouth of York River, and took a poſition which was calculated to prevent lord Cornwallis either from retreating or receiving ſuccours by water. Before the army marched from Williamſburg to York Town, general Waſhington gave out in general orders as follows: "If the enemy ſhould be tempted to meet the army on its march, the general particularly enjoins the troops to place their principal reliance on the bayonet, that they may prove the vanity of the boaſt which the Britiſh make of their peculiar proweſs in deciding battles with that weapon."</p>
                     <p>The combined army halted in the evening, about two miles from York Town, and lay on their arms all
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:028963_0363_0FDDC0089C22DD98"/>night. On the next day colonel Scammell, an officer of great merit, was mortally wounded and taken priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in approaching the outworks of the Britiſh. About this time earl Cornwallis received a letter from ſir Henry Clinton, announcing the arrival of admiral Digby with three ſhips of the line from Europe, and the determinations of the general and flag officers in New York to embark 5,000 men in a fleet, which would probably ſail on the 5th of October—that this fleet conſiſted of 23 ſail of the line, and that joint ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of the navy and army would be made for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. On the night after the receipt of this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, earl Cornwallis quitted his outward poſition, and retired to one more inward. On the 9th and 10th of October, the French and Americans open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their batteries;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 10.</note> and a tremendous roar of cannon and mortars was continued for ſix or eight hours without ceaſing. Major Cochran was ſent from New York on the 3d of October with a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate of ſir Henry Clinton's letter. That gallant of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer went in a veſſel to the Capes, and made his way to earl Cornwallis, through the whole French fleet, in an open boat. He got to York Town on the ſame day the Americans opened their batteries; and ſoon after his arrival had his head carried off by a cannon ball. On the 10th and 11th the ſhells of the beſiegers ſet on fire and burned the Charon, of 44 guns, together with a guard ſhip and a tranſport. Earl Cornwallis, it is ſaid, was adviſed at this juncture to evacuate York Town, and, after paſſing over to Glouceſter, to force his way into the country. But had this movement been made, and the royal army been defeated or captured in the interior country, and in the mean time had ſir Henry Clinton reached York Town with the promiſed relief, the precipitancy of the noble earl would have been perhaps more the ſubject of cenſure, than his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:028963_0363_0FDDC0089C22DD98"/>of ſtanding his ground and reſiſting to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>
                     <p>On the 11th the beſiegers commenced their ſecond parallel, 200 yards from the works of the beſieged. Two redoubts which were advanced on the left of the Britiſh, greatly retarded the progreſs of the beſiegers; it was therefore determined to attack both at the ſame hour, on the evening of the 14th, as ſoon as it was dark. To accompliſh their reduction as ſoon as poſſible,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 14.</note> as well as to prevent jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, the attack of the one was committed to the French, of the other to the Americans. Both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments having paſſed the abbatis and paliſades, with unloaded muſkets carried them in a few minutes. The Americans had only 8 killed and 28 wounded; but the French loſt a conſiderable number of men. Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant colonel Lawrens, ſon to the former preſident of congreſs, took the commanding officer priſoner. His humanity and that of his aſſociates ſo overcame their reſentment that they ſpared the Britiſh, though they were charged, when they went to the aſſault, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber New London, and to retaliate by putting the men in the redoubt to the ſword. Being aſked why they had diſobeyed orders by bringing them off as priſoners, they anſwered, "We could not put them to death, when they begged for their lives." About five of the Britiſh were killed and the reſt were captured. Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Hamilton who conducted the enterpriſe, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the marquis de la Fayette, mentioned to the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of his detachment, "that incapable of imitating examples of barbarity, and forgetting recent provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they ſpared every man who ceaſed to reſiſt."</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh were ſo weakened by the fire of the combined armies, but chiefly by ſickneſs, that earl Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis could not venture any conſiderable number in the making of ſallies. The preſent emergency, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:028963_0364_0FDDC00A1681A860"/>was ſuch, that he ordered a ſortie of about 400 men, under lieutenant colonel Abercrombie. He made the attack with ſuch impetuoſity,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 16.</note> that the redoubts which covered the batteries were forced, and eleven pieces of cannon ſpiked. The French troops, who guarded that part of the intrenchment, ſuffered conſiderably. This ſucceſsful exploit did hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the officers and troops engaged, but produced no eſſential benefit. The cannon, being haſtily ſpiked, were again rendered ſerviceable; and the combined forces were ſo induſtrious, that, about four o'clock in the afternoon of the ſame day the batteries were fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, and fired briſkly. Their ſeveral batteries were now covered with nearly 100 pieces of heavy ordnance, whilſt the Britiſh works were ſo deſtroyed that they could ſcarcely ſhew a ſingle gun.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cornwallis being now reduced to the neceſſity of preparing for a ſurrender, or of attempting an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, determined on the latter. Boats were prepared under different pretences, for the reception of the troops by ten at night, in order to paſs them over to Glouceſter Point. The arrangements were made with the utmoſt ſecrecy. The intention was to abandon the baggage, and to leave a detachment behind to capitulate for the town's people, and for the ſick and wounded; his lordſhip having already prepared a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the ſubject, to be delivered to general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington after his departure. The firſt embarkation had arrived at Glouceſter Point, and the greater part of the troops were already landed, when the weather, which was before moderate and calm, inſtantly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a moſt violent ſtorm of wind and rain. The boats with the remaining troops were all driven down the river, and the deſign of paſſing over was not only entirely fruſtrated, but the abſence of the boats rendered it impoſſible to bring back the troops from Glouceſter.
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:028963_0364_0FDDC00A1681A860"/>Thus weakened and divided, the army was in no ſmall danger. However, the boats returned, and the troops were brought back in the courſe of the forenoon with very little loſs.</p>
                     <p>Things were now haſtening to a period which would no longer be protracted; for the Britiſh works were ſinking under the weight of the French and American artillery. All hopes of relief from New York were over, and the ſtrength and ſpirits of the royal army were broken down and exhauſted by their conſtant and unremitting fatigue. Matters being in this ſituation,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 17.</note> on the 17th of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober land Cornwallis ſent a letter to general Waſhington, requeſting a ceſſation of arms for 24 hours, and that commiſſioners might be appointed for digeſting the terms of capitulation. Commiſſioners were accordingly appointed; and on the ſide of the allies were viſcount de Noailles and lieutenant colonel Laurens, whoſe father was in cloſe confinement in the Tower of London, whilſt the ſon was drawing up ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, by which an Engliſh nobleman and a Britiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my became priſoners.</p>
                     <p>On the 19th of October, the poſts of York Town and Glouceſter were ſurrendered. The honour of marching out with colours flying, which had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to general Lincoln, was now refuſed to lord Cornwallis, and Lincoln was appointed to receive the ſubmiſſion of the royal army at York Town, preciſely in the ſame way his own had been conducted, about 18 months before, at Charleſton. The troops that ſurrendered exceeded 7,000; but ſo great was the number of ſick and wounded, that there were only 3,800 capable of doing duty. The officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers retained their baggage and effects. Fifteen hundred ſeamen ſhared the ſame fate as the garriſon. The Guadaloupe frigate of 24 guns, and a number
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:028963_0365_0FDDC00B9EE4A548"/>of tranſports were ſurrendered to the conquerors. About twenty tranſports had been ſunk or burned during the ſiege, including the ſhips already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The land forces became priſoners to congreſs; but the ſeamen and ſhips were aſſigned to the French admiral. The Americans obtained a fine train of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, conſiſting of 75 braſs ordnance, and 69 iron cannon, howitzers and mortars. The regular troops of France and America employed in this ſiege, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of about 7,000 of the former, and 5,500 of the latter; and they were aſſiſted by about 4,000 militia. On the part of the combined army about 300 were killed or wounded. On the part of the Britiſh about 500; and 70 were taken in the redoubts which were ſtormed on the 14th of October.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cornwallis tried to obtain an indemnity for thoſe of the inhabitants who had joined him; but he was obliged to conſent to deliver them up to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional mercy of their countrymen. His lordſhip nevertheleſs obtained permiſſion for the Boneta ſloop of war to paſs unexamined to New York. This gave an opportunity of ſkreening ſuch of them as were moſt obnoxious to the Americans.</p>
                     <p>A Britiſh fleet of 25 ſail of the line, two fifty gun ſhips, and eight frigates, having on board Sir Henry Clinton, with 7,000 of his beſt troops, deſtined for the relief of lord Cornwallis, arrived off the Cheſapeak on the fifth day after his ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oct.</hi> 24.</note> but on receiving advice of this event, they returned to Sandy Hook. And de Graſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Cheſapeak till the 5th of November, when he ſet ſail for the Weſt Indies.</p>
                     <p>The reduction of the Britiſh army occaſioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual tranſports of joy in the breaſts of the whole

<note n="*" place="bottom">The door keeper of congreſs, an aged man, is ſaid to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired ſuddenly, immediately after hearing of the capture of lord Cornwallis's army.

                     <p>The campaign of 1781 terminated in all parts of the United States in favour of the Americans. The Britiſh were now confined to their garriſons in New York, Charleſton, and Savannah. After the capture of lord Cornwallis, general Waſhington returned with the greateſt part of his force to the vicinity of New York. The Britiſh having good reaſons for not urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hoſtilities without their lines, and general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington not being in condition to attempt the reduction of that poſt, ſome indeciſive excurſions of ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence took place. This in a great meaſure was alſo the caſe in South Carolina. General Greene had poſſeſſion of all the ſtate except Charleſton and the vicinity. The Britiſh ſometimes ſallied out of their lines for the acquiſition of property and proviſions. In oppoſing one of theſe near Cambahee, lieutenant colonel John Laurens,

In about three months after the capture of lord Cornwallis was known in Great Britain, the king and parliament reſolved to abandon all offenſive operations in America. In conſequence of this, every idea of conqueſt being given up, arrangements were made for withdrawing the royal forces from Georgia and South Carolina, and ſtationing them in New York.</p>

                     <p>THE United States afforded few great events in the year 1782. Thoſe which took place in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope and in the Weſt Indies, in which the powers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the American war were concerned, come now to be related.</p>
                     <p>Britain was at this time attacked in every quarter where ſhe had foreign poſſeſſions, and the combination againſt her was ſo great, that the iſland of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norea was left to its fate. After a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſiege it ſurrendered to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined armies of France and Spain,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Feb.</hi> 5.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of the duke de Crillon in the ſervice
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:028963_0367_0FDDC013A21069C8"/>of his moſt Catholic majeſty. About the ſame time the ſettlements of Demarara and Eſſiquibo, which in the preceding year had been taken by the Britiſh, were taken from them by the French. The marquis de Bouille added to the ſplendour of his former fame the reduction of St. Euſtatius and St. Kitts; the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at the cloſe of the year 1781, and the latter early in the year 1782. The iſlands of Nevis and Monſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat likewiſe fell into the hands of the French, who were at this time firmly eſtabliſhed in the Weſt Indies. Their land and naval force was very formidable. The monarchies of France and Spain had never before ſo prodigious an armament in that quarter. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined navies amounted to ſixty ſail of the line, beſides a vaſt multitude of frigates and armed veſſels. With this force they expected to reduce a great part of the Britiſh iſlands.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Britiſh miniſtry ſent a ſquadron under the command of admiral Rodney for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their poſſeſſions in that quarter. After Rodney had formed a junction with ſir Samuel Hood's ſquadron, and received an addition of three ſhips from Britain, his force amounted only to thirty ſix ſail of the line.</p>
                     <p>It was the deſign of count de Graſſe, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the French fleet at Martinique amounting to 34 ſail of the line, to proceed to Hiſpaniola and join the Spaniſh admiral Don Solano, who with ſixteen ſhips of the line and a conſiderable land force was waiting for his arrival, and to make in concert with him an attack on Jamaica.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh admiral wiſhed to prevent this junction, or at leaſt to force an engagement before it was effected.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 8.</note> Admiral Rodney came up with count de Graſſe, ſoon after he had ſet out to join the Spaniſh fleet at Hiſpaniola.
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:028963_0368_0FDDC01578A9AD20"/>Partial engagements took place on the three firſt days after they came near to each other. In theſe, two of the French ſhips were ſo badly damaged, that they were obliged to quit the fleet.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 12.</note> On the next day a general engagement took place: This began at ſeven in the morning, and continued till paſt ſix in the evening. There was no apparent ſuperiority on either ſide till between twelve and one o'clock, when admiral Rodney broke the French line of battle, by bearing down upon their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and penetrating through it. The land forces, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined for the expedition againſt Jamaica, amounting to 5,500 men, were diſtributed on board the French fleet. Their ſhips were therefore ſo crowded, that the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on board was prodigious. The battle was fought on both ſides with equal ſpirit, but with a very une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual iſſue. The French, for near a century, had not in any naval engagement been ſo completely worſted. Their fleet was little leſs than ruined. Upwards of 400 men were killed on board one of their ſhips, and the whole number of their killed and wounded amounted by computation to 3,000 killed and 6,000 wounded; while the loſs of the Britiſh did not much exceed 1,100 men. The French loſt in this action, and the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent purſuit, eight ſhips of the line. On board the captured ſhips was the money for the payment of the troops, the whole train of artillery, with the battering cannon and travelling carriages, intended for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt Jamaica. One of them was the Ville de Paris, ſo called from the city of Paris having built her at its own expenſe, and made a preſent of her to the king. She had coſt four millions of livres, and was eſteemed the moſt magnificent ſhip in France; ſhe carried 110 guns, and had on board 1,300 men. This was truly an unfortunate day to count de Graſſe. Though his behaviour throughout the whole action
<pb n="389" facs="unknown:028963_0368_0FDDC01578A9AD20"/>was firm and intrepid, and his reſiſtance continued till he and two more were the only men left ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the upper deck, he was at laſt obliged to ſtrike. It was no ſmall addition to his misfortunes that he was on the point of forming a junction, which would have ſet him above all danger. Had this taken place, the whole Britiſh naval power in the Weſt Indies, on principles of ordinary calculation, would have been inſufficient to have prevented him from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into effect ſchemes of the moſt extenſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                     <p>The ſhips of the defeated fleet fled in a variety of directions. Twenty three or twenty four fail made the beſt of their way to Cape Francois. This was all that remained in a body of that fleet which was lately ſo formidable. By this ſignal victory, the deſigns of France and Spain were fruſtrated. No farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes were undertaken againſt the fleets or poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Great Britain in the Weſt Indies, and ſuch meaſures only were embraced, as ſeemed requiſite for the purpoſes of ſafety. When the news of admiral Rodney's victory reached Great Britain, a general joy was diffuſed over the nation. Before there had been much deſpondency. Their loſſes in the Cheſapeak and in the Weſt Indies, together with the increaſing number of their enemies, had depreſſed the ſpirits of the great body of the people; but the advantages gained on the 12th of April, placed them on high ground, either for ending or proſecuting the war. It was fortunate for the Americans, that this ſucceſs of the Britiſh was poſterior to their loſs in Virginia. It ſo elevated the ſpirits of Britain, and ſo depreſſed the hopes of France, that had it taken place prior to the ſurrender of lord Cornwallis, that event would have been leſs influential in diſpoſing the nation to peace. As the cataſtrophe of York Town cloſed the national
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:028963_0369_0FDDBF939453ACA0"/>war in North America, ſo the defeat of de Graſſe, in a great meaſure, put a period to hoſtilities in the Weſt Indies.</p>
                     <p>Other deciſive events ſoon followed, which diſpoſed another of the belligerent powers to a pacification. Gibralter, though ſucceſſively relieved, ſtill continued to be beſieged. The reduction of Minorca inſpired the Spaniſh nation with freſh motives to perſeverance. The duke de Crillon, who had been recently ſucceſsful in the ſiege of Minorca, was appointed to conduct the ſiege of Gibralter, and it was reſolved to employ the whole ſtrength of the Spaniſh monarchy in ſeconding his operations. No means were neglected, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe ſpared, that promiſed to forward the views of the beſiegers. From the failure of all plans hitherto adopted for effecting the reduction of Gibralter, it was reſolved to adopt new ones. Among the various projects for this purpoſe, one which had been formed by the Chevalier D'Arcon was deemed the moſt worthy of trial. This was to conſtruct ſuch float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing batteries as could neither be ſunk nor fired. With this view their bottoms were made of the thickeſt timber, and their ſides of wood and cork long ſoaked in water, with a large layer of wet ſand between.</p>
                     <p>To prevent the effects of red hot balls, a number of pipes were contrived to carry water through every part of them, and pumps were provided to keep theſe conſtantly ſupplied with water. The people on board were to be ſheltered from the fall of bombs by a cover of rope netting, which was made ſloping and overlaid with wet hides.</p>
                     <p>Theſe floating batteries, ten in number, were made out of the hulls of large veſſels, cut down for the purpoſe, and carried from 28 to 10 guns each, and were ſeconded by 80 large boats mounted with
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:028963_0369_0FDDBF939453ACA0"/>guns of heavy metal, and alſo by a multitude of frigates, ſhips of force, and ſome hundreds of ſmall craft.</p>
                     <p>General Elliot, the intrepid defender of Gibralter, was not ignorant that inventions of a peculiar kind were prepared againſt him, but knew nothing of their conſtruction. He nevertheleſs provided for every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of danger that could be foreſeen or imagined.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 13.</note> The 13th day of September was fixed upon by the beſiegers for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a grand attack, when the new invented machines, with all the united powers of gunpowder and artillery in their higheſt ſtate of improvement, were to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into action. The combined fleets of France and Spain in the bay of Gibralter amounted to 48 fail of the line. Their batteries were covered with 154 pieces of heavy braſs cannon. The numbers employed by land and ſea againſt the fortreſs were eſtimated at one hundred thouſand men. With this force and by the fire of 300 cannon, mortars, and howitzers, from the adjacent iſthmus, it was intended to attack every part of the Britiſh works at one and the ſame inſtant. The ſurrounding hills were covered with people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to behold the ſpectacle. The cannonade and bombardment was tremendous. The ſhowers of ſhot and ſhells from the land batteries, and the ſhips of the beſiegers, and from the various works of the garriſon, exhibited a moſt dreadful ſcene. Four hundred pieces of the heavieſt artillery were playing at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The whole peninſula ſeemed to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in the torrents of fire which were inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poured upon it. The Spaniſh floating batteries for ſome time anſwered the expectations of their framers. The heavieſt ſhells often rebounded from their tops, while thirty two pound ſhot made no viſible impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon their hulls. For ſome hours, the attack
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:028963_0370_0FDDC01866AED118"/>and defence were ſo equally ſupported, as ſcarcely to admit any appearance of ſuperiority on either ſide. The conſtruction of the battering ſhips was ſo well calculated for withſtanding the combined force of fire and artillery, that they ſeemed for ſome time to bid defiance to the powers of the heavieſt ordnance. In the afternoon the effects of hot ſhot became viſible. At firſt there was only an appearance of ſmoke, but in the courſe of the night, after the fire of the garriſon had continued about 15 hours, two of the floating batteries were in flames, and ſeveral more were viſibly beginning to kindle. The endeavours of the beſiegers were now excluſively directed to bring off the men from the burning veſſels, but in this they were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Captain Curtis who lay ready with 12 gun boats, advanced and fired upon them with ſuch order and expedition, as to throw them into confuſion before they had finiſhed their buſineſs. They fled with their boats, and abandoned to their fate great numbers of their people. The opening of day light diſcloſed a moſt dreadful ſpectacle. Many were ſeen in the midſt of the flames crying out for help, while others were floating upon pieces of timber, expoſed to equal danger from the oppoſite element. The generous humanity of the victors equalled their valour, and was the more honourable, as the exertions of it expoſed them to no leſs danger than thoſe of active hoſtility. In endeavouring to ſave the lives of his enemies, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Curtis nearly loſt his own. While for the moſt benevolent purpoſe he was along ſide the floating batteries, one of them blew up, and ſome heavy pieces of timber fell into his boat and pierced through its bottom. By ſimilar perilous exertions, near 400 men were ſaved from inevitable deſtruction. The exerciſe of humanity to an enemy, under ſuch circumſtances of immediate action and impending danger, conferred
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:028963_0370_0FDDC01866AED118"/>more true honour than could be acquired by the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> impreſſion made to the diſadvantage of human nature, by the madneſs of mankind in deſtroying each other by waſteful wars. The floating batteries were all conſumed. The violence of their exploſion was ſuch, as to burſt open doors and windows at a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>atteries, lord Howe, with 35 ſhips of the line, brought ſo the brave garriſon an ample ſupply of every thing wanted, either for their ſupport or their defence. This complete relief of Gibralter was the third deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive event in the courſe of a twelvemonth, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the re-eſtabliſhment of a general peace.</p>
                     <p>The capture of the Britiſh army in Virginia—the defeat of count de Graſſe, and the deſtruction of the Spaniſh floating batteries, diſpoſed all the hoſtile pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to a general peace.</p>
                     <p>It was expected indeed by moſt people in America, and by many in England, that the capture of lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis would inſtantly diſpoſe the nation to peace; but the American war was too much the favourite of the miniſtry to be relinquiſhed, without a ſtruggle for its continuance.</p>
                     <p>The king of Great Britain, in his ſpeech to parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after intelligence had arrived of the capitulation of York Town, declared "That he ſhould not anſwer to the truſt committed to the ſovereign of a free people,

The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined language of this ſpeech pointed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the American war. An addreſs of thanks,
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:028963_0371_0FDDC019D1755088"/>couched in the uſual ſtyle, was voted in the houſe of commons by a majority of 131 to 54. In the houſe of lords a ſimilar addreſs was moved for, and, after great debates, a motion for an amendment to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs being made by lord Shelburne, the houſe divided, and the amendment was rejected, by a majority of 75 to 31. A ſhort proteſt againſt the addreſs was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the journals of the houſe ſigned by the duke of Richmond, the marquis of Rockingham, and earl Fitzwilliam, in which they declared, that they diffent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "for reaſons too often urged in vain for the laſt ſeven years againſt the ruinous proſecution of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt war carrying on by his majeſty's miniſters againſt the people of North America, and too fatally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by repeated experience, and the late diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful loſs of a ſecond army, to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>From the month of November till the month of Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary the houſe of commons were employed in war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> debates on the American war. During which time the minority were daily gaining ground, and the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry were giving up one point after another. They at firſt conſented that the war ſhould not be carried on to the ſame extent as formerly; then, that there ſhould be no internal continental war; next, that there ſhould be no other war than what was neceſſary for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the poſts already in their poſſeſſion; and, laſt of all, none but againſt the French in America.</p>
                     <p>As this war was made a parilamentary war, by an addreſe to the king in February, 1775, it was now no longer ſo, by an addreſs of the moſt numerous houſe, of the ſame parliament in February, 1782, for its diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. To this addreſs his majeſty anſwered, "that in purſuance of their advice, he would take ſuch meaſures as ſhould appear to him the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the reſtoration of harmony, between Great

This reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was carried without a diviſion, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to which it had reference cloſed the ſcene of the American war. A complete revolution in the cabinet was effected, March 27th, 1782, under the auſplces of the marquis of Rockingham, who was appointed firſt lord of the treaſury. On the deceaſe of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Rockingham, earl Shelburne was appointed his ſucceſſor. The firſt buſineſs of the new miniſtry, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of members oppoſed to the American war, was the taking meaſures for effectuating a general peace.</p>
                     <p>The great change in the public mind in Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain favourable to American independence took place between November, 1781, and March, 1782. In that interval Mr. Laurens was releaſed from his ſevere and tedious confinement in the Tower. Before and after his releaſe, he had frequent opportunities of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating to perſons in power, that every hope of peace without the acknowledgment of independence was illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fory. The conſtant triumphs of the miniſtry over ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery effort to oppoſe them, and their unremitting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance to carry on the war with America in deſpite of every remonſtrance at home and calamity abroad, had, until the above period, nearly annihilated all pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular clamours on the ſubject. It was conſidered as an evil which could not be remedied. But the defeat
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:028963_0372_0FDDC020B166AAE0"/>of lord Cornwallis, added to ſeven years experience, convinced the greateſt advocates for the American war, that the recognition of the independence of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, was an indiſpenſable preliminary to the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a war, from the continuance of which, neither profit nor honour was to be acquired.</p>
                     <p>On the 5th of May, 1782, fir Guy Carleton arrived at New York, being appointed to the command of the Britiſt, troops in America in the room of fir Henry Clinton. Two days after his arrival, he wrote a letter to General Waſhington, acquainting him, that admiral Digby was joined with himſelf in a commiſſion to treat of peace with the people of America; tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him, at the ſame time, ſome papers tending to manifeſt the pacific diſpoſition of the government and people of Britain towards thoſe of America. He alſo defired a paſſport for Mr. Morgan, who was appointed to tranſmit a ſimilar letter of compliment to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. General Waſhington declined ſigning any paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port till he had taken the opinion of congreſs upon that meaſure; and by them he was directed to refuſe any paſſport for ſuch a purpoſe. However, another letter was ſent to general Waſhington, dated the 2d of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, ſigned by ſir Guy Carl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They farther informed him, that his Britannic majeſty, in order to remove all obſtacles to that peace which he ſo ardently wiſhed to reſtore, had commanded his miniſters to direct Mr. Grenville, that the independency of the thirteen provinces ſhould be propoſed by him, in the firſt inſtance, inſtead of making it the condition of a general treaty. But ſome

                     <p>In the month of June, the town of Savannah and the whole province of Georgia were evacuated by the Britiſh troops, as was alſo Charleſton, South Carolina, about the cloſe of the year. In the mean time, the negociations for peace being continued, proviſional ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of peace were ſigned at Paris, on the 30th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, by the commiſſioner of his Britannic majeſty and the American commiſſioners, in which his majeſty acknowledged the united colonies of New Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts Bay, Rhode Iſland and Providence Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Connecticut, New York, New Jerſey, Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, South Carolina, and Georgia, to be "free, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and independent ſtates."

                     </argument>
                     <p>NO ſooner was peace reſtored by the definitive treaty, and the Britiſh troops withdrawn from the country, than the United States began to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the defects of their general government. Whilſt an enemy was in the country, fear, which had firſt impelled the colonies to aſſociate in mutual defence, continued to operate as a band of political union. It gave to the reſolutions and recommendations of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the force of laws, and generally commanded a ready acquieſcence on the part of the ſtate legiſlatures. Articles of confederation and perpetual union had been framed in congreſs, and ſubmitted to the conſideration of the ſtates, in the year 1778. Some of the ſtates immediately acceded to them; but others, which had not unappropriated lands, heſitated to ſubſcribe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:028963_0374_0FDDC02516C1E1C8"/>which would give an advantage to the ſtates which poſſeſſed large tracts of unlocated lands, and were thus capable of a great ſuperiority in wealth and population. All objections however had been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and by the acceſſion of Maryland in March, 1781, the articles of confederation were ratified, as the frame of government for the United States.</p>
                     <p>Theſe articles, however, were framed during the rage of war, when a principle of common ſafety ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the place of a coercive power in government; by men who could have had no experience in the art of governing an extenſive country, and under circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the moſt critical and embarraſſing. To have offered to the people, at that time, a ſyſtem of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment armed with the powers neceſſary to regulate and control the contending intereſts of thirteen ſtates, and the poſſeſſions of millions of people, might have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> a jealouſy between the ſtates or in the minds of the people at large, that would have weakened the operations of war, and perhaps have rendered a union impracticable. Hence the numerous defects of the confederation.</p>
                     <p>On the concluſion of peace, theſe defects began to be felt. Each ſtate aſſumed the right of diſputing the propriety of the reſolutions of congreſs, and the intereſt of an individual ſtate was placed in oppoſition to the common intereſt of the union. In addition to this ſource of diviſion, a jealouſy of the powers of congreſs began to be excited in the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This jealouſy of the privileges of fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>In this ſituation there were not wanting men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and talents, who had been enemies to the rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution,
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:028963_0374_0FDDC02516C1E1C8"/>and who embraced the opportunity to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the apprehenſions of the people and increaſe the popular diſcontents. As ſoon as the tumults of war had ſubſided, an attempt was made to convince the people, that the act of congreſs paſſed in 1778, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the officers of the army half pay for life, was highly unjuſt and tyrannical, and that it was but the firſt ſtep towards the eſtabliſhment of penſions and an uncontrollable deſpotiſm.

                        </gap> the apprehenſions of people, and to convince them that this gratuity was intended merely to indemnity the officers for their loſſes by the depreciation of the paper currency, and not to eſtabliſh a precede for the granting of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This act however did not ſatisfy the people, who ſuppoſed that the officers had been generally indemnified for the loſs of their pay, by the grants made them from time to time by the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates. Beſides, the act, whilſt it gave five years full pay to the officers, allowed but one year's pay to the privates, a diſtinction which had great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in exciting and continuing the popular fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and one that turned a large ſhare of the public rage againſt the officers themſelves.</p>
                     <p>During this ſituation of affairs, the public odium againſt the officers was augmented by another circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The officers, juſt before the diſbanding of the army, had formed a ſociety, called by the name of the <hi>Cincinnati,</hi> after the Roman Dictator, Cincinnatus. Whatever were the real views of the framers of this inſtitution, its deſign was generally underſtood to be harmleſs and honourable. The oſtenſible views of the ſociety could not however ſcreen it from popular jealouſy. The principles on which the ſociety was formed, would, it was ſaid, in proceſs of time, orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate
<pb n="402" facs="unknown:028963_0375_0FDDC0269CE00378"/>and eſtabliſh an order of nobility in this country, which would be repugnant to the genius of republican governments, and dangerous to liberty.</p>
                     <p>The oppoſition to the congreſſional acts in favour of the officers and to the order of the Cincinnati, did not riſe to the ſame pitch in the other ſtates as in Connecticut; yet it produced much diſturbance in Maſſachuſetts, and ſome others. Jealouſy of power had been univerſally ſpread among the people of the United States. The deſtruction of the old forms of governments, and the licentiouſneſs of war, had, in a great meaſure, broken their habits of obedience; their paſſions had been inflamed by the cry of deſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm; and like centinels, who had been ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by the approach of an enemy, the ruſtling of a leaf was ſufficient to give them an alarm. This ſpirit of jealouſy operated with other cauſes to relax the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy of federal operations.</p>
                     <p>When the danger of war had ceaſed, and the vaſt importations of foreign goods had leſſened the quantity of circulating ſpecie, the ſtates began to be very remiſs in ſurniſhing their proportion of monies. The anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation of the credit of the paper bills had totally ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their circulation, and the ſpecie was leaving the country in cargoes, for remittances to Great Britain; ſtill the luxurious habits of the people, contracted du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the war, called for new ſupplies of goods, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gratification ſeconded the narrow policy of ſtate intereſt in defeating the operations of the general government.</p>
                     <p>Thus the revenues of congreſs were annually dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing; ſome of the ſtates wholly neglecting to make proviſion for paying the intereſt of the national debt; others making but a partial proviſion, until the ſcanty ſupplies received from a few of the richeſt ſtates would hardly ſatisfy the demands of the civil liſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="403" facs="unknown:028963_0375_0FDDC0269CE00378"/>
This weakneſs of the federal government, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the flood of certificates or public ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, which congreſs could neither fund nor pay, occaſioned them to depreciate to a very inconſiderable value. The officers and ſoldiers of the late army, and thoſe who furniſhed ſupplies for public exigencies, were obliged to receive for wages theſe certificates, or promiſſary notes, which paſſed at a fifth, an eighth, or a tenth of their nominal value; being thus deprived at once of the greateſt part of the reward due for their ſervices. Some indeed profited by ſpeculations in theſe evidences of the public debt; but ſuch as were under a neceſſity of parting with them, were robbed of that ſupport which they had a right to expect and demand from their countrymen.</p>
                     <p>Pennſylvania indeed made proviſion for paying the intereſt of her debts, both ſtate and federal; aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſuppoſed proportion of the continental debt, and giving the creditors of her own ſtate notes in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for thoſe of the United States. The reſources of that ſtate are immenſe, but ſhe was not able to make punctual payments, even in a depreciated paper currency.</p>
                     <p>Maſſachuſetts, in her zeal to comply fully with the requiſitions of congreſs, and ſatisfy the demands of her own creditors, laid a heavy tax upon the people. This was the immediate cauſe of the rebellion in that ſtate, in 1786. But a heavy debt lying on the ſtate, added to burdens of the ſame nature, upon almoſt ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery corporation within it; a decline, or rather an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of public credit; a relaxation and corruption of manners, and a free uſe of foreign luxuries; a decay of trade and manufactures, with a prevailing ſcarcity of money; and, above all, individuals involved in debt to each other. Theſe were the real, though more remote cauſes of the inſurrection. It was the tax
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:028963_0376_0FDDC0671941D200"/>which the people were required to pay, that cauſed them to feel the evils which we have enumerated—this called forth all their other grievances; and the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of violence committed, was the burning or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the tax bill. This ſedition threw the ſtate into a convulſion which laſted about a year; courts of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice were violently obſtructed; the collection of debts was ſuſpended; and a body of armed troops, under the command of general Lincoln, was employed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the winter of 1786, to diſperſe the inſurgents. Yet ſo numerous were the latter in the counties of Worceſter, Hampſhire, and Berkſhire, and ſo obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly combined to oppoſe the execution of law by force, that the governour and council of the ſtate thought proper not to entruſt general Lincoln with military powers, except to act on the defenſive, and to repel force with force, in caſe the inſurgents ſhould attack him. The leaders of the rebels, however, were not men of talents; they were deſperate, but without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and while they were ſupported with a ſuperior force, they appeared to be impreſſed with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of guilt, which awes the moſt daring wretch, and makes him ſhrink from his purpoſe. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the conduct of a large party of the rebels before the magazine at Springfield, where general Shepard, with a ſmall guard, was ſtationed to protect the continental ſtores. The inſurgents appeared upon the plain, with a vaſt ſuperiority of numbers, but a few ſhot from the artillery made the multitude retreat in diſorder, with the loſs of four men. This ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conduct of general Shepard, with the induſtry, perſeverance and prudent ſirmneſs of general Lincoln, diſperſed the rebels, drove the leaders from the ſtate, and reſtored tranquillity. An act of indemnity wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="405" facs="unknown:028963_0376_0FDDC0671941D200"/>peaceable ſubjects and take the oath of allegiance. The leaders afterwards petitioned for pardon, which, from motives of policy, was granted by the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as hoſtilities between Great Britain and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica were ſuſpended, the ſpecie of the country was drained off to pay for foreign goods, the importations of which exceeded all calculation. Within two years from the cloſe of the war, <hi>a ſcarcity of money</hi> was the general cry. The merchants found it impoſſible to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their debts, and make punctual remittances to their creditors in Great Britain; and the conſumers were driven to the neceſſity of retrenching their ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in living, and of returning to their ancient habits of induſtry and economy.</p>
                     <p>This change was however progreſſive and ſlow. In many of the ſtates which ſuffered by the numerous debts they had contracted, and by the diſtreſſes of war, the people called aloud for emiſſions of paper bills to ſupply the deficiency of a medium. The depreciation of the continental bills, was a recent example of the ill effects of ſuch an expedient, and the impoſſibility of ſupporting the credit of paper, was urged by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the meaſure as a ſubſtantial argument againſt adopting it. But nothing would ſilence the popular clamour; and many men of the firſt talents and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence united their voices with that of the populace. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money had formerly maintained its credit, and been of ſingular utility; and paſt experience, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a change of circumſtances, was an argument in its favour that bore down oppoſition in ſeveral of the ſtates.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the ſtates were thus endeavouring to repair the loſs of ſpecie, by empty promiſes, and to ſupport their buſineſs by ſhadows rather than by reality, the Britiſh miniſtry formed ſome commercial regulations
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:028963_0377_0FDD5F484BBB4BC0"/>that deprived them of the profits of their trade to the Weſt-Indies and Great Britain. Heavy duties were laid upon ſuch articles as were remitted to the London merchants for their goods; and ſuch were the duties upon American bottoms, that the ſtates were almoſt wholly deprived of the carrying trade. A prohibition was laid upon the produce of the United States, ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to the Britiſh Weſt India Iſlands in American built veſſels, and in thoſe manned by American ſeamen. Theſe reſtrictions fell heavy upon the eaſtern ſtates, which depended much upon ſhip building for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their trade; and they materially injured the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the other ſtates.</p>
                     <p>Without a union that was able to form and execute a general ſyſtem of commercial regulations, ſome of the ſtates attempted to impoſe reſtraints upon the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh trade that ſhould indemnify the merchant for the loſſes he had ſuffered, or induce the Britiſh miniſtry to enter into a commercial treaty and relax the rigour of their navigation laws. Theſe meaſures however pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced nothing but miſchief. The ſtates did not act in concert, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſtraints laid on the trade of one ſtate operated to throw the buſineſs into the hands of its neighbour. Maſſachuſetts, in her zeal to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the effect of the Engliſh navigation laws, laid enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous duties upon Britiſh goods imported into that ſtate; but the other ſtates did not adopt a ſimilar meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure; and the loſs of buſineſs ſoon obliged that ſtate to repeal or ſuſpend the law. Thus when Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia laid heavy duties on Britiſh goods, Delaware and New Jerſey made a number of free ports to encourage the landing of goods within the limits of thoſe ſtates; and the duties in Pennſylvania ſerved no purpoſe, but to create ſmuggling.</p>
                     <p>Thus divided, the ſtates began to feel their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Moſt of the legiſlatures had neglected to comply
<pb n="407" facs="unknown:028963_0377_0FDD5F484BBB4BC0"/>with the requiſitions of congreſs for furniſhing the fed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral treaſury; the reſolves of congreſs were diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the propoſition for a general impoſt to be laid and collected by congreſs was negatived firſt by Rhode Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, and afterwards by New York. The Britiſh troops continued, under pretence of a breach of treaty on the part of America, to hold poſſeſſion of the forts on the frontiers of the ſtates. Many of the ſtates individually were infeſted with popular commotions or iniquitous tender laws, whilſt the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> were oppreſſed with public debts: The certificates or public notes had loſt moſt of their value, and circulated merely as the objects of ſpeculation: Congreſs loſt their reſpectability, and the United States their credit and importance.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of theſe calamities, a propoſition was made in 1785, in the houſe of delegates in Virginia, to appoint commiſſioners, to meet ſuch as might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the other ſtates, who ſhould form a ſyſtem of commercial regulations for the United States, and recommend it to the ſeveral legiſlatures for adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, ſeveral of the ſtates appointed commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners who met at Annapolis in the ſummer of 1786, to conſult what meaſures ſhould be taken to unite the ſtates in ſome general and efficient commercial ſyſtem. But as the ſtates were not all repreſented, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the commiſſioners were, in their opinion, too limited to propoſe a ſyſtem of regulations adequate to the purpoſes of government, they agreed to recommend a general convention to be held at Philadelphia the next year, with powers to frame a general plan of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment for the United States. This meaſure appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the commiſſioners abſolutely neceſſary. The old confederation was eſſentially defective. It was deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of almoſt every principle neceſſary to give effect

It was alſo deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a ſanction to its laws. When reſolutions were paſſed in congreſs, there was no power to compel obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by fine, by ſuſpenſion of privileges, or other means. It was alſo deſtitute of a guarantee for the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Had one ſtate been invaded by its neighbour, the union was not conſtitutionally bound to aſſiſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the invaſion, and ſupporting the conſtitution of the invaded ſtate. The confederation was farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in the principle of apportioning the quotas of money to be furniſhed by each ſtate; in a want of power to form commercial laws, and to raiſe troops for the defence and ſecurity of the union; in the equal ſuffrage of the ſtates, which placed Rhode Iſland on a footing in congreſs with Virginia; and, to crown all the defects, the want of a judiciary power, to define the laws of the Union, and to reconcile the contradictory deciſions of a number of independent judicatories.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and many inferior defects were obvious to the commiſſioners, and therefore they urged a general convention, with powers to form and offer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſtates, a ſyſtem of general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhould be leſs exceptionable. Accordingly in May, 1787, delegates from all the ſtates, except Rhode Iſland, aſſembled at Philadelphia, and choſe general Waſhington for their preſident. After four months deliberation, in which the claſhing intereſts of the ſeveral ſtates appeared in all their force, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention agreed to recommend the plan of federal gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
                     <p>From the moment the proceedings of the general convention at Philadelphia tranſpired, the public mind was exceedingly agitated, and ſuſpended between hope and fear, until nine ſtates had ratified their plan of a fed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral

                     <p>On the ratification in Maſſachuſetts, the citizens of Boſton, in the elevation of their joy, formed a proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in honour of the happy event, which was novel, ſplendid, and magnificent. This example was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards followed, and in ſome inſtances improved upon, in Baltimore, Charleſton, Philadelphia, New Haven, Portſmouth and New York, ſucceſſively. Nothing could equal the beauty and grandeur of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions. A ſhip was mounted upon wheels, and drawn through the ſtreets; mechanics erected ſtages, and exhibited ſpecimens of labour in their ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, as they moved along the road; flags, with emblems deſcriptive of all the arts and of the Federal Union, were invented and diſplayed in honour of the government. Multitudes of all ranks in life aſſembled to view the ſplendid ſcenes; whilſt ſobriety, joy and harmony marked the brilliant exhibitions, by which
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:028963_0379_0FDDC0307A088970"/>the Americans celebrated the eſtabliſhment of their empire.</p>
                     <p>On the 3d of March, 1789, the delegates from the eleven ſtates, which at that time had ratified the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, aſſembled at New York, where a convenient and elegant building had been prepared for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. On opening and counting the votes for preſident, it was found that GEORGE WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON was <hi>unanimouſly</hi> elected to that dignified office, and that JOHN ADAMS was choſen vice preſident. The annunciation of the choice of the firſt and ſecond magiſtrates of the United States, occaſioned a general diffuſion of joy among the friends to the Union, and fully evinced that theſe eminent characters were the choice of the people.</p>
                     <p>On the 30th of April, 1789, GEORGE WASHINGTON was inaugurated PRESIDENT of the United States of America, in the city of New York. The ceremony was performed in the open gallery of Federal Hall, in the view of many thouſand ſpectators. The oath was adminiſtered by chancellor Livingſton. Several circumſtances concurred to render the ſcene unuſually ſolemn—the preſence of the beloved FATHER and DELIVERER of his country—the impreſſions of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for his paſt ſervices—the vaſt concourſe of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators—the devout fervency with which he repeated the oath, and the reverential manner in which he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to kiſs the ſacred volume—Theſe circumſtances, together with that of his being choſen to the moſt dignified office in America, and perhaps in the world, by the unanimous voice of more than three millions of enlightened freemen,—all conſpired to place this among the moſt auguſt and intereſting ſcenes which have ever been exhibited on this globe.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the deliberations of the legiſlature of the Union have been marked with wiſdom, and the meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures
<pb n="411" facs="unknown:028963_0379_0FDDC0307A088970"/>they have adopted have been productive of great national proſperity.
