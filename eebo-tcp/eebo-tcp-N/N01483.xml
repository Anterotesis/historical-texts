            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Sure I am, If after the Setting up of <hi>Popery in the Plantations,</hi> had been Engaged unto him, when we had a <hi>Popiſh King</hi> upon the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001763_0004_0FB7CD8CE2948230"/>Throne, (as has been ſince diſcovered,) a moſt Seaſonable Revolution had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is taking Poſſeſſion of this Country, we had found him a <hi>Leviathan.</hi> The Jawes of the fierceſt <hi>Crocodile</hi> would have been full of <hi>Tender Mercies,</hi> in Compariſon of his Mercileſs <hi>Cruelties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Entertainment</hi> for the <hi>People Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Wilderneſs,</hi> is to be Conſidered on this Occaſion. Our God provides an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment</hi> for us. And what can more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably, or more deliciouſly <hi>Entertain</hi> us, than a View of the Wonderful <hi>Shakes,</hi> which the Great God is upon giving to the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> yea, to <hi>all Nations,</hi> upon ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation!</p>
            <p>Our Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> under the Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, animated a diſcouraged and a dilatory People, to go on with rebuilding the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> To this Purpoſe, a <hi>Greater Glory</hi> is promiſed for the Second, than had been Enjoy'd by the Former Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A <hi>Greater Glory!</hi> Not in regard of a Pompous and Splendid Appearance. Nor do I take the Story that <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives us,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001763_0005_0FB7CD8F07DD2730"/>of what was done by <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, for to be much better than a <hi>Romance,</hi> of Incredible &amp; Ill-deſigned Exaggerations. But the <hi>Greater Glory,</hi> was to be in the Coming of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> thither; in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Preaching of the <hi>Son of God Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> there.</p>
            <p>Concerning this <hi>Coming</hi> of our Saviour, we have here Two Things remarked.</p>
            <p>Firſt; It was to be <hi>in a little while.</hi> T'was indeed Five hundred Years off. But then, three thouſand and five hundred Years had paſſed ſince the Firſt Promiſe of it. What remained, was but <hi>a little while,</hi> to what had already paſſed. It is but <hi>a little while</hi> unto Him, with whom a <hi>Thouſand Years</hi> is but as <hi>One Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>All Nations</hi> were to be <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> to prepare them for ſuch a Bleſſing. The Fulfilment of the Promiſe was to be brought on with very <hi>Shaking</hi> Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The <hi>Shake upon all Nations,</hi> is here Metaphorically deſcribed, and perhaps alſo diſtinguiſhed, by a <hi>Shake</hi> upon the <hi>Heavens,</hi> or the Upper World; and upon the <hi>Earth;</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001763_0006_0FB7CD90AD426530"/>both the <hi>Sea</hi> and the <hi>Dry Land,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto the <hi>Earth;</hi> or the Lower World.</p>
            <p>This is what we are now to pay Regard unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are Times, wherein the Glorious Lord of Heaven and Earth, will Shake the Nations of the World; yea, Shake both Heaven and Earth in the diſturbed Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Text</hi> ſhall be a little more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Explained, before my <hi>Doctrine</hi> be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>A King of <hi>Perſia</hi> comes out againſt the <hi>Greeians,</hi> with the biggeſt Army that ever was heard of: But beſides his <hi>Army</hi> at Land, his <hi>Navy</hi> at Sea, was horribly defeated. So did the <hi>Lord ſhake the Earth &amp; the Sea!</hi> After this, <hi>Alexander</hi> the King of <hi>Greein,</hi> does annoy and deſtroy the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and by his Victorious Arms, he made all <hi>the Nations to Shake.</hi> The Succeſſors of that Emperour, dividing the Empire, fell out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves; Eſpecially the Kings of the <hi>North</hi> and of the <hi>South;</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> that is, and of <hi>Egypt;</hi> who made the <hi>Nations to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001763_0007_0FB7CD938975C4A8"/>Shake ſtill</hi> by their Bloody Wars. After this, the <hi>Romans</hi> Invaded and Conquered <hi>Grecia:</hi> And at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ngth <hi>Civil Wars</hi> fell out among the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves; in which Wars there were ſome terrible <hi>Sea-fights.</hi> Thus the Lord made the <hi>Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>all Nations</hi> to <hi>Shake.</hi> Finally, the <hi>Romans</hi> brought a Deſolation upon the whole Jewiſh State, both Civil and Sacred; wherein the Lord <hi>Shook,</hi> not the <hi>Earth</hi> only, but the <hi>Heavens</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Our Firſt Enquiry now ſhall be,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HOW 'tis</hi> that our Glorious LORD, will <hi>Shake the Nations,</hi> yea, <hi>Shake both Heaven &amp; Earth</hi> about them?</p>
            <p>Firſt. There are Times wherein <hi>Shakes</hi> are given to the <hi>Corporeal World; Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> Literally taken, are wonderfully <hi>Shaken,</hi> and unto the Terror of the Nations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>God that formed all things,</hi> has put all Things into an incomparable <hi>Order.</hi> But ſometimes the World may be put ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of the <hi>Order</hi> wherein tis ordinarily carried on. When the <hi>courſe</hi> of the World is altered, by any <hi>Extraordinary</hi> work or
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001763_0008_0FB7CD95097C15D8"/>change upon it, then does the Great God give a <hi>Shake</hi> unto it.</p>
            <p>Can <hi>Heaven</hi> be <hi>ſhaken?</hi> Yes. Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Thunderings</hi> and <hi>Lightnings</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> are ſome <hi>ſhaking</hi> of Heaven. Thus the Lord <hi>ſhook Heaven,</hi> at the giving of the Law, when the <hi>Thunders</hi> &amp; <hi>Lightenings</hi> were ſuch as to make <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf cry out, <hi>I exceedingly fear &amp; quake.</hi> Of this we read; Pſal. LXVIII. 8. <hi>The earth ſhook, the heavens alſo dropped at the preſence of the Lord.</hi> And ſo, when the <hi>Stars in their Courſes fight</hi> againſt the Enemies of God, by raiſing any Deſtructive Tempeſt upon them; <hi>Heaven</hi> is then <hi>ſhaken</hi> in it and for it. There is alſo a <hi>ſhaking</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> when any real Prodigies do there ſhow themſelves: for ſo we may ſuppoſe there ſometimes do, without our falling into the whimſies of a fanciful and credulous <hi>Livy</hi> about them. The Learned Man, who wrote againſt the Regard of all ſuch Things, afterwards owned unto one to whom I have the Honour to be related, <hi>That he had overdone.</hi> Thoſe Things that are called, <hi>Fearful ſights and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001763_0009_0FB7CD969CE6ED00"/>great ſigns from Heaven;</hi> There is a <hi>ſhaking</hi> of Heaven in them. We read, Mat. XXIV. 29. <hi>Stars ſhall fall from Heaven, &amp; the Powers of the Heavens ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> When <hi>Blazing Stars,</hi> do in their Elliptic Motions make their Deſcents towards us, &amp; threaten a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Bruſh unto us, then do <hi>Stars fall from Heaven.</hi> But then, moſt properly, then moſt awfully, are the <hi>Powers of the Heavens ſhaken;</hi> when the Angels of the <hi>Heavens</hi> are put upon doing unuſual Things among us. The <hi>Heavenly Powers</hi> may go ſo far out of the common Road, as to break in upon us, and <hi>Viſibly,</hi> or <hi>Audibly,</hi> and <hi>Senſibly</hi> do Strange Things among the Children of Men; There is a wonderful <hi>ſhaking</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in ſuch Things. It <hi>ſhakes Heaven,</hi> when the <hi>Angels</hi> do come out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, or with Operations, whereat Fleſh and Blood falls into a conſternation. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> is then <hi>ſhaken;</hi> when the <hi>Heavenly Hoſt</hi> is upon ſuch <hi>Motions</hi> as cauſe juſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement; and perhaps the <hi>Tongues of Men</hi> become the <hi>Tongues of Angels.</hi> — It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me to ſtop here; and Step into <hi>Lower Regions.</hi>

The <hi>Earth</hi> is to be <hi>Shaken</hi> too. 'Tis very particularly ſo, when what we call an <hi>Earth quake</hi> happens. Our Lord <hi>ſhakes the Earth,</hi> when He cauſes the <hi>Upper layes</hi> thereof to <hi>Quake,</hi> by the Subterraneous Fires getting Head beneath 'em. In an <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi> there comes to paſs that, whereof we read; Job IX. 6 <hi>He ſhakes the earth out of her place, &amp; the pillars thereof do tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus again the Lord <hi>ſhook the Earth</hi> at the Giving of the Law; when the <hi>whole Mountain Quaked greatly.</hi> The Songs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People of God many Ages after, celebrated that <hi>Earth-quake;</hi> They Sang, <hi>O God, The Earth trembled &amp; ſhook.</hi> Of all the Plagues inflicted by God upon a Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted World, that of an <hi>Earth-quake</hi> is the moſt formidable. It may ſeem admirable, that it is not Enumerated among the <hi>Plagues</hi> in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> Some think, 'Tis becauſe the Lord has more peculiarly reſerved this <hi>tranſcendent Judgment</hi> for the Times and the Crimes under the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And yet in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> alſo we find it Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified. Very ſingularly notable was that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001763_0011_0FB7CD9B9FB8D1B0"/>whereof the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> [I ſay, the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> becauſe I take the Six laſt Chapters of what we have in the Book of <hi>Zechariahs</hi> Prophecies, to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Jeremiahs:</hi>] takes notice, in Zech. XIV. 5. <hi>Ye fled from before the Earth-quake, in the Dayes of Uzziah, King of Judah.</hi> The Jewiſh Hiſtorian relates, That this roaring <hi>Earth quake</hi> tore down an High Hill, which rolling for diverſe furlongs did no little Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Kings Palace and Garden, and the roof of the Temple Split open ſo that the Sun ſhone into it. Be ſure; The <hi>Earth-quakes</hi> which accompanied the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> and the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Bleſſed JESUS, deſerve an Eternal Commemoration: The Modern Travellers, who are far from Fancies and Whimſies, and at the ſame time of the moſt unſpotted Veracity, do on the <hi>Split Rocks</hi> thereabouts at this very day, find a very probable Commemoration of it. 'Tis notorious, That the <hi>Sea,</hi> as well as the <hi>Dry Land,</hi> bears a Part when an <hi>Earth-quake</hi> is in its Agitations. A <hi>Troubled Sea</hi> is then perceived at a diſtance from the Shore; and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001763_0012_0FB7CDA04C7A07E0"/>near the Shore the <hi>Sea</hi> ſo retires, that the Channels <hi>of the waters are ſeen,</hi> and what no Eye ever ſaw before, is <hi>diſcovered.</hi> When God <hi>ſhakes the Sea &amp; the dry Land,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> withdrawes, and the <hi>Dry Land,</hi> which it once covered, is for a while Expoſed. Every body knows theſe Things, I ſhall ſay no more about them.</p>
            <p>Secondly. The <hi>Political World;</hi> there are Times wherein <hi>Shakes</hi> are given to <hi>That</hi> alſo; The terrified <hi>Nations</hi> feel <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> if you take them Figuratively, moſt wonderfully <hi>Shaking</hi> about them. God <hi>ſhakes all Nations;</hi> and He <hi>ſhakes Heaven and Earth</hi> in doing ſo. According to the Language of the Orient, by <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> are meant <hi>Superiors</hi> and <hi>Inferiors</hi> among the People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Shaking</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> What is this? Truly, Any Great Alteration in a <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> may be counted ſo. <hi>Kings</hi> are called <hi>Suns. Rulers</hi> under them are called <hi>Stars.</hi> When Suns or Stars are Extinguiſhed, and put out and pull'd down, and laid in the Duſt; when God <hi>Covers the Sun with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001763_0013_0FB7CDA4C69E07E0"/>Blackneſs, &amp; makes the Stars dark, &amp; brings darkneſs upon the Land,</hi> as it was denounced of old unto the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> Surely, <hi>Heaven</hi> cannot but be <hi>ſhaken</hi> in it. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when ſuch ſurprizing <hi>Mutations</hi> fall out, that Men who are the moſt Faithful <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of our Saviour, ſhall <hi>hear a great Voice from Heaven, Come up hither;</hi> and ſhall put off their <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> and be advanced into Authority, and have power over the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> the <hi>Heaven</hi> of thoſe <hi>Nations</hi> muſt be ſhaken with a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> in thoſe Works of God. Aſtoniſhing <hi>Mutations</hi> came upon the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> when a <hi>New Set</hi> of Men, and a <hi>Good Set,</hi> had the management of it thrown into their Hands; And it is thus painted out; Rev. VI. 12, 13. <hi>Lo, There was a Great Earth-<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the Earth, and the Heaven departed as a ſcroll, when it is rolled together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Church-State</hi> of any <hi>Nations,</hi> or People, is peculiarly the <hi>Heaven</hi> of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A Settling of <hi>Churches</hi> is called, a Planting of <hi>Heavens.</hi> The <hi>Paſtors</hi> of Churches are called, The <hi>Stars</hi> of them.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001763_0014_0FB7CDAC99CA2C40"/>When Faithful Miniſters are ſilenced, it is expreſſed ſo; Dan. VIII. 10. <hi>A caſting down of the Stars from the Hoſt of Heaven, and a ſtamping on them.</hi> The <hi>Changing</hi> of a <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> is a <hi>ſhaking</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> When the <hi>Religion</hi> of a People is aſſaulted, their <hi>Heaven</hi> is then <hi>ſhaken:</hi> And if it be the <hi>Religion of God,</hi> in that <hi>ſhaking</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> there are <hi>Dragons</hi> who try with their Stings, to annoy the <hi>Stars of Heaven.</hi> Or, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it a <hi>Falſe Religion;</hi> The Abolition of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> has always been with a Mighty <hi>ſhake of Heaven,</hi> in the Country, where the <hi>Falſe Religion</hi> has been aboliſhed. Verily, To diſſolve a <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> and bring a New Face upon a <hi>Church by Law Eſtabliſhed,</hi> or to lay aſide Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Conſequence to a <hi>Church-ſtate;</hi> This is to <hi>ſhake Heaven</hi> over the Heads of the People concerned in it. The <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is Eminently the <hi>Firmament of Heaven</hi> ſpread over the Church of God. Where the <hi>Goſpel</hi> comes to be brought in, and ſet up, and ſpread out, as the Rule of all Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations in the <hi>Church;</hi> Tis done with a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001763_0015_0FB7CDAF9180A6E0"/>
               <hi>ſhaking of Heaven</hi> over the Heads of the People there.</p>
            <p>And may not the <hi>Earth</hi> be <hi>ſhaken</hi> too! It may be ſo. Then is the <hi>Earth ſhaken,</hi> when there are <hi>great Stirs</hi> among the Common People. Sore Diſtreſſes among a People have this Deſcription given of them; Iſa. XXIV. 19, 20. <hi>The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean diſſolved, the earth is moved exceedingly; The earth reels to &amp; fro like a Drunkard, &amp; is removed like a Cottage.</hi> Tumults, &amp; Ferments and Uproars among a People, are a Shaking of the Earth, as well as the <hi>Roaring of the Sea,</hi> in the Prophetic Schemes of ſpeaking. We Read of ſuch Things as thoſe; Luk. XXI. 25. <hi>Upon the earth diſtreſs of Nations, with perplexity, the Sea and the Waves roaring.</hi> Sometimes, there are violent <hi>Commotions</hi> among the People. There are Tendencies to quite <hi>another Condition</hi> of Things; It may be ſaid, <hi>The Nations are Angry;</hi> The Factions, the Claſhes, the Clamours, are full of Menaces. Now the <hi>Waters roar and are troubled, &amp; the Mountains do ſhake</hi> (the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001763_0016_0FB7CDB0D62B3F48"/>Great Miniſters are frighted) <hi>with the ſwelling thereof.</hi> So does God <hi>ſhake the Earth;</hi> and the <hi>Sea,</hi> as well as the <hi>Dry Land,</hi> has a deep ſhare in the Convulſions upon the <hi>Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>Deaths</hi> and <hi>Wars</hi> are Two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable Strokes, whereby the Great God gives very conſiderable <hi>Shakes</hi> unto the Nations.</p>
            <p>The Deaths of <hi>Chief Men</hi> give a Shake to the State which thoſe Great Men Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. The Fall of <hi>Pillars</hi> makes the Houſe to <hi>ſhake,</hi> at the Supports leaving of it. And no <hi>Pillars</hi> do ſtand ſo firm, that the Mighty One, before whom every <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> is leſs than a <hi>Moth,</hi> cannot throw them down. The World Shakes, when He throws them down. When a King died, and it was cryed out, <hi>How is the Mighty fallen?</hi> It was then ſaid, Pſal. LX. 2. <hi>Thou haft made the Earth to tremble.</hi> Sometimes <hi>One Life</hi> has upon it, Inexpreſſible Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies! The frail Thread of <hi>One Life,</hi> the Affairs of whole <hi>Nations,</hi> depend upon it. The Prince Dies; <hi>His Breath goes forth;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001763_0017_0FB7CDB25D888430"/>he returns to his Earth; In that very day his thoughts periſh:</hi> And in that very Day, what a Shake is given to many <hi>Nations!</hi> — O Memorable Month of ANGUST, How marvellous thy Demonſtrations of it! How marvellous thy Demonſtrations of it!</p>
            <p>But, if <hi>Wars</hi> ariſe, — then the <hi>Nations</hi> are yet more dreadfully Shaken, and in the Shaking they are daſhed One againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It <hi>ſhakes</hi> the World, when Things are at that ſad paſs: Mat. XXIV. 6, 7. <hi>Ye ſhall hear of Wars, &amp; Rumours of Wars, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall riſe againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom.</hi> It is very ſuitably added, <hi>There ſhall be Earthquakes in divers places.</hi> Eſpecially, If <hi>Civil Wars</hi> ariſe among a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and God ſets <hi>Aegyptians</hi> againſt <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and they <hi>fight every one againſt his Brother and againſt his Neighbour,</hi> ſuch a People is horribly <hi>ſhaken</hi> in their Diviſions. It is foretold; Hag. II. 21, 22. <hi>I will ſhake the Heavens and the Earth; and I will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Throne of Kingdoms, and they ſhall come down every one by the Sword of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> When there were diverſe Competitors
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001763_0018_0FB7CDB3E11DD820"/>for the Crown of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we read; <hi>The Earth trembled.</hi> Such Competitions bring on Shakes, the Iſſues whereof are ſuch as no Man alive could have imagined. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all <hi>Wars</hi> are a <hi>Shaking</hi> and <hi>Sifting</hi> ſort of Things, unto the Nations that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in them. <hi>Nations</hi> are Shaken, when <hi>Swards</hi> are Furbiſhed, when <hi>Swards</hi> are Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhed; They are a <hi>Troubled Sea,</hi> when there is <hi>no Peace</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. The <hi>Angels</hi> of our Glorious LORD, even His <hi>Mighty Angels,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, tho' inviſible Inſtruments, in the Mighty <hi>Shakes</hi> which He gives unto the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Shakes that are given to the World, are ſo many Turns, given to the <hi>Wheels,</hi> that carry on what is a doing in the World. We are haſtening to a <hi>Kingdom that cannot be moved;</hi> But as yet we are in a World, in all Parts whereof, [all the <hi>Four</hi> Parts!] The <hi>Wheels</hi> are <hi>moving</hi> and <hi>ſhaking</hi> perpetually. And we find; Ezek. X. 9. <hi>The Wheels are by the Cherubims.</hi> One ſays well, <hi>The Angels are capacious Wheels, that move in the great Clock of the World.</hi> The <hi>Wheels</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:001763_0019_0FB7CDB550992158"/>of Providence, that Shake the World, and Change it Marvellouſly are very much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi> whom God hath made <hi>Miniſtring Spirits,</hi> to wait about the Throne of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. When a Great King, the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vager on the Liberties of the World, was Dethroned, it gave a <hi>Great Shake</hi> unto the World. But how was it brought about? We read; Dan. IV. 23. <hi>A Watcher, and an Holy One, comes down from Heaven, and ſayes, Hew the Tree down, and deſtroy it.</hi> Was it not the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> that help'd <hi>Alexander</hi> in Shaking the World, until it was turn'd upſide down! I am ſure, he ſaid, <hi>He would,</hi> no leſs than Two Hundred Years before it was done. The Deſcent of Angels, uſes to make all <hi>Tremble</hi> where they come. The <hi>Trembling</hi> of the World is very much owing to this; The Angels Deſcend; and they Shake Nations, and Shake Kingdoms, and Shake Empires, and ſet all a-ſhaking before the Lord.</p>
            <p>It is by a <hi>Secret Work</hi> of the Glorious LORD on the <hi>Spirits</hi> of Men, that <hi>ſhakes</hi> are
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001763_0020_0FB7CDB6CD7FB810"/>given, and wondrous Turns brought upon the World. Our LORD ſecretly diſpoſes the <hi>Spirits</hi> of Men, to puſh on Amazing Changes in the Nations. Nations are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrangely <hi>Spirited,</hi> ſometimes one way, ſometimes another. The <hi>Spirit of a Nation</hi> is an Irreſiſtible Thing. It will <hi>ſhake</hi> down <hi>Thrones,</hi> that ſeem to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Rocks.</hi> It will <hi>ſhake</hi> a Nation out of a <hi>Slavery,</hi> as well as into it. It will ſhake <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> into a Nation or out of it. It will bring back abdicated <hi>Superſtitions,</hi> or it will drive them out again. When the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſhall be ſet that way, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Eſtabliſhment that ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall bring me down to the Ground?</hi> Shall ſee <hi>Obadiahs</hi> Prophecies Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled upon it. But now the ANGELS of the Glorious LORD; theſe have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Inſtrumentality, in Raiſing or in Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Spirits</hi> of Nations. In ſuch Things, <hi>The Heavens do Rule;</hi> that is to ſay, The <hi>Angels</hi> of the Heavenly World. <hi>O Bleſs the Lord, ye his Angels, for the uſe he makes of you, in his Kingdom which Ruleth over all!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Next Enquiry muſt be,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001763_0021_0FB7CDBA865CD478"/>to the <hi>Nations.</hi> By their <hi>Prayers,</hi> they do, as it were, Jog that Almighty Arm, that ſets all a-ſhaking. As we read, Act. IV. 31. <hi>When they had Prayed, the place was ſhaken:</hi> So when the People of God in a Place, have been a Praying, it falls to Shaking thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <hi>That thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain.</hi> There are ſome <hi>Excellent Things,</hi> which <hi>cannot be ſhaken,</hi> but the more they are Studied, and the Wiſer and the Better they are who Study them, the more they will be approved of. And what are thoſe <hi>Excellent Things?</hi> They are, The MAXIMS of the EVERLASTING GOSPEL.</p>
            <p>There are certain MAXIMS directly calculated for the Grand Intentions of, <hi>Glory to God in the Higheſt,</hi> and, <hi>Peace on Earth from Good-will among men.</hi> Thoſe MAXIMS,— to dig them out from that <hi>Mountain of God,</hi> our Sacred Scriptures, and run the Oar into <hi>Wedges of Gold;</hi> a more comprehenſive Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the <hi>Church,</hi> and the whole <hi>World,</hi> cannot at this Day be thought upon. They, and thoſe that adhere to them, ſhall one Day, become a <hi>Great Mountain,</hi> which the <hi>whole Earth</hi> ſhall be fill'd withal.</p>
            <p>MAXIMS there are, wherein all the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God</hi> are <hi>United,</hi> whatever <hi>Different Perſwaſions</hi> in other matters may alienate them from One another. MAXIMS they are, wherein all that are Cordially <hi>United,</hi>

A <hi>Church</hi> built upon any other <hi>Foundation</hi> than theſe undoubted <hi>Sayings</hi> of our Saviour, is not <hi>well-founded;</hi> No, It ſhall firſt or laſt, be wonderfully <hi>Shaken,</hi> and <hi>Great will be the fall thereof!</hi> GOD will one day bring His People to Embrace One ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon theſe Generous MAXIMS; and to keep the <hi>Leſſer Points</hi> in a due <hi>Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to them; and manage their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy on the <hi>Leſſer Points</hi> with <hi>another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> than what has been too frequent among the Diſputers of this World.

               </p>
               <p>I need not call upon you to look for <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001763_0028_0FB7CDCC070B2190"/>Times:</hi> We ſee them, we feel them, we are in the midſt of them; we ſhall ſhortly be more than ever ſo. The <hi>Things that cannot be ſhaken,</hi> but muſt be introduced, cannot be otherwiſe introduced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Earthquakes</hi> without a Metaphor will be Multiplied; More horrid than any of the paſt <hi>Sicilian</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> ones. Even <hi>Geneva</hi> too has been very lately approached with them, and a whole Village newly Swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. Ominous Things they'l be! <hi>State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> will become yet more Univerſal.</p>
               <p>When our Lord was Leading forth His People from their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Captivities and Idolatries, there ſeems to have been an <hi>Earthquake</hi> aſſiſting their Paſſage tho' the Divided Waters. We read, Pſal. LXXVII. 18, 19. As if the <hi>Earth trembled &amp; ſhook,</hi> when the <hi>Way</hi> of God <hi>was in the Sea,</hi> and <hi>His Path in the great Waters.</hi> My Friends, Our Lord will certainly and ſpeedily lead forth His People, from the midſt of their worſe than <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Entanglements. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, that I tell you; I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, we are now at laſt entring into
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001763_0029_0FB7CDD15936A2B8"/>an <hi>Earth quake</hi> that will give Aſſiſtance unto it.</p>
               <p>This I am certain of, we are bidden to look for ſuch a Thing as that; Rev. XVI. 18. <hi>A great Earthquake, ſuch as has not been ſince men were upon the earth, ſo mighty an Earthquake, and ſo great an one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but the Enquiry muſt be made; In <hi>ſuch Times,</hi> how are we to behave our ſelves?</p>
               <p>Firſt. Let us make ſure of having the Great GOD our Saviour, even our Lord JESUS CHRIST, for our <hi>Friend;</hi> under every <hi>Shaking</hi> His <hi>Friendſhip</hi> will be our <hi>Safety.</hi> In <hi>Shaking</hi> Times, <hi>Luther</hi> would ſay, <hi>Let us go Sing the Forty-ſixth Pſalm.</hi> If we are in the Favour of our Saviour, we may Sing that Pſalm, Oh! How Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, Oh! How Triumphantly! What tho' the <hi>Earth be removed?</hi> We have the Lord of <hi>Heaven</hi> for our <hi>Friend,</hi> and we have <hi>Heaven</hi> to retreat unto. What tho' the <hi>Mountains fall?</hi> We have Him for our <hi>Friend,</hi> unto whom the Biggeſt <hi>Mountains</hi> are no more than the ſmalleſt <hi>Atoms;</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001763_0030_0FB7CDD3B5738090"/>we ſhall our ſelves be like Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> that <hi>cannot be moved.</hi> What tho' the <hi>Sea</hi> roar, and ſwell, and riſe, till it ſtrike the very welkin? The <hi>Lord on High, is Mightier than the Noiſe of many Waters, than the Mighty waves of the Sea,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST is the <hi>Rock of Ages.</hi> There is no <hi>Shaking</hi> of that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Rock.</hi> Oh! Run to the <hi>Rock:</hi> Fly to the <hi>Rock!</hi> Become United unto our Saviour with a Lively <hi>Faith</hi> in him; and we are in a Felicity that Never, Never, Never can be <hi>ſhaken.</hi> He ſayes to us, My Brethren, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Abiathar, With me thou ſhalt be in ſafety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us be ſtrong Believers on. High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of, our Lord JESUS CHRIST.

               <p>Secondly. Why ſhould not <hi>Shaking Times</hi> be <hi>Praying Times? Prayer</hi> has before now made an <hi>Earthquake.</hi> We read, Act. XVI. 25, 26. <hi>At midnight Paul &amp; Silas prayed:
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001763_0031_0FB7CDD4D5818228"/>And ſuddenly there was a great Earthquake, ſo that the Foundations of the Priſon were ſhaken.</hi> Who knows, but that the true Diſciples of our Lord may now ſee that <hi>Great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi> which will <hi>Shake</hi> the very <hi>Foundations</hi> of all the <hi>Confinements</hi> unjuſtly put upon them: and ere long the <hi>Doors will be opened,</hi> and <hi>Every ones Bonds be looſed?</hi> Certainly in ſuch an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and when whole <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are <hi>ſhaking,</hi> then <hi>Prayer</hi> will be a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar preſervative. <hi>Prayer!</hi> Ah, why ſo much <hi>Slumber,</hi> and ſo little <hi>Prayer,</hi> when we have the World ſo <hi>ſhaking</hi> about us!</p>
               <p>I have read of a Town in <hi>Switzer-land,</hi> once utterly ruined in an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> All except one piece of an Houſe, in which a devout Man happened then to be at <hi>Prayer</hi> with his Family. The <hi>Decree</hi> of the Infinite GOD ſeems to be this; <hi>Yet once more, I will ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven.</hi> At ſuch a Time there is that Voice from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to the <hi>Earth;</hi> Zeph. II. 2, 3. <hi>Before the Decree bring forth;</hi> — <hi>Seek ye the Lord, all ye Meek of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly. When all Things are <hi>Shaking,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:001763_0032_0FB7CDD7106816A8"/>Let it be our Conſolation, that it is our Glorious LORD, who does all that is done, and has all at His Diſpoſe.</p>
               <p>Who was it that ſaid, <hi>I will ſhake the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens &amp; the Earth, &amp; all Nations?</hi> Our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle has expreſsly told us, It was the Lord JESUS CHRIST; Heb. XII. 26. <hi>Whoſe Voice ſhook the Earth,</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai; but now He hath promiſed,</hi>—as you have heard.</p>
               <p>When 'tis a Time for <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and all <hi>Nations,</hi> to be ſo <hi>ſhaken,</hi> that <hi>Heaven &amp; Earth</hi> ſhall come together; Now, <hi>Let the Children of Zion be Joyful in their King!</hi> O <hi>Zion,</hi> Thy <hi>King,</hi> even the Glorious Head of the Church, and He that will not give <hi>Zion</hi> cauſe to ſay, <hi>My Lord has forgotten me:</hi> — 'Tis <hi>He</hi> that has the Ordering of all that comes to paſs; And all ſhall be well-orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. He <hi>will do all things well,</hi> — You may depend upon it! The Sentence which the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> wrote upon his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; You may take it, and make it your Comfort, and Feed and Live upon it; <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:001763_0033_0FB7CDD94A9EDB58"/>
What ſhall we ſay? <hi>O Lord, we know, that thou canſt do every thing.</hi> The People of God, may need ſome <hi>Shakes</hi> to be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, for their Advantage; And ſuch as can be given by none but an <hi>Arm</hi> that <hi>can do every thing.</hi> But ſuch a <hi>Mighty Arm</hi> has our Saviour. You read, <hi>His Voice ſhook the Earth.</hi> It is the <hi>Voice</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, whom we are to ſee this Day upon a <hi>Threne High &amp; Lifted up,</hi>— His <hi>Voice</hi> that <hi>Shakes</hi> the World. If He do but <hi>Utter His Voice,</hi> or if He do but <hi>Speak the Word,</hi> there ſhall every thing be done, that His People can wiſh for. We read, <hi>The Kingdoms are moved,</hi> when He <hi>Utters His Voice,</hi> and the <hi>Earth Melts</hi> before it.</p>
               <p>A Powerful <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that has made <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to <hi>ſhake</hi> with the Terror of his Arms: Our Lord JESUS CHRIST can eaſily <hi>ſhake</hi> ſuch an one down into his Grave.</p>
               <p>HE has newly done ſo. And I muſt conclude, with beſpeaking of your due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto HIS Hand, in what has been done.</p>
