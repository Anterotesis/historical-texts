            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT is of importance to the welfare of any <hi>art,</hi> that those whose taste inclines towards it, should have a good opinion of its <hi>utility,</hi> and competent notions of its <hi>principles.</hi> It is therefore the design of the present section, to shew the degree of estimation that the art of <hi>Gardening</hi> is worthy of; and it is the object of the next section, to assist in the acquiring that knowledge of <hi>Nature,</hi> upon which the art so much depends.</p>
                  <p>The employments of <hi>horticulture,</hi> certainly conduce to health of body, and peace of mind; and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are the <hi>charms</hi> and recreations of a <hi>garden</hi> well stocked, and well managed by the hand, or under the direction of the owner himself: It at all times serves him as a source of rational amusement, and honest satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>praise of gardening,</hi> it is presumed, can hardly be too highly extolled; and, as this has been so well done by the best of men, and most respectable of writers, it may better answer the purpose to produce <hi>their</hi> sentiments, than to attempt new ones.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Evelyn,</hi> who had so great knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the way of gardening, speaks its praise in these words: Though the gardener's life be a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one, yet is it full of tranquillity and satisfaction. A condition furnished with the most innocent, laudable and purest of earthly felicities; and such as does cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make the nearest approaches to that blessed state, where only they enjoy all things without pains.</p>

Mr. <hi>Addison</hi> says, I look upon the pleasure which we take in a garden, as one of the most innocent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of human life. A garden was the habitation of our first parents before the fall. It is naturally apt to fill the mind with calmness and tranquillity, and to lay all its turbulent passions at rest. It gives a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight into the contrivance and wisdom of providence; and suggests innumerable subjects for meditation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> in his meditations on return from a walk, having entered the <hi>flower garden,</hi> and called it a beautiful spot, says, "Here nature always pleasing, every where lovely, appears with peculiar attractions. Yonder she seems dressed in her <hi>dishabille;</hi> grand, but irregular. Here she calls in her hand-maid art; and shines in all the delicate ornaments, that the nicest cultivation can convey. <hi>Those</hi> are her <hi>common apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> where she lodges her ordinary guests: <hi>This</hi> is her <hi>cabinet of curiosities,</hi> where she entertains her inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance. My eye shall often expatiate over those scenes of universal fertility: My feet shall sometimes brush through the thicket or traverse the lawn, or stroll along the forest glade: but to <hi>this</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful retreat shall be my chief resort.—Thither will I make excursions, but here will I dwell."</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>Kitchen Garden</hi> Mr. H. observes, "Here those celebrated qualities are eminently united,—the utmost simplicity with the greatest neatness: none of the productions affect finery. If it be pleasing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their orderly situations, and their modest beauties; how delightful to consider the advantages they yield! What a fund of choice accommodations here! What a source of wholesome dainties, and all for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man! Not one species of all this is a cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berer of the ground. Not a single plant but is good for food, or some way salutary. And with so benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent an economy are the several periods of their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035770_0018_100A2F78803C3228"/>
ministration settled, that no portion of the year is left destitute of such nourishing esculents as are best suited to the temperature of the air, and the state of our bodies. Oh! why should the possessor of so valuable a spot envy the condition of kings? Since he may daily walk amidst rows of peaceable and obsequious subjects; every one of which tenders him some agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able present, and pays him a willing tribute. Such as is most excellently adapted, both to supply his wants, and regale his taste; to furnish him at once with both plenty and pleasure."</p>
                  <p>From the amiable <hi>Cowper</hi> something on this subject may be added. See the <hi>garden</hi> in his Poem, entitled the TASK.</p>

                  <p>Let the ELEMENTS be first considered.</p>
                  <p>EARTH, as an element, considered in itself, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not to serve to the support of man or beast. Though from it all things spring as from a common womb; yet independent of the other elements, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous matter, it neither produces, nor affords, any thing like food. Assisted however by these, there is a combination of powers, the effects of which are equally beneficial and wonderful.</p>
                  <p>It has been the most general opinion, that the <hi>earth</hi> acts only as a <hi>receptacle</hi> for nutriment; and as a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, or means of supporting plants erectly; to imbibe rain, dews, air, &amp;c. needing continually to be replenished by manures, or from the atmosphere. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is not to be conceived, how the earth, consid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as a solid, should pass through the capillary parts of plants. Experiments have proved, that the earth is very little, if at all exhausted, by the growth of plants, and consequently affords a presumption that plants are not fed by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:035770_0021_100A2F7E987E5ED8"/>
There has been much controversy about the <hi>food</hi> of plants. A respectable writer says, The saline, unctuous, and subtle slime, which the water separates from the coarse earth, and keeps in a dissolved state, is the principal nutriment of plants. And indeed, this is the opinion of others, who have treated the subject, and is justified by inquiries into the nature of the sap of plants.</p>
                  <p>Those who contend for an <hi>inherent</hi> power in earth to nourish plants, lay a stress upon the circumstance, that various earths have various qualities, suited to different parts. But to this it may be said, that the earth being more or less binding, or composed of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently constructed particles, occasions the parting with the food committed to it, the more or less freely, or altered according to its various modes of perco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>WATER appears to have much to do in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of plants, for they consume a great deal; and either die, or are at a stand, when they are deprived of it, or at least of humidity from the air. It is proved, that seeds and plants, and in short all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, consist chiefly of water, being reducible to liquids in a great degree. Thus some ancient philos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophers maintained, that all things have their nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and growth from water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Water</hi> (with respect to vegetation) has been defined to be, a mixed fluid, in which are all sorts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles proper for the composition of plants. But though seeds will germinate in water, they will not proceed to grow in it. Rooted trees however have been set in water at the spring, (as a rose) and put forth leaves fair, though pale; and it is well known, that many slips and branches of plants will strike root in water readily: and gathered flowers not only keep fresh in it, but increase in fize, and buds open their foliage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:035770_0022_100A2F812FE36258"/>
The natural state of water uninfluenced by heat is ice, and when very cold, it is too dense a fluid to pass through some of the capillary vessels of plants; yet a small degree of heat rarefies it; and as its globules are capable of being infinitely divided by a proportionate heat; it is thus rendered fit to pass through the finest canals. It mixes with the nutritive properties that are lodged in the earth, and is (at least) the <hi>vehicle</hi> of the food of plants. In this respect alone, it is most val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable. Without it, nothing could be elaborated in nature, no fermentations be wrought, and animals and plants would die of thirst!</p>
                  <p>AIR is found in a considerable degree in water, in plants, and in fruits. It may be almost demonstrated (says one) that the vegetable nourishment is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in the air: The <hi>tree Sedum</hi> lives and grows for years without earth or water.</p>
                  <p>How <hi>necessary</hi> this element of air is to <hi>man,</hi> the commonest observation evinces. Deprived of air, life is quickly lost, and in a depraved state of it, runs fast to sickness and death. Thus <hi>plants</hi> are found to flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish in a free and open air, and grow pale and languish in the contrary. But air is not only necessary for the <hi>leaves</hi> of plants to breathe in, but their <hi>roots</hi> require it: Plants will not do well if the soil is too much bound for the <hi>air</hi> to penetrate freely about them.</p>
                  <p>The sickliness of <hi>housed</hi> plants has been said to be owing greatly to want of <hi>motion,</hi> supposing it equally necessary to vegetable as to animal life; and the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the several parts of plants by wind, must necessarily impel the juices forwards. Rest can only be esteemed a joint cause of sickliness, and the want of fresh air, must still be the chief; for pure air is fraught with animating principles, and by its attenuating and elas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic properties, separates the gross juices, keeps the sap in motion, and the plants in health.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:035770_0023_100A2F82B1FAFF88"/>
If it be asked what <hi>air</hi> is, and of what it consists? It may be answered, Particles of wet and dry bodies volatilized and rendered elastic by fire. The air or atmosphere that surrounds our earth, contains a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all the active volatile parts of the whole habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able world; that is, of all vegetables, minerals and animals. Whatever perspires, corrupts or exhales, impregnates the air; which, being acted upon by the solar fire, produces within itself, all sorts of chemical operations, dispenses again those salts and spirits in new generations, which it had received from putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.</p>
                  <p>FIRE, as it operates from the prime body of it the SUN, gives life and energy to all, completing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of nature. There is no existing without it. Its total absence would presently bring all to the coldness of death!</p>
                  <p>The <hi>sun</hi> by its warmth (conveyed by the air) sets forward that <hi>fermentation</hi> in the earth, and gives that animation to plants, which effects growth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocts their juices to make them fruitful.</p>
                  <p>It is by the <hi>rarefaction</hi> of the air and juices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the roots, and all the parts of a plant, that motion and expansion are given to it; and by its as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending force pushes into buds, leaves flowers and fruits; sending off superfluous and excrementitious moisture into the atmosphere, thus giving us the <hi>scents</hi> peculiar to each. That the <hi>sun</hi> does this, is evident from what is experienced in <hi>artificial warmth,</hi> hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the growth of plants, which is ever propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to the heat applied, provided there is a proper supply of moisture.</p>
                  <p>Without the vivifying <hi>sun,</hi> the other elements would be inactive matter, and <hi>no longer would the fig-tree blossom, nor fruit be in the vine: The labour of the olive would fail, and the fields yield no meat.</hi> The operative power of the <hi>sun</hi> reaches the deepest recesses, to beds

                  <p>The SUN is the fountain of LIGHT. This glorious object of creation, as a <hi>luminary,</hi> gives cheerfulness both in nature and appearance to all things: If light is not so necessary to existence as heat, life would yet be miserable without it.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>vegetation,</hi> we may observe, without <hi>light</hi> plants get always sickly, and would not exist long if deprived of it. Light (says Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi>) philosophic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally considered, is half their nourishment. All plants turn to the light as to a powerful attraction, or, as if conscious how necessary it is to their existence. That accute philosopher Dr. <hi>Berkeley</hi> says, light at the same time that it heats, doth wonderfully rarify and raise the sap. He is of opinion, that light is the same with AEther, and that it so mixes with other bodies, as to enter into their composition, and increase their weight.

                  <p>They are covered with coats that are finely and closely wrought, the better to keep the moisture of the earth from coming in too suddenly upon the lobes, or the little plant which might occasion their rotting, and we find that almost every sort of seed, by means of these coverings, must remain different lengths of time in the earth, before they begin to germinate. Some will not spring in the ground till the second year after they are buried, while others will begin to shoot in three days after sowing. This is owing to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring different degrees of moisture, heat and air, to make them germinate; i. e. bring them into a state of fermentation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>substance</hi> of seeds appears to be spent first in feeding the radicle, and then in the nourishment of the two first, or <hi>seed leaves,</hi> which are commonly of a different size, shape and substance from the <hi>proper</hi> leaves of the plant: From between these comes a shoot bearing the <hi>true</hi> leaves. The <hi>lobes</hi> (or substance) of seed, consist of a farinous nutriment, adapted to the infant state of the plant, when softened and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by the moisture of the earth, which extends and unfolds the young plant (or plumule) in the same manner, as the nourishing juice in the eggs of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals hatches their embryo. The seed leaves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contain a fugary juice, which is evident from insects so greedily biting them, and their pleasant taste in sallads, as those of <hi>turnips, cabbages,</hi> &amp;c. They
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035770_0028_100A2EE7A6D0CC50"/>
are thick and succulent, calculated to imbibe air and moisture from the atmosphere, for the support of the tender plant, that might otherwise suffer by drought: for it must <hi>proceed</hi> in growth, or it would quickly die. When the radicle has struck downwards, the office of the seed is evidently to nourish these leaves, as is seen by the seed coming above the ground with them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted of its substance—a mere shell sticking to the top of the leaves.</p>

To conclude that they have, is however more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the uniformity of the <hi>divine</hi> procedure, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to reason.</p>
                  <p>Seed may be so small as not to be discerned with the help of convex glasses, as we know there are many not discernible without them; and with this minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it may be extremely fugacious by its slight adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the plant.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>truth</hi> is, GOD originally ordained that plants should proceed from seed, and they do, (<hi>Gen.</hi> i. 2.) It was long said that <hi>fern</hi> bare no seed; but this has proved a demonstrable mistake. That <hi>Mushrooms,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce seed, we need not doubt. Many of the <hi>mosses</hi> are so small plants, that the microscope only can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their flowers, and some the plants themselves are but barely thus discernible. A great variety of seeds are wafted about continually in the air, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their kind, whenever they light upon a proper matrix. Whatever has been objected there appears good ground for believing, that there is no natural production, either in the vegetable or animal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but what comes from the seed, or egg of some parent, plant or animal.</p>

As to certain plants appearing where none were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we know that some seeds will keep many years, when deep buried, and being afterwards brought to the surface, have vegetated, as the wild <hi>mustard,</hi> &amp;c. Besides the wind carrying some sorts of seeds to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable distance, birds also drop a great many, so that plantations of <hi>oaks,</hi> &amp;c. have sprung up by means of crows carrying the acorns, and dropping them in cracked ground.</p>
                  <p>PLANTS follow seed, and we find them proceeding in a steady unceasing progression towards maturity, to their destined end, i. e. production of the like, from which they sprung (seed) to preserve the species. And the <hi>economy</hi> of nature is so regular, that a certain portion of <hi>time</hi> is invariably kept (barring accidental circumstances) for this business. So cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly does Nature pursue her end in all respects, that the identical species is always preserved, as to the distinguishing properties of each, though the soils that seeds are sown are so various.

The ROOTS of plants are to keep them fixed in the earth and to draw food from it; which they do (chiefly at least) by their <hi>ends</hi> which have been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called mouths: In general they affect an hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal growth for the benefit of the sun and air, and never descend above a certain depth from the surface.</p>
                  <p>By means of the <hi>root,</hi> nourishment proceeds through the pipes and capillary conduits of plants, continually from the earth, and by the action of the sun and air, circulates, rarifies, and distributes itself. This juicy food, swells the little bags, or cells (of which the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of plants is composed) and following the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent modifications thereof, filtrates athwart the parts. For example. That which is most pure and sine, serves to nourish the flowers and fruits; that which is not, supplies the branches and leaves, and roots; the most gross and earthy serves for the bark; and the most oily i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for gum and rosin. Just the same as we find it in <hi>animals,</hi> where the food they receive into the stomach pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The STEMS or trunks of plants are for the support of the head, and to convey juices from the roots up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for the leaves, branches, &amp;c. and are composed (as the roots) of bladders, and various conduits for air, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ap, &amp;c. perpendicular, spiral, and horizontal, from the pith to the bark. These vessels may be somewhat seen with the naked eye, as in slices of the young snoots of <hi>nut, apple tree,</hi> and <hi>vine,</hi> but very evidently by a microscope. It is observable, that some plants which are weak and pipy have <hi>knots</hi> at proper dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances to strengthen them, and others have <hi>claspers</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>old them up; while others are robust enough to brave the fury of a tempest.</p>
                  <p>The LEAVES of plants are very variously, but beautifully constructed in their form and substance; and if we consider them as attracting nourishment
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035770_0031_100A2F938C981348"/>
from the root and the atmosphere, and as perspiring and respiring, they are most evidently essential to vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and so we find that if the stems, or branches of a plant, are considerably deprived of them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come stunted and diseased, and if any fruit be on them, it proceeds slowly in growth, and is ill flavoured. The <hi>quantity</hi> of nutriment which a plant derives from the earth, is in proportion to the number and size of its leaves; thus that they may uninterruptedly perform their offices, they are distributed in as distinct and sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arate a mode as possible.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>under</hi> and <hi>upper</hi> part of leaves are different, and have separate offices; the under is rough and porous, as if adapted to imbibe the rising moisture of night dews; and the upper, or closer, to exclude the grosser parts of the atmosphere, and to imbibe some finer food, as to "draw the live ether." Thus leaves will not endure to be <hi>reversed,</hi> as is seen by the quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their right position, when forced from it, and that till this is effected, they perform not their proper functions.</p>
                  <p>That the glossy <hi>surface</hi> of leaves have an intimate connection with the <hi>light</hi> is evident, as they rise and fall (in a degree, some plants more and others less) as the sun does. If they are turned from the light they twist themselves towards it, as if they had enjoyment, and were <hi>conscious</hi> of the benefit. The curious will meet with gratification relative to this subject, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting <hi>Hill'</hi>s Tract <hi>On the Sleep of Plants;</hi> or his <hi>Eden</hi> for October.</p>
                  <p>One of the offices of leaves, seems to be, to subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize and give more spirit to the abundance of nourishing sap, and to convey it to the little <hi>buds</hi> at their foot <hi>sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k,</hi> to whose welfare and life they are essential.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>texture</hi> of the leaves be scrutinized, they are found curiously ramified; the ribs and fibres of each seeming much like a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> reading plant. The ramifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hold a close communication with each other;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035770_0032_100A2F950F867108"/>
so that the principal rib sends out lateral ones less strong, and they again an infinite number of fine ones in all directions; and these are vessels of two kinds, <abbr>viz.</abbr> for <hi>sap</hi> and <hi>air.</hi> As leaves throw off a great deal of excrementitious, so do they imbibe a great deal of nutritious moisture, as is evident from the general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments received from dews. Yet we are not to conclude, that the other parts of plants do not the same in a less degree; and the rough bark of the trees, and the outer vessels, are well calculated to detain moisture, which they convey to other parts.</p>
                  <p>The BRANCHES of plants come next to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. How beautifully do they spread, and how uniformly do they proceed, keeping up precisely the same mode of growth, one from another throughout the whole; till the head of the plant, or tree, attains its customary size, and own peculiar form; which, if it has grown with native liberty, proves always of an agreeable symmetry.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>texture</hi> of branches consists of the same kind of vessels as the stem, or trunk; but here it may be observed, that there is yet a specific difference in the vessels of the various parts, as is concluded from their affording juices of a different flavour and effluvia in the bark, wood, leaves, flowers and seeds; so that from the <hi>same</hi> plant are extracted medical properties of very contrary nature.</p>
                  <p>BUDS are like seeds, as they contain the future growth of branches and fruit in miniature, so that for instance, in the buds of a <hi>currant-tree</hi> may be discov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered (by a microscope) even before winter, the woody branch, and the bunches of fruit. The future fruit also has been viewed in the bud of a <hi>vine.</hi> In the short buds of <hi>pears,</hi> which appear at <hi>Midsummer,</hi> an indifferent microscope will shew the blossoms designed for the <hi>April</hi> following. The buds of a <hi>Mazerion</hi> being examined at <hi>Midsummer,</hi> had the blossoms dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035770_0033_100A2F97D7CE1DC0"/>
in them, though the time of their blow is not till <hi>February;</hi> but these are only particular instances.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears, that the leaves, blossoms, fruit, and branches, on all trees, are formed the year <hi>before;</hi> and so their fruitfulness in the year they bear, is no otherwise the consequence of <hi>that</hi> season, than that nature has gone without any destructive check in her progress, and particularly at the time of flowering, when many blossoms are destroyed by inclement wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by wet only as much as any thing.</p>
                  <p>The FLOWERS of plants have not yet been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly noticed, but of them something must, and much might be said.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Flowers</hi> have a general structure in substance, similar to the other parts of plants, as to vessels for sap, air, &amp;c. only are so much the more exquisitely formed, as the leaves are of so delicate a texture. They are formed in the bud while in the <hi>pith,</hi> and so consequently are the fruit and seed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>flowers</hi> of many proceed from a bud, or knot, the leaves or parts of which do first cover the flower contained therein, whilst it is yet unable to bear the inconveniences of the weather, and defend it from the same; and after the flower is blown, they keep up its leaves, that they may not hang confusedly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but regularly represent their beauties to the eyes of the beholders: This is exemplified in the <hi>carnation.</hi> Those that have a cup to sustain their leaves, are weak
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035770_0034_100A42468E71BD18"/>
in their texture, and so need this support; but those that are strong have it not, as <hi>lilies, tulips,</hi> &amp;c. Those that have no cup are, however, covered in the bud by some <hi>sheath,</hi> or tegument, to preserve them, while young, and yet too tender to be exposed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>leaves</hi> of flowers protect and conceal the <hi>seed</hi> of those that bear it, where nature secretly works to the great end of propagation. The seed is the natural offspring of the flower, and when this is once well formed, the several parts of the flower dwindle and disappear. So that while we are admiring the colour, shape, and perfume of these delightful companions of our walks, they are kindly engaged to provide the means of perpetuating pleasure to us.</p>
                  <p>The care which the AUTHOR of nature has taken to preserve the <hi>seed</hi> of plants, by the flower leaves which contain the embryo, as in a matrix is admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able! The flowers themselves come not forth till the season suits their particular temperament, many are hid till then under the coverture of the earth, and those that dare to continue above ground all the year, have yet their <hi>gems</hi> carefully locked up, and thus their succession and their fruits are secured to us.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>flowers</hi> of plants have a remarkable property, when they begin to unfold, and the seed is yet young and tender; they observe the course of the weather, day and night, opening and shutting their flowers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. There is also a property of some flower plants, <hi>twining</hi> round solid bodies, or fixing themselves to them by <hi>claspers,</hi> laying fast hold of what may be in their way. <hi>Flowers</hi> have many admirable properties and parts, that might be considered distinctly, if it were designed to speak of them <hi>botanically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>flowers</hi> (of which every month in the year has its beauties) we eventually gratify the palate, by a valuable <hi>nectar,</hi> and from many we immediately reap agreeable <hi>odours;</hi> but it is for their <hi>colour</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

                  <p>But not only the <hi>colours</hi> delight the eye, the <hi>form</hi> of flowers are objects of admiration. The <hi>leaves</hi> of the plants (not to mention the shades of their green and variegations of other colours) are of various symmetry, some plain, others indented, some hard, some soft, smooth, hairy, &amp;c. <hi>Flowers</hi> are composed, some of only one, others of several and numerous leaves.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ew; and when it does, <hi>soil, situation,</hi> and <hi>space,</hi> all favourable, are happy circumstances not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at command: It often indeed happens, however, that pieces of ground are taken into use as additions, and some judgment should be exercised in the choice, that the business may be well done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:035770_0038_100A422AEF014788"/>
To help towards resolving on the <hi>quantity</hi> of ground it may be prudent to cultivate as a garden, a general idea may be given in observing, that an <hi>acre</hi> with wall-trees, hot beds, pots, &amp;c. will furnish employment for a man, who at some buisy times will need assistance. The <hi>size</hi> of the garden should, however, be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the <hi>house,</hi> as to the number of inhabitants it does, or may contain. This is naturally dictated; but yet, it is better to have too much ground allotted than too little, and there is nothing monstrous in a large garden annexed to a small house.</p>
                  <p>Some families use few, others many vegetables, and it makes a great difference whether the owner is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to have a <hi>long</hi> season of the same production, or is content to have a supply only at the more common times. But to give some <hi>rule</hi> for the quantity of ground to be laid out, a family of four persons (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of servents) may have a <hi>rood</hi> of good working ground, and for every head after ¼ rood extra.</p>
                  <p>But if it can, let the garden be rather extensive in proportion to the family; for then, a useful sprinkling of <hi>fruit trees</hi> can be planted in it, which may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to do well, under the common culture of the ground about them; and then, a good portion may be allotted for that agreeable fruit the <hi>strawberry</hi> in all its varieties; and the very disagreeable circumstance of being at any time short of vegetables, may be avoided. It should be considered also, that <hi>artichokes, asparagus,</hi> and a long succession of <hi>peas</hi> and <hi>beans,</hi> require a good deal of ground. <hi>Hot-beds</hi> will also take up much room, if any thing considerable be done in the way of raising <hi>cucumbers, melons, flowers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>situation</hi> of a garden should be dry, but rather low than high, and as sheltered as can be from the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>East</hi> winds. These points of the compass, should be guarded against by high and good fences; by a wall of at least ten feet high: Indeed lower walls do not answer <hi>well</hi> for fruit-trees, though eight may
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035770_0039_100A422F72BB59B8"/>
do. A garden should be so situated, to be as much warmer as possible, than the general temper of the air is without, or ought to be made warmer by the ring, and subdivision fences: This advantage is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to the expectation we have from a <hi>garden</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally considered.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>trees</hi> planted without the wall, to break the wind, it is not to be expected to reap much good this way, except from something more than a single row; i. e. a plantation. Yet the fall of the leaves by the autumnal winds is troublesome, and a <hi>high</hi> wall is therefore advisable. <hi>Spruce firs</hi> have been used in close <hi>shorn</hi> hedges; which therefore, as <hi>evergreens,</hi> are proper to plant for a screen in a single row, though not very near to the wall; but the best <hi>evergreens</hi> for this purpose are the <hi>evergreen oak,</hi> and the <hi>cork tree.</hi> Rows of <hi>Lombardy poplars,</hi> or the <hi>witch elm,</hi> planted close, grow quick, and have a pretty summer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance behind a wall: but are of little use then, as a screen, except to the <hi>West;</hi> where still, they may shade too much (if planted near) as they mount high. In a dry hungry soil, the <hi>beech</hi> is proper. The great <hi>maple,</hi> commonly called the <hi>sycamore,</hi> is handsome, of quick growth, and being fit to stand the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>udest blasts, will protect a garden well in a very exposed situation: the wind to be chiefly guarded against as to strength, being the <hi>westerly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>form</hi> of a garden, may be a square, but an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long is to be preferred; and the area rather a level; or if there be any slope, it should be <hi>southward,</hi> a point either to the <hi>East,</hi> or <hi>West</hi> not much signifying, but not to the <hi>North,</hi> if it can be avoided, because crops come in late, and plants do not stand the winter so well in such a situation. A garden with a <hi>northern</hi> aspect, has, however, its advantages, being cooler for some summer productions, as <hi>strawberries, cauliflowers,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore to have a little under cultivation, so sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated, is desirable; especially as succession ground.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035770_0040_100A423106355330"/>
If the soil of a garden is strong, it would be worth while, where <hi>sand</hi> (not a binding sort) is to be had, to make one warm spot of it <hi>light</hi> for the purpose of a few <hi>forward</hi> things; as in a <hi>good</hi> sandy soil, plants will germinate at spring, from a fortnight to a month sooner than on clay.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>soil</hi> that suits general cultivation best, is a <hi>loam;</hi> rather the red than the black; but there are good soils of various colours, and this must be as it happens: The worst soil is a heavy clay, and the next a light sand I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the soil is not good; i. e. too poor, too strong, or too light, it is to be carefully improved <hi>without delay.</hi> Let it first, at least, be thoroughly broke, and cleaned of all rubbish, to a <hi>regular</hi> level depth at <hi>bottom</hi> as well as top, so as to give full eighteen inches of working mould, if the good soil will admit of it, for none that is bad should be thrown up for use. This rule of <hi>bottom</hi> levelling, is particularly necessary when there is clay below, as it will hold up wet, which should not stand in any part of the garden. When a piece of ground is cleared of roots, weeds, stones, &amp;c. it would be of advantage, to have the whole thrown into two feet wide <hi>trenches,</hi> and lay thus as long as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently may be. The ground cannot be too well <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared;</hi> for when this business is not performed to the bottom at first, it is often neglected, and is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently done afterwards; and so it happens, that barely a spade's depth (or less) is too often thought sufficient to go on with. There is this great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a <hi>deep</hi> staple, that in the cultivation of it, the bottom may be brought to the top every other year, by double trenching and being thus renewed, less dung will do: Tap-rooted things as <hi>carrots</hi> and <hi>parsnips</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a good depth of soil.

                  <p>The <hi>border</hi> next this wall should be of very good earth, about two feet deep, rising a little towards the wall. A free moderate <hi>loam,</hi> or some fresh maiden soil, not too light, is <hi>necessary;</hi> and if it is not natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally there, let no trouble be spared to procure it, if it can be had, so as to make all the borders <hi>promising</hi> good; and in order to this, if <hi>manure</hi> is necessary, let it rather be that of rotted vegetables, or a small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of turf, or wood ashes, or a less of soot, or salt, for the roots of fruit-trees should not meet with much dung, at least of <hi>horses;</hi> that of <hi>cows</hi> is the best, or that of <hi>sheep</hi> or <hi>hogs,</hi> will do, well-rotted, and well mixed, &amp;c. being worked in the borders, as long as possible before the trees are to be planted. Let the <hi>holes</hi> be some time opened beforehand, that they may be sweetened and improved by the exposure. Thus due care will be taken, and all things ready to go about the work of <hi>planting</hi> properly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>borders</hi> for <hi>peaches,</hi> &amp;c. cannot be too wide, for in a few years the roots will spread a considerable way; and that they may do it without <hi>impediment</hi> of rubbish in the walks, and without meeting with a <hi>bad</hi> soil, is of much consequence to the health and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the trees.</p>
                  <p>If a garden is <hi>large</hi> and square, a second <hi>South</hi> wall, running down the middle of it would be very useful; and so, if large and long, a <hi>cross</hi> wall or two might be so, as giving opportunity for the cultivation of more trained <hi>fruit trees;</hi> and if there is any idea of <hi>forcing</hi> fruits, these intersecting walls, ranging <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> are proper for it (as situated within the ring fence) being furnished with flues, &amp;c.</p>

The <hi>best</hi> fruit border being prepared for <hi>peaches, nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarines</hi> and <hi>apricots,</hi> or <hi>vines</hi> and <hi>figs,</hi> the trees should take their residence there (if the leaf is falling) about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or as soon after as can be. If the middle of <hi>December</hi> be past, <hi>February</hi> is then the time, though some gardeners plant all winter, if the weather is open enough at the time to work the ground. <hi>March</hi> may do, or even [upon a pinch] the beginning of <hi>April.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Wall-trees</hi> should not be older than <hi>two</hi> years from grafting, or budding. Much disappointment has been the consequence of planting old <hi>trained trees,</hi> through their being accustomed (perhaps) to a contrary soil, or by damage done the roots in taking the trees up; and thus, instead of saving time, it has frequently been lost, being obliged, (after years) to be replaced with young ones. But if trained trees are to be made use of, let them be planted as early as possible, with full roots, and in a particularly good soil: The <hi>necessity</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving trees to a better (or at least as good a soil) has been denied, but it is certainly reasonable.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>distance</hi> to plant, should be about eight or nine inches from the wall, and let <hi>apricots, peaches,</hi> and <hi>nectarines</hi> be twenty feet asunder, more or less, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the height of the wall; though for the small early sorts of wall fruits, sixteen feet will do. As the larger <hi>apricots,</hi> however, grow freely, and do not well endure the <hi>knife,</hi> they should have twenty-five feet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them: This is for a wall of nine or ten feet high; if higher, the distance may be less, and if lower, the contrary. This room may seem (to some) too great, but experience proves it necessary; for when trees are planted in too <hi>confined</hi> a space, after a few years it is troublesome to keep them pruned within bounds; and the cutting they <hi>must</hi> have, makes them run to wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

without shortening. In low, sheltered, and warm situations, as under a high wall to the <hi>N.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> the fig-tree sometimes does very well as a dwarf standard, particularly in the gardens of great towns. Though other trees are best planted in <hi>October,</hi> this should not be till <hi>March.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>intermediate</hi> spaces between <hi>peaches, nectarines,</hi> and <hi>apricots,</hi> may have a <hi>vine,</hi> a <hi>dwarf-cherry,</hi> or <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> or <hi>gooseberry-tree,</hi> of the early sorts, as the smooth green and small red, to come in early; and improved in the beauty, size, and flavour of their fruit, by the advantage of situation. But wheresoever <hi>grapes</hi> can be expected to <hi>ripen,</hi> there let a young plant, or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, be set, though the space be confined; for the <hi>vine</hi> (freely as it shoots) bears the knife well to keep it within bounds. If the wall be high, the <hi>cherry,</hi> or <hi>plum,</hi> may be half-standards, which being after a while kept above, will be more out of the way of the principal trees; though dwarfs may be trained so as not to interfere. Some have planted half-standards of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The better way however is, when the wall is tolerably covered, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Something merely <hi>ornamental</hi> may occupy the vacancies also, as some <hi>double blossomed</hi> fruit tree, <hi>passion tree, roses,</hi> &amp;c. or in a fine situation, a <hi>pomegranate;</hi> any of which may be removed when their room is wanted.

                     <hi>Plums, cherries,</hi> and <hi>pears,</hi> may occupy the other walls, the two former at about fifteen, or it may be twenty feet asunder. <hi>Cherries,</hi> however, will not gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally do well in a full <hi>North</hi> aspect; but any sort

of <hi>plum</hi> (rather a late one) and summer <hi>pears,</hi> and also <hi>nut trees</hi> will, if you chuse to train them. There should always be some <hi>currants</hi> and <hi>gooseberries</hi> in an <hi>E.</hi> and <hi>N.</hi> situation, at the distance of eight feet, where they will be easily <hi>matted,</hi> (when ripe) to come in late, as <hi>October, November,</hi> or perhaps <hi>December. Pear</hi> trees of free growth are hardly to be kept within tolerable compass on <hi>low</hi> walls; but if attempted, should have at least thirty feet allowed them. The best sort of <hi>winter pears</hi> deserve a <hi>southerly</hi> wall to ripen them well, and improve them in size and flavour: The gable end of a house is peculiarly proper for a pear tree, as it affords room which they require. <hi>Apples</hi> may do on a wall, (and if any on a <hi>good</hi> wall, let it be the <hi>golden pippen</hi>) yet the practice is seldom adopted: The same may be said of <hi>mulberries,</hi> though they come to bearing much sooner against a wall; but they need not have a <hi>South</hi> aspect, indeed it has been asserted, that they do the best in a <hi>North</hi> one. For <hi>walls,</hi> chuse trees of moderate wood, rather than strong; for it can hardly be too fine, if well rooted, clean, and healthy: This observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion particularly applies to the <hi>pear. Quince stock</hi> pear trees are chosen in order to a confined growth; but they do not succeed in a dry soil, or hot situation.</p>
                  <p>When the planting of a garden is finished, it will be a good way to have a <hi>plan</hi> of it taken, with the names of every peculiar tree marked thereon, in their place, to be assured of the sorts when they come to bear. Some have the names of the trees painted on <hi>boards,</hi> and placed behind them, to which, if added the time of ripening (fixed late enough) it would prevent a premature plucking by visitors, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be observed, that if any <hi>evergreen hedges</hi> are desired, in or about the garden, <hi>yew, box, alaternus, celastrus, phillyrea</hi> and <hi>pyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:035770_0045_100A423D281A0D60"/>
The <hi>walks</hi> come next under consideration, and they are to be begun from the <hi>best wall;</hi> the border of which being regularly levelled and settled, the walk is to be governed by it. A <hi>wide</hi> border next the <hi>South</hi> (as was said) is best for the trees, and moreover for the many uses that may be made of it for the smaller early, or late tender esculents, and a few early cauliflowers. For the sake of a pleasant sheltered walk, to have the <hi>South</hi> border narrow may be desirable; but on no account let it be within six feet. Take care that this <hi>walk</hi> is not <hi>sunk</hi> too much, and that it have a bottom of good earth, as deep as where the trees are planted. Let the body of gravel be thin, and then the roots of the trees will be admitted to run properly under the walk, and find nourishment; where, if they were stopped by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish, they would be apt to canker, and irrecoverably disease the tree.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>number</hi> and <hi>breadth</hi> of the walks must in a measure be determined by the quantity of allotted ground; exceeding in these particulars where there is room. But better be few and wide, than many and contracted. If the garden is small, one good walk all round is sufficient; and if long and narrow, the cross walks should not be many: six, or eight feet, is not too wide in a moderate sized garden.</p>
                  <p>If the grounds be laid out in <hi>Autumn,</hi> leave the walks alone till <hi>Spring,</hi> when the earth will be settled. <hi>Gravel</hi> laid towards Winter would be greatly disturbed by the frost, and the necessary work about the ground. But whenever made, the garden ought to be first care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully brought to an exact level; then the walks should be nicely stumpt up, keeping the tops of the stumps (as guides) to the true pitch of the quarters by a <hi>light</hi> line, made of good hemp, that will bear pulling tight. Proceed to take the earth out of the alleys about eight inches deep, which may be thrown towards the middle of the quarters, to give them an agreeable, but small convexity, which makes them look well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="unknown:035770_0046_100A423FA694A5E0"/>
Rake the bottom of the walk level, and lay the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to within two inches of the top of the stumps. The gravel will settle a little, but the walks should always be about three inches at their edge, below the quarters, or these will have a flat and mean appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Edgings</hi> are to be made, in order to separate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the earth and gravel, especially if of stone, or wood, or box, they should be done first, and they will be a good rule to lay the walks by. See, <hi>of Edgings</hi> in the miscellaneous section.</p>
                  <p>If plenty of <hi>Gravel,</hi> lay it moderately fine: if scarce, some small stones, or rubbish of any kind, may be laid in first, and rammed down with a broad rammer; but do not spare for a little expense, if gravel can be had, as a thick coat of fine gravel, will bear relaying, or turning over, to refresh it occasionally. As the gravel is laid, let the operator neatly rake the larger parts down to the bottom, leaving a fine surface, in a small degree convex, i. e. just barely sufficient to throw off wet: walks that lie high in the middle are unpleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to both eye and feet, and cannot be so well rolled.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>deep</hi> walks of gravel are designed, for the sake of the mould dug out of the alleys, it should be forborne, and laid thin, if any <hi>trees</hi> are designed to be planted near the edge; for if the roots of trees have not a good soil to strike into, when they reach the walks they will not (as has been observed) prosper. In laying gravel very thick, it is a good way to do it at two courses; the first of which may be rough as it comes from the pit, yet still raking the larger parts down, and then ramming or treading it; and the last course should be of all screened materials.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>few yards</hi> of gravel only should be laid at a time, before ramming or treading; after which it may be necessary to go over it with a fine iron rake, tooth and back; and then a whole walk being finished, it should be repeatedly pressed with a moderately heavy
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035770_0047_100A4242B51658E8"/>
roller; and again after the next rain that falls: so will the walks become level and firm. The <hi>caution</hi> may be repeated, not to lay the walks too high, on account of the ill appearance it gives the quarters and borders when on the same level with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grass Walks</hi> may do where gravel is scarce; but the latter is so clearly preferable, that except for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle variety in large gardens where there are many walks, they will hardly be made choice of. They are troublesome to keep in order, and if much used are apt to get bare, and out of level, especially when narrow; they are also frequently damp to the feet, if not wet. See miscellaneous Section, <hi>Of Grass Plats.</hi>

                     <hi>Camomile,</hi> has been used also to form green walks, planting it in sets about nine or ten inches asunder; which naturally spreading, and the runners being fixed by walking on them, it forms a pleasant carpet, and is esteemed medicinal, from the effluvia arising by the pressure of the feet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sand</hi> may be adopted for walks, and there is a bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sort of it, that does very well; but lay not any of it too thick, as it is the less firm for it. Drift sand is a good substitute for gravel.</p>

                     <hi>Coal Ashes</hi> strewed thinly in the alleys are better than nothing, as they at least serve to keep the feet dry and clean. If the garden be a <hi>strong</hi> soil, these ashes (when worn down) may be thrown out of the walks, with a little of the earth, and will prove a good manure for the quarters.</p>

                  <p>All <hi>trees</hi> designed to be planted, are to be thought of before winter. Those of the <hi>wall</hi> have been spoken of; and as to <hi>standards</hi> they must have a fair <hi>depth</hi> of good soil (not very dungy) to grow in, for it should be remembered, that tree roots in a garden are prevented from running over the <hi>surface,</hi> as they do in an undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed orchard. It is necessary that some caution should be used not to dig the ground too near, and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035770_0048_100A4244B68C5EE8"/>
too deep about garden trees; lest loosening the roots, they should not be able to stand the wind; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the nearer the surface any root grows, the more, and better fruit, the tree bears.</p>
                  <p>But the fewer <hi>standard trees</hi> in a garden the better, as they take up much room, and by their shade prevent the proper growth of vegetables that are any thing near them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that if a garden is small, there should be no trees except those of the <hi>wall.</hi> The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ase is different where there is ample room; and the <hi>blossoms</hi> of fruit trees (apples particularly) are so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, that if they produced nothing for the palate, there would be a sufficient inducement to plant them for ornament; but let them be dwarf standards, in preference to espaliers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dwarf-standards</hi> occasion less trouble to keep them in order than espaliers, and are generally more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive. <hi>Espalier</hi> trees are seldom managed well, and commonly appear unsightly; they are stiff and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and obstruct the sight in viewing the quarters of a garden, which (if in order,) are worthy of coming under the eye; and the violence done to nature, to keep espaliers in form, is paid by pains and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A writer of repute; observes, apples on <hi>French</hi> paradise stocks, planted at eight or nine feet distance, pruned and kept in an easy manner, make a fine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and produce better fruit, and in greater quantities, than when they are in espaliers; <hi>Dutch</hi> paradise stocks however last longer, and are altogether superior. For managing <hi>Dwarf trees,</hi> see <hi>Pruning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>Espaliers</hi> are planted, let them be only fruit of the best sorts, and in <hi>spacious</hi> gardens, where they may have a good length and height allowed them to grow freely; and let it be resolved to do the business <hi>neatly.</hi> If they may have nothing better than poles or stakes to be trained to, let them at least be strait, and of some equality in size, as to height and thickness, smooth, and not too clumsy for the purpose; fix them well in

the ground, upright, and about nine inches asunder; at first only four feet from the ground, and raised as the trees advance in height. Apples on <hi>paradise stocks</hi> best suit for espaliers in small gardens, and pears on <hi>quince stocks,</hi> as they maintain a small size; but they do not so well in espaliers as dwarf standards, being apt to decay by the cutting they must have: These dwarf stocks in general (at the best) do not however produce enduring trees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Espalier trees</hi> should rather be trained to <hi>sawed</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials properly framed together, smoothed and painted But for a year or two, they may be fastened to light stakes, when they will have formed a head, to begin to train them for bearing in the <hi>neat</hi> manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; i. e. to slips of deal joined to light oak posts as <hi>trellises.</hi> Whether the slips be placed perpendicularly, or longitudinally seem indifferent. If the longitudinal mode of training be the best approved, strong iron <hi>wire,</hi> may be recommended to run through the posts, instead of slips of wood, as it shades less and is stronger and neater. If upright slips are used, they should be slender, and from six to eight inches dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, according to the greater or less freedom of growth of the tree. The height may be also accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the tree, from five to six feet; and it will not answer to have them lower. Only a moderate length of <hi>trellis</hi> (on each hand) need be fixed at first, and so additions made as the tree ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends The posts may be about four feet asunder, the first on each hand, being two feet from the stem of the tree.</p>

                     <hi>Strawberries</hi> may be planted at the <hi>edges</hi> of borders and quarters, either in single or double rows, (rather the latter) for the convenience of gathering, and for ornament; but the common and best way is, in four feet <hi>beds,</hi> with eighteen inch or two feet alleys on which beds may be five rows of the <hi>wood</hi> and <hi>Alpine,</hi> four of the <hi>scarlet</hi> and <hi>pine-apple,</hi> three of the <hi>Carolina,</hi> and two of the <hi>Chili;</hi> setting the plants at the same distance in the rows, as the rows are from one another in what is called the <hi>quin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The best <hi>situation</hi> for strawberries is an open and sunny one, as thus they bear more, and finer flavoured fruit, but they are not very difficult. Some of the <hi>scarlets</hi> should be planted under warm walls to come early, and in a situation of little sun to come in late. The <hi>woods</hi> bear shade as natural to them, and the <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines</hi> do tolerably well in it: As lengthening the season of fruit is a desirable circumstance; for these three sorts (at least) the situation should be various.</p>
                  <p>The most proper <hi>time</hi> for planting the strawberry is the <hi>first</hi> moist weather in <hi>September,</hi> (or even earlier) that they may be established in the ground before winter, and they will bear the better the first year: Frost is apt to throw up late planted ones, and injures, if not destroys them.

                     </gap>; but in this case, a greater distance should be allowed them at planting.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>alpine</hi> sort be planted on a warm border, eighteen inches asunder, and suffered to spread, the young <hi>runners</hi> will produce fruit the same year, and sometimes this <hi>prolific</hi> strawberry bears till <hi>November.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fresh <hi>plantations</hi> of strawberries should be made every fourth year, though in a good soil, and with good management they will continue longer; so that where they are suffered to <hi>run,</hi> the plants being frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and old ones removed, beds have borne tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for ten years. Some gardeners insist that this spreading mode is the best way of cultivating the straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry. In a <hi>dry</hi> season, such full covered beds have the advantage; but in a <hi>wet</hi> one, the fruit is apt to rot, though still in such a season, it is cleaner than from plants growing in an open way; but this carries the appearance, and rather argues neglected culture. See the sections, <hi>nursery, pruning,</hi> and <hi>fruits.</hi> The method of keeping them in <hi>detached</hi> plants produces the largest and best ripened fruit, and on the whole is preferable; for this practice there cannot be a stronger argument than that those follow it who cultivate the strawberry for sale.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>watering</hi> of strawberries should not be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doing it almost daily, when in flower and setting their fruit, if the weather proves dry, particularly to those under a warm wall; but this is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued when the fruit is towards ripening, which would spoil the flavour, and dispose them to decay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Flowering Shrubs</hi> may be dispersed about, and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baceous <hi>perennial flowers;</hi> but plant them not too near the edge, lest they hang over the walks: The <hi>bulbous</hi> sorts may however be within six inches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Asparagus</hi> and <hi>artichokes</hi> should be thought of, but they take up much room, and in <hi>small</hi> gardens may therefore be left out. It will be of little use to have
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035770_0053_1006BAB26240A570"/>
less than fifty or sixty feet of <hi>asparagus</hi> beds, as there would be so few heads to cut at a time; and <hi>artichokes</hi> must be planted wide, or they will not grow large and fleshy, in which their merit consists.</p>
                  <p>Let not <hi>pot herbs</hi> be forgot, but provide a general <hi>herbary</hi> in that part of the garden which is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the kitchen.</p>
                  <p>Having spoken of <hi>stationary</hi> things, the <hi>routine</hi> of the <hi>seasons</hi> must dictate the rest; and the inclinations of the palate will refresh the memory to take care of providing the most necessary and agreeable <hi>esculents</hi> and <hi>herbs.</hi>

                     <hi>Perennial flowers</hi> have been mentioned; but let <hi>fancy</hi> direct as many <hi>annuals,</hi> and <hi>biennials</hi> to be cultivated, as room can conveniently be found for, that the garden may be well ornamented.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>furnishing</hi> a garden with <hi>shrubs</hi> and <hi>flowers,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect should be had to their usual <hi>height,</hi> their <hi>bulk, colour</hi> and <hi>season,</hi> that the mixture may be properly varied, appear harmonious to the eye, and come in regular succession, throughout the year; the <hi>latter</hi> end of which is seldom provided for so well as it might be with <hi>late</hi> flowers, which should be set in warm situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, as their proper place. In the most dreary months, by judicious planting, <hi>evergreens</hi> in their neat and cheerful "winter liveries," may be viewed from our windows, and serve instead of flowers.</p>
                  <p>Those who garden upon a <hi>large</hi> scale, should take care to have every thing proper and convenient lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally provided for the work. Let there be a well situated place for <hi>hot-beds,</hi> with some building as a <hi>tool house,</hi> and (if dry) for keeping <hi>bulds, seeds,</hi> and <hi>herbs.</hi> A <hi>house</hi> also on the spot, for the <hi>gardener</hi> to reside in, is desirable on many accounts, where there is much to look after: Those also who garden upon a small scale will do well to have <hi>every</hi> needful imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>water</hi> can be introduced, and kept <hi>clean</hi> with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent banks around it, it would be found very useful

                     <hi>Mixed Gardening,</hi> as comprehending the useful with the sweet—the profitable with the pleasant, has been the subject hitherto, but if the <hi>flower garden</hi> and the <hi>kitchen garden</hi> are to be distinct things, the case is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; yet not so much, but that still the <hi>kitchen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> should be adorned with a sprinkling of the more ordinary decorations, to skirt the quarters, which should be chiefly those of the most powerful sweet scents, as <hi>roses, sweet-briars,</hi> and <hi>honey-suckles, wall flowers, pinks, minionette,</hi> &amp;c. in order to counteract the coarser effluvia of vegetables, or (perchance) of dead leaves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>flower garden</hi> (properly so called) should be rather <hi>small</hi> than large; and if a portion of ground be separately appropriated for this, only the <hi>choicest</hi> gifts of <hi>Flora</hi> should be introduced, and no trouble spared to cultivate them in the <hi>best</hi> manner. The beds of this garden should be narrow, and consequently the walks numerous; and not more than one half or two thirds the width of the beds, except one principal walk all round, which may be a little wider. The gravel (or whatever the walks are made of) should lie about four inches below the edge. The beds for <hi>tulips, hyacinths, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <hi>Chinese<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> manner) an assemblage of all sorts of flowers, in a fancy spot of about sixty feet square, is a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful home source of pleasure, that still deserve to be countenanced. There should be neat <hi>edgings</hi> of <hi>box</hi> to these beds, or rather of <hi>boards,</hi> to keep up the mould. See, <hi>Of Edgings,</hi> in the miscellaneous section.</p>
                  <p>An ORCHARD may be spoken of here; i. e. a spot to plant <hi>standard trees</hi> in, which are forbidden a place in the garden; but it must not be a small spot. The front row, should be <hi>half</hi> standards, and before these may be a row of <hi>dwarfs;</hi> observing to plant the most <hi>towering</hi> sorts of the <hi>full</hi> standards behind. The ground should be dug thoroughly as low as the proper soil is, and if not naturally good, let it be improved by <hi>dung</hi> duly rotted, and worked well in a full spade. In a strong soil <hi>time</hi> should make a part of the manure. If the ground be naturally uneven, it will not be proper to level it, as this would rob the higher parts, and needlessly enrich the lower. A strong cool soil does best for an <hi>orchard,</hi> but it must not be wet. If it holds up water, it should be well drained by trenches, for the roots of trees will not endure to be sudden, without sickening the branches, and eventually bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on death by cankering, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A piece of ground designed for an <hi>orchard,</hi> would be greatly improved by first cultivating it as a <hi>kitchen garden</hi> for a year or two, manuring well at the time: Or, give it a good tillage; let it have a winter's frost, by deep trenching into high ridges, turned over in spring, and summer fallowed. The trees being planted, at proper distances, the ground may be kept under some sort of crops, for several years to come, with proper dressing. In a large orchard, the plough may be used for <hi>corn, potatoes,</hi> &amp;c. It the soil is poor, every opportunity should be taken to give it a little
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035770_0056_1006BABF1988C228"/>
manure, that there may be proper food prepared for the roots, as they extend. No doubt many orchards would bear much better if the whole ground (as the roots extend far) were before winter dug or ploughed over every second, or third year, and dressed, by dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in some rotten dung, or sprinkling over the whole (when rough dug) foot and pigeons' dung, or that of any other poultry; this will wash in by rains and snows, and do much good. Or if an orchard were ploughed, or rough dug, every year, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall of the leaf without manuring, it would be very beneficial; for it is not advisable to give trees <hi>much</hi> manure.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>thinning</hi> of the branches of orchard trees, by an occasional use of the saw, bill, chizzel, or knife, should not be neglected, that the air may have free course, and the sun access among the branches: This is more especially necessary in thick planted orchards, and the benefit of proper pruning is very great, though much neglected. See <hi>Pruning of Standards,</hi> Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion XII.</p>
                  <p>To succeed well, <hi>apples</hi> and <hi>pears</hi> should be planted from thirty to forty feet asunder, and <hi>cherries</hi> and <hi>plums</hi> from twenty to thirty, according to the richness of the land. The <hi>walnut</hi> should be rather planted singly; but if in a number together, ought to be forty feet asunder for <hi>fruit,</hi> and thirty for <hi>timber.</hi> See <hi>Nursery.</hi> These distances appear great, but it is necessary, as after a course of years will be found evident. See <hi>planting</hi> and <hi>pruning,</hi> Sect. 9, 12.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>intermediate</hi> ground is not cultivated, as before recommended, some sort of fruit or forest trees may be planted, to be removed in time; or currants, gooseber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. it may be kept also in grass, the trees thorned, and small cattle turned in: which grass, as it will come early, will be found particularly useful to those who have a stock of cattle. On this subject, it may not be amiss to give the instructions of one of our best gardeners.</p>

It is an error (says he) to let <hi>turf</hi> cover the surface of the ground in an orchard. The trees should be at such distances, that a <hi>plough</hi> may go between them, and in that case the trees thrive every way better; the breaking of the ground serves as a manure without its rankness, and the <hi>sun</hi> and <hi>air</hi> have free passage, which is very essential to the good taste and well ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fruit. Where the plough cannot be used, dig the ground a full spade deep, picking out the roots of weeds.</p>
                  <p>The best <hi>manure</hi> for an orchard, is a mixture of two parts dung and one part coal-soot. Let this be blended carefully, and spread all over the ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the trees, not piled up in heaps just about their stems, according to the old practice.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>cultivation</hi> of the ground about the trees in an orchard, is more neglected than any other part of the gardener's business, yet there is not any thing more necessary: The industry of man in <hi>tillage</hi> gives the earth in fields its great fertility, and why should it be denied in an orchard. <hi>Hill.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>cultivation</hi> of a garden includes the doing all those things that are necessary, in order to a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and prolific <hi>production</hi> of the various vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, fruits and flowers, we are disposed to propagate.</p>
                  <p>

The <hi>soil</hi> must be first attended to, always to keep the fruit borders in heart, and the quarters in a proper <hi>state</hi> for use, when called upon to receive either seeds or plants. Ground should never lie long without stirring; and if all is so well as might be, or not, it must be borne with; but the soil of a garden <hi>should</hi> have a <hi>free, sweet</hi> and <hi>rich</hi> soil, by proper digging, &amp;c. or no great things can be done, as to forward, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, or well-flavoured productions. It should be <hi>free,</hi> that the roots of plants may not be impeded in the quest of food; <hi>sweet</hi> that the food may be wholesome; and <hi>rich</hi> that there may be no defect of nutriment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trenching</hi> the vacant ground in a garden, does good to all soils in the <hi>autumn</hi> and <hi>winter</hi> seasons, and that in proportion to its strength, being indispensibly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for clays: The light soils may do (perhaps) as well by being only <hi>rough</hi> dug, which is a method that stronger soils may be also benefited by. The <hi>soil</hi> would be still farther improved, by retrenching, or rough digging, once or twice in the winter, if the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offers, particularly if strong or stubborn.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>manure</hi> is applied, let not the ground be <hi>glutted</hi> with dung; for a little at a time, well-rotted, is sufficient, so that it comes often enough, as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and the nature of the cropping may dictate. It is indeed a sort of <hi>rule</hi> with gardeners, that ground should be dunged every second year; but circumstances may make more or less of it necessary, and rules should never be <hi>indiseriminately</hi> applied. If dung is pretty well reduced, as it were to earth, much less will do, and let it not be buried too deep; but if it is otherwise, lay it low, to be dug upwards another time, when it is more consumed.</p>
                  <p>It is an <hi>excellent</hi> way of manuring, especially where the superficial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035770_0059_1006BACD9CBA4368"/>
dug before the manure is put on, or forked in a little afterwards. This method is particularly to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended where crops of <hi>onions, leeks,</hi> and such super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial rooting plants are to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dung</hi> is often, but should never be used in great quantities, and lie in lumps, which bread worms, grubs, and insects, and make plants grow two rampant and rank flavoured. <hi>Carrots</hi> it cankers, and it disagrees with many things; it is apt also to make the ground parch, and burn the crops sown upon it in a hot sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. On these accounts some persons have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to dress their gardens <hi>only</hi> with good fresh earth; which, if they do not overcrop, will do very well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompained with good <hi>tillage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vegetables</hi> are always <hi>sweeter,</hi> the less dung is used, and little need be used, when the natural soil is good and deep; for the earth may be so dug, that what is at the top one year may be at the bottom the next; which is a <hi>manoeuvre</hi> evidently advantageous, as a good part of the strength of the top soil, is constantly wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downwards: The method just recommended, of letting dung lie on the surface for a time is good also, as it abates the rankness of it.</p>
                  <p>If the ground is in proper <hi>heart,</hi> every spot may be contrived to be <hi>constantly</hi> and successfully cropped. The common gardeners about <hi>London,</hi> and other great towns, who give high rents for their land, contrive (manuring well) a <hi>succession</hi> of crops, one under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very dexterously; and this sort of conduct should be imitated by private persons; and thus a little spot, in skilful and industrious hands, shall be much more productive than a much greater under contrary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement.</p>
                  <p>A caution must however be observed, that plants do not grow so <hi>crowding</hi> thick as to defeat the end in view; and <hi>fruit borders</hi> must not be <hi>much</hi> cropped, furnishing them chiefly with small plants, of short du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and superficial growth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="unknown:035770_0060_1006BAD3C0E16338"/>
In the occupation of ground, the <hi>change</hi> of crops will be proper, as each sort of plant draws a <hi>somewhat</hi> different nourishment: so that after a full crop of one thing, one of another kind may often be immediately sown; but it should be contrived that a wide crop may follow a close one, and contrariwise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Close crops,</hi> as onions, leeks, carrots, &amp;c. are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently and neatly cultivated in <hi>beds</hi> of from four to five feet widths, with alleys of a foot to eighteen inches between them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>seasons</hi> proper for furnishing the ground with every particular vegetable, should be well attended to, that each may be obtained as <hi>early</hi> as its nature will permit; and of the <hi>seeds</hi> and <hi>plants</hi> we use, care must be taken to procure the <hi>best</hi> of the kind, lest after all the trouble of cultivation, disappointment as to quality should ensue.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>quantity</hi> sown and planted is (in a degree) to be determined by the portion of ground that can be spared; but it should be always a <hi>rule,</hi> to sow and plant <hi>more</hi> than probably enough, as more may happen to be wanted than expected; and a cross season or other accident, may occasion disappointment. As exact rules cannot be laid down, the exercise of a little <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> will be necessary, in order to <hi>proportion</hi> crops aright; for to have too much of one thing, and too little of another, is very disagreeable. Attention should be particularly paid to cultivate those things that are most generally called for, or approved, having respect to the natural duration of crops, some going off soon, and others being lasting, and that too according to the season they are propagated in. See, <hi>Of Propagation,</hi> in the next section.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>plants</hi> should be adapted as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the <hi>soil</hi> and <hi>situation</hi> which best suits them; for in the same garden some difference will be found, not only as to sun and shelter, but quality of the earth.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035770_0061_1006BAD59D5ED838"/>
Some parts of the garden will be richer, some poorer, some deeper of good mould, some shallower, and some (perhaps) heavier, some lighter; in due attention to which, the gardener will reap advantage.</p>
                  <p>Let the ground be <hi>well dug,</hi> broke thoroughly with the spade, and properly levelled, when it is to receive seeds or plants; and let no trouble be ever spared in doing any thing that is understood as at all necessary, and proper to be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Weeding</hi> in time is a material thing in culture, and <hi>stirring</hi> the ground about plants, as also <hi>earthing up,</hi> where necessary, must be attended to. Breaking the surface will keep the soil in <hi>health;</hi> for when it lies in a <hi>hard</hi> or bound state, enriching showers run off, and the salubrious air cannot enter. Weeds exhaust the strength of the ground, and if they are suffered to seed and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Deep <hi>hoeing</hi> is a good practice, as it gives a degree of fertility to the earth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>thinning</hi> of seedling crops is a very necessary thing to be done in <hi>time,</hi> before the young plants have drawn one another up too much, by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weak and out of form, and sometimes never do well afterwards. All plants grow stronger, and ripen their juices better, when the air circulates freely round them, and the sun is not prevented from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate influence; an attention to which should be
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035770_0062_1006BADFC143D270"/>
paid from the first appearance of plants breaking ground.</p>
                  <p>In thinning <hi>close</hi> crops, as <hi>onions, carrots, turnips,</hi> &amp;c. be sure that they are not left too near, for instead of reaping a greater produce, there would assuredly be a less. When they stand too close, they will make tall and large tops, but are prevented swelling in their roots: better to err on the <hi>wide</hi> side, for though there are fewer plants they will be finer.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>pricking</hi> and <hi>planting</hi> out of crops, be sure to do it as <hi>early</hi> as may be; and always allow <hi>room</hi> enough for this work; and being thus treated, vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables will come forwarder, larger, and of a superior flavour. These advantages are seen in all things, but in <hi>lettuces</hi> particularly, which often have not half the room allowed them they should.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Over cropping</hi> is of bad consequence also to the ground, robbing it of strength to no purpose, except increasing the dunghill; it makes it also inconvenient to weed, rake and clean the ground round about them, which in a <hi>private</hi> garden at least it is proper frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do: So that while attention is paid to make the <hi>most</hi> of a piece of ground, care must be taken, that the contrary is not in <hi>fact</hi> the consequence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dibble planting,</hi> as being easy and expeditious, is the common way of setting out plants by; but (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept indeed quite small ones) they are best put in by a spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Watering</hi> is a thing of some importance in cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not so much as some make it. It is a most point indeed, whether more harm than good is not <hi>

necessary in a dry season. In a large garden, it is an <hi>Herculean</hi> labour to water every thing, and so the temptation generally prevails either wholly to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, or to do it irregularly or defectively. To wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothing is too much on the dry side: but there is such a thing as watering <hi>too</hi> much which spoils the flavour, and makes vegetables less wholesome.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>watering</hi> will assuredly benefit some things; as (sparingly) new planted trees, flowers and vegetables. Watering is of use to settle the earth about the roots of plants newly set, and it is by a close union, (as it were) of the earth with them, that they prosper. The watering of new planted things may be to be repeated, but it should not be done <hi>too</hi> often, as it is then apt to sicken, and rot the young fibres of the roots. As soon as they are believed to have got hold of the ground, desist from watering. When any plant is towards <hi>flowering</hi> then moisture is more necessary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shading</hi> of new planted things, particularly flowers, is of much benefit, and that in proportion as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son is sunny. As a little water in a cloudy time, does much good, the imitating a cloud by a shade, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proper, and frequently necessary to the life of the plant, as neglecting this business has frequently proved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strawberries</hi> and <hi>cauliflowers</hi> are generally watered in a dry season; that is the strawberries when in bloom to set the fruit, and the cauliflowers when they shew fruit, in order to swell the head. In a light soil this ought particularly to be done. In very dry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, early <hi>turnips, carrots, radishes,</hi> and <hi>small-sallads,</hi> will need watering. <hi>Slips, cuttings,</hi> and <hi>layers</hi> of any kind will need water. <hi>Pots</hi> of flowers must have it frequently.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>watering</hi> is undertook, let it be a <hi>complete</hi> business; i. e. to the bottom and extent of the roots, as much as may be. The wetting only of the surface of the ground is of little use, and of some certain
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035770_0064_1006BAE50F924460"/>
harm, as it binds and cracks the ground, and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the benefit of showers, dews, air and sun, from entering the soil, and benefitting the roots as they otherwise would do. Wetting the surface of the ground, (however) in a summer's evening, as it makes a cool atmosphere, a dew is formed, which pervades the leaves, and helps to fill their exhausted vessels again.</p>
                  <p>Watering the roots of <hi>wall-trees</hi> (if dry weather) when the fruit is setting, is by some thought necessary. The way to do this effectually, is to make a few holes at some distance from the tree with a smooth sharp pointed stake, the better to let the water down; but this may wound the roots, and should only be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed in a light soil, and <hi>very</hi> dry season. To young trees only it can be of use for the roots of the old ones run far and wide; and it is the small fibres of these distant roots, on which the tree chiefly depends for food. <hi>Vines</hi> should have no water till they are off blossom. (<hi>July</hi>) and the fruit as big as pin's heads; and then if the season be very hot and dry, watering the roots (if the soil is warm as it ought to be) twice a week will help the fruit to swell.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>engine</hi> to water the leaves of vines, and all other wall trees in a summer evening, refreshes them much and helps to rid the trees and wall of insects and filth. Late in the summer, when the nights begin to get cold it is time to leave off all watering, except things in <hi>pots</hi> and <hi>frames</hi> which should have it then only in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As watering is apt to make ground hide bound and unsightly, let the surface be occasionally stirred and raked, which will make future waterings enter the ground the better: when the ground is hard on the top, the water runs away from its proper place, and half the labour is lost. Many things are impatient of being kept wet about the shanks, and therefore water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be generally at a little distance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>quality</hi> of water used for refreshing plants, is a material thing, and it is very various in its nature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035770_0065_1006BAE95377FA70"/>
to the peculiar earths and mineral substances, that it passes through. <hi>Rain</hi> water is by far the best, as appears by the verdure and vivacity it gives: It is nourishing as being full of vegetable food, and free from metallic impregnations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>River</hi> water is next in fitness, and pond water fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows if it is sweet. <hi>Well</hi> water is of least account, though circumstances occasion its use the most. So that in forming a judgment concerning watering, it is not simply to be considered, whether plants should be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; but whether with <hi>well</hi> water and that too from a pump. Pump water if used directly (to say nothing of its hardness) it is so <hi>cold</hi> in summer, that the roots feel an extreme sensation; for as they are then warm, through a lively fermentation in the earth, extreme cold so contracts their vessels, that they perform their proper offices with difficulty, and become consequently diseased.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hard</hi> water is softened by throwing in a little earth, and rather that of a <hi>loamy</hi> nature, which will greatly fit it for use. Some persons keep <hi>cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At any rate, however, let hard water stand exposed to the <hi>sun</hi> and <hi>air,</hi> as long as may be; a few hours will improve it, but a few days will better qualify it for vegetation.</p>
                  <p>Water is sometimes <hi>enriched</hi> with dungs and salts. Some experiments of putting a small quantity of <hi>nitre</hi> into water to keep flowers flourishing in phials, and rooted plants in pots, have been reported to prove beneficial. That courser way of impregnating water with <hi>dungs</hi> may be useful to pots of plants that are too full of roots, or to any thing growing in a poor soil; but the water should not be made <hi>too</hi> rank, or suffered to touch the leaves. <hi>Sheep's-dung</hi> is that which has been used for the purpose, and is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, though others may do. Let the <hi>rule</hi> be, to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035770_0066_1006BAEB0A15C980"/>
impregnate the water about an equivalent to an ounce of sea salt to a gallon: A stronger mixture might do mischief.</p>
                  <p>The MANAGEMENT of a garden as somewhat distinct from the cultivation of it, is an object of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; i. e. to keep it in such ORDER, that it may not offend the eye, or fail in those general impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>pleasure</hi> it is capable of affording, when things are shewn in their <hi>best</hi> manner.

                  <p>It is too <hi>sordid</hi> a way of persuing gardening to have nothing farther in view than the gratification of the <hi>palate.</hi> To do every thing (especially in a large gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) that ought, or might be done, with a view to have it in the greatest state of perfection, will indeed occasion no little trouble; but the true <hi>taste</hi> for gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening, does not admit of complaint on this head, and will do (at least) what it <hi>can</hi> to make all agreeable and inviting; for surely a green meadow, or a ploughed field, are pleasanter objects than a garden that is <hi>not</hi> in tolerable order.</p>
                  <p>In order to be <hi>neat,</hi> weeding must be industriously followed up, and all litter that is made in working, quickly carried off. The ground also should be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently stirred and raked between crops, and over the borders, to give all a <hi>fresh</hi> appearance. There is a pleasantness to the eye in new broken earth: and when there are no flowers left in the borders, this gives an air of culture, and is always agreeable. This observation is particularly meant to apply in <hi>autumn,</hi> that the garden may not become dreary <hi>too</hi> soon, and so bring on winter before its time. An <hi>Asparagus fork</hi> is expeditious and useful in this case. Vegetables
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035770_0067_1006BAF3D5A09B18"/>
and flowers should be <hi>supported</hi> in time; and in form, by <hi>earthing up,</hi> or by proper <hi>ties</hi> to sticks.</p>
                  <p>Trees and shrubs should be constantly freed from suckers and dangling shoots, and wall trees ought to be regularly kept in order agreeable to the directions in the section, <hi>On pruning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let <hi>gravel walks</hi> be kept free from <hi>weeds</hi> and <hi>moss</hi> and often swept and rolled as they may require. If there is quantity of gravel enough in the walks to relay, or turn them up every spring, or once in two years, it will thoroughly clean, and make them appear lively. <hi>Moss</hi> may be either scraped off with a trowel, or some such instrument, or rather rubbed off by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated strokes of a broom not quite new.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grass plats</hi> and walks should be mowed, as often as there is the <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ast</hi> hold for the scythe, for they lose much of their beauty, when the grass gets any thing long; leaves should not be suffered to remain on them as it stains the grass.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edgings</hi> of all sorts should be kept in good order and repair, as having a singular neat effect in the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a garden. The dead edgings will sometimes, and the live edgings often want putting to rights; either cutting, clipping, or making up complete. Where there are no edgings, or but weak ones, let the border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the walks be kept <hi>firm,</hi> and now and then worked up by a line in moist weather, beating it smooth with the spade. See <hi>Section</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>fruits</hi> may need support, by tying their weak branches when they get heavy, to stakes, &amp;c. Rows of <hi>raspberries,</hi> and <hi>beans</hi> are kept neatly up in their lines, by putting in here and there a stake, and using packthread lengthwise; and thus will they bear better fruit, and be more conveniently gathered. <hi>Strawberries</hi> of fine heavy sorts, will be preserved from getting dirty and rotten, by tying their stems of fruit to little sticks; by this practice the fruit also gets better ripened, and of a finer flavour: Some persons lay tiles, or moss round the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035770_0068_1006BAF5C7ED9E08"/>
plants, but this is not (generally) so well, only it has the advantage in keeping the ground cooler in a hot season.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Flowers</hi> should be particularly seen to, to <hi>tie</hi> up, and <hi>trim</hi> off dead and dangling parts. Some of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do without support, and many sorts are made more secure and beautiful by proper ties. If this business is neglected, perhaps a heavy rain, or strong wind comes and lays all prostrate, especially about the <hi>equinoctial</hi> seasons: but even their own weight will often bring flowers down.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>sticks</hi> used for flowers, should be of smooth wood, as <hi>hazle</hi> or <hi>sallow,</hi> or of neat painted slips of <hi>deel,</hi> with or without an ornamental head; white is the best colour, on account of its contrast with the leaves. New <hi>bass</hi> wetted, soft <hi>packthread,</hi> or green <hi>yarn</hi> are proper for the ties, which should be twisted first round the stick, and then round the flower: let the ends of the string be cut off close. The sticks should have smooth and sharp points, otherwise they may damage the roots, and will not hold so fast in the ground; thurst them in as far from the stem as conveniently may be, and let attention be paid to <hi>bulbous roots</hi> not to go so near as to wound them. Do not think of forcing all the branches of a large bushy head to a single stick; but let two or more be used, as may appear necessary, observing that there is something of an equality of size in the sticks used to the same flower.</p>
                  <p>Some persons are very <hi>incurious</hi> about their flower sticks, which may rather be called <hi>stakes,</hi> even when applied to the smaller sort of flowers. Sticks may also be too weak for large ones, and a due <hi>proportion</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to propriety and neatness.</p>
                  <p>It has been said, by a great gardener, that the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port given to flowers, should be a <hi>concealed</hi> business, and therefore, if this idea is adopted, the sticks should be no taller, than that the head of the plant may cover
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035770_0069_1006BAF9483A7200"/>
them when full grown: In order to do this work the more completely, they ought to be painted green</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decaying flowers</hi> should be timely trimmed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and <hi>perennials</hi> should be regularly freed from the parts running to <hi>seed,</hi> (except so much as may be wanted) as the production of seeds weakens the root much; sometimes even causing death, and thus many curious perennials have been lost, especially the first year of planting them. To <hi>preserve</hi> any particular sort therefore, let the stems be cut down as soon as the flowers appear to be going off, or to secure the root in strength, let them not flower at all the first year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decaying vegetables</hi> are offensive, and the kitchen garden ought to be attended to, that every thing of the kind may be removed out of sight or smell. Thus <hi>may</hi> all in this department, being under industrious and judicious management, strike the eye as agreeably as a flower garden, the idea of <hi>usefulness</hi> stamping a value on the neatness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vegetables</hi> prematurely spindling, and superfluous ones, sprouts, &amp;c. running for seed, should not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to continue in the ground (as they too often are) to exhaust its strength, as well as offend the eye.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>management</hi> of a garden (summarily speaking) consists in <hi>attention</hi> and <hi>application;</hi> the first should be of that wary and provident kind, as not only to do well in the present, but for the future; and the latter should be of that diligent nature as (willingly) <hi>"Never to defer that till to-morrow which may be done to-day:"</hi>—Procrastination is of serious consequence in <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening;</hi> and neglect of times and seasons will be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of disappointment and complaint. It will often happen, indeed, that a <hi>gardener</hi> cannot do what he <hi>would;</hi> but if he does not do what he <hi>can,</hi> he will be most justly blamed, and perhaps censured by none more than himself.</p>

                  <head>OF PROPAGATION.</head>
                  <p>PLANTS are propagated by <hi>seeds, suckers, slips, off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets, divisions, cuttings, layers,</hi> and <hi>graffs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>seed</hi> is the most general method of propagation, and plants raised any other way are seldom so fine. Those plants from seed which have never been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, are commonly handsomer, and come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder, than those that have been transplanted, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they were sown in a proper soil and situation.</p>
                  <p>As upon seed being right in kind and good in nature, depends the desired success, care should be taken to procure the best, and no temptation suffered to prevail for the use of an inferior kind, or of one only suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of being so, if it can be helped; for to cultivate a soil, and use a wrong or defective seed knowingly, is folly indeed!</p>
                  <p>The <hi>largest</hi> seed of the kind, plump and sound, is the best, being well ripened and kept from injuries of weather and insects; for, as the largest animals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the most profitable stock, so it is in vegetables; which directs the gardener always to save seed only from the forwardest and handsomest uninjured plants. As in animals the young may be stunted by bad man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, and defective food, so in vegetables, the seed being good will not be alone sufficient, if the soil and culture be not right.</p>
                  <p>Commonly speaking, <hi>new</hi> seed is to be preferred to old, as growing the more luxuriantly, and coming up the surer and quicker. This circumstance induces some private persons to save their own seed (a practice
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035770_0071_1006BB06B28B9EF8"/>
not altogether to be recommended) that they may not be <hi>deceived</hi> in buying old for new seed: But this trick of trade it is to be hoped is not practised by <hi>every</hi> seedsman: Yet a little mixture of <hi>old</hi> seed is sometimes proper, because the new is perhaps cut off, and the old saved, by being a day or two later in coming up.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>old</hi> seed is knowingly sown, some allowance in point of time must be made. <hi>Peas</hi> and <hi>beans</hi> of two years old, are by some preferred to new, as not likely to run to straw. And <hi>cucumbers</hi> and <hi>melons</hi> are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned best to be of <hi>several</hi> years age, in order to their shooting the less vigorously, and so becoming more fruitful, and take up less room: But this principle is maintained extravagantly by some gardeners, who say these seeds can hardly be <hi>too</hi> old, and will allow ten years to be within bounds; <hi>three</hi> for <hi>cucumbers,</hi> and <hi>four</hi> for melons however is best. As to the <hi>age</hi> of seeds, at which they <hi>may</hi> be sown and germinate, it is uncertain, and depends much <hi>how</hi> they are preserved. Seeds kept from the air and moisture by being buried deep in the ground will continue a great many years without corruption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peas</hi> and <hi>beans</hi> will germinate very well at seven years of age; but the seeds of <hi>lettuces</hi> and <hi>kidney</hi> beans, and some others are not to be depended upon after a year or two; and though generally speaking the smaller seeds are of the least duration, yet their maintenance of vegetative power must depend much upon the <hi>texture</hi> of the seed, with respect to its coat, and the oil it contains, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>saving</hi> seed, for the sake of saving money in the purchase, has not been found to answer well, in general with private persons, and is hardly to be recommended. Things running to seed give a garden a <hi>rude</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, often occupying ground that is wanted, and might be used to better purpose; and the case often is, that seeding plants (in private gardens) are <hi>neglected</hi> in some measure, or destroyed by birds, and come to little at last. Perhaps they are not saved from <hi>proper</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:035770_0072_1006BB087AF5DB58"/>
plants. It is a particular business to raise seeds for sale, and (generally) they are best had from those whose province it is to deal in them.</p>
                  <p>Against sowing our <hi>own</hi> seed, there is this to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that it is a received <hi>maxim</hi> to procure seeds of esculents from a different soil and situation, or at least to <hi>change</hi> them, as being apt to alter or degenerate, if repeatedly sown in the same place. Seed produced on <hi>warm</hi> land is disposed to come early, but by this means (in proportion to its dryness) prematurely, so that the plants produce but few flowers. Seed from <hi>cold</hi> land comes late, and in some seasons the plants do not well ripen their seed. <hi>Rich</hi> land produces seed, not abundantly, but too luxuriant in nature, and <hi>poor</hi> land gives weak seed; so that in these cases, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue sowing the seed produced on the same ground, is evidently not proper.</p>
                  <p>The only case where (on the whole) it is proper for private persons to save seed, is to secure that of any <hi>particular</hi> sort, that it is judged may not be got so true and good. Yet here perhaps the busy <hi>bee</hi> or <hi>wind</hi> may interfere, and disappoint expectation; for if there is any thing of the like kind in a neighbouring garden, these may carry the <hi>Farina</hi> of that to our charge, and contaminate it, so as to produce a spurious offspring, which is often experienced in the <hi>cabbage</hi> tribe. Now this cannot in a <hi>great</hi> degree happen with those who raise seed in extensive pieces of ground oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with the <hi>same</hi> sort of vegetable.</p>
                  <p>Those however who choose to save the seed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>vegetables,</hi> must propagate from fine forward plants, secure them from rocking about, when they get tall and heavy guard against birds, gather them as they ripen, and keep them dry. <hi>Flowers,</hi> it may be proper to save the seed of, and it is little trouble. The sorts may thus be better depended on, and the small quantity wanted of each kind makes it hardly worth while to buy, if we can raise them ourselves, or get them of a

friend. It should be a rule for <hi>flower seeds</hi> in general to be fresh from year to year; though if kept dry, and from much air, many sorts will grow that are older: Flower seeds are kept well in vials.</p>
                  <p>Seeds may be <hi>forwarded</hi> for sowing by various ways of procuring a germination before they are put into the ground. In <hi>summer</hi> it has not been unusual, to <hi>steep</hi> both <hi>broad</hi> and <hi>kidney beans</hi> in soft water, or milk and water, about twenty-four hours, to forward their growth, and to ascertain their vitality. If the ground is <hi>very</hi> dry when these seeds are committed to it, either steeped or not, it is a good way to make drills or trenches to plant them in, watering them well first, and then pressing the seed in a little way. Any sort of the <hi>broad beans,</hi> or even <hi>peas,</hi> may be forwarded, when ground is not for the present ready, by laying them in damp mould, in a garden pot, or otherwise, a layer of earth, and a layer of seeds, &amp;c. and they may be put into trenches (with care) when the radicle has got some considerable length, the mould being light, and the work finished by a gentle watering.</p>
                  <p>The smaller seeds, as <hi>carrots,</hi> &amp;c. may be prepared for sowing, by simply mixing them in a little moist sand, or fine earth, taking care that they do not lie longer than the usual time of their beginning to sprout: but this practice should only be adopted for seeds that are long in coming up, and then there is some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in having them to sow in a state ready for rooting immediately, on fresh dug earth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>season</hi> for committing seeds to the ground, is that as <hi>early</hi> a time as the nature of the plant to be cultivated will bear; for the forward productions, which come without forcing, are the best as to size and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, if they meet with no material check from weather. It is the proper <hi>ambition</hi> of gardeners also, to have some of the first of each kind of vegetables and fruits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="unknown:035770_0074_1006BB11697B6E38"/>
Let this direction for <hi>early</hi> sowing be understood, not only of <hi>spring,</hi> but <hi>autumn</hi> crops; that the plants designed for winter use, or to stand for spring, may be strong, and well established in the ground: Though for those designed for <hi>spring,</hi> it is advisable to have two or three different sowings; for <hi>lettuces</hi> (as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) that are forward, will sometimes rot, when backward plants shall do well.</p>
                  <p>To be <hi>sure</hi> of a crop, and in some things a <hi>succession</hi> of crops, various sowings should be made through the year, at all times that are not too unnatural as to season; for it is an object in gardening, not only to have early and late productions, but never to be without what <hi>may</hi> be produced. Every sowing that is made (the early in particular) should be <hi>noticed</hi> in time, whether it is likely to succeed, that the work may be repeated, if there is like to be a failure. But a little <hi>caution</hi> is necessary, that this business be not <hi>over</hi> done; for though there may seem to be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient distance of time in sowing for <hi>succession</hi> crops; yet they tread sometimes upon the heels of one another so <hi>fast</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sowings</hi> should be generally performed on <hi>fresh</hi> dug, or stirred ground. The digging should therefore be done as near the time designed to <hi>sow</hi> as can be. There is a <hi>

If the ground, indeed, turns up <hi>raw,</hi> or wet (as early in the spring it is apt to do) a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time must be allowed it to dry, and so also if rain falls first.

It is to be observed, however, that sowing in <hi>dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The proper <hi>depth</hi> at which seed should be sown, is to be carefully observed: if <hi>too</hi> deep, they will either rot or not vegetate or thrive well; and if too shallow, they are liable to be injuriously affected by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The smaller the seed, the finer should the soil be, and the less also the covering; so that, while some (as the seed of <hi>celery</hi> is to be but barely covered, others, as <hi>peas</hi> and <hi>beans</hi>) may have a depth of two, three, or four inches. But some regard is to be had to the <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>soil:</hi>—in a warm season, and light soil, sow deeper, and in a cool season, and strong soil sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is not generally advisable to sow <hi>several</hi> sorts of seed on the <hi>same</hi> spot, as some persons are accustomed

to do; for though the gardeners about <hi>London</hi> follow the practice; profit is their great object, and not neatness or propriety. On the same piece, they sow <hi>radishes, lettuces</hi> and <hi>carrots;</hi> the radishes are drawn young for the table, the lettuces to plant out, and a sufficient crop of carrots is left, for carrots should not be very near to grow big: this is as reasonable a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as any that is made; but still, if not short of ground, each kind separate will be found best. In defence of this mode of culture, it is said, if one crop <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ails, the others may do, and there is no loss of ground or time; and if all succeed they do very well. <hi>Radishes</hi> and <hi>spinach</hi> are commonly sown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the common gardeners, and many <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>res</hi> of inter-cropping are made by them as sowing, or planting between rows of vegetables that are wide asunder, or presently to come off, or in the alleys of things cultivated on beds. But this crowding mode of gardening will not be imitated by private families, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there is a want of room to bring in a proper suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of crops.</p>
                  <p>Some little things of this sort, however, ought to be done; as, suppose a piece of ground for <hi>horse-radish</hi> be new planted, it may be top-cropped with radishes or spinach, &amp;c. or if a piece of <hi>potatoes</hi> be planted <hi>wide,</hi> a bean may be put in between each set in every or every other row: a thin crop of <hi>onions</hi> upon new asparagus beds, is a common practice, drawing them young from about the plants.</p>
                  <p>The proper <hi>covering</hi> for seeds at broad cast being determined on, as to depth, let the ground lay the rougher, the deeper the seed is to be buried; and if it is to be scarcely covered, rake the ground first very level and fine. All seeds come up best when moderately pressed with the earth; for if they lie too lightly in contact with it, cold and drought more easily affect them, and when once seeds begin to germinate, they are impatient of both: If stopped in their vegetation,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035770_0077_1006BB1F59660788"/>
are quickly cut off. Thus, trampling seeds in, not only fixes them in their places, but tends to preserve them from injury by the weather. According to the <hi>depth</hi> it is intended to cover seeds, the feet should be set wider or nearer, i. e. the closer for the less covering. Begin to trample on the outside, walking regularly and steadily round the piece, till the middle be arrived at in the finish. This done, lay all immediately and neatly level with a wide rake, drawing off stones, &amp;c. but do it lightly, to avoid driving in the teeth of the rake, which would remove the seed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Patches,</hi> or small pieces, are sometimes sown with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trampling, particularly of <hi>flowers,</hi> by drawing some of the mould on one side, and then sowing and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper depth with what earth was drawn off, adding a little more, if necessary. In this case, if the soil is not heavy and wet, press the surface a little with the rake head, spade, or otherwise. Seeds sown in <hi>drill,</hi> or <hi>rows,</hi> should be pressed a little, especially if the soil be light; and even beans set by a <hi>dibble,</hi> are best to have the earth pressed about them with it, or afterwards with the rake head, and they will support themselves more erectly for it, for the least wind rocks them about in loose holes. In a light soil, the best way is to lay them in a trench, and trample them in.</p>
                  <p>Directions for <hi>thinning</hi> seedling crops, and pricking them out in time, were given in the last section. Let this business be done properly, and prick out enow, that there may be to spare: perhaps a neighbour may be obliged thereby, and at any rate it is best to have plenty, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>st accidents happen.</p>
                  <p>Propagation by <hi>suckers</hi> is a mode of culture rather peculiar to <hi>trees</hi> and <hi>shrubs.</hi> The things to be observed in this business are, to take them up with some care from the mother plant, so as not to injure its root, nor the sucker's own root, by pulling it up without prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly loosening it first. The earth should be moved aside by a trowel, and then the sucker cut off by a <hi>knife,</hi> and not with a <hi>spade,</hi> as is common. Of these
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035770_0078_1006BB252927B0B8"/>
hardy things that there is plenty of, this rough way does not signify much, as to the sucker; but it may injure the root too much that it comes from. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a root appears barked, the part below should be cut off. If it is desired to succeed well, in propagating by suckers, consider that all young roots are tender, let them be trimmed to form, and planted immediately, or at least let them be covered. Suckers that have poor roots, must have their heads reduced accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Propagation by <hi>slips</hi> is of two sorts, either from the <hi>root,</hi> or <hi>stem:</hi> and several sorts of <hi>flowers</hi> and <hi>herbs</hi> are increased this way. When from the <hi>roots</hi> (if the whole is not taken up) move the earth carefully aside, and slip off by a pressure of the thumb and finger, and be cautions of hurting the fibres of the slips, planting with fine and good mould about them. Take off slips from the <hi>stem</hi> carefully by a push of the thumb, and not too many from the same plant, as it is apt to injure the place a little by tearing off some of the wood. <hi>Slips</hi> from the stem are to be considered as <hi>cuttings,</hi> and treated accordingly. They take more certainly, and make better roots than cuttings; but are apt to injure the stem from whence they are taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Offset</hi> is a term sometimes applied to <hi>slips</hi> from fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous roots; but more properly so from <hi>bul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s</hi> roots, which put forth many offsets. These are slipped away at the time they are taken up for removal or replant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and commonly take two or three years before they bear flowers: dispose of them therefore in a <hi>nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,</hi> where they may remain undisturbed while they come to a flowering state.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Division</hi> of the roots is a way of propagating many sorts of plants. To this end (of course) they must be taken up, and then carefully pulled, or cut asunder with a sharp instrument; as the case may require. It is not safe, however, to divide such roots into very small pieces, (especially if cut), as then they are apt to die; but leave them of a size sufficient, not barely to secure life, but to form immediately a full and 
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035770_0079_1006BB2CCD698C48"/>
handsome head. The general season for thus <hi>splitting</hi> fibrous rooted plants, is <hi>October,</hi> but it may be done early in the spring.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cuttings</hi> of a variety of woody plants will grow, and many trees and shrubs are propagated this way; but their sap must be of a watery nature, as those plants that are gummy will not strike, (or rarely) though ever so much care is bestowed, or time allowed them. The texture of the wood of cuttings must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what soft, as hard wooded ones will not grow. Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings should be rather short than long, and kept <hi>steady</hi> in the ground. If they are planted where there is any likelihood of their being disturbed, they may be tied to a stick, well fastened in the ground.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>season</hi> for setting <hi>slips</hi> and <hi>cuttings</hi> is for some things summer, as <hi>wall-flowers</hi> and <hi>myrtles;</hi> and for most, from <hi>October</hi> to March, but (in general) the sooner the better. It has however been said (by Mr. Miller) that <hi>spring</hi> is the best time for all, and that the sap should be in motion first. This is at least true of some things, as cuttings of the <hi>vitex,</hi> or <hi>chaste tree,</hi> (though hardy) are found to do best in spring, and so all cuttings from plants of a delicate nature do.</p>
                  <p>Cuttings should be of well ripened wood, and have the earth pressed to them, the whole length that they are in the ground; i. e. from four to six inches. Cut them with a sharp knife slopewise, and plant in a good soil, and in a situation where they only have the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sun. They must be kept cool (not wet) by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional watering; but if set in fresh <hi>cow's dung,</hi> with about two inches of mould on the top, they will not need watering, and will strike freely, if the shoots are not <hi>too</hi> young and raw, or of too succulent a nature: Slips and cuttings should always be taken from the outside of plants, and be robust but not luxurious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laying</hi> of branches is a mode of propagation, that may be adopted for almost all forest trees, and several sorts of fruit trees and shrubs; i. e. all that will grow from cuttings, and many that will not. <hi>Layers</hi> are

                  <p>Let the ground about layers be kept <hi>cool</hi> by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional waterings, and laying some <hi>moss, turf, litter,</hi> or rather small <hi>pebbles</hi> about them, which will not harbour insects. The part out of ground, may be supported erectly by a tie to a stick. It is a good way to <hi>slit</hi> (with a sharp knife) the part at the peg as in <hi>corna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion layers,</hi> a little more than an inch; and some <hi>prick</hi> a few holes about the part (at a joint) with a blunt awl, to help the layer to strike root. For the <hi>hard</hi> woods, some gardeners make several slits, or chips, in the part layered in the earth, and bind the layer rather tight, just above it, with pliant wire; and <hi>soft</hi> wooded layers are sometimes twisted to crack the bark, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to help the part to strike quickly.</p>
                  <p>Where there are no branches low enough to be brought into the ground, (and it is not thought good to head down for the production of low shoots, or suckers) plants may be layered by fixing a broken <hi>pot,</hi> or a <hi>box,</hi> with a slit in the side, to the height necessary to lay in a branch. A branch also, if long enough, may be thrust through the hole of a garden pot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, then filled with earth, and supported by some contrivance, and shaded by some means, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watered. Take care not to break the buds in drawing it through the hole of the pot. By this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance rooted plants being procured in <hi>pots,</hi> may be turned out with the earth about their roots undisturbed.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035770_0081_1006BB344754FBD0"/>
A branch of a <hi>vine</hi> thus layered in <hi>November,</hi> may be next year cut off, when the <hi>fruit</hi> is ripe, and brought in the pot to <hi>table,</hi> before it is planted out.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>season</hi> for layers is (generally) the same as for cuttings, and some sorts will be well rooted in a year, but others will require two, and sometimes three years before they will be fit to be moved. Those, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that are <hi>slow</hi> to strike should be layered as soon as ever young shoots are forward enough, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be in <hi>July</hi> or <hi>August. Cut</hi> off the leaves of the part that goes into the ground, because such young wood will not bear stripping. For propagation of fruit tres by <hi>graffing,</hi> see the two next sections.</p>

grow, and to fruit, there is a sort of certainty of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that could not otherwise be had.</p>
                  <p>There is also a great advantage in raising trees, in a very <hi>material</hi> point, in an assurance of having fruit that we <hi>know</hi> we like, by getting graffs, or buds, from trees of which we have tasted and admired the fruit. If trees are, however, to be bought, it is reasonable to hope for better success, in procuring them from a nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery-man living <hi>northwards</hi> than southwards.</p>
                  <p>In a nursery, <hi>stocks</hi> may be raised for fruit trees, shrubs propagated by <hi>suckers, slips</hi> and <hi>cuttings,</hi> and flowers of the biennial and perennial sorts may be sown, bulbous offsets planted, and thus a <hi>stock</hi> may be readily provided for furnishing any part of the pleasure ground. For all, or some of these objects, a spot might be allotted, if it were only the corner of a garden.</p>
                  <p>Supposing even only a <hi>little</hi> spot is made use of for a few <hi>flowers, shrubs,</hi> &amp;c. let them be duly attended, to <hi>weed, thin, water, trim</hi> into form, <hi>support, shelter,</hi> and in short <hi>nurse,</hi> but yet not to bring any thing up tenderly, as too much, or long cover in winter, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to risk when it is taken away; the plants not being able to bear a moderately cold air. A low part of the garden that has not too much sun, is best for a little nursery; but it must not be overshaded with trees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suckers, slips</hi> and <hi>cuttings</hi> of any kind, should be attended to for forming a proper <hi>head;</hi> shortening the shoots, and keeping a clear stem below, and the roots free from suckers. Two years commonly fit <hi>suckers</hi> for planting out, and three years <hi>slips</hi> and <hi>cuttings.</hi> It is a good way, to fasten the two latter, if not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to sticks, that the wind, &amp;c. may not loosen them, and prevent their rooting.</p>
                  <p>Large plants, as young <hi>trees,</hi> &amp;c. should be tied to stakes well fixed, at first putting out for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. These should be seen to from time to time, that they remain fast; as also, the mats or cloths, that may have been put over hoops to shelter exotic seedlings,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035770_0083_1006BB40B8CCD520"/>
&amp;c. from heavy rains, or severe frosts, for the wind has great power over such coverings.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>soil</hi> of a nursery should be dry, free and in heart; but not <hi>much</hi> enriched with dung, left a rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of food give too great a freedom of growth, and a <hi>habit</hi> in the plants, which not being indulged by a like soil afterwards, disappointment ensue. A <hi>dungy</hi> soil also encourages worms and insects, to the injury of seedlings, and makes young plants more liable to be cut off in a sharp winter; too rank a soil also, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the juices of plants from being properly digested, and so they are less fruitful.</p>
                  <p>On ground designed to be sown, or planted in spring, if it needs refreshing, lay on a little well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed dung towards winter, as directed at page 46.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>nursery</hi> should be laid out into <hi>beds</hi> of about four feet wide, with <hi>alleys</hi> of about two; and thus all the work of it will be done conveniently, and the plants will have free air to strengthen them. In the alleys may be buried some dung, which will be at hand, and useful when <hi>consumed</hi> by time and turning over, to dress the beds as they may need it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stocks</hi> for graffing <hi>fruit,</hi> are raised from <hi>suckers</hi> of plums, cherries, codlins, crabs, pears and quinces; and sometimes from <hi>cuttings</hi> of codlins and quinces; but those stocks raised from <hi>seeds</hi> and <hi>stones</hi> are much best, if we consult freedom of growth. If <hi>sucker</hi> stocks grow ever so well, they are apt to put forth suckers, which is not only a troublesome circumstance, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausts a tree and prevents fruitfulness. It is to be understood, that the <hi>graff</hi> will (in some measure) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the nature of the <hi>stock;</hi> therefore soft, mealy fruit, ought to be propagated on austere stocks, and the contrary; tender, delicious fruits designed for <hi>forcing,</hi> should always be on smart stocks, or they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come insipid.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>crab stocks</hi> for apples are mostly used, yet the ripe black seed; of any other <hi>smart</hi> eating apple may be sown, either in autumn or spring Sow in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035770_0084_1006BB4303ECF588"/>
(<hi>October</hi> or <hi>November,</hi>) and if this sowing fails, the spring may be adopted towards the end of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi> At these times, the well ripened seeds of pears, or stones of plums, or cherries, may be sown. The stones of any sort of plum, produce stocks for apricots, peaches and nectarines; and though the <hi>white</hi> sorts are commonly preferred, the <hi>red wheat-plumb</hi> is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for the <hi>apricot;</hi> of <hi>black</hi> plums the <hi>muscle</hi> is the best.</p>
                  <p>Those <hi>seeds</hi> or <hi>stones</hi> that are saved early, or are to be kept through the winter for spring sowing, (which many prefer,) should be preserved from air in dry sand: Let them be put in a box layer upon layer, three or four courses, covering the top three inches, and guard against mice. Nuts, acorns and chesnuts are put in the ground at the same time, as also the seeds of various sorts of <hi>shrubs</hi> and <hi>forest trees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>sowing</hi> as to depth must be according to the size of the seed. The <hi>seeds,</hi> or kernels of apples and pears may be sown in <hi>drills</hi> a full inch deep, a foot asunder, and scattered thinly in them, pressing the ground a little to them; or sow at <hi>broad cast.</hi> But take care not to use the seeds of fruit that has grown on a <hi>hollow</hi> tree, for they will not vegetate. The <hi>stones</hi> of any fruit should be sown at near two inches depth; and <hi>nuts,</hi> &amp;c. at three or four. Stones and nuts must be set thin, and (it is of some advantage) the small end upwards, as here the shoot pushes out, or they may be laid flat. If the beds are sown all over, cover with mould previously drawn aside in the alleys; but drills have the neatest appearance, and some <hi>little</hi> use may be made of the spaces between them the first year.</p>
                  <p>Prepare the <hi>beds</hi> by digging the soils well to a full foot in depth, and let the surface be made fine: thus will the roots strike down freely to preserve themselves from drought, wet will drain away, and the young plant push strait upward: four feet beds are best.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="unknown:035770_0085_1006BB465804B650"/>
The <hi>enemies</hi> of seed beds must be guarded against, as poultry, birds, dogs, cats, mice and frost; the latter by covering lightly with pea haulm or wheat straw, and the former by furze, thorns, or brush wood, and traps. If any hares, or rabbits, get at a nursery, they make sad havock in sharp weather, by barking the young plants; therefore, guard against them, and larger animals by good close fences, which will also keep out sharp winds.</p>
                  <p>During the <hi>first</hi> year, they must be kept moderately cool, by <hi>watering</hi> in dry seasons, or laying <hi>moss,</hi> or some short litter, over the beds. And as to <hi>weeding,</hi> though they must not be smothered, yet some small weeds may be suffered to grow in summer, as they help to shade the plants, and keep the ground cool. Seedling trees are very apt to suffer by drought. They should be <hi>thinned</hi> in the summer, after rain, from two inches to three or four asunder, according to their nature; and at the end of the year (i. e. when a year old) thinned to from nine inches to a foot asunder, and those drawn may be planted out at the same distance, or at least the best of them. The first <hi>winter,</hi> they should be protected from severe frosts, by some light, dry litter, which remove in mild weather.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stocks</hi> designed to grow for <hi>full</hi> standards, should be set in rows, three or four feet asunder, and at one foot and a half in the rows; or if set at the beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned distances, they may be transplanted again, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther year or two, wider. Rows for dwarfs need not be so far asunder as those for standards: but before they are planted, the side shoots must be trimmed off, and the <hi>tap</hi> roots shortened, in order to procure a clean strait stem, and a full root.</p>
                  <p>All new planted trees in a nursery, should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from <hi>frost,</hi> by laying pease haulm, bean, or strong wheat straw between them, which may be trampled down, and secured by throwing stones over it, or by pegging down: seedlings, or stocks, planted

out in <hi>spring</hi> should be protected from drought also in the same manner, a month or two, (or longer,) and afterwards occasionally watered in dry weather.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> year, in <hi>October,</hi> those left at about a foot distance in the rows, may either be taken up and replanted, cutting the tap to make bushy roots, or, taking out every other, left to grow of a size fit to <hi>graff,</hi> or <hi>inoculate</hi> there. This year, only the stronger side-shoots from the stem should be cut off; for the weaker ones will help the stem to thicken, by detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rising sap, and imbibing moisture from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere to feed it; and the getting a strong stem is a material thing, especially for standard trees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stocks</hi> of any kind will be three or four years grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or two or three from planting out, before they are fit for graffing; and if strong stocks are wanted, (as for standards,) more time will be necessary: The rule of substance may be from a quarter to an inch, or more. As <hi>dwarf</hi> trees are graffed, or inoculated within five or six inches of the ground, much less stocks will do for them, than for <hi>standard</hi> trees, which are to be graffed at so many feet high; i. e. if for full-sized trees.</p>
                  <p>Stocks that are naturally of a slow growth, are cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etted for dwarf trees, that they may not mount the wall, fill the espalier, or increase to a large head too fast. So for <hi>apples,</hi> instead of <hi>crab</hi> stocks, which are commonly of free growth, those raised from the seeds of the <hi>paradise</hi> apple are recommended, or stocks raised from <hi>cuttings</hi> of the <hi>Kentish codlin.</hi> These cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings should be planted strong, of an inch at least thick, and from two to three feet long. Trim the shoots of the side off, but leave one at the top. They must be set a foot deep, in a good soil, and occasionally watered. It is best to fix them in the very place where they are to bear <hi>fruit,</hi> as stocks from cuttings make weak roots, and are therefore not so safely moved,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035770_0087_1006BB5264343810"/>
without danger of losing some of the fibres, none of which can be spared.</p>
                  <p>In default of these naturally dwarf-growing stocks, those raised from <hi>suckers</hi> are sometimes used, as less likely to grow off freely than seedling stocks. <hi>Layers</hi> also are proper for dwarf stocks, and they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be had from the <hi>codlin;</hi> all layers must be carefully taken up to preserve the roots.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>pears,</hi> dwarf stocks are raised from <hi>quince</hi> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, layers, or suckers; but as quince shoots are commonly of a weak and crooked growth, the stocks from <hi>pear seeds</hi> are mostly used. But suckers may be obtained from <hi>pears, quinces,</hi> &amp;c. by cutting down an old tree within a foot of the ground, and these being planted out for a year or two, become good stocks. If the suckers, or shoots, lay high, they may be earthed up to induce them to strike. But <hi>suckers</hi> will be often forced, by only cutting off the <hi>top</hi> of an old tree, which is an experiment to be recommended, (in <hi>pears</hi> particularly) as there will be formed a <hi>new</hi> head, and an opportunity given to <hi>graff</hi> for another, or a better sort. And if there are no suckers, there may be low-placed shoots proper for <hi>layers,</hi> of those trees that will thus strike, and most trees will, if not the first, perhaps the second year.</p>
                  <p>Stocks from <hi>suckers,</hi> for dwarf <hi>plums</hi> and <hi>cherries,</hi> are in <hi>one</hi> sense better than those raised from stones, as being less free in their growth; and the <hi>common red cherry</hi> and the <hi>black</hi> are to be preferred for stocks, whether as to suckers or seedlings. If suckers of any tree grow at a proper <hi>distance</hi> from the parent stock, they may be graffed or inoculated without removal, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Figs, quinces,</hi> and <hi>mulberries</hi> (as sometimes <hi>codlins</hi>)

are raised from <hi>suckers, layers</hi> and <hi>cuttings,</hi> without graffing; but from layers is the best method, being more sure than cuttings, and more fruitful than suckers, and in one year they will be rooted. The season for both cuttings and layers (a little before or after) is <hi>October,</hi> though <hi>February</hi> is rather better for the <hi>fig.</hi> The layers from <hi>fig trees</hi> must not be taken off till the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> as when planted in <hi>autumn</hi> they may die; other layers should, however, be then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>

                     <hi>Medlars</hi> are <hi>graffed</hi> on pear or crab, or service-tree stocks; but more commonly upon medlar and white thorn stocks; though the fruit (on the last at least) is not reckoned so good.</p>

                     <hi>Vines</hi> are raised from <hi>cuttings</hi> and <hi>layers,</hi> either in autumn or spring; but for cuttings rather the latter; and if the vines are pruned in <hi>February,</hi> lay the cuttings by in dry mould or sand, till <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April.</hi> Place the layers in the ground, about four or five inches deep, leaving two or three eyes out. The cuttings should have three or four eyes in the ground, and only one out, or be about a foot or fifteen inches long, and placed a little aslant. Cuttings should have a knot of the <hi>old</hi> wood at bottom, for those cut off above, though they may strike, will not produce so good, or fruitful plants; they are also best taken from the lower part of the tree, the wood there being the most ripened. Vines are <hi>best</hi> raised where they are to grow, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hole, and placing two cuttings in, one of which is likely to answer. Keep it to one shoot, and cut down to two eyes in autumn. Keep to two shoots the next summer, and prune down to two or three eyes in autumn, and then the vine will proceed with vigour, and bear well.</p>

                     <hi>Walnuts</hi> are raised from well-ripened nuts, sown either in autumn or spring; and if the latter (which may be rather best) preserve the nuts in their outer coats, in dry sand. These trees are best but once moved, and their tap root preserved, if for <hi>timber,</hi> with the head as entire as possible; but if for <hi>fruit,</hi> the tap root should be shortened, to prevent the tree mounting, and the head may be cut, to accommodate it to the root, as to size. The walnut likes a dry soil, and if gravelly, it does best; and though walnut trees are many years before they come to bear, yet if it were only for the <hi>wood,</hi> posterity would have reason to commend the planter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Filberds</hi> are raised from nuts, or suckers, and layers, the latter of which is the best method; or they may be graffed on the common nut tree. The nuts sown in <hi>autumn,</hi> or kept dry in sand till <hi>February,</hi> produce fine trees, but generally <hi>differ</hi> a little from the sorts sown, and make a variety generally for the worse.

                     <hi>Raspberries</hi> are almost universally propagated from <hi>suckers,</hi> being always abundant; and as this saves a year, and <hi>seed</hi> produces varieties not desirable, sowing is not to be recommended: This shrub is rarely brought into the nursery to obtain strength. Se page 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strawberries</hi> are raised from <hi>seed, offsets,</hi> and <hi>runners,</hi> but almost universally from the last; plants from seed produce the finest fruit, and sometimes a variety that is superior to the original.</p>
                  <p>The young <hi>offsets</hi> of the present year, slipped in <hi>autumn,</hi> or those of the last year (which will be better rooted) slipped in <hi>spring,</hi> will do for plants, cutting off the sticky parts; but the first <hi>runners</hi> are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and properly used. <hi>Offsets</hi> early in spring, and forward <hi>runners</hi> in summer, (as soon as rooted in <hi>June,</hi>) may be planted out in cool ground, at six inches distance, by way of a nursery, in order for making new plantations towards the end of <hi>September,</hi> or in <hi>October.</hi> This is thought a good way by many, but it is seldom practised: Let the summer plants be well watered till rooted, and suffer no runners to proceed from them. The <hi>common</hi> method is to let the runners remain till <hi>September,</hi> and then, as early in the month as may be, to dress the beds, and select the strong and most bushy-rooted sets for forming new beds: It would, however, be an advantage both to the old stools, and the young plants, to suffer only the first or second runners to remain for the purpose: Thus their own beds will be the <hi>nursery</hi> for them; and except the soil is worn out, (perhaps,) the best. See page 39.</p>
                  <p>The raising of <hi>FOREST TREES</hi> is rather beside the purpose of this book. They have been mentioned as
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035770_0091_1006BB66E6948E70"/>
to the time of <hi>sowing,</hi> and their treatment is in a great measure the same as for raising <hi>stocks</hi> for fruit trees; so that to those who would do only a little in this way, much more need not be said.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Forest trees</hi> are often left to grow thick on the seed bed, and only thinned a little in the autumn following, and so from time to time as they get bigger; but a little thinning in the summer, by <hi>drawing,</hi> when the ground is moist, were surely best. If the soil that seedling trees are to be planted in be poor, let them be raised in earth somewhat sandy, and at any rate not in a rich soil.</p>
                  <p>Those who would do much in raising <hi>forest trees,</hi> should consult works written particularly on the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and that is a judicious one by Mr. <hi>Kennedy,</hi> on this, and other articles, 2 vols. 8vo. entitled, A Treatise on Planting and Gardening, and Management of the Hot-House; but it is to be observed his chief subject on planting, is with respect to poor or waste land, in which business (as also in the other articles he has treated) he had much experience.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>young</hi> men take to gardening and planting, it is an happy circumstance, and they should lose no time in the business; for it is a thing that persons advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in years have often repented of. It produces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable satisfaction, and a peculiar pleasure, in the evening of life, when a man can point at good trees, and say, "These are of my own <hi>planting!"</hi>—but it were a superior thing to add, "And of my own <hi>rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> too." Let <hi>young</hi> planters resolve, therefore, to raise their own trees, especially of the <hi>forest</hi> kind. "There is no better, or cheaper way of raising woods and plantations, than by sowing the masts or nuts of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber trees, where they are always to <hi>remain,</hi> and this is best done in <hi>spring."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to be observed, that the wild <hi>service, hawthorn, hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035770_0092_1006BB69EF4E9498"/>
probably the others,) if they are buried in a pit with coal ashes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ted fine, or in a sandy earth for a year, will come up the first year they are sown.</p>
                  <p>To have <hi>good seed</hi> of the various kinds, is a thing too little attended; but on which evidently depends much. It should be well ripened, and the produce of fine healthy trees; withal, not growing near dottrel, ill-conditioned ones, the <hi>farina</hi> from the flowers of which might impregnate those of the good tree, and give its seed a degree of degeneracy. Let <hi>oak acorns</hi> be thrown into water, and those only used which sink quickly;—they should be kept a while to harden, but not too long out of ground, as they soon sprout.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>management</hi> of a nursery, the young plants of trees and shrubs should be dug round once a year, by a downright cut of a sharp spade, a little distance from the stems, nearer or farther off, according to their age, to shorten straggling roots, and produce new ones more at home: Let this be done in <hi>October</hi> or <hi>February;</hi> the former time is best for the older plants, and the latter for young ones. The spade also may be drove under them to cut off the tap roots, where it is not an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to preserve them. By this practice, a good, full, brushy root will be obtained, fitting plants for a pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous removal; but it should be done a year before transplanting. <hi>Evergreens</hi> in particular would be safer to move, being thus treated. Immediately after the operation, a sound watering will be proper to settle the earth to the roots, except the ground be quite moist.</p>

                  <p>If the seeds of fruit were left to grow up <hi>without</hi> graffing, they would produce a <hi>different</hi> kind from that they came from; by chance a better, but most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a worse. The <hi>varieties</hi> of fruit we have, were obtained partly from seedling stocks, without graffing, and partly by an accidental difference, that the stock, or soil, may have given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Graffing</hi> is like planting upon a plant, for though there is an union of the parts, there is in fact little other communication than a root has with the ground. The cion, or bud, draws nourishment from the stock, but no other than is properly adapted to its own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar pores, which by a chemical process (suppose by fermentation in its little bladders, or cells) it alters, so as to become exclusively its own. A great variety of <hi>fruit</hi> is produced by graff-planting from the same kind of stock, (and that perhaps a mere <hi>crab,</hi>) just as a great variety of plants are from the same soil: By this means also, some <hi>forest,</hi> and many <hi>ornamental</hi> trees and shrubs are propagated, and thus their particular varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preserved, as in all the variegated sorts, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="unknown:035770_0094_1006BB77ACC27730"/>
The art of <hi>graffing</hi> is a very curious discovery, and though it requires some ingenuity to perform it, a few trials may make it familiar, and it will prove an agreeable source of amusement and satisfaction. By being able to graff, young trees may be always at hand for replacing old, or unsuccessful ones; and the pleasure of obliging a friend in <hi>this</hi> way, is peculiarly gratifying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Skill</hi> in this ingenious art is clearly best obtained by <hi>seeing</hi> the work performed; for this is an <hi>ec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There are few <hi>gardeners,</hi> (even by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,) however, that practice this work, owing to the great number of <hi>nurserymen</hi> ready to supply trees. But though they raise fine trees, much disappointment has often happened in dealing with them (particularly in the <hi>sort</hi>) which might be avoided, by a man's being able to raise good trees for <hi>himself.</hi> Directions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely descriptive of the business of <hi>graffing,</hi> are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here attempted, and if once understood, trials should be made without minding the discouragement of a few failures; for practice will in the end make perfect.</p>
                  <p>Proper <hi>stocks</hi> being ready, and cions, or buds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, there will be wanting a good sharp narrow bladed <hi>pen-knife,</hi> and a sharp smooth-edged <hi>pruning-knife,</hi> with some fine-wrought <hi>loam,</hi> or <hi>clay,</hi> and some good new <hi>base,</hi> or strong <hi>yarn.</hi>

CLEFT-GRAFFING has been the most common method of propagation, and though it is not the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, yet it is a certain and easy way to young practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. The stocks for this mode of graffing should be strong, about three quarters of an inch diameter, or more if it so happen; but it <hi>may</hi> be used with the very youngest stocks, having cions of the same size.</p>
                  <p>Cut off the <hi>head,</hi> as before directed, so as to have (on the sunny side) a smooth part in the stock, where the cion is to be placed, and cutting a part of the stock off slopewise, opposite to this place, leave the top, or the crown of the stock, about half an inch wide.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>cleave</hi> the stock with a strong knife, or thin sharp chisel, about two inches deep, as near the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle as possible, so as not to divide the <hi>pith,</hi> and if any roughness appears in the flit, smooth it off with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife; but something of the <hi>wedge</hi> kind must be put into the flit to keep it open to receive the cion, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper room to put it in. Cut the cion on each side to the form of a <hi>wedge</hi> at bottom, an inch or more long, making that side which is to be placed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the stock, thinner by about one third. Put the cion in, so that its bark, and that of the <hi>stock</hi> be level; and if the bark of the stock be thick, let the bark of the cion sink in a trifle, as the current of the sap runs chiefly betwixt the bark and wood. The <hi>cion</hi> being placed, take the wedge out that kept the stock open; yet if the stock be so strong as to <hi>pinch</hi> the cion <hi>too</hi> hard, ease it by a little bit of dry wood to be left in the cleft; so, however, as not to loosen the graff, which must be held firmly; or if the stock be very strong, the wedge of the cion may be nearly of equal thickness, inside and out, which eases the barked part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>"Cleft-graffing</hi> is used in the <hi>cyder</hi> countries, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to old stocks <hi>very</hi> large, with cions of four or five inches in circumference: thus renewing old trees to bear fine fruit in three years, which before produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing eatable."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="unknown:035770_0098_1006BB88F9A0DE60"/>
The <hi>graff</hi> must be nicely <hi>whipped</hi> round with wet <hi>bass</hi> pulled tight, and the whole <hi>clayed</hi> over to an inch above and half an inch below, smoothing it off taper, with a trowel, or knife, dipped in water. And as this is done with a view to keep out wet, sun and air, if the clay falls off, or cracks, it must be immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, till the season comes to take off the bandage, which is about <hi>Midsummer,</hi> or rather sooner: yet at this time some clay should still be kept on the <hi>top,</hi> to secure the cleft from wet, and so continued till the cleft is grown up. This clay must be worked up well with horse dung (having no straw in it) and a little short chopped hay to make it hold together without cracking. Let it be prepared at least some days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and be beat as mortar is, the oftener the better.</p>
                  <p>If it is desired to put in <hi>two</hi> cions, to form a tree for the wall, or espalier, there should be two clefts paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to one another, one on each side the pith. Some put in two cions, merely in case one should miss; but it is not advisable. It need hardly be observed, that in this case the crown must be left whole.</p>
                  <p>With respect to the <hi>time</hi> of performing this work, remember that what has been sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>WHIP-GRAFFING has the advantage of cleft-graffing in neatness, and not requiring the stocks to be so old by a year or two, as very small ones will do in this way; for the stock is directly covered by the cion and it takes with certainty if properly performed. The objections to this mode are, that cions suitable to proper stocks cannot always be had; i. e. near upon half an inch thick; and, that if the cion is of a more free nature than the stock, it will overgrow it, which though it does not signify for dwarf-trees, is not so well for standards. Stock and cion are to be both of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035770_0099_1006BB8B28BE38B8"/>
the advantage in bigness; for thus it is not so likely to be overgrown. When the stock of a standard is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown by the cion, it will give it some opportunity to thicken, by slitting the bark through downwards, in two or three places.</p>
                  <p>Having cut the <hi>head</hi> of the stock off, and the cion to its length, <hi>slope</hi> the lower end of the <hi>cion</hi> about an inch and a ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, and to a point; then cut the stock to answer it, (the cut of the stock however may be a <hi>trifle</hi> wider and longer) bark against bark, and tie them together <hi>exactly</hi> to their place, and clay it. But for the greater certainty of keeping a cion to the part, two ways to assist it are used. The first is, by cutting the cion so as to leave a small <hi>shoulder</hi> at the top of the slope, and the stock so as to leave a narrow bit of the crown to answer it, and to hold it. The other way is, make a slit with the knife in the bare place of the stock downward, beginning towards the top of the slope, and so slitting it a little way; and doing the like in the sloped face of the cion, but beginning at the same distance from the lower end of it, as was done before from the top of the stock, and so carrying it upwards; and then join them by thrusting the one slice into the other, till the bare place of the cion cover the bare place of the stock:—this junction is called <hi>Lipping.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a sort of whip-graffing that has been denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated <hi>slicing,</hi> or packing, which differs only from the one just described, in that the stock is of <hi>any</hi> size<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is performed by cutting the cion to a face, as before, and then taking off a slice from the (beheaded) stock, choosing a gibbons part of it so as exactly to correspond with the cut-surface of the cion, taking care to fit them so that the cion may stand erect (or nearly) when clapped to. Shouldering and lipping are here as necessary as in the former method, though shouldering is more conveniently and commonly practised.</p>

GRAFFING IN THE BARK, which is sometimes called <hi>crown graffing,</hi> is perhaps as good a way as any, both for ease of operation and certainty of success; but it will hardly suit any other fruit than <hi>apples</hi> or <hi>pears,</hi> as other cions will be past use (most likely) before the bark of the stocks will <hi>peel,</hi> as the time for this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is towards the end of <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of <hi>April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>head</hi> being cut off, make a strait slit down and through the bark from the top, at the place destined for the graff, which should be rather <hi>southerly</hi> or <hi>westerly.</hi> This score down the bark, should be <hi>nearly</hi> as long as the slope cut of the cion, which may be one and a half, or two inches. Loosing the bark a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ile at the top of the score, and then with some <hi>smooth</hi> instrument rather of dry hard wood, ivory, bone, or silver, than iron or steel, open the bark sufficiently to receive the cion, by pushing the instrument down a trifle below the botton of the slit. This instrument should be thin, tapered and rounded towards the point, to suit the shape of the cion's face; one side of it flat, and the other a little convex, the flat side being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the wood of the stock; let it be rather nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than the cion, that it may not loosen the bark too wide.</p>
                  <p>Cut a bit of the <hi>bark</hi> of the cion smooth off at the bottom, that it may not turn up in pushing down. It will be proper to cut the cion with a small <hi>shoulder,</hi> to rest upon the stock. And because when the cion is in, it will bear the bark up hollow from the stock, score the bark on each side the cion, so that it may fall close to the stock, and to the edges of the cion. Bind and clay neatly. In this way of graffing there is a sort of agreement between the cion and stock necessary; the cion not being too big, or the stock too small, to prevent a proper <hi>bedding.</hi> If more than one cion be not put in, the stock on the opposite side to the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035770_0101_1006BB8E815F7C78"/>
cion should be sloped up, about two inches in length, to half its thickness.</p>
                  <p>This way of graffing is used most properly with <hi>strong</hi> stocks; and sometimes is applied to large branches, and even trunks of old trees, to change the sorts, or renew the wood. In proportion to the largeness of which, from two to five or six cions are put in, and sometimes of different sorts; and if the stock be large, the more the better, as they insure the life of the stock, by receiving and carrying off the sap: in this respect the single branch of the head of an old stock may be left on, for the sap to pass off by when it begins to stir.</p>
                  <p>Having inserted the cions, and bound them, clay the top of the stock <hi>well</hi> so as to shoot off the wet. In this way of graffing, the cions are liable to be <hi>disturbed,</hi> or moved from their places by strong winds, and the best preventative is to tie small long sticks to the stocks, and then the cions to them, taking care to place the sticks so as not to <hi>force</hi> the cions; and as the shoots proceed to push they may be fastened to the sticks also, and so grow two years, when nature will need no further assistance.</p>
                  <p>SIDE-GRAFFING is done in the <hi>bark,</hi> much like <hi>inoculation,</hi> a cion being inserted instead of a <hi>bud;</hi> but remember, there must be a fluent sap first: i. e. the bark must part <hi>readily</hi> from the wood, before this mode of graffing is attempted. The <hi>head</hi> of the stock is <hi>not</hi> to be cut off, only thinned a little if it be big, and the side shoots taken away. The bark of the stock, where the insertion of the cion is to be, must be cut through in the form of the letter T, as wide and as long as is sufficient to receive the cion, cut as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with a slope face of at <hi>least</hi> an inch long, taking advantage, (if it may be) of a part of the stock, that is a little <hi>gibbous.</hi> Let the bark of the stock be neatly raised to receive it, but yet no more than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035770_0102_1006BB92049AF868"/>
a little bit of the bark may be sliced off the part that is over the cross cut, to receive the cion the better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Side-graffing</hi> may be done also by taking off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> bark to the size of the <hi>cion's face</hi> (exactly,) and <hi>sipping</hi> may be used to keep it in its place: in this case the operation should be performed somewhat <hi>sooner</hi> in the season than in the former method.

                  <p>APPROACH GRAFFING, or INARCHING, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed when the stock we would graff, and the tree we would propagate, grows so near together, as to be brought conveniently into contact, and the nearer the graff and the stock are of a size the better. This mode of propagation is esteemed the <hi>surest</hi> of all, as it will conjoin branches of trees which are scarcely congenerous in their nature; and in truth, some things cannot be so well propagated any other way. It is a method seldom used for common fruit trees; but if any one wishes to try the experiment, the <hi>stock</hi> or stocks must be planted at least a year before, first mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the soil good, as it may need it, being so near another tree, for it of course must be close.</p>
                  <p>Plants in <hi>pots</hi> or <hi>tubs</hi> being easily brought together, are frequently propagated this way; so that <hi>inarching</hi> is used much in <hi>green-houses</hi> and <hi>hot-houses</hi> for various things, as <hi>oranges, lemons, pomegranates, jasmines</hi> and <hi>vines</hi> sometimes: <hi>oranges</hi> and <hi>lemons</hi> thus treated in <hi>May</hi> will be united by <hi>August.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The method of <hi>inarching</hi> is, bend the best situated young branch of the tree or shrub to be propagated, to the stock to be graffed, and having determined on the part at which most conveniently to fix the shoot; cut the bark of that part of the shoot off, with nearly half the wood, (not to touch the <hi>pith</hi>) to the length of about
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035770_0103_1006BB95F763EE80"/>
three inches for a strong branch, or less for a weaker. Then cut exactly so much of the bark and wood of the stock off, as will receive the cut part of the branch, or shoot, so as to bring <hi>bark</hi> and <hi>bark</hi> in contact in every part; and if the contrivance of <hi>lipping</hi> be used, it will secure them better together. Bind and clay, and if in open ground, fix a stake to tie the work so that the wind may have no power over it; a tie also to a neat stick may be proper for those inarched in pots, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the graff has <hi>taken,</hi> which will be probably in four months, (except in the harder woods,) let the head of the stock be steadily cut off with a <hi>keen</hi> knife, three or four inches above the binding, which then removing, bind and clay again, to remain about a month. In <hi>March</hi> following, cut off the branch from the parent close to the graffing, and also the stub of the stock that was left. The head of the stock is sometimes cut off before graffing, in which case a sloping cut half way the thickness of the stock, is to receive the cion; but here the graff and the stock must be both of a size, or nearly so. There has been this <hi>distinction</hi> made, to call it <hi>inarching</hi> when the head is cut off, and <hi>approach</hi> graffing when it is not. Gardeners mostly prefer the former method.</p>
                  <p>BUDDING or INOCULATION, though here last mentioned, is the most considerable mode of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is a pretty summer business. <hi>Apricots, peaches,</hi> and <hi>nectarines</hi> are always propagated this way, and <hi>plums</hi> and <hi>cherries</hi> may be. <hi>Pears</hi> are sometimes budded, and <hi>apples</hi> have been, but the success is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. Not only <hi>fruit,</hi> but <hi>forest,</hi> and <hi>ornamental trees</hi> and shrubs are inoculated. The <hi>branches</hi> also of trees as well as stems are sometimes budded, which is best done on two years wood, though it may be on both younger and older.</p>

reckoned from <hi>Mid-June</hi> to <hi>Mid-August;</hi> but about <hi>Old-Midsummer,</hi> or rather after, is the usual and best time for the work: it should be done in a <hi>morning</hi> or <hi>evening,</hi> (the latter rather best,) except the day be cloudy, when any part of it will do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apricots</hi> being first ready, the budding season begins with them. The <hi>stocks</hi> to be used are those of the <hi>plum</hi> (raised from stones or suckers) when half an inch thick, a little under or over, and the operation is to take place from four to eight inches from the ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peaches</hi> are best budded on stocks from stones, which may be either of <hi>peach</hi> or <hi>plum;</hi> but rather the latter, as making the more durable trees. The <hi>wheat plum,</hi> (a white one, ripe in <hi>August,</hi>) is reckoned the best by some, and the <hi>muscle</hi> plum is preferred by others; but any free growing sort will do, giving the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to those mentioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nectarines</hi> are propagated on the same sort of stocks; but if the plum stock is first budded with an <hi>apricot</hi> (very low,) and, when of proper size, budded with the nectarine, the advantage is reckoned that it takes best so, and comes to a better bearing, producing an improved fruit, and particularly the <hi>red Roman necta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. Peaches</hi> are also sometimes thus <hi>double-budded;</hi> and <hi>apricots</hi> may be expected to be less luxuriant by this treatment, in which case the first bud should be of the <hi>Brussels</hi> sort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>cherries</hi> may be inoculated on sucker stocks of any kind; yet if a free growth is required, (as for standards,) stocks raised from stones are best; i. e. plums on plums, and cherries on cherries, though they will take upon each other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pears,</hi> if for <hi>standards,</hi> should be inoculated on pear stocks, and on those raised from seed, rather than suckers, but if for dwarfs, quince stocks may be best used, to keep the trees from growing off too fast, and so getting soon too big for their allotted space; <hi>white thorn</hi> stocks are sometimes used with the same view, but the fruit gets stony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="unknown:035770_0105_1006BB9EC0A12DB8"/>
                     <hi>Stocks</hi> for budding <hi>dwarfs</hi> should be three years old; but for <hi>standards</hi> four or more, though small stocks may be budded for standards also, (as mentioned in the case of graffing,) if the shoot proceeding from the <hi>bud</hi> be trained to a single stem, till of sufficient height to be topped in order to form a head. <hi>Standards</hi> should be from three to seven feet high, before they are topped, according to the height they are desired to be of, as <hi>half</hi> or <hi>full;</hi> but <hi>dwarfs</hi> for trailing can hardly branch off too low, being budded at five or six inches, or less from the ground, the shoot from the bud should be shortened (at a year's growth) to five or six eyes, or to four that are well placed; i. e. with a <hi>lateral</hi> direction for the wall.</p>
                  <p>Though the longer <hi>inoculation</hi> is deferred, the riper the shoots will be for furnishing buds; yet there is an advantage in beginning as early as may be, that if the budding appears not to have taken, the work may be done again before the season is out. Or, to <hi>insure</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, two buds may be inserted in the same stock, (but not in a direction under one another) and if both fail this year, the stocks may do again the next, as the heads in this mode of graffing are not to be cut off till the spring following the inoculation, because the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated buds do not push till then, when they will grow off <hi>apace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes, however, in a very early inoculation, the bud will shoot the same year; but it is not desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as it comes weak, and is likely to be destroyed in the winter.</p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>cions</hi> to procure buds for inoculation, be taken only from the outside branches of <hi>healthy</hi> and <hi>fruitful</hi> trees. If <hi>early</hi> budding be attempted, it will be proper to cut off some spare shoot, (not fit for the purpose,) to <hi>try</hi> first whether the bark will yet <hi>readily</hi> part from the wood.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>season</hi> being right, and the cions at hand, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a sharp narrow bladed <hi>knife,</hi> and neat though wet

bass, set about the work <hi>adroitly,</hi> for the quicker it is done the better; but "make no more haste than good speed." Keep the <hi>bud,</hi> as much as may be from <hi>sun</hi> and <hi>wind:</hi> they must not be taken from the upper part of the cions, as the bark and buds there are are too raw. If cions or buds be brought from any distance, they should be conveyed in damp (not wet) moss, or grass, and never kept above a day and night, but the sooner they are used the better.</p>
                  <p>Before the <hi>buds</hi> are <hi>prepared,</hi> get the stock ready to receive them, by taking off lateral shoots, leaving an uncut single stem. At the part fixed on for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation, which should be smooth, and rather on the <hi>north</hi> side, cut the bark through to the wood, in form thus T, the cross and the down slit being of the length necessary to take in the bud, which may be cut with from one to two inches of bark; putting the point of a knife (or some instrument rather not of iron or steel) into the top of the down cut of the stock, <hi>raise</hi> the bark all the way to the bottom, so that it will <hi>just</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bud easily. There are knives made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for budding with flat ivory hafts.</p>
                  <p>To procure proper <hi>buds,</hi> put your knife in (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) about three-fourths of an inch above the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ye, and with a slope downwards cut the cion half through, then do it at the same distance below the eye, and sloping it upwards cut up the middle of the wood, till the knife meets the upper incision, so the <hi>eye</hi> will be directly in the middle.</p>
                  <p>The next step is, to <hi>separate</hi> the wood from the bark, which is to be done thus: with your nail, or the point of a knife, loosen the bark at the top, and strip it from the wood; or rather with a swan or large goose quill, made in the form of an <hi>apple scoop,</hi> (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a regular <hi>smooth</hi> edge) push it down between the bark and wood, pressing against the wood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Examine</hi> the inside of the bark, and it there is a
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035770_0107_1006BBA8F4B79B00"/>
                     <hi>cavity</hi> just behind the <hi>eye,</hi> or <hi>bud,</hi> it is good for noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and another must be procured; for the cavity shews, that the <hi>root</hi> of the bud is with the wood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being with the bark.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>leaf</hi> that grows by the eye is to be cut down to near its footstalk, so as to leave only a little bit of it to hold the bud by, while inserting it in the stock.</p>
                  <p>See that the <hi>bark</hi> of the stock is loosened a proper length and breadth, and if when the bud is put in, it should prove a little too long, cut the spare part off; so that the top of the <hi>bud</hi> (being squared) falls in strait with the cross cut of the stock. Thus fixed, bind it <hi>moderately</hi> tight in its place with the <hi>wet</hi> bass, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the bottom and passing by the <hi>bud,</hi> go on to the top, or rather above it. Care must be taken that the bud is not hurt, and it is to be left only just start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out between the bass:—This is the mode of <hi>inoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation</hi> commonly used.</p>
                  <p>Some gardeners insist, that it is best to cut the bark of the stock thus <hi rend="invert">T,</hi> and so insert the bud by pushing it <hi>upward</hi> instead of downward, because by this method it shoots off wet effectually.</p>
                  <p>Others <hi>squaring</hi> the bud to an oblong, clap it to the place to be inoculated, and scoring the stock to its size, cut out the bark of the stock from within the lines, and having put the bud to the place, bind it in: but great <hi>exactness</hi> must in this way be observed, that the edges of the bark do regularly touch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another way,</hi> and perhaps as good as any, is this—clap the bud to the stock, (the bud being first squared) and rather before it is separated from the wood, and score the bark on each side, and across the top; and instead of scoring the bark at the bottom, do it a quarter of an inch (or rather more) above the bottom ends of the side lines; then take off the bark between the lines, and place the bud, by pushing it down this piece of bark, (being first loosened) which will serve to hold it. Bind close, but not over tight. If in this method the bud fits <hi>exactly,</hi> it is a very sure and neat
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035770_0108_1006BBAC8EAD7628"/>
way of inoculating. As the scoring of the stock is best done before the barking of the bud, a little allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance must be made, as when the bud is separated from its wood, it will spread a trifle wider.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>budding</hi> has been performed by making a down slit in the bark of the stock, and a cross one in the middle of this slit, and so raising the four corners to receive the bud; making in this case, the bud rather under an inch in length; but it is <hi>difficult</hi> thus to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the bud without injuring it, and this method i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> therefore not to be recommended.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>buds</hi> have <hi>taken,</hi> it will be seen in about three weeks, by their appearing <hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>plump,</hi> and not dark, flat and shrivelled. As often as any shoots appear <hi>below</hi> the budding, cut them off, and also some of the shoots above, if there are many of them; for it is not proper that an inoculated stock should have a large head. In a month loosen the bandage, by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it off, and putting it on gently again, for another month.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>March,</hi> cut the head of the stock off with a keen knife, close behind the budding, in a sloping direction; some leave three or four inches of the stock above the bud till the following spring, and it will serve to tie the new shoot to, in order to keep it to a proper erect direction. Suffer no shoots from the stock, but rub the buds off as soon as they appear.</p>
                  <p>A few <hi>observations</hi> concludes this long article of prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agation by <hi>graffing</hi> and <hi>budding.</hi> Persons designing to graff, are apt to neglect cutting their <hi>cions</hi> till they get two forward, therefore remember to be <hi>in time.</hi> To do the work well, there must be good <hi>tools,</hi> &amp;c. and particularly a <hi>keen</hi> knife. Choose as good a <hi>day</hi> as can reasonably be expected, for bad weather oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions hurry and embarrassment, and the patience necessary to success may not be possessed: but defer
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035770_0109_1006BBB1CE6DEC88"/>
not <hi>too</hi> long on account of the weather. In handling <hi>cions,</hi> take care of their eyes, that nothing bruises them, and be particularly careful of the <hi>buds</hi> used for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation.</p>
                  <p>Some motion of the <hi>sap</hi> is proper, at the time of <hi>all</hi> graffing, but a <hi>free</hi> motion is necessary for the mode of graffing in the <hi>bark,</hi> and as on the sunny side of the stock it moves freest, and is the best aspect as to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, insertion of <hi>graffs,</hi> though not <hi>buds,</hi> if it can be avoided, should be always on a part of the stock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to the <hi>West.</hi> It may be of use to <hi>shade</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated buds a few days, by a leaf, or a bit of paper. Silver, (as a fruit knife) is best to raise the bark with, or any thing is preferable to iron.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>inoculation</hi> may seem the slowest mode of propagating fruit trees, it proves eventually the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; and is the most certain way to produce free grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trees, with a well covered stock. The insertion of a <hi>bud</hi> has also the advantage of a <hi>cion,</hi> as a failure does not hurt the stock so much.</p>
                  <p>It is to be <hi>advised,</hi> that some <hi>mark</hi> be affixed, (or notch the stock) to be assured of the sort; an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of which is often a great mortification. Many <hi>words</hi> have been necessarily employed in directing to the business of <hi>graffing,</hi> but let not <hi>that</hi> circumstance deter ingenuity from setting about the work; or a few failures prevent that perseverance which will at length be crowned with success, and be a pleasing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Though private persons are apt to think much of the <hi>difficulty</hi> of this art, yet the ease, celerity, and certainty, with which <hi>Nurserymen</hi> perform it, seem to make it nothing at all: such is the ability which much practice gives.</p>

                  <head>OF PLANTING.</head>
                  <p>AS so much depends upon proper planting, every attention ought to be paid to it. This business may be arranged under these several heads. 1. The choice of plants. 2. The act of planting. 3. The soil. 4. The situation. 5. The season.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the CHOICE of plants. Trees ought to be the <hi>best</hi> of the kind; and therefore no care in <hi>raising,</hi> or caution and expense in <hi>purchasing</hi> should be spared, that at least there may be a fair <hi>prospect</hi> of satisfaction. To plant, and after waiting a long time, to be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, is rather a <hi>serious</hi> misfortune; especially when the work is to be begun again late in a man's life.</p>
                  <p>Having some confidence that the <hi>sort</hi> is right and good, the <hi>plants</hi> must be seen to, that they are <hi>healthy;</hi> they should appear <hi>sound</hi> as to any external injury. If they are of a squat, weak, bushy growth, there can be little expectation of their becoming good plants; though it may sometimes happen that a tree of poor promise will rally.</p>
                  <p>Trees graffed on old <hi>stunted</hi> stocks, or that have often been <hi>removed,</hi> or frequently <hi>cut down,</hi> seldom grow off well in any soil, and should be rejected. Let those that are purchased be seen to, as <hi>nurserymen</hi> often have <hi>suck</hi> trees, having remained long on hand.</p>
                  <p>Good <hi>y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>g trees</hi> have a smooth, bright, and strait appearance, rather of a robust growth than otherwise: though the most luxuriant are not to be preferred, for their wood is raw, and wants that firmness which is
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035770_0111_1006BBBCEFBB1208"/>
necessary to fruitfulness: they may get off this crude state in time, but the moderately free growers are best.</p>
                  <p>Young fruit trees are the best to plant, for though old ones may sometimes succeed with good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet they are liable to stunt, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>indle off; whereas the former establish their roots quickly, and grow off apace; so that young trees planted at the same time with old ones, generally overtake them in a few years.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ACT of planting. Trees taken up for planting should be dug <hi>carefully,</hi> with (as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) their <hi>full</hi> roots. Many a good tree has failed merely by being taken up badly, and then planted so. The roots of fruit trees are often not only mangled, and too few, but are also put into the ground without any dressing or care.</p>
                  <p>The less roots are exposed to the <hi>air</hi> the better, and the sooner trees are planted after being taken up, the more likely they are to succeed well. Trees properly packed (i. e. the roots well covered) may live out of ground ten days or a fortnight, in <hi>autumn,</hi> or early in the <hi>spring;</hi> but nothing except <hi>necessity</hi> will justify the keeping a tree out of ground a day longer than can be helped.</p>
                  <p>It is be <hi>determined</hi> for any length of time beforehand, when and where to plant, the <hi>opening</hi> the ground, and exposing the holes to the <hi>sun</hi> and <hi>air,</hi> (and if it may be to <hi>frost</hi> also) will both correct crudities in the soil, and enrich it from the various stores of the atmosphere; this opening should be as deep and wide as convenient, that the salutary influences of the air may be extended.</p>
                  <p>Some people do the <hi>work</hi> of planting very <hi>idly,</hi> as if it were sufficient to see that a tree has a root, and that it was only necessary to <hi>bide</hi> it in the ground. Every one who plants trees should stand by himself, or have some trusty person to <hi>see</hi> the work done, or the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary labour may not be bestowed. It is frequently the way (for instance) just to dig a hole <hi>no</hi> bigger than will
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035770_0112_1006BBBE86C69A98"/>
receive the roots of a tree twisted and forced in; but being thus cramped, and the vessels of their roots dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted and broke, it cannot be expected that such <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> treatment should answer.</p>
                  <p>But the above <hi>violence</hi> is not all; the roots are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined as in a prison, (in a tub or a bason,) which if the soil is strong detains wet, and chills and cankers, if not rots the fibres. To plant well, the <hi>roots</hi> of a tree should have liberty to strike out freely every way, and the ground well broke for their <hi>easy</hi> progress. Let the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>de for a tree be loosened about two feet deep, and as wide as will be much more than sufficient to receive the roots in their <hi>fall</hi> spread as they grow, with little or no direction given contrary to the original one.</p>
                  <p>When the tree is to be <hi>planted,</hi> take out the earth a little lower than necessary for the roots, at the depth the tree is designed to stand; then dig the bottom to the full spade's depth. Trim any <hi>dead</hi> or <hi>damaged</hi> part of the root clean off; thin it of the finer fibres where withered, or matted thick, and the more, according to the time the tree has been out of the ground, for the fine roots soon die, and <hi>if</hi> dead, ought not to be on. Trees moved only from one part of the garden to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, need have but few fibres cut off, but <hi>some</hi> ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are necessary to help the sooner to new roots, which shortening always forces out. If the root had a <hi>tap,</hi> (or downright spur,) it should be cut to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral level of the other roots, and never be left longer than a foot from the highest part of the root. Those great roots that lay auk ward, or crossing, should be judiciously rectified with a sharp knife; be cautious, however, of taking off <hi>too</hi> much, for the head will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce stronger branches in proportion to the goodness of the root. Though it be little practised, it may be very well to apply some <hi>wound mixture</hi> to large ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, especially of stone fruit.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>head</hi> of a tree should be somewhat conformed to the root. <hi>Some</hi> reduction of the head may take
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035770_0113_1006BBC09E4E9350"/>
place at the time of planting; yet not <hi>all</hi> that may be thought necessary should be taken off at first; but let alone till the sap stirs at spring, and then care should be taken to proportion the head to the root; and not leave on a tree too many buds, for a few stout branches are preferable to many weak ones. This is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary practice with respect to <hi>wall trees,</hi> and why not of <hi>all</hi> others? See articles, <hi>Orchard</hi> and <hi>Pruning,</hi> Sect. 3 and 12.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>hole</hi> being made as directed, form a little <hi>hillock</hi> in the middle of it to lay the roots <hi>on</hi> and <hi>round;</hi> clap the tree upon it, and having thrown on a little good and <hi>well-broke</hi> mould, give the tree a <hi>gentle,</hi> shaking lift, which will let the earth in close among the roots, and bring the tree up towards its proper height; by not doing this the roots are sometimes turned up at the ends, instead of laying <hi>rather</hi> downwards: Set the tree high enough to allow for a setting of the earth, in proportion to the depth it was loosened. <hi>Young</hi> trees, however, should have their roots nearly upon a <hi>level,</hi> and so must have their ends raised with the hand, if they are suspected to be too much depressed. The mould should be thrown on gently, a little at a time; and if some that is finer and richer than the rest be put about the roots, just to cover them, it would be a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that would answer, helping the tree to strike fresh roots, and grow off the faster.</p>
                  <p>Trample the mould <hi>gently</hi> about the roots, beginning at the outside of the hole, and so towards the stem. Finally, leave the ground a little hollow on the top, to receive rains, or waterings.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>depth,</hi> trees in a <hi>light</hi> dry soil may have the top of their roots settled at about five or six inches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the surface, and in a <hi>strong</hi> soil about three inches; or it may be a general rule to plant a tree no deeper than it was before; for trees planted too deep never do well. Always keep the roots of a tree <hi>above</hi> a heavy clay, for the making trenches in it will not answer, and
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035770_0114_1006BBC6D275FB90"/>
an unhealthy tree may be looked for. See next article <hi>Soil.</hi> If the good soil is <hi>thin,</hi> the roots should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most planted in sight, raising the earth about them; and if care is taken to protect the roots of such high set trees from frost the first winter, and drought the first summer, they will generally do well. But <hi>all</hi> new planted trees should be somewhat covered about their roots from extremes of weather for a time; either with good solid <hi>turf, litter</hi> with stones on it, or stones alone, which by their weight help to hold the tree fast. Where plenty of <hi>moss</hi> is to be had, it is a neat material to lay about roots to keep them from drought.</p>
                  <p>When litter alone is laid about trees (particularly if against an old wall) <hi>mice</hi> are apt to harbour in it, and bark them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Watering</hi> is to take place if trees are planted <hi>early</hi> in autumn; but in winter it should not. This settles the mould about the roots, but let them not be sodden with it. <hi>Late</hi> in spring water will be safely and necessarily applied, and must be repeated also if dry weather; but yet with caution, for many new planted trees have been injured (if not killed) by keeping the roots wet. Late planted trees should be <hi>occasionally</hi> watered through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the summer.</p>
                  <p>In planting <hi>wall trees,</hi> (the bud outwards) try in the hole which way they will best stand against the wall; and if they have a head designed to remain for train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, place it carefully for the branches to be laid to; but keep the tree as <hi>far</hi> from the wall as <hi>may</hi> be, (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose eight or nine inches) that the roots may have the more room to strike behind: cut off, or shorten much all roots whose <hi>direction</hi> is towards the wall. Nail the tree to it, that wind may not disturb the roots.</p>
                  <p>In planting <hi>standards</hi> it will be proper to fix a <hi>stake</hi> near the stem to fasten the tree, in order to prevent the roots being disturbed by wind, which prevents their striking out new fibres; rocking about opens the ground also about the stem, and admits frost, by which a tree
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035770_0115_1006BBCAAE407C10"/>
is sometimes lost, or succeeds badly. This staking is best done while the holes are <hi>open,</hi> and the roots of the tree seen, as by driving a stake in afterwards, it might damage some principal root, and the hurting a root is to be avoided as much as bruising a branch. Take care to fix the stake firmly, and to tie the tree so with a hayband, that it may not easily get <hi>galled.</hi> Twist the band close round the tree first, and then round the stake and tree.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>late</hi> spring planting it will be found of good use to make a mixture (in a barrow) of <hi>fresh cow dung</hi> and <hi>fine mould,</hi> half and half, to put about the roots, which will greatly help to keep them cool, and plentifully to nourish them. In default of cow dung, a <hi>puddle</hi> of fine sifted mould and water will do. Or, if the soil is light, mix half mud from a pond or ditch.</p>
                  <p>Circumstances <hi>may</hi> occur to make <hi>summer</hi> planting desirable, if it could be safely done. It is certain that roots quickly strike in summer, and if the head of the tree is a little reduced, and some shading contrived for a while, even <hi>wall trees</hi> may be then planted with cow dung. But the <hi>greatest</hi> point in this business is, that the tree be not <hi>out</hi> of the ground so long as to dry the roots; by some means they should be kept cool, and if dried, put into pond water a few hours before planting. Trees thus planted will not need watering for a long time, and must not have it, for over moisture might rot the delicate new fibres.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The SOIL for planting fruit trees should be <hi>good,</hi> or nothing pleasing can be expected: It should be sweet and nourishing; and therefore if not naturally so, it is to be improved by art and labour. Tillage or breaking up a soil, to expose it to the atmosphere, is of much benefit. See article <hi>Soil,</hi> in the <hi>Formation of a Garden.</hi> Sect. 3.</p>
                  <p>It nothing more can be done at the <hi>present,</hi> at least make the ground fairly good where the tree is to be set. Two or three barrows of <hi>fresh</hi> earth, if of a good
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035770_0116_1006BBD1A23DFDC0"/>
quality, is preferable to dung: but if the soil really needs manure, let it be well incorporated by the spade; and work some rotten dung in <hi>deep,</hi> below the roots, which will be properly consumed before the new roots reach it.</p>
                  <p>In the case of only making the soil good for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the first opportunity, (or at least before the roots spread far) should be taken to extend the benefit as far as may be, even to several yards round; and let this work be done deep enough, or as low as the part made good for first planting, i. e. two feet, or as near upon it as the case will allow. In a few years this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention should be extended (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n bad soils) to where it may be thought <hi>possible</hi> for the roots to have reached. For want of this, a tree sometimes fails when just come to its full size and principal time for bearing. When roots reach a weak, ill conditioned, poisonous soil, the tree <hi>must</hi> fail; and it should be remembered that the <hi>extreme</hi> branches of the root are what chiefly nourish a plant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fruit trees</hi> (though they like a rather strong soil) will not prosper, or hardly grow, in a <hi>cold</hi> clay; but in a soil that is tolerable above they may be planted, by improving, or raising this as the case may require, and cautiously avoiding going into the clay. Some persons have laid flat stones, or tiles, below the root to a considerable distance, which perhaps may answer; but it seems advisable only to do it about a <hi>foot</hi> square, (or a little more,) as this may give the roots an hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal direction, which if they keep, all will be well.</p>
                  <p>It has been recommended to do this in <hi>all</hi> kinds of soil, in order to insure a more superficial spread, than without such contrivance could be expected.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>soil</hi> be good, and at the same time strong, above any bad soil, and the roots take to run towards the surface, it is surprising how trees will thus pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. When planting takes place <hi>superficially,</hi> let a hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock of earth be laid round the roots, and the tree se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035770_0117_1006BBD3440EA2A0"/>
by a stake for two or three years to hold it steady; and keep <hi>turf</hi> or <hi>moss</hi> about the root, till the tree is well established.</p>
                  <p>In a soil that trees are found to <hi>canker</hi> in, and get otherwise diseased, it is of no use (generally speaking) to <hi>wait</hi> their getting better; but if there is any spot of a more promising quality, trees that are not too old and far gone may be removed there, and perhaps recover, as it has often happened; but let the <hi>root</hi> be examined, as well as the head, to cut out any <hi>diseased</hi> part. If the shoots should be <hi>weak</hi> the first year, prune down close the second, and strong wood may possibly follow.</p>
                  <p>With respect to the <hi>soil</hi> that suits every <hi>particular</hi> kind of tree, there is some variety of opinions; and though it were clear what best agrees with each, yet trees must after all be planted in <hi>different</hi> soils, as each situation is. In what may be truly called a <hi>good</hi> soil, all trees will do very well, and in a bad one none will. No situation or management avails when the soil is poisonous, as some sorts are, by their coldness, acidity, sulphureous, or metallic qualities. Generally speaking, a true <hi>loam</hi> suits every thing. See <hi>Formation of a Garden,</hi> Sect. 3.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>soil</hi> that <hi>best</hi> suits each sort of tree, (though this be mentioned elsewhere in different places,) the following particulars seem to have a pretty common consent. <hi>Vines</hi> love a rich dry soil, gravelly or sandy, if it does not bind. <hi>Figs</hi> like much the same soil, though they need not so rich a one. <hi>Apri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ots</hi> flourish in a light loam; but <hi>peaches</hi> and <hi>nectarines</hi> should have a somewhat strong loam, and the latter needs the warmer or richer soil of the two. <hi>Pears</hi> like a strong but dry soil; <hi>apples</hi> a strong and a cool one, if it is not wet. <hi>Cherries, plums, walnuts,</hi> and <hi>mulberries</hi> prefer a dry, sandy, gravelly, or light soil, though they will grow in a stronger; notwithstanding plums do very well in a moist soil, and produce the larger fruit in it, yet the flavour is far inferior. <hi>Quinces</hi> flourish most
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035770_0118_1006BBD8B5C93210"/>
in a rich moist soil, by a brook or river's side, or where a rich wash from sinks, or dunghills, runs occasionally about their roots; in a dry soil their fruit is small, though higher flavoured: It is an universal rule, that fruits are forwarder and more grateful in warm soils, but of less size.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>vine</hi> be planted in a right soil, yet it will require to be fed and enlivened with some spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous manure, either in <hi>autumn</hi> or <hi>spring.</hi> For this purpose water impregnated with <hi>sheep's dung</hi> and fresh <hi>urin</hi> has been used. The top soil being removed, <hi>bullock's</hi> or <hi>hog's blood</hi> is sometimes applied; but a little <hi>sheep's dung,</hi> or that of <hi>poultry,</hi> dug in regularly every <hi>autumn,</hi> is a good, neat, standing rule. The dung of <hi>sheep</hi> and <hi>poultry</hi> should be used in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a tenth part of that of <hi>horses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That soils should be accommodated to each particular <hi>sort</hi> of tree, the analogy between plants and animals is reasonably urged; that as the latter require their <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> food, so do the former;—but it is to be observed, that plants receive a great deal of <hi>their</hi> nourishment from the <hi>air,</hi> and do not depend so much on the soil as is supposed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The SITUATION properest for planting any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kind of tree is to be considered; for some like a low, some a high, some a moist, some a dry situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it is spoken here chiefly of <hi>fruit trees.</hi> The <hi>general</hi> situation of a country, will in a measure rule; for though <hi>England</hi> be but an island, it has many <hi>cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> in it, and certain plants will do better in one place than another, (even within the space of a few miles,) as to effects from weather. The difference between hill and valley in the <hi>same</hi> place, is something, so that in the latter the tender blossoms of trees shall escape, when in the former, unkind winds shall cut them off:—not that valleys are always safe, for they have sometimes destructive n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Peas</hi> sown to stand the winter, in a garden on a hill, and in another only a hundred yards below, the former exposed, and the latter well sheltered, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate what situation will do; for the peas below will live when the others are cut off, and perhaps come in a week earlier, when both survive uninjured.</p>
                  <p>In very <hi>exposed</hi> situations, especially <hi>northwards,</hi> little <hi>fruit</hi> can be expected from the more delicate <hi>wall trees;</hi> it is prudent therefore to avoid planting in cold places the <hi>tenderest,</hi> or the <hi>earliest,</hi> or the <hi>latest</hi> sorts.</p>
                  <p>The difference of <hi>latitude</hi> between <hi>Middlesex</hi> and <hi>Northamptonshire</hi> makes commonly a fortnight in the coming in of many of the productions of the garden; so that, generally speaking, what is called an <hi>October</hi> peach is of little worth in the latter country, though in the former it may do well; except there is plenty of walling for <hi>experiment,</hi> therefore never think of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing late fruit in a bleak aspect.</p>
                  <p>The farther <hi>north,</hi> however, is not a certain rule for the productions of the garden being <hi>proportionally</hi> later; for in some parts of <hi>yorkshire</hi> they produce veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etables and fruits, nearly as early as about <hi>London.</hi> This has been ascribed to subterraneous heat from coal beds or minerals, acting as natural hot-beds; but it may be attributed simply to a rich, warm, and deep soil, having gravel below it, especially when in a valley sheltered by winds on the cold side. It has been observed, "in some grounds in the same climate, fruit will ripen fifteen days, or more, before some others, not far off from them, in ground of a different temper." A <hi>happy</hi> soil is therefore the great <hi>desidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> in gardening.</p>
                  <p>With regard to <hi>situation,</hi> we should consider the garden <hi>itself,</hi> and not plant choice fruits in a cold or shaded part of it: the <hi>aspect</hi> must be good for them as well as the soil. From an error of this sort, <hi>Vines</hi> have frequently been planted and pruned for years, producing nothing but wood and leaves.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Figs</hi> and <hi>vines, nectarines</hi> and <hi>peaches</hi> should have a <hi>full</hi> sun, or little fruit can be expected from them; and <hi>Apricots</hi> ought to have a good share of it, though they do very well (in some places) against an <hi>east</hi> wall, and sometimes against a <hi>west.</hi> An <hi>east</hi> aspect is not so safe as a <hi>south</hi> one, as to the embryo fruit at the time of blossoming, nor does it bring the <hi>apricots</hi> so forward; but the fruit is commonly better: it has the earliest sun all the morning, and the benefit of a gentle warmth afterwards, by the wall, (the sun shining hot on the other side,) if the tree is nailed properly close. See <hi>Formation of a Garden,</hi> articles <hi>Situation</hi> and <hi>Aspect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From what has been said on <hi>situation,</hi> the young gardener will be led to make some discrimination in planting, and not hope to succeed when working against nature. If his garden is small, let him contract his desires, and proceed upon sure grounds: but if large, experiments and risks are not of much conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Favourable and unfavourable seasons make a great difference; but hope should have a foundation, and we cannot expect a fortunate end, without the use, of probable means.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The SEASON for planting is a matter of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, though some persons are apt to neglect it who should, and do, know better. The proper rule is, to plant as <hi>early</hi> in the season as can be; so that if the ground is ready, trees had best be put in when the leaves <hi>begin</hi> to fall, i. e. in <hi>October,</hi> yet some good planters have recommended an earlier time than this; and scruple not to plant all the latter half of <hi>September,</hi> though the leaves be full on. Some trees will form fresh roots in the winter, and those which do not, get so united with the earth, and prepared for starting in the spring, that they are ready to answer a supply of juices much more freely than when late planted; and consequently the new shoots <hi>

                     </hi> be stronger. Let nothing but necessity put off planting in <hi>autumn,</hi> except

indeed the soil be naturally wet and then the work done early in spring is proper.</p>
                  <p>The season for planting in a dry soil <hi>may</hi> be all winter for <hi>deciduous</hi> trees, i. e. those that leave their leaves; but all <hi>evergreens</hi> (except the <hi>Scotch sir,</hi> which may be planted at any time,) should be moved <hi>early</hi> in autumn, or <hi>late</hi> in spring, and rather the latter, as they are somewhat uncertain in taking kindly to the ground, especially if the weather is unfavourable at the time of planting. The <hi>oak</hi> and <hi>larch</hi> (though deciduous) are removed safest in the spring. In spring-planting, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways give a sound watering at the time, and it late in the spring repeat it once a week in dry weather.</p>
                  <p>Let even the meanest trees and shrubs, as <hi>currants, gooseberries</hi> and <hi>raspberries</hi> have the like attention paid to them as to their superiors; for their fruit will prove the finer, and the argument is cogent for an <hi>October</hi> planting of these, as they are to bear the next season. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <head>OF SHRUBS, SHRUBBERIES, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>WE are indebted to SHRUBS for much of the pleasure we enjoy in our gardens and planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and they justly merit every care, though they produce us no (or few) <hi>edible</hi> fruits. They assist in forming an agreeable shade, they afford a great variety of flowers with leaves differently tinged, and are standard <hi>ornaments</hi> that give us no great trouble.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>shrubs</hi> too little care (however) in general is taken to <hi>plant</hi> them properly, or even to choose good plants for the purpose; and hence they often <hi>fail</hi> to flourish, and are mortifying us with a dwindling growth, and unhealthy appearance, when they should have become objects of admiration.</p>
                  <p>Many <hi>shrubs,</hi> are raised from <hi>suckers,</hi> others from <hi>layers,</hi> some from <hi>cuttings,</hi> and most may be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from <hi>seeds,</hi> which though the slowest method, generally produces the finest plants. Before they are planted out for <hi>ornaments,</hi> they should be trained two or three years in a nursery, to be formed into a full and proper <hi>head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though <hi>deciduous</hi> shrubs may be planted almost at any time, yet <hi>October,</hi> is much the best month, especially if a moist season; the exception being made as to a cold wet soil, in which all sorts of planting (as observed before) is best done in spring.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Evergreen</hi> shrubs must be cautiously planted, and should not be ventured upon in winter, and even in autumn and spring ought not to be meddled with in
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035770_0123_1006BBE79FACBBF0"/>
harsh weather: drying winds are apt presently to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure their roots. It is a good rule, let the weather be what it will, and the sorts what they may, to expose the roots to the air no longer than can be helped; <hi>evergreens</hi> should therefore be immediately planted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are taken up, and their roots also very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preserved whole.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>shrubberies, clumps,</hi> &amp;c. are often made on poor or indifferent ground, the soil should be previously cleared, dug, and <hi>trenched,</hi> and that as long before planting as may be. For <hi>spring</hi> planting, this work ought to be done in <hi>autumn</hi> or in <hi>winter,</hi> that the soil may have the benefit of frosts, and other helps from the atmosphere, which is a circumstance of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence in the case.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tillage</hi> not only saves manure, but is superior to it, where time can be allowed exhausted ground. In planting <hi>shrubs</hi> and <hi>trees,</hi> it is desirable to do without <hi>dung,</hi> as much as possible; and therefore a little <hi>foot,</hi> or <hi>turf-ashes,</hi> &amp;c. sprinkled over the ridges of trenched ground is proper; and if the trenches were turned over once a month, the advantage would be fully answerable to the trouble.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>spring</hi> is, on the whole, rather the fittest time for moving <hi>evergreen</hi> shrubs, and as the <hi>deciduous</hi> sorts do then also very well, <hi>shrubberies</hi> and <hi>clumbs</hi> will prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly enough be the work of <hi>March,</hi> a little earlier or later, according to the soil and season. Light sandy soils should always be planted in good time, and any fair weather that appears settled, should not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> however, is by some reckoned the best season for planting shrubs. A good medium way is to plant the <hi>deciduous</hi> sorts the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>March;</hi> and, leaving places for the <hi>evergreen</hi> kinds, plant them the end of <hi>March,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>April.</hi> But it were still a better way (if the ground is in order) to plant <hi>deciduous</hi> shrubs in autumn, and the <hi>evergreen</hi> sorts in spring.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="unknown:035770_0124_1006BBEDC4BE14B0"/>
If <hi>autumn</hi> be the season fixed for planting, it will be proper before the frost comes in to cover the roots of shrubs, and especially of <hi>evergreens,</hi> with litter, and indeed at <hi>spring</hi> it is proper to do so; for neither <hi>frost</hi> nor <hi>drought</hi> should be suffered to affect new planted trees, or shrubs. It will be proper to have the outside plants of a new shrubbery, towards the sun, covered about the roots all summer.</p>
                  <p>What has been said of the <hi>act</hi> (or method) of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>fruit trees,</hi> should be observed of shrubs. In dressing the roots of shrubs, shorten them moderately, prune the heads so as to form them handsomely. Settle the ground to the roots by watering, and leave a little hollow about them for future watering, if the season should require it. Let the taller plants be tied to stakes, as the wind is apt to disturb them, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their speedy rooting.</p>
                  <p>The proper <hi>disposition</hi> of shrubs, where there are many to be planted, should be considered in several particulars; for the beauty and prosperity of a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, depends greatly upon it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>distances</hi> must be according to the <hi>size</hi> they usually attain. Some grow off slow at first, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards get large; but still these should be rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in a middling way, otherwise the ground will be a long time naked. Some sorts will require not more than a three feet distance, others four, five, or six; but as they are small, when planted, and perhaps much of a size, the <hi>future</hi> height and spread, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>not</hi> considered.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>situation,</hi> to accommodate them as well as may be, according to their <hi>tender</hi> or <hi>hardy</hi> nature, should be attended to; not to plant evergreen shrubs, or the more delicate deciduous sorts, on the outside towards the <hi>N.</hi> or <hi>N. E.</hi> and as there may be a variety and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity in the ground, the lower parts and deeper soil may be more suitable to some, and the higher and shallower may suit (or at least do very well for) others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="unknown:035770_0125_1006BBF30CDDDA90"/>
                     <hi>Tender</hi> shrubs should not only be sheltered for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, but be planted in a <hi>dry</hi> spot open to the fun: Some things will live abroad in a dry and poor soil, that would seldom survive a winter in a rich and moist one. The more towering sorts must be placed behind, and the less so before them, <hi>gradually</hi> declining to the low growing ones, in a sort of <hi>theatrical</hi> order: This is necessary in a <hi>shrubbery,</hi> and indeed all plantations, but more so in the disposition of plants in <hi>clumps,</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the centre high, and falling gradually towards the edge. Thus the stems, and naked parts of the higher plants are hid by those before them, and the whole appears to the eye a full scene of verdure.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>season</hi> of shrubs flowering and leafing is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial point to provide for, by a proper distribution, that there may be a sprinkling of decoration every month, in every part. And in this business, an equally dispersed mixture of the evergreen, and deciduous sorts is necessary to be observed.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>proportion</hi> of this mixture it will depend upon taste, and the opportunity of procuring the one sort or the other; but the circumstance may direct (in a measure) whether the plantation of shrubs be about the <hi>house,</hi> or at a distance from it. In the former case, more <hi>evergreens</hi> should be made use of, as in sight in winter: generally speaking, perhaps, one evergreen, and two deciduous shrubs, or one and three, may form an agreeable shrubbery for view at all times.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>regularity</hi> in planting shrubs is not necessary as to <hi>lines,</hi> but is rather to be avoided, except just in the front, where there should always be some low ones, and a border for <hi>flowers,</hi> chiefly of the <hi>spring,</hi> as sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ones are apt to be drawn up weak, if the shrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery walks are not very wide. The flowers should be of the lowest growth, and rather bulbous rooted. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the edge may be planted <hi>aconites, snow-drops, crocusses, primroses, violets, polyanthuses, hepaticas, wood anemonies, daffodils, cowslips,</hi> &amp;c. In open shrubberies

an edging of <hi>strawberries</hi> is proper, and the <hi>hautboy</hi> preferable, on account of its superior show when in flower; but in these situations the <hi>wood</hi> strawberry is more commonly planted, as it will produce fruit with less sun and air.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>management</hi> of a plantation of shrubs comes next be considered. It should be kept <hi>clean,</hi> or much o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When moss can be <hi>seen,</hi> it has then got ahead, and will be got rid of with difficulty. The usual time for <hi>pruning</hi> and <hi>digging</hi> about shrubs is <hi>spring;</hi> but <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn</hi> is better, if the plants are well established in the ground, and especially if got old and full of roots. The <hi>pruning</hi> should not be late, (<hi>October</hi> best) as <hi>some</hi> sorts are apt to die down; these, however, might be left to spring, or only shortened in part: They should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly be kept free from <hi>suckers</hi> and <hi>luxuriant</hi> wood. See <hi>pruning of shrubs.</hi> An autumn <hi>digging</hi> of an old shrubbery does much good, by the benefit which the soil receives from frost, and cutting some of the ends of the roots, by which new ones strike. This autumn dressing is particularly to be recommended as lessening the work of spring, the hurry of which season some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occasions, shrubberies to be neglected <hi>too</hi> long, and to be but partially attended to.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>suchers</hi> or young <hi>plants,</hi> found in digging and dressing about shrubs are often left carelessly on the ground, but if likely to be <hi>wanted</hi> ought to have their roots buried as soon as possible: Why should they be suffered to wither and spoil, because they <hi>may</hi> recover?</p>

                  <p>PLANTING of <hi>forest trees,</hi> in some extent or other, may be an object with some young gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners, and those who have a taste this way, and ground to exercise it on, will amuse themselves in a
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035770_0128_1006BBFF9F4E5FB0"/>
very <hi>respectable</hi> manner by so doing. Let the work be set about with all speed and resolution; for every year lost is to be lamented, both in a public and private view.</p>
                  <p>What if <hi>forest trees</hi> produce nothing for the table, or no <hi>immediate</hi> profit, they afford in their planting and nursing, present entertainment of a very grateful and kind; they may ever after be viewed as objects of sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction, and friends, neighbours, and <hi>posterity</hi> will have reason to praise the work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plantations</hi> of forest trees do very much ornament a country, and there are some grounds peculiarly situated to become objects of <hi>delight</hi> in this respect, which could not be better employed. A place without trees appears disagreeably naked, and being destitute of one of the most useful materials for buildings, utensils, &amp;c. is in truth to be lamented as unfurnished and forlorn. The demand for <hi>wood</hi> is perpetual, and the consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is great; and therefore a provision for generations to come, by planting of <hi>forest trees,</hi> must afford the sincerest, (because most disinterested) gratifications of pleasure to the mind.</p>
                  <p>Though every one has not ground to form <hi>planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of any considerable extent, yet if it were only a single tree here and there, i. e. to do what little <hi>might</hi> be in this way, it would shew a worthy spirit, and make a man an honourable benefactor to society. <hi>Corners</hi> of fields might have little clumps conveniently planted, without much expense of fencing. A few trees might be planted in, or rather just without <hi>hedge rows;</hi> but these should be chiefly <hi>oaks.</hi> It is a practice with some, to plant trees in hedges when first made; but they are commonly too small, and so the quick choaks them, and they never thrive.</p>
                  <p>The planting of <hi>forest trees</hi> is <hi>profitable</hi> as well as pleasing and respectable; and a young planter may live to <hi>reap</hi> much reward from his labour, or he may leave a valuable inheritance to his children. "The
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035770_0129_1006BC071AFBE1F8"/>
plantation and care of timber is like buying the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of an estate—for a little money expended, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heirs to great sums.—In countries scarce of firing, and where poles and rails are wanted, <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> will pay the proprietor triple more value than the best fields of corn, and the <hi>oaks</hi> among it remain a great estate to succeeding generations." <hi>Poor</hi> land, that does not answer for <hi>corn,</hi> would be profitable cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated in <hi>wood;</hi> but such ground should be <hi>sown,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than planted. Wet ground may be advantageously planted with the amphibious tribe, as <hi>willow, sallow, withy, ozier, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For those who may be disposed to plant <hi>forest trees,</hi> the following directions are offered:—The <hi>manual</hi> work proper to this business, may be gathered from what has been already said on planting <hi>fruit trees</hi> and <hi>shrubs;</hi> and though plantations of <hi>forest trees,</hi> need not be so nicely attended to as fruit trees, yet the <hi>better</hi> the work is performed, the fairer is the prospect in grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>good timber;</hi> a <hi>check</hi> by an error at first planting is a loss of time, and a damage done to trees which is sometimes never recovered. To give an instance:—the mould is often thrown on the roots of a forest tree in <hi>lumps,</hi> when if it were <hi>sifted,</hi> so as just to cover them with fine mould, the trouble would be amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid by the quick striking of the roots, and future strength of the tree.</p>
                  <p>Ground <hi>designed</hi> for planting should be <hi>prepared</hi> as long as it can beforehand, by the use of the plough or spade; and if some sort of previous cultivation, either in <hi>corn</hi> or <hi>vegetables,</hi> were adopted, the soil would be better fitted to receive the trees. At any rate, the places where the trees are to be set, should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viously dug somewhat deep, and cleared of rubbish, perennial weeds, twitch, &amp;c. If wet let it be properly drained, for none but those of the <hi>aquotics</hi> kind can do well in a cold and very moist soil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="unknown:035770_0130_1006BC0DD591F518"/>
In <hi>open</hi> planting for timber, to make only the holes good where the trees are set, is sufficient, if the soil is not strong, (which generally speaking however it should be,) and in such plantations the plough being used for <hi>corn,</hi> or some crops to be carried off, the whole soil will be prepared for the roots to spread. A plantation of this sort may be constantly under the plough, till the trees shade too much, and then it may be sown down for <hi>grass,</hi> which laying warm, and coming early, would be found useful. The opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity given to <hi>improve</hi> a soil by this intermediate culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, would insure very fine timber.</p>
                  <p>But a <hi>plantation</hi> of trees being made (as suppose of <hi>oaks</hi>) at due distances, and the ground ploughed for a year or two, while they got a little a-head, then it might be <hi>sown</hi> profitably with nuts, keys and seeds for <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> observing to thin the plants the second year, and again the third, till two or three feet asunder in poor ground, and to three or four feet distance if rich. In fourteen or fifteen years, (or much sooner for some purposes,) the <hi>ash poles,</hi> &amp;c. will be <hi>fine,</hi> and meet with a ready sale as useful stuff; and afterwards the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> will be fit to cut, in a strong state, every eleven or twelve years. In the management of underwood, some have thinned the plants while young, to three feet asunder, and cut them down at three years, to about six inches, to form <hi>stools,</hi> which in about ten years are cut, having produced several stems from each. Some persons have cut seedling trees down at this age to three inches for <hi>timber,</hi> leaving only one strong shoot to grow from each stool; and thus finer trees are frequently (or rather certainly) produced, then from seedlings not cut down.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>distances</hi> of the timber plants, may be from twenty-five to thirty-five feet, according to the soil, or opinion of the planter. If no view to <hi>underwood,</hi> the above <hi>open</hi> planting may be made close, by setting first the <hi>principals</hi> (which should be fine plants) and then
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:035770_0131_1006BC0F90EA5280"/>
filling up with others that are worse, to within about eight or nine feet of one another. They will at this distance come to fair <hi>timber,</hi> or may be thinned at pleasure; and even among these a small crop of <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> might be had, which would shelter the timber plants, and help to draw them up strait and tall.</p>
                  <p>As to small plantations, of <hi>thickets, coppices, clumps,</hi> and <hi>sows</hi> of trees, they are to be set close according to their <hi>nature,</hi> and the particular view the planter has, who will take care to consider the usual size they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and their <hi>mode</hi> of growth. An advantage at home for shade or shelter, and a more distant object of sight, will make a difference: for some immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate advantage, <hi>very</hi> close planting may take place, but good trees cannot be thus expected; yet if thinned <hi>in time,</hi> a strait tall stem is often thus procured, which afterwards is of great advantage.</p>
                  <p>For little <hi>clumps,</hi> or <hi>groupes</hi> of forest trees, (as elms) there may be planted three or four in a spot, within five or six feet of one another, and thus be easily fenced: having the air freely all round, and a good soil, such clumps produce fine timber.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Single trees</hi> of every sort, grow off apace, and are more beautiful than when in the neighbourhood of others, and particularly <hi>firs, pines, larches, limes,</hi> and <hi>chesnuts:</hi> the <hi>edible</hi> fruited <hi>chesnut</hi> is only good for timber; but the <hi>horse</hi> is very ornamental; flourishing however only on high dry ground. As to <hi>rows</hi> of trees, whether single or double, when planted for a <hi>screen,</hi> they may be set about seven or eight feet asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, upon an average, according to their nature, taking care to prune them occasionally, from too galling an interference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Avenues</hi> are now seldom planted, but when they are, two good rows of <hi>elms, limes, chesnuts,</hi> &amp;c. should be set at the width of the house, at full thirty feet distance in the rows; to thicken which, intermediate plants may be set; and also an inner row, to be removed
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035770_0132_1006BC151BB6B618"/>
when the principal trees are full grown. <hi>Avenues</hi> to prospects, should be fifty or sixty feet wide.</p>
                  <p>The best season for planting the <hi>deciduous</hi> kinds of forest trees, is the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> and <hi>evergreen</hi> sorts, the latter end of <hi>March;</hi> though the soil, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er light and dry, or heavy and wet, should somewhat direct; evergreen trees being to be planted generally with safety, early in autumn, if the soil is warm; but in all cases trees should be planted in <hi>dry</hi> weather, that the mould may be loose to drop in, and lie close between the roots, which is a <hi>material</hi> thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Forest trees</hi> for planting are generally preferred ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther large, and being so, should not be taken up <hi>idly,</hi> but with as much of an uninjured spread of roots as possible: yet, free growing plants of about three or four feet high, promise in the <hi>end</hi> to make finer trees than those that are planted larger. Some say they are best at this size from the <hi>seed bed;</hi> and others, that having grown on the seed bed two years, and been once planted out, as having had their tap roots cut, they will do better, and generally speaking this is the case, as they have a more bushy and horizontal foot.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>act</hi> of planting, let every thing be done as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for fruit trees; i. e. the hole dug wide and deep, the ground well broken, or rather sifted, to lay about the roots, &amp;c. A sound <hi>watering</hi> may take place, and the trees made fast by stakes, and litter laid about their roots to keep out frost and drought. It is of much consequence to take care that the roots (especially of <hi>evergreen</hi> trees) do not get withered before planted. <hi>Evergreens</hi> do best in a dry, but <hi>deciduous</hi> forest trees (generally) in a moist soil, if it is not wet. <hi>Oaks</hi> in particular, though at first they may appear to do poorly, grow well in strong and moist ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fencing</hi> is the last thing to be considered. If trees are planted where cattle go, their stems must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from barking and rubbing. The common way of small posts and little rails, is well known; but if
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035770_0133_1006BC1A81CCF7D0"/>
large cattle are not fed where the trees are, good thorns stuck round them, and tied to them, is sufficient, and indeed this might do in almost all cases. There are various ways, and whatever mode is used, let it be at first well executed, and afterwards repaired in time, as often as there is need. Something concerning the <hi>raising</hi> of forest trees will be found at page 78.</p>
                  <p>Whoever plants <hi>forest trees,</hi> should take care to <hi>dress</hi> them by proper pruning, and suffering no suckers to remain about their roots. Their <hi>tops</hi> should be kept equal, and not permitted to spread too much in heavy branches, but trained in a light and spiral way; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preserving the leading shoot, to encourage <hi>mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which is the perfection of a forest tree. The <hi>stems</hi> of all trees designed for timber, should be constantly, and <hi>timely</hi> attended to, as it is necessary to rub off buds, or to cut off the side shoots, except here and there a small one, which may serve to detain the sap to the swelling of the trunk; but branches being left on of any strength, keep the tree from mounting, and draw it crooked, and such branches, if cut off when large, occasion, knots, and sometimes a decay at the part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plantations,</hi> growing thick, should, be <hi>thinned</hi> in time, but not too much at once, especially in hilly situations; for as those trees which remain, come sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to be exposed, (after having been brought up under the shelter of others) suffer much; getting crooked, stunted, and bushy, instead of having their desirable erect from, without which they are not adapted for superior uses, or are agreeable to the eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ornamental trees,</hi> as the <hi>crab, black cherry,</hi> &amp;c. may prove profitable, as well as agreeable, here and there one amongst forest trees, and should therefore not be omitted.</p>

                  <head>OF RURAL AND EXTENSIVE GARDENING.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RURAL and extensive gardening</hi> is naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with a taste for planting <hi>forest trees;</hi> and an idea of the <hi>picturesque</hi> should ever accompany the work of planting. Merely for the sake of <hi>objects</hi> to gratify the <hi>eye,</hi> planting is very often pursued, and wherever trees can be introduced to improve a view from the <hi>house,</hi> or accustomed walks, <hi>there</hi> a man, having it in his power, as proprietor of the land, ought to plant.</p>
                  <p>If to planting in <hi>clumps, coppices, groves, avenues,</hi> and <hi>woods,</hi> be added levelling of ground, improving of water courses, and pastures, making lawns, &amp;c. the expense incurred would be <hi>honourable,</hi> and answered by pleasures of the sincerest kind! There are ways of spending money, that <hi>could</hi> be named, which are found mischievous in the extreme, and are therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly branded with disgrace; but he who distributes wealth into the hands of <hi>industry,</hi> working to useful purposes, and that delectable end of making the country about him, as it were, a <hi>garden,</hi> does it in wisdom.</p>
                  <p>Yet here some <hi>caution</hi> may be necessary. "Do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too much," is a wise maxim. Building, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gardening, upon a <hi>large</hi> scale, have been sometimes attended with <hi>serious</hi> consequences, as when a man's fortune has not been equal to the undertaking. It were desirable to be able to persuade to great things in this way; but prudence must guide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="unknown:035770_0135_1006BC23D38B2C80"/>
Those who would do much in <hi>rural and extensive gardening,</hi> should not be forward to trust to their own taste altogether, though they may be ingenious. In this business there is no making <hi>experiments,</hi> but all should be executed, as much as possible, upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. There are <hi>professional</hi> man in this way, whose peculiar practice, and appropriate talents, will enable <hi>them</hi> to conceive improvements, and the best manner of executing them, which could scarcely be projected by any private person. There is a variety of works and decorations in extensive gardening which injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously introduced, might create a wasteful expense. This is an error that <hi>ought</hi> to be avoided, and most probably would be, by those who have been in the habit of studying nature, and the powers of art, as her submissive handmaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Artificial decorations</hi> are at this time much less made use of than formerly, and the grandeur of past times in the way of gardening would <hi>now</hi> be thought trifling and mean. Witness the sheard trees, statues, vases, water works, figured parterres, &amp;c. of that style of gardening, imitated from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which has been long deemed a mere burlesque upon Nature, the grand characteristics of which are <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>simplicity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The pleasure we seek in <hi>laying out</hi> gardens, is now justly founded upon the principles of <hi>concealed art,</hi> which appears like Nature; but still, whether inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious contrivances and decorations, (altogether artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,) should be so entirely laid aside as they are, may deserve to be considered. Gardens, were formerly loaded with <hi>statues,</hi> and great improprieties were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in placing them, as <hi>Neptune</hi> in a grove, and <hi>Vulcan</hi> at a fountain, large figures in small gardens, and small in large, &amp;c. but, perhaps, works of the statuary might still be introduced, and the meeting with <hi>Flora, Ceres,</hi> or <hi>Pomona,</hi> &amp;c. well executed, and in proper places, could hardly give offence. A <hi>terrace</hi> as a boundary, is now seldom formed, but in
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:035770_0136_1006BC2DC8BB4290"/>
                     <hi>some</hi> situations, such an eminence might in several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects be agreeable.</p>
                  <p>It would certainly be too much to attempt here par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular directions; for extensive gardening. The <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> capabilities of any place must suggest what may be done, and <hi>much</hi> judgment is necessary to plan aright. It is presumed only to give a few <hi>hints</hi> to those private persons who would do something in this way, which they may consider as they please.</p>
                  <p>If trees are <hi>planted</hi> injudiciously, the error is a trifle; but if <hi>cut down</hi> so, the consequence is serious, and has often been sorely lamented; extirpation should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be <hi>well</hi> thought of before it is executed; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally trees about houses, for many dwellings have been thus too hastily exposed, and deprived of a comfortable shelter and shade. And why should a taste have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed for so <hi>sudden</hi> a transition, no sooner out of the house than to arrive in the open country, or why should an extensive garden be thrown as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible into a <hi>single</hi> view, when meeting with new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in our walks is so agreeable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hilly spots,</hi> that are in view of the house should be planted with <hi>firs,</hi> as pleasant noble looking trees, and very hardy. <hi>Beech</hi> does well on high ground, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if chalky. In low ground, not to mention. <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and that tribe, the <hi>birch,</hi> and even the <hi>oak,</hi> should not be forgot, where the wet does not long stand.</p>
                  <p>About the houses some <hi>shady</hi> walks ought always to be provided, by thick planting, if not of trees, yet of flowering shrubs, and <hi>evergreens,</hi> of which the <hi>laurel</hi> will be found the most useful. Here should be also a good portion of grass plat, or <hi>lawn,</hi> which so delights the eye when neatly kept, also borders of shewy <hi>flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> which, if backed by any kind of fence, it should be hid with evergreens, or at least with deciduous shrubs, that the scene may be as much as possible vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacious. If there is good room, <hi>single</hi> trees of the <hi>fir</hi> kind, at due distances, are admirable ornaments about
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035770_0137_1006BC2FC9971018"/>
a house, and clumps of shrubs all of the <hi>same</hi> kind have a good effect.</p>
                  <p>Those who have <hi>much</hi> space of ground to decorate, do well to plant trees and shrubs of <hi>every</hi> kind, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the sources of amusement, and affording op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for observation; but if the allotment of ground for this purpose is <hi>contracted,</hi> then, of course, those <hi>only</hi> should be planted, which by their neat fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liage, natural symmetry, and gay flowers, may be truly esteemed <hi>ornamented.</hi> They should be such as strike the eye of persons in <hi>general,</hi> though they have nothing of singularity to engage the attention of the curious in plants. It too often happens, that good <hi>old</hi> sorts of trees, shrubs, and flowers, are excluded for <hi>new</hi> ones, but if the latter are <hi>not</hi> more elegant, and generally pleasing, the practice is surely not a wise one: in ornamental gardening, on a <hi>small</hi> scale, great care should be taken, in the choice of what is really pretty, that nothing dull or rambling be introduced.</p>
                  <p>In the most <hi>sheltered</hi> place near the house, there should be an <hi>enclosure</hi> of a compact nature, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of <hi>yew,</hi> or <hi>hornbeam</hi> (rather the former) open only to the <hi>South,</hi> as a necessary apartment to place things in from the <hi>greenhouse,</hi> or occasionally the <hi>hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi> tender <hi>annuals,</hi> or any hardy <hi>curious</hi> potted plants, for a summer residence. For this purpose, or for <hi>hedges</hi> to separate, or divide any spot of ground, the <hi>hop hornbeam</hi> is best, as the <hi>common</hi> sort holds its dead leaves all the <hi>winter,</hi> and makes a litter at <hi>spring.</hi> This business, however, may be easily effected by planting <hi>elder</hi> cuttings at a foot asunder, which will grow up quickly, being kept moist.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>walks</hi> should always be <hi>wide,</hi> some (in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) serpentine, and contrived as much as possible up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>level,</hi> as walking up and down hills can hardly be called pleasure. That they may be extensive, they should skirt the grounds and seldom go across them. In small pleasure grounds the <hi>edges</hi> of the walks should
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035770_0138_1006BC360E2E95B0"/>
be regularly planted with flowers, and long ones oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally so, or with the most dwarf shrubs; and neat sheltered compartments of <hi>flowers,</hi> (every now and then to be met with) have a pretty effect. If the walks are extended to distant plantations of <hi>forest trees,</hi> every opportunity should be taken, to introduce some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the herbaceous <hi>flowery</hi> kind, which will prove the more pleasing, as found in unexpected situations: The outer walk of pleasure grounds and plantations, should every now and then break into open views of the country, and to parts of the internal space, made pleasing, if not striking, by some ornaments of art and nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Water</hi> should only be introduced in full sight, where it will run itself <hi>clear,</hi> or may be easily kept so, ought to be kept in full sight; and some <hi>fall</hi> of it should be contrived, (if possible,) for the sake of giving it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and sound, because a lively scene of this element is always much more pleasant than a dead one. Every <hi>spring</hi> of water should be made the most of, and though <hi>fountains jets d'eau;</hi> &amp;c. are out of fashion, something of this kind is agreeable enough. Near some piece of <hi>water,</hi> as a cool retreat, it is desirable that there should be something of the <hi>summer-house</hi> kind, and why not the simple rustic <hi>arbour,</hi> embowered with the <hi>wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blue,</hi> the <hi>sweetbriar,</hi> the <hi>jasmine,</hi> and the <hi>rose?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before the design of a (rural and extensive) <hi>garden</hi> be put in execution, it ought to be considered, what it will be in twenty or thirty years time; for it often happens, that a design that looks handsome when it is first planted, and in good proportion, becomes so small and ridiculous in process of time, that there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary either to alter it, or destroy it entirely, and so plant it now." This observation of Mr. <hi>Millar's,</hi> justifies the advice given of employing the most <hi>skilful</hi> in planning and directing pleasure grounds. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the breadth of walks, the size of carpets, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and levelling of grounds, parterres, &amp;c. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035770_0139_1006BC38A6402510"/>
of fountains, statues, vases, dials, and other dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orations of magnificence to most advantage, requires a <hi>particular address,</hi> says Mr. <hi>Evelyn,</hi> or to speak more emphatically, <hi>a prophetic eye;</hi> and though the taste is not now what it was in Mr. <hi>Evelyn's</hi> time, yet, perhaps, the only difference is, that <hi>more</hi> skill is requisite.</p>
                  <p>What has been said of the <hi>difficulty</hi> of rural and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive gardening, is meant only as advice to proceed with cautious steps. The work is truly of the most worthy nature, and a taste for it deserves to be cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished. Mr. <hi>Shenstone,</hi> in an ode on <hi>rural elegance,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends his favourite employment thus:

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Shenstone</hi> succeeded admirably in laying out his grounds, and producing a delightful scene about the <hi>Leasowes.</hi> Several <hi>gentlemen</hi> have done great things in picturesque gardening, without the assistance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessional artists; but they have had a peculiar talent this way, improved by study and observation. Thus Mr. <hi>Walpole</hi> makes an easy affair of it, and says, "the possessor, it he has <hi>any</hi> taste, is the best designer of his own grounds." And indeed, as they have come so frequently under his own eye and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he must, in a <hi>great</hi> measure, be competent to the work; and at least, ought not to give up his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>too</hi> implicitly to general undertakers of rural gardening.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ornamental gardening</hi> depends much on the form of the <hi>ground,</hi> and therefore to shape <hi>that</hi> is the first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:035770_0141_1006BC43C89F61D8"/>
Some situations may not need it, and, perhaps, a little alteration may produce a happy effect in others; therefore great alterations should not be attempted without manifest advantages, as either levelling, or raising ground, is a heavier business than is commonly supposed.</p>
                  <p>Too much <hi>plain</hi> is to be guarded against, and when it abounds, the eye should be relieved, by <hi>clumps</hi> or some other agreeable object. <hi>Hollows</hi> are not easily filled, and <hi>ominences,</hi> in general, are advantageous in the formation of <hi>picturesque scenes,</hi> in which the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> principle of ornamental gardening consists. This idea has been pressed so far, that it is contended, a gar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r should be a <hi>painter,</hi> or at least a studier of paintings. But without an immediate view to pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, no doubt, grounds may be laid out in a way sufficiently picturesque. That view may be very agreeable in Nature, which would not be so in a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>vice versa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Picturesque gardening</hi> is effected by a number of means, which a true rural genius, and the study of examples, only can produce. These examples may be <hi>pictures,</hi> but the better instructions will be scenes in <hi>Nature;</hi> and the proper grouping of trees, according to their mode of growth, and their shades of green, and appearance in autumn will effect a great deal.</p>
                  <p>To plant <hi>picturesquely</hi> a knowledge of the <hi>character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istic</hi> differences of trees and shrubs, is, evidently, a principal qualification. Some trees spread their branches wide, others grow spiral, and some conical; some have a close foliage, others an open one, and some form regular, others irregular heads, the branches and leaves of which may grow erect, level, or pendent.</p>
                  <p>The mode of growth in trees, as quick or slow, the time of lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing, and shedding leaf, with the colour of the bark, are all circumstances of consideration in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to produce striking contracts, and happy assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blages in the way of ornamental gardening.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="130" facs="unknown:035770_0142_1006BC4574195760"/>
To <hi>range</hi> the shrubs and small trees so that they mutually set off the beauties, and conceal the blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishes of each other; to aim at no effects which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on a nicety for their success, and which the soil, the exposure, or the season of the day, may destroy; to attend more to the groupes than to the individuals; and to consider the whole as a plantation, not as a collection of plants; are the best general rules which can be given concerning them.</p>
                     <p>In considering the subjects of gardening, ground and wood first present themselves; <hi>water</hi> is the next; which, though not absolutely necessary to a beautiful composition, yet occurs so often, and is so capital a feature, that it is always regretted when wanting; and no large place can be supposed, a little spot can hardly be imagined, in which it may not be agreeable. It accommodates itself to every situation; is the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresting object in a landscape, and the happiest cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance in a retired recess; captivates the eye at a distance, invites approach, and is delightful when near: it refreshes an open exposure; it animates a shade; cheers the dreariness of a waste, and enriches the most crowded view. In form, in style, and in extent, it may be made equal to the greatest compositions, or adapted to the least; it may spread in a calm expanse to soothe the tranquillity of a spaceful scene; or hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying along a devious course, and splendor to a gay, and extravagance to a romantic situation. So various are the characters which water can assume, that there is scarcely an idea in which it may not concur, or an impression which it cannot enforce.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>On the works of <hi>art</hi> in gardening, the following passage is pertinent. <hi>"Art</hi> was carried to excess, when ground, wood and water, were reduced to math<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ematical figure, and similarity and order were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to freedom and variety. These mischiefs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, were occasioned, not by the use, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:035770_0143_1006BC497150B9B0"/>
of art; it excluded, instead of improving upon nature, and thereby destroyed the very end it was called in to promote. Architecture requires symmetry, the objects of nature freedom; and the properties of the one, cannot, with justice, be transferred to the other. But if, by the term <hi>art,</hi> no more is meant than merely <hi>design,</hi> the dispute is at an end; choice, arrangement, composition, improvement, and preservation, are so many symptoms of <hi>art,</hi> which may occasionally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in several parts of a garden, but ought to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played without reserve near the <hi>house:</hi> nothing there should seem neglected; it is a scene of the most culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated nature: it ought to be enriched, it ought to be adorned; and design may be avowed in the plan, and expense in the execution. Even regularity is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: a capital structure may extend its influence beyond its walls: but this power should be exercised only over its immediate appendages. Works of <hi>sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> are not, like buildings, objects familiar in scenes of cultivated nature; but vases, statues, and termini, are usual appendages to a considerable edifice: as such, they may attend the mansion, and trespass a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon the garden, provided they are not carried so far into it as to lose their connection with the structure."</p>

                     <p>OF this "master work of gardening," it has been said, "that gentlemen prune too little, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners too much;" these extremes are to be avoided, as attended with peculiar evils, equally mischievous: <hi>Wall-trees</hi> are presently spoiled by either practice. If they are too full of wood, the shoots and fruits cannot be properly ripened, and if they are too thin, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of the cutting that has made them so, is the production of wood, rather than fruit, <hi>forcing</hi> out shoots, where otherwise blossom buds would have been formed. The designation of trees to a <hi>wall</hi> necessarily occasions cutting, and on the <hi>skilful</hi> use of the knife much depends; but let not the ingenious young gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener be discouraged at the appearance of difficulty; a little study, practice and perseverance will clear the way, and if he does not become a <hi>complete</hi> pruner at once, he will in a reasonable time, and the work will prove one of the pleasantest of rural amusements not attended with fatigue.</p>
                     <p>Every one who has wall-trees, cannot keep a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed</hi> gardener, nor is every one who <hi>calls</hi> himself so, qualified to prune properly. It is a great mortification to a man, who wishes to see his trees in order, not to be able to get an operator to attend them; let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to learn the art <hi>himself,</hi> and the ability will be very gratifying to him.</p>

                     <p>As many words must be used on this article of <hi>prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> for the sake of a little <hi>order,</hi> and the appearing less tedious, the business of managing <hi>wall-trees</hi> may be thus divided; 1. Concerning the FORM. 2. The HEALTH. 3. The FRUITFULNESS of them. A tree may be kept in good <hi>form,</hi> but be neither <hi>healthy</hi> nor <hi>fruitful,</hi> and may be both in good form and health yet not fruitful; but if it is fruitful, it must possess both the former qualifications.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the FORM, or general appearances of the wall trees. If a tree is newly planted, the first thing is to <hi>head</hi> it down, by cutting off (if it is a <hi>nectarine, peach,</hi> or <hi>apricot)</hi> all the shoots, and the stem itself, down to a few eyes, that the lower part of the wall may be furnished with new and strong wood. Make the cut sloping, and behind the tree, taking care (by placing the foot on the root, and the hand on the stem) not to disturb the tree by the pull of the knife. Plaster the part with a bit of cow dung and clay, or stiff earth, to keep the weather from it, and prevent an oozing of the sap: this is not generally done, but it is proper.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>heading down</hi> is to be made so as to leave two or three eyes, or at the most, four on each <hi>side</hi> of the stem, from which shoots will come properly placed for training. The number of eyes should be determined according to the strength of the tree, and its roots. If there are not two well placed eyes on each side of the stem, two <hi>shoots</hi> thus situated, may be left, cutting them short to two or three eyes each. Eyes, or shoots behind, or before, as being of no
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:035770_0146_1006BC59A882C9E0"/>
use, must be early displaced by rubbing, or cutting. This work is to be performed in spring, when the tree is putting forth shoots; i. e. about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>April.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If towards the end of <hi>May,</hi> there should be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shoots on either side, having, perhaps, only one put forth where two were expected, <hi>that</hi> one shoot should be cut, or pinched down, to two or three eyes, and before summer is over there will be found good shoots from them, and thus a proper head be obtained. This work of shortening shoots of the year may be do any time before <hi>Midsummer,</hi> but in this case, all illp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ed, or superfluous growths must be rubbed off <hi>as</hi> soon as seen, that those to be reserved may be the stronger.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>lateral</hi> shoots grow, let them be <hi>timely</hi> nailed to the wall, close, strait, and equidistant; but use no <hi>force</hi> while they are tender. If they are quite well placed, they will need to bending: but sometimes shoots must be laid is which are not perfectly so. Lay in as many good <hi>moderate</hi> sized shoots as may be throughout the summer, for choice at winter pruning, yet do not <hi>crowd</hi> the tree. As the shoots proceed in length, nail them to the wall, that no material dangling be seen; but avoid using too many shreds.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>formation</hi> of a tree, keep each side as nearly as can be <hi>equal</hi> in wood, and the shoots inclining downwards, which is a mode of training necessary to fill the lower part of the wall, (none of which should be lost) and to check the <hi>too</hi> free motion of the sap, which wall trees are liable to from their warm situation, and continual cutting. All the branches should have an <hi>horizontal</hi> tendency, though the upper cannot have it so much as the lower ones. Those that are <hi>perpendicular,</hi> or nearly so, mount the wall too fast, and run away with the food that should pass to the horizontals, which being impoverished by
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035770_0147_1006BC5BCE945C60"/>
the vigorous <hi>middle</hi> branches, gradually become too weak to extend themselves, and nourish the fruit. The pruner, therefore, must be content to have some of the wall over the middle of the tree, unoccupied; or, at least, suffer none but <hi>weak</hi> shoots to find a place there.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>idea</hi> of a wellformed tree, is somewhat repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the ribs of a spread <hi>fan,</hi> or the <hi>fingers</hi> of the hand extended. Regularity is allowed to be so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the <hi>beauty</hi> of a wall tree, that some have even drawn lines for a guide to train by; but Nature, (ever free and easy,) will not submit to so much formality, and such a perfect disposition of the branches are not necessary. A tree may be regular, without being lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear, and the proper useful shoots are not to be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to a fanciful precision. Though <hi>crossing</hi> of branches is against rule, yet cases <hi>may</hi> happen (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in want of wood or fruit) where even this awkward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness may be permitted. The object is <hi>fruit,</hi> and to obtain this end, from must sometimes give place. "Barrenness being the greatest defect, crossing must not be scrupled, when barrenness cannot otherwise be avoided." A tree may be in fair symmetry, and yet badly pruned; and thus some ignorantly, and others cunningly, put trees in <hi>order</hi> without a proper <hi>selection</hi> of branches; so that the best shall be cut out, and the worse left, merely because the latter suits the form better, and gives a favourable appearance to the work.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>fore right,</hi> and <hi>back</hi> shoots, and other useless wood, should be displaced in time, for they exhaust the strength of the tree to no purpose, and occasion a rude appearance. It is a very expeditious method to displace superfluous young shoots, by pushing, or <hi>breaking</hi> them off; but when they get <hi>woody,</hi> it is apt to tear the bark, and, in this case, the knife must be used: the better way is to <hi>disbud</hi> by rubbing; yet a young <hi>laxuriant</hi> tree, should be suffered to grow a
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:035770_0148_1006BC61B1030710"/>
                        <hi>little</hi> wild to spend the sap. There is one evil, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, attending on disbudding, and rubbing off young <hi>fore rights</hi> that some <hi>fruit spurs</hi> are thus lost; for <hi>apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots</hi> are apt to bear on little short shoots, of from half an inch to an inch (or more) and there are <hi>peaches</hi> which do the same; so that it is a rule with some pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to wait to distinguish <hi>spurs</hi> from <hi>shoots,</hi> and then to use the knife; but the less the knife is used in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the better.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>regulating</hi> a tree, at any time, begin at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and middle, and work the way orderly upward and outward. Never <hi>shorten</hi> in <hi>Summer,</hi> (which would produce fresh shoots,) except a forward shoot where wood may be wanting; but where the tree is really too thick, cut <hi>clean</hi> out what may be spared. None of the shoots produced <hi>after</hi> midsummer should be nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, except where wood is wanting to fill a naked place.</p>
                     <p>The proper use of <hi>nails</hi> and <hi>shreds</hi> is necessary to the beauty of the tree, as well as a regular disposition of the branches; and in this business a <hi>neatness</hi> will evidence ingenuity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nails</hi> that are weak and small can hardly be used, for they must be of sufficient strength to hold <hi>fast;</hi> but large nails do not look well, and hurt the wall more than smaller. There is, however, a sort made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for this work, with flat heads and robust shanks, called <hi>garden nails,</hi> and these are generally to be used; there is yet a smaller sort, with flat heads, that, in many cases, might do, and they have somewhat the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in <hi>neatness.</hi> In default of these there are <hi>lath</hi> nails of too or three sizes, that may be brought into use. It is proper to have two sizes, the larger for strong, and the smaller for weak shoots; trees trained to <hi>wood</hi> can hardly have nails too small.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Shreds</hi> should be adapted to the strength of the branches, and the distance of the buds from each other; so that with strong shoots, having their buds
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:035770_0149_1006BC63DEA7BB88"/>
wide, such broad shreds may be used, that would make weak shoots unsightly, and spoil them by covering the buds: many a well cut tree has been made disgusting, merely by irregular and dangling shreds. An uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of <hi>colour</hi> can hardly be accomplished, but a regularity of size may; scarlet, if all alike, looks best; and white the worst. The general <hi>width</hi> of shreds should be from half an inch, to three quarters, and the <hi>length</hi> two inches to three, having a few wide, longer, and stronger for large branches. In the <hi>dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> of shreds some must have their ends turned down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and some upwards, as best suits for bringing the shoots to their proper place and strait direction. Though some pruners observe a sort of alternate or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet the ends hanging chiefly down, (if it may be) will be found to look best. Use no more shreds and nails than necessary to make good work, as both are unsightly and injurious.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>hammer</hi> used in nailing branches should be neat and light, with a perfectly smooth and level face, about two-thirds of an inch diameter, having a claw for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nails. As nails are apt to break out pieces of the wall in drawing, it is a good way to give the nail a tap to drive it a little, which loosening it from its rust, makes it come out easier, and so saves a wall from holes, which is a material thing, as they harbour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects and filth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trellises</hi> have been recommended to be placed against walls, as a means of keeping a wall sound, and giving the fruit more room to swell. In the training of fruit trees that do not require the greatest degree of sun, and in situations where the loss of a little heat is not n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aterial, this method of training trees is a good one. But, perhaps, there are not many situations in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (common as it is on the continent) where this mode of culture can be adopted, as all the sun we meet with here, is generally but barely sufficient for <hi>peaches, nectarines, grapes,</hi> and <hi>figs. Apri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ts,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035770_0150_1006BC6E9930F1B0"/>
may do, and when trained upon a <hi>trellis,</hi> in a <hi>Southern</hi> aspect, grow finer, and are less mealy than against a wall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trellises</hi> should be made of seasoned <hi>deal,</hi> and squar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to slips of three-fourths of an inch, or a trifle wider, and fixed close to the wall, so as to form up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right oblongs of twelve inches by six. In this way of training, the shreds ought to be finer, and the nails much smaller; but the branches may be <hi>tied</hi> with <hi>bass,</hi> &amp;c. if the <hi>trellis</hi> is set a little from the wall.</p>
                     <p>It may be observed, that <hi>tying</hi> saves the expense of nails and shreds, close set buds are never covered, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from the hammer is avoided, and that by trel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lising, a tree will be less infested with vermin, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects</hi> which breed in the holes made by nailing. In this mode of training the fruit swells freely, grows larger, and is of more equal flavour; so that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves trial where it is likely to succeed.</p>
                     <p>As a <hi>close</hi> to these instructions concerning the <hi>form,</hi> or beauty of wall trees, let the young gardener be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised <hi>resolutely</hi> to observe the pruning <hi>laws,</hi> and keep all things in perpetual order; for <hi>anarchy</hi> among the branches of wall trees is attended with serious evils. As in the state it is certain,

To in the <hi>garden</hi> all things run presently to confusion and rain, if inattention and neglect take place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The HEALTH of wall trees is greatly provided for, by observing the directions already given, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their <hi>form;</hi> for, if observed, each shoot will have the proper benefit of <hi>sun</hi> and <hi>air,</hi> to concoct its juices, and prepare it for fruiting.</p>
                     <p>It injures a tender shoot when it presses hard against a <hi>nail.</hi> If the <hi>hammer</hi> strikes a shoot, and bruises the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:035770_0151_1006BC702AD61080"/>
bark, it often spoils, if not kills it, by the part can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering. The <hi>shreds</hi> may be too tight, so that the shoot cannot properly swell, and if shreds are too broad, and too numerous, they are apt to occasion sickness. A slip of the <hi>knife</hi> may wound a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing branch, and make it gum, canker, or die. It will require care, and some practice, to avoid this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and in order to it, keep the point of the knife sharp, and mind the position of it when cutting. Cut close and sloping behind the eye; neither so near as to injure it, nor so wide as to leave a stub.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Digging</hi> deep with a spade about borders, sometimes injures the roots, and keeps them too low in the ground, when they should be encouraged to run high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and as nothing but well consumed dung, or other manure that drops freely, should be used about fruit trees, it is a good way to dig, or stir the ground with an <hi>asparagus fork.</hi> Wounds and bruises hurt roots as much as branches, and though cutting small roots asunder by a spade, does good rather than harm, yet large ones are often much injured.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>extremities</hi> of a tree will not be in vigour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a strict attention to the <hi>middle,</hi> that it have no strong wood, growing erectly: this was before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and must be observed: when the sides of a tree are well extended, and full of healthy wood, then some shoots of <hi>moderate</hi> substance may be trained up the middle.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>bending</hi> of a branch <hi>much</hi> out of the direction it has grown in, is a violence to the vessels of which it is composed. It distends those in the upper part, and contracts those in the lower, if it does not break them; so that every shoot should be kept from the <hi>first</hi> in the direction it is to grow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Luxuriant</hi> wood must be particularly attended to, to get rid of it in time, before it has robbed the weaker branches too much. <hi>That</hi> is luxuriant wood, which according to the <hi>general habit</hi> of the tree is much larger
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:035770_0152_1006BC72048FEC48"/>
than the rest; for a shoot that is deemed luxuriant in one tree, would not be so in another. If strong wood that is not very luxuriant, happens to be at the bottom of the tree, so that it can be trained quite horizontally, it may often be used to good purpose, as this position checks the sap. A luxuriant shoot may be kept in summer where it is not designed to retain it, merely to cut it down at <hi>winter,</hi> pruning to two or three eyes, for getting wood where wanted to next year; or this shortening may take place in <hi>June,</hi> to have new shoots the present year. Luxuriant shoots may be sometimes retained for a time, merely as <hi>waste pipes.</hi> More concerning luxuriant wood will be found in what follows.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>diseased,</hi> damaged, very weak, or worn out branches (as they occur) should be cut out, to make way for better; but if a tree is <hi>generally</hi> diseased, some caution must be used not to cut out too much at once, if there is any hope of restoring it. A very old tree, or a young one that does not thrive, may be cut a great deal; but prune it so as to have a general sprinkling of the best of the branches, and keep s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ort lengths of an eye or two, of the weaker ones, in a sort of alternate order.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>weak</hi> tree is helped much by training it more <hi>erectly</hi> than usual, as less check is thus given to the sap, and so the shoots are more likely to swell: such a tree should be kept <hi>thin</hi> of branches, and always pruned <hi>early</hi> in autumn, keeping the top free from such wood as is stronger than that which is in general below.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Old</hi> decaying trees should be lessened a little every year, and constantly watched, to observe where young and strong shoots are putting out below, in order to cut down <hi>to</hi> them; and though the time for doing this is commonly at autumn or winter pruning, yet it may be best done in summer, as the shoots would thrive the better, observing to put some mixture, or graffing
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:035770_0153_1006BC75B81AE270"/>
clay to the part, to prevent gumming, which summer pruning is apt to occasion. A judicious pruner may bring the oldest, and most ill-conditioned tree, to a healthy and bearing state, if all is but right at the root, it having a good soil about it.</p>
                     <p>Keep all wall trees <hi>clean,</hi> and particularly weak ones, from moss, cobwebs, or other filth; and attend to insects, snails, caterpillars, and smother flies. Any <hi>bark</hi> that is decayed by cracks, &amp;c. must be cleared away to the quick, either by rubbing, or the knife, as filth and insects are apt particularly to gather there: wipe the part clean.</p>
                     <p>Consider the <hi>soil</hi> about an unthrifty tree, and if it is thought bad, improve it by moving away as much of the old, as conveniently can be done. The roots should be laid quite bare, and examined in order to cut off decayed or cankered parts, and to apply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to them some fine and good <hi>fresh</hi> earth, with a <hi>little</hi> thorough rotten dung in it, and a sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of soot or wood ashes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hog dung</hi> applied fresh, is said to have a peculiar efficacy in recovering weak trees; and <hi>cow dung</hi> may reasonably be expected to do good, if the soil is a warm, or hungry one, and if not so, the hog dung is not so proper, as it is a cold dressing. If the soil is a strong one, a <hi>compost</hi> of <hi>fowl's,</hi> or <hi>sheep's dung, lime,</hi> and any fresh light <hi>earth,</hi> one part of each of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and three of the latter, mixed with the soil that is taken off, will be a proper manure. An <hi>animal</hi> dressing as of entrails, or any carrion, or bullock's blood, applied to the roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, has been frequently found effectual to make fruitful, and to recover decaying trees and vines. All these applications should be made late in <hi>autumn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>constitution</hi> of a tree is sometimes naturally <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren;</hi> or the soil that the roots have got into may be so nought and <hi>deleterious,</hi> that no pains, or perseverance will avail any thing; but growing worse and worse,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:035770_0154_1006BC7E33527D20"/>
admonishes the owner to take it up, and try another plant, rectifying the soil thoroughly, if the evil is thought to arise there. The <hi>smother fly</hi> does some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times repeatedly attack the same tree, which is a sign of inherent weakness, for the juices of a sickly tree are sweeter than those of a sound one, and so more liable to such attacks. Sometimes a tree of this kind when removed and pruned greatly down, does very well. A soil too rich of dung often occasions trees to be blighted, and the remedy is to impoverish it with a sharp sand.</p>
                     <p>A tree must not be kept too <hi>full</hi> during summer, as it prevents the proper ripening of the wood, and makes the shoots long jointed. If more than one shoot proceed from the same eye, reserve only the strongest and best situated. A crowded tree cannot be healthy, and it becomes both lodging and food for insects. The <hi>blossom buds</hi> of a tree being formed the <hi>year before,</hi> will be few and weak in a thicket of leaves, being debarred of the sun and air. But in order to avoid an over fulness, do not make any great amputations in summer, lest the tree should gum.</p>
                     <p>In clearing a tree of <hi>superabundant</hi> wood, take care not to cut off the <hi>leading</hi> shoot of a branch. All shoots after <hi>midsummer</hi> should be displaced as they arise, except where wanted to fill up a <hi>vacancy.</hi> In a <hi>too</hi> vigorous tree, the midsummer shoots, (if not quite foreright) may be left for a while on those branches that are to be cut out at winter pruning, as cutting such trees in summer is to be avoided as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: so that a little rudeness in a luxuriant tree may be permitted as a necessary evil, provided it becomes not too shady, or unsightly. Watering wall trees with an <hi>engine</hi> on a summer's evening is conducive to their health.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The FRUITFULNESS of wall trees, (the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate object of planting and training them) comes
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:035770_0155_1006BC801A8440F8"/>
now to be spoken of. Their proper <hi>form</hi> and <hi>health</hi> being good, the foundation is laid, but several things are yet to be done to obtain the <hi>end</hi> proposed, and this chiefly regards the principal, or what is called <hi>winter pruning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If trees have been planted far enough asunder, it is a happy circumstance, as the proper <hi>horizontal form,</hi> and the <hi>open middle</hi> may be preserved. The longer the horizontals are, the more necessary it is to be careful to suffer none but weak branches in the centre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly. If trees are confined as to length of wall they must take a more erect form: but still strong wood should not mount just in the middle.</p>
                     <p>If the trees have been properly attended to, during <hi>summer,</hi> there will be now the less to do; and the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects are, to <hi>thin</hi> and to <hi>furnish</hi> them, or in other words, to take out what is to spare, and to cut what is left, so as to fill the tree properly again by succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shoots.</p>
                     <p>A tree is to be <hi>thinned</hi> of damaged, unpromising, and illplaced shoots, and of woody branches that are decaying, or reach far without fruitful shoots on them, and always <hi>some</hi> of the old wood should be cut out, where there is young to follow, or supply its place. Of the fair and well placed shoots also, the superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is to be taken away, so as generally to leave the <hi>good</hi> ones at four, five or six inches asunder, according to the size of the wood and fruit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Luxuriant</hi> wood, i. e. those shoots that are gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, must be taken out from the rest, as they would impoverish the good, and destroy the weak branches, and are never fruitful; but if a tree is <hi>generally</hi> luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, it must be borne with, and the less it is cut, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively speaking, the better. Such trees, after a few years, may come to bear well; and when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to shoot moderately, some of the biggest wood may be taken out each year, or shortened down to two or three eyes, and so <hi>manoeuvered</hi> into order. The
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:035770_0156_1006BC8573A29CD8"/>
more horizontally free shooting trees are trained, the better, as the bending of the shoots checks the sap. A strong shoot or two of a very luxuriant tree may be trained perpendicular for a time, to keep the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontals the more moderate.</p>
                     <p>As the tree is to be begun below, and towards the <hi>stem,</hi> so the object in thinning must be, to prefer and to leave these shoots that are placed <hi>lowest</hi> on the branches, that so the tree may be furnished towards the centre. See that those left are sound, and not weak, or over strong, for the moderate shoots are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally best. Weak shoots are always more fruitful than strong ones; and if they are furnished with fair blossoms, should be kept where a tree is full of wood, and even preferred to moderate ones, on a very flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishing tree.</p>
                     <p>In this <hi>thinning</hi> business the young pruner must be content to go on <hi>deliberately,</hi> that he may consider well before the knife is applied. To make a proper <hi>choice</hi> is the great point, and perhaps no two adepts would exactly determine the same; so that after hesitating, to be sometimes at a loss, must not discourage a learner.</p>
                     <p>Of those shoots that are <hi>barren,</hi> retain no more than are absolutely necessary to throw out wood for the next year, and shorten them as much as may be, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the view of the following directions.</p>
                     <p>The next object is to <hi>furnish</hi> a tree. In order to this, the thinning of old wood, young being ready (or easily to be procured) to follow, has already been mentioned; but the principal step is the <hi>shortening</hi> of the shoots, which occasions them to throw out below the cut, for <hi>future</hi> use. If they were not to be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, the tree would presently extend a great way, bearing chiefly at the ends, and all over the middle, it would be thin of fruit, and thus a great part of the wall lost.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="145" facs="unknown:035770_0157_1006BC8ACD60E188"/>
The <hi>mode</hi> of bearing in peaches, nectarines, and apricots, is on the last year's wood, which makes it necessary to shorten, in order to a certain supply of bearing wood for the next year; and to contrive to have <hi>succession</hi> wood in every part of the tree, is one of the chief arts of the pruner.</p>
                     <p>The rule for <hi>shortening</hi> is this. Consider the strength of the tree, and the more vigorous the shoots are, cut off the less. If a luxuriant tree were to have its shoots much shortened, it would throw out nothing but wood; and if a weak tree were not pretty much cut, it would not have strength to bear. From vigorous shoots one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourth may be cut off: from middling ones, one-third; and from weak ones, one-half.</p>
                     <p>In shortening, make the cut at a leading shoot bud, which is known by having a <hi>blossom bud</hi> on the side of it, or which is better, one on each side. <hi>Blossom buds</hi> are rounder and fuller than leaf buds, and are discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible at the fall of the leaf, and plainly seen early in the spring: but though it is desirable to make the cut at <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>uin blossoms,</hi> yet as this cannot always be done, the due proportion of <hi>length</hi> must generally determine. It often happens that the blossom buds are chiefly, and sometimes all, at the end of the shoot; but still it should be shortened, if it is at all long. Never cut where there is <hi>only</hi> a blossom bud, and prefer those shoots that are shortest jointed, and have the blossoms most in the middle. The shoots that lie well, and are fruitful or healthy, and but a few inches long, may be left <hi>whole.</hi> Always contrive to have a <hi>good</hi> leader at the end of every principal branch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Young</hi> trees (as of the first year of branching) should have the lower shoots left longer in proportion, and the upper shorter, in order to form the tree better to the filling of the wall: The lower shoots may have three or four eyes more than the upper.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>furnishing</hi> a tree, consider where it <hi>wants</hi> wood, and cut the nearest unbearing branch (or if necessary,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035770_0158_1006BC91A024D9F0"/>
a bearing one) down to one, two, or more eyes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of shoots desired, for in such close shortening, a shoot will come from each eye. With a view to wood for filling up a naked place, a shoot formed after <hi>midsummer</hi> may be thus shortened; though the general rule is, to displace <hi>all</hi> such shoots as useless; the dependence for blossoms, being on the early formed shoots, and therefore the tree must not be crowded with the late formed ones.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>time</hi> for the principal or <hi>winter</hi> pruning is by some held indifferent, if the weather is mild at the time; but a moderate winter's day, is often quickly followed by a severe frost, which may hurt the eye and blossom next the cut. The best time is at the fall of the leaf, and may take place as soon as the leaves <hi>begin</hi> to fall. <hi>November</hi> is, generally speaking, a good time, and if this month is past, then <hi>February,</hi> if it is mild, or as soon after as possible, for when the blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms get swelled, they are apt to be knocked off by a little touch.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>autumn</hi> pruning will make the tree stronger, and the blossoms come bolder and forwarder; and if trees are then cut, as it lessens the work of <hi>spring</hi> much, this alone is a good argument, if no obstacle is in the way. This practice gives also a better opportunity to crop the borders with <hi>cauliflowers, lettuces, radishes,</hi> &amp;c. to stand the winter. Pruners in general, however, like a <hi>spring</hi> cutting, because they then see the blossoms plainly, and thus more readily make their election of shoots. Yet if the first fine weather and leisure were embraced in <hi>autumn</hi> it were certainly better; and surely it must be satisfaction, to see the trees in <hi>order</hi> all the winter: It is a most desirable thing to bring gardeners to this practice.</p>
                     <p>To clear a tree of <hi>leaves</hi> in autumn, a birchen broom may be drawn <hi>up</hi> the branches, or the hand brushed upwards: this practice is not only desirable to get at the tree properly, but to free the borders from litter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="unknown:035770_0159_1006BC937B6F2A08"/>
It has been so strongly recommended by one of our best gardeners to prune wall trees in <hi>October,</hi> that he directs to the trouble of cutting the leaves off with a sharp knife, an inch from the bud below, which he observes may be done very expeditiously: but though an <hi>autumn</hi> pruning is to be recommended, it were best to leave <hi>young</hi> trees, for a year or two, after heading down till <hi>spring;</hi> and <hi>luxuriant</hi> trees ought certainly to be so left, not only to check the strength of the coming shoots, but to see better where their blossoms are, that no fruit be lost, as when in this state they bear but idly.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>spring</hi> be the time for pruning, the rule is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>apricots,</hi> then <hi>peaches,</hi> and then <hi>nectarines. Apricots</hi> should not be so much shortened as peaches, nor do they so well endure the knife, and the <hi>Anson,</hi> or <hi>moor-park</hi> sort, particularly.</p>
                     <p>Shoots of the <hi>apricot,</hi> if under a foot, may be left uncut, if there is room. The <hi>spurs</hi> of apricots should be spared, if not too long, or numerous, for they bear well and continue for years.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>apricot</hi> bearing so much in the manner of the <hi>plum,</hi> it should be somewhat considered as such; and those who leave stubs on the wall plums for forming spurs, may, with equal reason, do so on the apricot, but let it be done sparingly. Some sorts of <hi>peaches</hi> are also apt to put out fruit <hi>spurs,</hi> and must be managed accordingly.</p>
                     <p>If much <hi>alteration</hi> is to be made in a wall tree, it will be necessary to unnail a great part, if not the whole tree, or a side of it, at least. When a tree has <hi>filled its space</hi> something of this sort <hi>must</hi> be done, and the worst, oldest, largest, and most unprofitable wood taken out. If good fruitful wood be cut away to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the tree, then that is to be reserved which will lay in straitest and in the best form, branching out the nearest towards the stem.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="148" facs="unknown:035770_0160_1006BC96E0F80870"/>
Thus having finished the directions for pruning <hi>apricots, peaches,</hi> and <hi>nectarines,</hi> a few short observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be made, and something said concerning the <hi>management</hi> of those wall trees, in order to obtain good <hi>fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After trees have been pruned, it will be proper to look them over, to see what can be amended, as they will hardly be done <hi>perfectly</hi> at first; this business may be let alone till <hi>blossoming</hi> time, and then some judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious alterations may perhaps be made, as taking out some weak, or other shoots, that prove <hi>barren,</hi> and may be spared, or cutting some down to the knit-fruit, both to benefit that, and make room for the new wood: <hi>April</hi> will be the time for this.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>pruner's</hi> greatest <hi>art</hi> is shewn, not simply in providing a present, or a next year's crop of fruit, but to manage his trees so as to lay a <hi>foundation</hi> for years to come: He is to <hi>anticipate</hi> consequences, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the future.</p>
                     <p>Particular as the directions here given for pruning have been, they cannot have comprehended every <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> case, but good sense and experience will readily supply what may be wanting, if the instructions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded are understood.</p>
                     <p>Those who <hi>hire</hi> a workman to perform their prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, should have three summer operations besides the winter; i. e. in <hi>May, July,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> earlier, or later in these months as the season is, taking care to be satisfied of the <hi>skill</hi> of the performer.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>preserve blossoms</hi> from inclement weather, is a thing some persons are curious in, though on the whole, they may be (as they generally are) left to take their chance. After some expense and trouble, this business is often done to no purpose, or a bad one. The cover sometimes knock off the blossoms,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:035770_0161_1006BC9A8F4D1958"/>
and if the work is done irregularly, as perhaps cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too close for a time, and then left uncovered, they are sooner then cut off.</p>
                     <p>Many contrivances for <hi>shelters</hi> have been used. The old way of sticking cuttings of <hi>yew,</hi> or other <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens,</hi> or <hi>fern</hi> (which is best when dry) is as little trouble as any, but they should be fixed carefully, so as not to slip, or be moved by wind, and not so thick as to shade overmuch. A slight covering is of service, and rather to be recommended than a thick one.</p>
                     <p>Nothing more than an old <hi>net</hi> has been used success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by some gardeners for the purpose.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>coping</hi> projecting from six-inches to a foot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the height of the wall is serviceable, as keeping off heavy rains, and also frosts whose action is perpendicular: This coping when it is of <hi>thatch,</hi> though not so sightly, is best.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Perpetual</hi> covers, it is observed, if wide, do harm by keeping off dew and gentle rains, which so greatly cherish and feed the leaves, and the whole tree, and are essential to its welfare.</p>
                     <p>An instance, however, deserves to be recorded, of an <hi>apricot tree</hi> growing on a wall about eleven feet high, part of which was covered by a coping pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting near a foot, and this portion of the tree was uniformly forwarder, and more fruitful than the other, rarely having its blossoms injured by the weather.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>best</hi> covering, for the protection of <hi>blossoms</hi> is, perhaps, that which Mr. <hi>Miller</hi> recommends, "made with two leaves of slit deal, joined over each other and painted, fixed upon the top of the wall with pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to draw up and down at pleasure, forming a sort of penthouse."</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reed</hi> or <hi>straw</hi> hurdles have been used to place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the trees in severe weather; and if only set at right angles against the wall, towards the <hi>east,</hi> when the wind is strong from that quarter, they do good: a
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:035770_0162_1006BCA3047F5248"/>
long tree might have one set up against the middle of it, as well as at the <hi>East</hi> end. <hi>Hurdles,</hi> covered with a mat, or cloth over them, do very well, and if too short to reach the top of the wall, they may be set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forked stakes fast in the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Poles</hi> fixed in the ground to the height of the wall, at small distances, and six inches from it, might be covered with <hi>mats;</hi> but as to applying mats directly to the wall, it is hazardous, being apt to beat off the blossoms, and if they are kept long on it, sickens the tree, by depriving it of air, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Whatever <hi>covering</hi> is used, it should be left <hi>no</hi> lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on than necessary, and it should be well secured from slipping or rubbing against the tree by wind. It should not be used till the blossoms get a little forward, nor continued longer than while the fruit is well set, being <hi>regularly</hi> put up at night, and taken off in the day, except in very bad weather.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>thinning</hi> of fruit, when too thick upon the tree, is a matter that must be attended to, for it will event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually prove loss, and not gain, to leave too many for ripening. It weakens the tree, prevents the knitting of so many, or so strong blossoms for the next year as are desirable, and hinders the fruit from coming to its size and flavour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>rule</hi> for thinning should be, to leave no two fruits so close as to swell one against another; except indeed the tree is generally short of fruit, when twins may be left on strong branches. Three or four on a long and strong branch are quite enow, and so in proportion for weaker wood; this is said of the larger sorts of <hi>peaches,</hi> and <hi>nectarines; apricots</hi> may, in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, be left somewhat thicker on a flourishing tree, and the lesser kinds of peaches and apricots may still be somewhat more numerous, as the early <hi>masculine apricot,</hi> the <hi>nutmeg peach,</hi> and <hi>nutmeg nectarine:</hi> there may be more <hi>nectarines</hi> left on a tree than peaches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="unknown:035770_0163_1006BCA7441D3CE8"/>
As the <hi>apricots</hi> gathered to thin a tree are used for <hi>pies,</hi> so are sometimes the <hi>nectarines,</hi> but let not too many of either grow for this-use, or stay too long on the tree before they are gathered. Young wall trees that presently become very fruitful, should be spared for two or three years, so as not to be suffered to <hi>over</hi> bear themselves, which has often occasioned a rapid decline and death. Trees should be thinned by <hi>cutting</hi> off the fruit with a sharp pointed knife, and not by pulling, which may tear the bark, and, if joined (as in clusters) to another fruit, the pulling off one, often damages the foot stalk of the other, and occasions its dropping.</p>
                     <p>As to thinning the <hi>leaves</hi> of wall trees, too much liberty should not be taken, though in some measure it may be necessary to give colour and ripeness to the fruit. When leaves are greatly multiplied and shade the fruit much, a <hi>few</hi> at a time may be displaced, if the fruit is nearly full grown, but rather by pinching or cutting the leaves, just above the foot stalk, than by pulling. Fruit that is too much, and long exposed in a hot summer, is ripened too fast, the skin hardens, it attains not its proper size, nor is so juicy, or well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flavoured.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>garthering</hi> wall fruit, do not pinch it to try if it is ripe, but give it a gentle lift, and if fit for eating, it will readily part from the foot stalk. Those <hi>peaches</hi> and <hi>nectarines</hi> that drop by their ripeness are yet good (some say best) for the table; but <hi>apricots</hi> have a smarter and more agreeable flavour before they are thoroughly ripe.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>dropping</hi> of fruit, when it has attained to some little size, though some have imputed it to drought, and therefore use watering (which however is seldom done deep and wide enough,) yet the cause seems more probably to be some injury from insects, or frosts, that the <hi>embryo</hi> fruit, has suffered at the foot

stalk, which can only sustain its burden for a while, and then its own weight breaks it off.</p>

                        <hi>Vines</hi> require frequent attention, as to pruning and training; but all will avail little, if they have not a warm soil, and full sun, or some accidental advantage, as being planted at the back of a warm chimney; and though they will grow and bear leaves any where, they will not fruit well in <hi>England,</hi> without a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able season, or hot summer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Young</hi> new planted vines should be pruned quite short, for two or three years, that they may get strong. If the plant has a weak root, not above <hi>one</hi> shoot ought to grow the first year, which should be cut down in <hi>autumn</hi> to two or three eyes.</p>
                     <p>The best <hi>time</hi> for the principal, or winter pruning of vines is best, as soon as the fruit is off, or the leaves falling. <hi>November</hi> does very well, and if this month passes, <hi>February</hi> should be adopted, rather than quite in the winter, when the shoots may die down by severe frosts; or late in the spring, when they are apt to bleed by cutting.</p>

the middle, or stem of the vine, that all the wall may be covered with bearing wood; and every year cut some <hi>old</hi> wood out that reaches far, to make room for younger to follow.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>form</hi> that a vine takes on the wall is various, and not very material, whether it be more horizontal, or perpendicular. The form must be governed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the space of walling alloted to it; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it has ample room, as at the gable end of a house, and sometimes it is confined to a low wall, or between trees, windows, &amp;c. The reserved shoots should be twelve or fifteen inches asunder, if they are strong, and weak ones may be something <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ess: we can hardly allow too much room.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>shortening</hi> of the shoots should be according to their strength and the room there is for training those shoots that <hi>will</hi> be produced, which always grow very long. If there is room, three, four, or five eyes may be left, but not more to any shoot, except it is desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to extend some shoot to a distance to fill up a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular space, and then eight or nine eyes may be left, which being repeated again another year, and so on, a vine will soon reach far.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes vines are trained on low walls by a long <hi>extended</hi> horizontal branch, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If the <hi>vine</hi> is confined to a narrow but lofty space, it is to be trained to an <hi>extended perpendicular</hi> mother bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, having short lateral shoots pruned down to a single eye, or at most two. The management of vines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>severe</hi> cutting, that they may not be too full in the summer, for they put out a great deal of wood, and extend their shoots to a great length; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the young pruner must resolve to cut out enough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="unknown:035770_0166_1006BCB3DE23B6A8"/>
An <hi>alternate</hi> mode of pruning vines is practised by some, one shoot short, and another long; i. e. one with two eyes, and another with four or five. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere cutting does not hurt vines, and make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, as it does other trees; and therefore, where short of room, they may be pruned down to a single bud, as the case requires.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>summer management</hi> of vines must be carefully attended to. As soon as the young shoots can be nailed to the wall, let them not be neglected; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member they are very tender, and will not bear much bending: train in only the well placed shoots, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing or breaking off the others. The <hi>embryo fruit</hi> is soon seen in the bosom of the shoot, and these are of course to be laid in, as many as can be found room for, in preference to those shoots that are barren, which nevertheless should also be trained, if they are strong and well placed, and there is space for them. Rub off all shoots from <hi>old wood,</hi> except any tolerable one that proceeds from a part where wood is wanting to fill up some vacant space. If two shoots proceed from one eye, displace the weakest, or the outermost, if they are both alike, and the <hi>fruit</hi> should not direct otherwise. <hi>Vines</hi> grow rapidly, and must be nailed to the wall from time to time as they proceed, that there may be no rude dangling; which would not only have a slovenly appearance, but in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral respects be injurious.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>stopping</hi> of the shoots is to take place, both as to <hi>time</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> according to the strength and situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of them, or whether <hi>fruitful</hi> or <hi>barren.</hi> Those <hi>weak</hi> shoots that have fruit, and are rather ill placed, or confined for room, may be stopped at the second, or even first joint above the fruit, early in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but those shoots that are <hi>strong,</hi> and have room to grow, should not be stopped till they are in flower, (in <hi>July,</hi>) and at the third or fourth joint above the fruit. In shortening the shoots of the vine, do it about
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:035770_0167_1006BCB59E955498"/>
half an inch above an eye, sloping behind a plump and sound one. The <hi>barren</hi> shoots are to be trained at full length, and not stopped at all, if there is room for them, or, at least, but a little shortened towards autumn, because they would put out a number of use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and strong side-shoots, if cut before.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>side shoots,</hi> i. e. those little ones put out by the eyes that are formed for next year, are commonly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to be immediately displaced by rubbing off, as soon as they appear; and if the vine is large, and the shoots slender, it is very proper; but if otherwise, their being left to grow a while (so as not to get <hi>too</hi> rude and crowding) is rather an advantage, in detaining the sap from pushing the shoots out immoderately long; and when these are taken off, the lower eye may be left with the same view. But the side shoot, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>top</hi> of each shortened branch, should be left on, and when it gets long, shortened down to an eye or two.</p>
                     <p>In order to fruitfulnesse, vines will need <hi>dressing</hi> with some sort of manure, for though they grow in vineyard countries on rocky hills, and in very shallow soils, and have done so on some chalky, hot, gravelly hills in <hi>England,</hi> yet some warm spirituous food they must have, or they will produce little fruit, and that of poor flavour.</p>
                     <p>Some people are very fond of <hi>exposing</hi> the fruit of the vine to the full sun, by stripping off leaves; but this should not be practiced till the bunches have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their proper size, needing only to be ripened, and even then but <hi>little</hi> should be done in this way. The loss of <hi>leaves</hi> is an injury to every plant, and all fruit grows larger in shade, though when grown, it will not ripen well without sun. Much sun, as it contracts the skin, does not forward, but hinder young fruit from swelling and ripening properly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="unknown:035770_0168_1006BCBB350F0200"/>
                        <hi>Fig trees</hi> are best pruned early in <hi>October,</hi> (cutting the leaves off) but the more usual time is early in <hi>spring,</hi> as after an <hi>autumn</hi> cutting (if late) they are apt to die down; but if not completely pruned at this time, let, at least, stragglers be taken out, and the rest laid in close without straining.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>mode of bearing</hi> in the fig is, that fruit chiefly comes the present year on the little shoots from wood of the <hi>preceding,</hi> and that towards the <hi>ends</hi> of the branches; which circumstances dictate the rules for pruning: Two years old wood will bear some, but older never.</p>
                     <p>The shoots, during <hi>summer,</hi> are to be laid in at full length, plentifully as room will permit. The weak, ill placed, or superabundant ones, cut clean out; yet rather brake, or rub them off, in an early state of growth, for cutting branches or shoots in summer, makes them bleed, as it is called; i. e. the sap run; when cut in <hi>autumn</hi> (as is recommended the fig will sometimes bleed, for a day or so) but if late cut in <hi>spring,</hi> the oozing will continue a week, which is too much.</p>
                     <p>At the <hi>principal</hi> pruning, the strongest, and the closest jointed shoots are to be preferred, and left about seven or eight inches asunder, without shorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Let the spare shoots be cut out close and smooth, and <hi>as</hi> much of the <hi>old wood</hi> as may be; for the tree will increase too fast, and get too naked of bearing wood in the middle, if this is not freely done; and the greatest point in the management of fig trees is, to have <hi>young</hi> wood all over it, and particularly in the middle and towards the bottom. Wood is seldom <hi>wanted</hi> in a fig tree, but where it is, the <hi>shortening</hi> of a shoot, properly situated (by taking off the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bud, or cutting lower as the case requires) is
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:035770_0169_1006BCC0D413E868"/>
sure to produce it. Do this in <hi>April,</hi> as the best time.</p>
                     <p>When hard <hi>frosts</hi> are expected let some litter be laid over the roots of fig trees, and mats nailed over their branches, (first pulling off the figs) as the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent nature of their wood makes them tender; and these coverings are to remain till the frosts are judged to be over, and then let them be covered up at night, and not by day, for a week or two, to harden them by degrees.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>fig trees</hi> will generally survive hard winters, when in standards, without covering; and though shoots trained to a wall are tenderer, yet <hi>pease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haulm</hi> hung close among the branches (at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of sharp frosts) will preserve them. This sort of protection, as affording plenty of air, is by many good gardeners preferred to the more common practice of <hi>matting.</hi> But if <hi>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                        </hi> were contrived to roll up and down, or kept a little distance from the tree, so as to give more or less air, as the weather is, the health and fruitfulness of the tree would be better insured, for too close (and as it commonly happens in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence too long) covering is injurious to both. Fig trees that have been close covered are often hurt by an early uncovering, and yet the spring air, as soon as possible, is desirable.</p>
                     <p>It is worthy consideration and trial, whether fig trees against a good wall would not do best on a <hi>trel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> as thus they would have sufficient heat, without being forced into wood, which they are apt to have too much of.</p>
                     <p>PEARS come next under our consideration as wall fruit:</p>
                     <p>A <hi>young</hi> pear tree, being planted against a wall in autumn, should not be cut down till <hi>spring,</hi> when the
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:035770_0170_1006BCC718CA1990"/>
head is to be reduced according to the goodness of the root, and so as to lay a proper foundation for cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wall. If it has a <hi>bad</hi> root, (as is often the case) all the shoots should come off, and only the stem be left, with a few eyes to form new shoots, as was directed for <hi>peaches,</hi> &amp;c. But generally some of the shoots are to be left, with due shortening, only taking it as a general rule, that it is not proper to leave much wood on; but to prune down freely, in order to the putting out strong shoots for parent branches. See <hi>heading-down,</hi> under the directions for <hi>espalier pruning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>form</hi> of pear trees is to be governed by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wall. If the space allowed the tree is low and long, it must of course be trained perfectly <hi>hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal;</hi> but if there is room above, and a deficiency of length, the form becomes more erect: Yet even in this case the lower, and more horizontal branches, should be allowed to get the start a year or two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the middle is permitted to fill, which ought not to have any over strong wood, lest it run away with the strength of the tree, and keep the extremities weak. The <hi>branches</hi> are to be trained at length, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shortening, and kept at from six to eight inches distance, according to the size of the fruit; remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is essential to a pear, above most other fruit trees, that the branches be clear of one another, for the sun and air to have free access: Pruners should consider this circumstance, in all trees, more than they generally do. The reason for not shortening the branches is, that wood is always thrown out from two or three eyes below a cut, and so the tree would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a thicket of useless wood, if such cutting took place.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>mode of bearing</hi> in pear trees is on short <hi>spurs,</hi> which appear first towards the ends, and then form themselves all along the branches, which do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce blossoms for three or four years from planting,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035770_0171_1006BCC8B805F6F8"/>
and sometimes (according to the sort) for several years more. When they are come to fruiting, some pears bear pretty much on year old wood, some on two, others on three. The same branches continue to bear on spurs from year to year, and most when five or six years old; but as in course of time the branches may become diseased and barren, and not produce so fine fruit as younger wood, it is always proper to procure a <hi>succession</hi> of young bearers, as the opportunity of good shoots offer.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>projecting</hi> wood, most gardeners allow of it in wall pear trees, but some not. The wood should not, however, be suffered to project above three or four inches; and though there may be blossoms at the <hi>ends</hi> of short year old wood, yet they should be either cut clean out, or down to an eye or two, for forming fruit <hi>spurs,</hi> as they will be apt to do, though they are also as apt to produce only wood shoots; and these shoots being cut down again, <hi>tufts</hi> of wood are thus produced which makes a tree appear ragged; but whether it is best to cut <hi>all</hi> spare shoots clean out, (or to cut some o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> them at least) down to little <hi>stubs,</hi> or false spurs, is hardly yet determined, though the advocates for both practices speak very positively. The cutting clean out is much the neater, and less troublesome way, and is therefore best, <hi>if</hi> as much fruit is to be obtained by it: It has been <hi>said</hi> more may be.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>occasional</hi> pruning of pear trees during summer is necessary, lest the strength of the tree be spent in vain, the fruit robbed, and shaded, and the extremities impoverished. Whether all the shoots that are clearly known to be wood shoots (from their length) should be cut out during summer is a question, but proceed as follows:</p>
                     <p>Where <hi>fruit spurs</hi> are wanted, the moderate wood shoots may be left to grow to some length, till the wood is hardened, and then broke off to about six
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:035770_0172_1006BCCE09239D68"/>
inches, which being left to the winter pruning, may be cut down to one eye, with the hope of getting a spur there: But spurs should not be suffered to grow too thick; trees bearing small pears, may have theirs four inches asunder, and the large six.</p>
                     <p>Several <hi>summer</hi> shoots will come out about the fruit spurs; yet it is not advisable to cut all of them off as they appear, but only the strong and most unsightly; one moderate shoot may be left to each, and shortened when the wood is hardened, to about six inches, and cut clean out at the general pruning: All superfluous shoots, except those mentioned as allowed of, should be displaced while young; but though rubbing, or breaking off, in all cases are preferable to the knife, do not use this method when shoots are so big as to <hi>tear</hi> the wood with them.</p>
                     <p>The time for <hi>general</hi> or winter pruning of pear trees ought to be <hi>November,</hi> as the blossoms are then very discernable, and at spring pruning they get so turgid and tender, that almost the least touch knocks them off, or even the jarring of the tree. What is now to be cut out will be understood from what has been said; only when the bunches of spurs get too thick and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting, some must occasionally be removed, and a thin sharp chissel and mallet will do the work well, where the wood is too strong or awkwardly placed for the knife. When a tree gets to the extent of its bounds, it is to be shortened down to a wellplaced shoot, which may serve for a leader; which leader should be already provided by a selection in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                     <p>Where <hi>wood</hi> is <hi>wanted</hi> to fill a vacant place, a shoot may be accordingly shortened; but otherwise there must be no shortening, except down to a single eye, with a view (as was said) to forming fruit spurs, where the tree is thin of them. And when <hi>wood</hi> is desired in any particular part, where there is no shoot to cut down for the purpose, a <hi>notch</hi> (somewhat long)
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:035770_0173_1006BCCFE9B9F9F0"/>
will generally produce it, and the more certainly, if made just above a joint, or knot, and such knotching of pear trees does no harm, but rather good, as many choose to do it to check their too great aptness to lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriancy.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>thinning</hi> of the fruit on pear trees is frequently necessary. They put forth a great many blossoms, and many of them fall, and even the fruit will do so when it is set; but as soon as it is promising (by the healthy shining appearance of the skin) that the fruit will hang, thinning so as to leave only one pear on a spur, will improve the fruit left, and help the tree: this work do with a sharp pointed knife.</p>
                     <p>To check the <hi>luxuriant</hi> growth of pear trees, many schemes have been tried; but the best is here and there to strip pieces of <hi>bark</hi> off, behind the stem, and some of the principal branches, half round, or rather make so many wide <hi>notches,</hi> not going to the pith.</p>
                     <p>APPLES are sometimes planted against walls, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>What has been said of pruning and managing <hi>pears</hi> is applicable to them; the branches, however, may be laid in somewhat closer, and they will not require so much room, but ought to have from twenty-five to thirty feet in length of a low wall, and on a high one something less: This distance appears great, but a few years will evince its propriety, and in such wide plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intermediate spaces may be occupied by several things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mulberries</hi> are still more rarely cultivated as wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ruit:</p>
                     <p>These trees require good room, as their mode of bearing is mostly at the ends of the trained shoots,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:035770_0174_1006BCDA150A46B8"/>
which are therefore not to be shortened. Twenty or twenty-five feet should be allowed them, and a new planted tree is to be headed down as directed for <hi>pears,</hi> &amp;c. Train regularly as many shoots as may be in summer, and at winter pruning, lay them about six or seven inches distance. A succession of new wood must be always coming forward, and of course some old taken out, for the fruit is produced chiefly on year and two year old wood; and as it comes on spurs, and also small shoots of the same year, the leaving short stubs (of moderate wood) in pruning, seems justified, though by some much condemned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cherries</hi> should be found against walls in every good garden; but plant <hi>young</hi> trees, not more than two, but better if <hi>one</hi> year only from budding.</p>
                     <p>A new planted cherry tree is best to have but one strong shoot from the bud, and then cut down, at spring, so as to have two or three eyes on each side, to lay in well to the wall; but if older and fuller of wood, head it down as directed in <hi>Espalier Pruning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cherry trees</hi> should be trained at length, four or five inches asunder. The fruits come from spurs all along the shoots, on one and two years old wood, which will continue to bear. In pruning have an eye, however, to some fair shoots for successors to those that are getting diseased, or worn out. Some cut all superfluous shoots clean away, and others leave a sprinkling of short stubs, which may be allowed; but let them not advance <hi>far</hi> fore right.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>morella</hi> cherry has a different mode of bearing from others, the fruit proceeding mostly from eyes along the branches of new, or year old wood: the pruner, therefore, is to lay in a proper supply of <hi>young</hi> wood every year, always removing older wood to make room accordingly. For the better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035770_0175_1006BCDC00F529B8"/>
of furnishing the tree with young wood, the bearing branches of this tree should be at six inches distance, and then one young shoot trained between, makes them three inches distant, closer than which they should not be. The morella it is clear, ought to have <hi>no</hi> stubs left in pruning, with a view to spurs, nor most any fore right shoots be suffered to grow at all, but let them be <hi>rubbed</hi> off while very young, or rather while in the bud.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>morella</hi> cherry is commonly planted against <hi>north</hi> walls, where they grow large and hang long, as they are commonly not wanted till late in the season to <hi>preserve;</hi> but if planted upon warmer walls, their fruit is of a finer flavour, and (when thoroughly ripe) excellent for table use in the desert; i. e. in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> according to the aspect of their growth.</p>
                     <p>PLUMS of the finer sorts are often planted against walls, and deserve a good one.</p>
                     <p>For the pruning of plum trees, the directions given for <hi>cherries</hi> apply to them, only that the branches should be laid somewhat wider; i. e. at five or six inches.</p>
                     <p>FILBERDS, or other nuts, are to be trained at full length, the branches about six inches distance, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening only the shoots of new planted trees, in order to the furnishing a proper head and spread of branches, which would be kept as horizontal as possible, to check their free growth.</p>
                     <p>They bear upon the sides and ends of the upper young branches; so that young wood must be contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually bringing in, by removing some of the old.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="unknown:035770_0176_1006BCE617D00220"/>
                        <hi>Currants</hi> and sometimes <hi>Gooseberries</hi> are planted against walls:</p>
                     <p>Train the lower branches somewhat horizontal as far as their allotted room, and then train upwards, filling the middle as they grow. Keep the branches about five or six inches asunder. They bear fruit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on young wood, and on little spurs of the old. Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous shoots of the trained branches, are to be cut down to little stubs or spurs, about half an inch long, which will throw out fruit shoots and spurs. The mother branches of currants and gooseberries will last many years; but when good young wood can be brought in for principals, a renewal every three or four years will produce finer fruit. Take care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide shoots to the very bottom of the wall, that no space may be lost. In the gathering of these fruits for pies, there should be left a sprinkling all over the trees to come on for eating ripe, which will prove fine, there being only a small quantity for the tree to nourish.</p>

The only difference is, that instead of being spread upon walls, the branches are fastened to stakes, or frames, as trellises. The fastenings are commonly ties of ozier twigs, bass, yarn, or soft packthread, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of nails, which, however may be used to frame work, if small and sharp pointed. See <hi>formation of a garden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As trees planted for espalier training should be young, let great care be taken to set them off right at first, by regular shoots, full furnished immediately from the stem; which is effected by proper <hi>heading down,</hi> as was directed for wall trees; but directions more particular shall be repeated here, as to <hi>apples, pears, plums, cherries,</hi> &amp;c. which in the general need not to be so much freed of all branches at planting, as <hi>peaches, nectarines,</hi> and <hi>apricots;</hi> yet there are gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners who prune down to the stem, <hi>all</hi> sorts of wall and espalier trees, as peaches are.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>heading down</hi> of a young tree (i. e. apple, &amp;c.) for an espalier that has only <hi>one</hi> shoot from the graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, or budding, should be so low, as to leave two or three, or at the most four eyes on each <hi>side</hi> of the stem, from which will proceed shoots properly placed for training: If the tree has <hi>two</hi> shoots, one on each side, which branch out right and left, so as to be made principal leaders, cut each of them down to three or four eyes. If it has <hi>three,</hi> the upper one, if not over strong, being shortened down to a few eyes, may be trained strait up and the two lower ones shortened as above, as laterals, and thus a good foundation will be made for a proper spread of branches. If it has <hi>four</hi> shoots properly placed for training, two on each side, the lower one may be cut down, to seven or eight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>yes, and that above to three or four: If the tree has more shoots, they may be either all cut out to two on each side (shortening as before) or one left perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, being cut down to a few eyes; or if the tree is somewhat old, and has a good root, more wellplaced
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035770_0178_1006BCE9E99A7B70"/>
shoots may be left on, keeping the lowermost longer than the upper by two or three eyes, making the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ones very short. If these directions are properly observed, an espalier (or a wall) will be properly and presently filled with branches.</p>
                     <p>The best <hi>time</hi> for heading down is the <hi>spring,</hi> though when trees are planted early in autumn, it may be then done. All cuts should be <hi>close</hi> behind an eye. When a strong stem is to be cut down at spring, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to place the foot against it, to keep the root in its place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Heading down</hi> should not only be deferred till <hi>spring</hi> on account of frosts possibly injuring the top eye of the shoots; but because the head of a tree helps to push out roots, either by circulation of the sap, or by a descent of moisture imbibed by it from the atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere: The proper time, therefore, to prune the heads of new-planted trees, is, when new roots <hi>are</hi> formed; and then a head disproportioned to the roots should by no means be suffered, as the new shoots in such case would be too weak to be healthy, or fruitful.

                     <head>3. OF PRUNING STANDARD TREES.</head>
                     <p>The principle of pruning <hi>standard trees</hi> is the same, whether <hi>full, half,</hi> or <hi>dwarf</hi> standards; and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is, to form a compact, handsome, round, and open head, rather small than large, equal on all sides, with tolerably erect wood, capable of supporting the fruit without much bending. Perfect symmetry indeed is not necessary, but confusion of branches, weak and crossing, crowded and dangling, is to be prevented by pruning; for a proper (rather free) use of the knife, is capable of doing much towards the beauty and fruitfulness of standard trees. A little pruning of standards every year, and a general one every three or
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:035770_0179_1006BCF35A17D710"/>
four years, to cut out what is decayed, and some of the older wood, where a successional supply of young may be obtained to succeed, is the way to keep them in vigour, and have the best of fruit; for that which grows on <hi>old</hi> wood, gets small and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere.</p>
                     <p>Clear trees from <hi>moss,</hi> by scraping them with a long narrow bladed blunt knife, on a bit of hard wood, and cut, or rub off bits of decayed bark, in which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects are apt to bread, and wipe the part clean. Some use a scouring brush in this business, the long end hairs of which are well adapted to clean the forky parts. A bit of hair cloth is also used for the purpose; and a finish is properly made with a brush and soap and water.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>first</hi> year of new planted standards, they are to be cleared in the <hi>spring,</hi> of all weak and improper shoots, reserving only a few of the strongest. If there are four regularly placed shoots opposite to each other, it is sufficient to form a good head, shortening them down to a few eyes each, or, (in general) cutting off about one-third may be a rule. What the head will be, may be pretty well foreseen, by conceiving two or three shoots to come from each of the buds below the cut.</p>
                     <p>If the shoots of the tree are weak, or the root but a poor one, cut the reserved shoots down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o two eyes each. If the head is not <hi>regularly</hi> furnished with shoots, a judicious pruner will yet be able to <hi>manoeuvre</hi> it into form in a year or two, and this must be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by close pruning the first year.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>second</hi> year (rather in spring) attend to the head, and cut out, or shorten, so as to provide for the future form and strength of the tree; reserving only such shoots as recommended themselves for their position and vigour, as widely placed as may be from each other, and but few in number. After this, the head will form <hi>itself,</hi> so as to need only
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:035770_0180_1006BCF5765A98B8"/>
cutting clean out a few superfluities; but no shorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is allowed, except some of the lowest branches, or any one where wood is wanted to fill a vacancy; for which purpose, a weak shoot may do, cut down to one or two eyes.</p>
                     <p>If trees are <hi>too</hi> full of wood, the shoots must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be drawn weak and long jointed, and so be the less fruitful, and unable to support the fruit they have; and thus it often happens, the branches of an apple tree needs propping; but on the other hand, <hi>too</hi> much pruning will occasion a tree to be always putting forth wood, rather than fruit, and so a <hi>medium</hi> must be observed. The branches should be kept about six inches asunder; and as superfluous weak shoots, will of course be cut out, so let also the over strong wood; for though it is desirable to have standard trees of able wood, yet those shoots that much exceed the size of the rest, would, if left on, infallibly weaken the others.</p>
                     <p>Let no shoots remain on the stems, below the head, nor suckers about the roots. With respect to <hi>cherry trees,</hi> rather than cut more than necessary; drooping branches may be suffered, as the fruit is not heavy, and the heads of cherry trees may be fuller than other fruit trees. Wherever a cut is made in a full headed standard to shorten a shoot, it should be (generally) at an eye situated <hi>within</hi> side, that so the shoot from it may point more erectly, as the weight of the fruit is too much for those branches that grow quite hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gooseberries</hi> and <hi>currant,</hi> may be ranked upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of dwarf trees, and the principle of prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them will be the same, as for other standard trees, frequently cutting out old wood, to make the room for a succession of young. The keeping these trees, or bushes, more <hi>open</hi> than they commonly are, would improve the fruit in size and flavour, and bring it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder; yet some of them should be suffered to grow
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035770_0181_1006BCFD0A3E5850"/>
rather full of wood, in order to keep the fruit longer, especially in a <hi>northern</hi> aspect of the garden, or some shady place; and if to this situation and fulness, be added <hi>matting,</hi> or <hi>netting,</hi> they may be preserved till <hi>November.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>time</hi> of pruning these trees, is commonly held to be indifferent, and any time between leaf and leaf may be adopted to cut them, as opportunity offers. But when they are getting <hi>into</hi> leaf is (perhaps) the best time; as when pruned <hi>early,</hi> there is frequently a loss of almost the whole fruit, by birds eating the buds, or, as some say, insects. Leaving the whole head on till <hi>spring,</hi> is a security as to a crop of fruit, as the case would be bad indeed, if <hi>some</hi> good branches are not left, properly furnished with uninjured buds; but still it is allowed, that an early pruning strengthens the tree, and tends to increase the size of the fruit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Currant</hi> trees need not be kept so open as <hi>goose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> the branches of which, should be (for <hi>fine</hi> fruit) five or six inches asunder, and as little shortened as possible. Those sorts of gooseberries whose shoots grow in a <hi>curved</hi> manner, may have their long branches, when in fruit, supported with little forked sticks. Keep these trees clear of suckers, and all shoots from the stem, that are within nine or ten inches of the ground.</p>

                     <head>4. OF PRUNING SHRUBS.</head>
                     <p>Many shrubs are cultivated for their ornament, and some for their <hi>fruit;</hi> of the latter are <hi>raspberries</hi> and <hi>barberries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>RASPBERRIES bear fruit on little side shoots of the present year, proceeding from stems of the last, and sometimes produce a little on those of the same year. To prune this shrub, therefore, first cut out all the
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:035770_0182_1006BCFF272B4090"/>
old bearers, whose wood dies, then cut out, close to the stool, all the new shoots, except three or four of the best situated and strongest, which may be carefully twisted, or tied together at the top, or if upright and strong, left to support themselves singly. The best situated are those standing closest together, near the centre of the stool, and ranging well in the row: stragglers should not be forced in. This done, let all shoots between the rows be <hi>clean</hi> dug out. Shorten raspberries either just below the bend, or from three to four feet, according to their strength.</p>
                     <p>Raspberries must not be shortened in summer; and the <hi>time</hi> for pruning them is from <hi>October</hi> all through winter, till they begin to shoot at spring, though the former is the best time to dress them; especially if any thing is to be planted between their rows. See page 38.</p>
                     <p>BARBERRY, is a beautiful and somewhat large shrub, which should be suffered to grow with a full head, like a dwarf standard tree. It bears along the sides of both young and old wood, but chiefly towards the ends, and its branches should, therefore, not be shortened, except with a view to throw out wood. Keep the root free from suckers, and the stem from shoots in its lower part, and prune out weak, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant, straggling, and crossing branches, forming it to a somewhat round head, which keep moderately open. Let the stem be freed from lower branches to the height of three, four or five feet, according as the shrub may be desired to approach to a tree. See page 77.</p>
                     <p>STRAWBERRIES require pruning from the runners during summer, which strengthens the plants, keeps the soil from being exhausted, and gives all a neat air of culture. This work should be particularly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

up in <hi>edgings</hi> of strawberries, that they may not run over the walks: If plants, however, are wanted for new beds, they must be suffered to run. See pages 39,78.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>dressing</hi> of strawberries consists, not only of pruning from runners; but cutting down the great leaves in <hi>autumn</hi> (early) with a sythe; or which is better, by taking them up in the hand, and using a knife. At this time they must be weeded, and the ground stirred between them, deep enough to cut the ends of the roots. Then there should be spread over the beds a little rott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n dung, or good fresh earth, and all afterwards kept free from weeds. The <hi>surface</hi> of the ground be stirred again in <hi>spring,</hi> and any hollows that may be between the plants should be filled up with earth, and some dung too amongst it, if none was applied in <hi>autumn.</hi> Thus with good management the delicious strawberry will be had in abundance and perfection.</p>
                     <p>FLOWERING SHRUBS are of great variety, and the method of pruning them is to be determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their several <hi>modes of bearing,</hi> of which consider chiefly these; that is, whether they produce their flowers upon the <hi>last</hi> year's shoots, or the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> on the <hi>ends</hi> or the <hi>sides</hi> of their branches. If a shrub bears on the <hi>last</hi> year's shoots, it is evident that it must be cut away no more than is necessary to keep it within bounds, open, and handsome as to its form; in this case, it is the business to cut clean out, or <hi>very</hi> low, what is to be spared. If a shrub bears on the <hi>present</hi> year's shoots, the old wood may, and must be cut down freely, so however as to leave eyes enough for new shoots to proceed from, to make a sufficient head and show. If the shrub bears alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or chiefly as its <hi>ends,</hi> no shortening must take
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035770_0184_1006BD08B1F13F70"/>
place; but if some of the branches are too long, they may be either cut out, or quite low, leaving the shorter ones to bear. If the shrub bears along its <hi>sides,</hi> the shortening is of no consequence, and the desired form may be freely provided for at pleasure.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>season</hi> for pruning shrubs is generally reckoned the <hi>spring,</hi> but <hi>autumn</hi> is better, if not too near win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as at this time sharp weather might occasion some of the sorts to die down, particularly <hi>jasmines</hi> and <hi>honeysuckles.</hi> The <hi>time of flowering</hi> must, in some measure, direct the time of <hi>pruning.</hi> Shrubs that flower in winter (as the <hi>laurustinus</hi>) should be cut in spring. Those that flower in spring may be pruned immediately after their blow, or in summer. Those that flower in summer should be pruned in autumn; and those that flower in autumn should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pruned either soon after flowering, or in spring. The <hi>pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantha</hi> bears on two and three years old wood, and therefore, young wood should be kept in every part of the tree; for want of this, beautiful plants of this shrub are frequently seen very large, with fruit only at some of the extreme branches. The time for pruning it is autumn, but may be done in spring, as the flowers are then to be seen.</p>
                     <p>Be sure to take off in time, i. e. as soon as discov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, all suckers and over strong shoots from shrubs; for by their luxuriancy they greatly impoverish the proper sized branches, which are the fruitful ones, and such large sappy wood looks very unsightly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Flowering shrubs</hi> should be better attended to, as to pruning, than they commonly are; for we sometimes see them either wholly neglected, or cut down at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, perhaps, only <hi>sheared</hi> into a little form; and so they make a return quite suitable to the desert of the owner for his neglect. To be crowding full of branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, suits the production of flowers no better than it does fruit: They should not be choaked up from sun and air, either in themselves, or by their neighbours.</p>
                     <p>

The <hi>general</hi> directions already given for pruning shrubs might suffice, but that the young gardener may not have to discover (by observation alone) the proper application of the given rules, he is here particularly directed to the work of pruning a <hi>few</hi> of the more common sorts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Roses</hi> bear upon shoots of the present year, and upon those formed after Midsummer in the past year, but chiefly upon the former. Therefore, they may, or rather should be cut down low, leaving only three or four eyes to a shoot; except some of those short shoots formed the last year too late to blow then. If rose trees are not close pruned, we see them get dangling, and unable to support their flowers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. Use a sharp knife, and cut close behind an eye or bud.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Honeysuckles</hi> flower on shoots of the present year; and therefore whether trained to walls, or kept in bushes, should be also pruned close, but not so short in the latter as the former; for those against walls should be cut down to an eye or two, and those in bushes to three or four eyes on a branch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sweet briars</hi> flower on shoots of the present year, and therefore should be cut after the manner of honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suckles. These shrubs (and most others) are seldom pruned down enough, and so in a few years they get very rambling and unsightly; but if kept compact, we have beauty as well as sweetness, to recompence our care; and in all cases, a less number of fine flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (obtained by short and open pruning) is certainly preferable to many indifferent ones.</p>
                     <p>

                           </gap>acs</hi> bear their flowers at the ends of shoots of the last year, so of course at spring must not be shortened. If got rambling and crowded, cut either clean out, or very low, what may be superfluous. If they need much reduction, let them be cut down as soon (or somewhat before) as they have got off flower,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:035770_0186_1006BD12B381BEC8"/>
and then the shoots that come after will form for blow before the summer is out, for next year.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jasmines</hi> should be pruned down close, even to half an inch, as they bear on weak shoots of the year.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sennas</hi> bear also on shoots of the present year, yet are best left rather full of wood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hypericum frutex</hi> bears all along the sides of old wood, and therefore may be shortened at pleasure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spirea frutex, Guelder rose,</hi> and many others, bear on shoots of the year, and may therefore be pruned short.</p>

                  <p>Two <hi>errors</hi> are common in the use of <hi>hot beds,</hi> sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or placing in the same bed things of a very <hi>different</hi> nature, as to the climate they grow best in, and forcing with <hi>too</hi> much heat even the tenderest. Though it may not answer our views of haste, the heat of a bed had better be slack than otherwise. A strong hot bed, that ought (perhaps) to be made a fortnight before it is used, is sometimes furnished by impatience in a few days, and various ill consequence follow, which nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally frustrate success.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>place</hi> where hot beds are worked, should be open to the full sun, catching it as early as possible in the morning, and as long as can be in the evening; and if not naturally sheltered, it should be screened from the <hi>north</hi> and <hi>north-east</hi> winds by a boarded fence, or rather one of reeds, as from a solid fence the wind reverberates; but straw, or flake hurdles set endwise may do. A screen of some sort, (and a close clipt <hi>hedge</hi> is as good as any) not only protects the enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from the harsher winds, and confines the warm air, but keeps a rather unsightly work from view, and straws from blowing about, the litter of which is very disagreeable. In large gardens, however, they have <hi>detached</hi> grounds for the work of hot beds, where such litter is of no consequence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Working</hi> of the dung is necessary previous to the making a hot bed; i. e. it should be thrown together on an heap, in a conical form; and when it has taken a thorough heat, and has been smoking or sweating for two or three days, it should be turned over, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the outside in, or mixing the colder parts with the hot. When it has taken heat again for two or three days, give it a second turn as before, and having lain the same time, it will be in proper order for making a
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:035770_0188_1006BD1A08E04B08"/>
good lasting bed with a steady heat. If in any haste, it may be made into a bed after the first heating; but it will be better for shifting again. When dung is ready before wanted, keep turning it over, left it be too much spent. It will be proper to begin to work <hi>fresh</hi> dung a week or ten days before it is to be used; but if the dung is not fresh, it is only necessary to throw it together for once heating.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dunghills</hi> from which it is designed to collect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for a hot bed, should be taken notice of in time, that they are not left to work themselves <hi>weak</hi> by long smoking, without opening and turning over. Beds may be made of dung from the stable from a week to a month old.</p>
                  <p>If heavy <hi>rain,</hi> cutting <hi>wind,</hi> or driving <hi>snow</hi> should keep the heaps from heating, and the dung is wanted, lay some straw round it, and it will protect and fetch up the heat. If at first putting it together there is not a general <hi>moisture</hi> in the dung, it must be given it, by casting water evenly over it as it is laid. This may be done with a hand bowl from a pail, but it would be better to use a large watering pot. No water must be used to dung when it is got <hi>dark;</hi> this is however the colour that it <hi>should</hi> begin to have when put together in a bed, which the directions given for working it will bring it to.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>size</hi> of a hot bed, as to length and breadth, is (of course) to be according to the <hi>frame;</hi> and the height of it according to the <hi>season,</hi> and the degree of heat requisite to the nature of the <hi>plant</hi> to be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. In a dry soil, a bed may be <hi>sunk</hi> in the ground, from six inches to a foot, to make it more convenient to get at and manage. But beds made <hi>forward</hi> in the season, should rather be on the surface, for the sake of being able to add the stronger <hi>linings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The bed should not be of greater dimensions than necessary to hold the frame up firmly; i. e. three or four inches wider every way, though some approve of
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:035770_0189_1006BD25462FCD20"/>
making it six, which may be proper if the frame is small, as otherwise the body of dung might not hold heat enough.</p>
                  <p>It is the practice of some gardeners, when they <hi>mould</hi> the bed, to take the frame off, and lay it two or three inches thick all over, and then put the frame on again. This is done to guard against steaming, and is proper when the frames are shallow; in this case the bed must be six inches wider every way than the frame, in order to hold up the mould for the frame to rest upon. As a guide to laying the dung, <hi>stakes</hi> of about four feet long should be drove into the ground at the four corners.</p>
                  <p>If there is a likelihood of not being a sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of good <hi>horse dung,</hi> that of <hi>cows, oxen,</hi> or <hi>pigs,</hi> if it is strawy, and not <hi>too</hi> wet, may be mixed with it, in the proportion of one-fourth, or upon a pinch more; especially in an advanced part of the season, or to cultivate things that are only forcing, and do not naturally require heat. In the case of a deficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of proper materials also, some dry old worn out horse dung may be laid at bottom, and a little of it on the top. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fal <hi>hay</hi> may be mixed as the bed is made; or a little or mown <hi>grass</hi> or <hi>weeds,</hi> especially for late made beds; but <hi>clear straw,</hi> well wetted, may be put at the bottom a foot thick, and reckoned about equal to five or six inches of dung. Cucumbers and melons have been raised upon <hi>straw</hi> beds, mixed with sea coal <hi>ashes:</hi> and thus the rank steam of dung avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which sometimes injures plants, if it does not give the fruit a less agreeable taste than they otherwise would have. <hi>Sea coal ashes</hi> among dung, has been recommended to continue the heat of the bed, and to moderate it, in the proportion of one-fifth or sixth part; <hi>tanner's bark</hi> has been used in the same way: and these have been sometimes mixed generally, and at others in layers three or four to a bed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="unknown:035770_0190_1006BD27BA1FBED8"/>
The <hi>making</hi> of a hot bed is performed thus: lay some of the most strawy dung at bottom, and keep that which appears least worked toward the middle. Let all be <hi>well broke,</hi> and laid evenly without lumps; keeping the ends and sides upright, (or rather hanging over) not suffering them to draw in, left the bed be made too little for the frame, or should thus catch wet. Having laid it about half a yard high, some gardeners <hi>trample</hi> it with the feet set close, and again when raised a foot higher, and lastly when near finished; but <hi>beating</hi> it down well with the back of the fork is by many gardeners thought sufficient, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept indeed the dung be fresh and strawy, and then trampling ought to be used. The <hi>cleaner</hi> dung is, it must not only be more trampled, but more wetted, and the greater quantity of it used. To make beds of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soiled straw,</hi> it is recommended to lay it in a pond for two or three days, and then to throw it in a heap to drain and heat.</p>
                  <p>If any dung is to be used directly from the stable, let it be equally mixed with the rest; but if there is a coldness in the other dung, it will bring the heat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder, by laying a good part of the fresh in the middle, which will soon kindle, and spread warmth. The litter that is made use of for this purpose should be <hi>foul;</hi> and if not, it may be made so, by mixing cow or hog dung with it, or rather by collecting the draining from a farmer's much hill, and sprinkling with it; this would help greatly to fermentation.</p>
                  <p>The best <hi>sort</hi> of dung is that of <hi>bean straw,</hi> next <hi>wheat, rye, oats,</hi> and <hi>barley.</hi> When the season is pretty much advanced, hot beds may be made of <hi>grass</hi> mowings, (as from an orchard) and <hi>weeds,</hi> which is a common practice in the <hi>cider</hi> countries. These heats, however, (though violent) last not long; yet may they be lined with the same materials if done in time, otherwise if a green hot house bed g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="179" facs="unknown:035770_0191_1006BD2D8FA29FE0"/>
used as soon as warm, but let it not be overweighted, by putting on heavy frames, or more mould than nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essary. It should rather be worked with hand glasses, or oiled paper covers. If a large quantity of grass be put together <hi>wet,</hi> it will occasion such a burning heat, as has been known to melt tin; therefore, in these beds some caution must be used.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hot beds</hi> are to be made of the refuse <hi>hark</hi> of a tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's yard, and also of <hi>oak leaves;</hi> but these must have <hi>walled pits</hi> for them, of a large size, and are seldom used but in hot-houses. A bark-bed properly made, and managed by forking up at two or three months end, &amp;c. will hold a fair, moderate, and steady heat, four, five, or six months.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>bark</hi> is to be got fresh, after it has been thrown out of the vats a few days, and if not moderately dry, kept a few days longer to drain, and if the weather is fair, it may be opened to the sun to dry; for it will not ferment if it is put together wet. When it is made into a bed it must be only beat together with the fork, and not trampled. In a fortnight it will have come to a fine heat, and may be immediately used.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>pit</hi> should be eleven or twelve feet long, five and a half or six feet wide, and a foot, or a little more, higher than the bark in front, and two feet higher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, to receive the mould on a body of bark, three feet deep: But if for the cultivation of any thing in <hi>pots,</hi> as there will need no mould, the pits need not be so deep, the pots being plunged in the bark: or the pit may be made level all round, of a depth to hold the bark and mould, on which frames of wood may be set. Let the pit be sunk one-third, or one-half in the ground, as the soil about it is either cold or warm. In the section <hi>on Flowers,</hi> is mentioned a method of making hot beds of <hi>bran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>increase</hi> the heat of a <hi>dung</hi> bed when it declines, a warm <hi>lining</hi> of straw, or hay, put round it, a foot thick, and laid high up the sides of the frame, will
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:035770_0192_1006905367A381B8"/>
recover it for a few days; but a lining of <hi>hot</hi> dung, one foot and a half wide at bottom, and rather nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower at top, should be applied first to the back, and in about a week after to the front, <hi>before</hi> the heat is greatly gone off; and if very bad weather comes, there should be a lining of straw all round this. In cases of <hi>great</hi> declension of heat, the <hi>ends</hi> should have <hi>hot</hi> dung applied to them, or, at least, a good thickness of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or straw. Lay all <hi>linings</hi> a few inches higher than the bed, to allow for sinking; or, not being laid quite so high at first, add more afterwards, when a little settled. Early made beds will require two or three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated linings. Should dung of a brisk heat for a new lining be wanting, the old lining may be worked up with what there is, and if shook up with quite fresh (but foul) dung from the stable it may do very well.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>decrease</hi> the heat of a bed, several <hi>holes</hi> may be made in it, by thrusting an iron bar, or a thick, smooth, sharp pointed stake up to the middle, which holes are to be close stopt again, with dung or hay, when the heat is sufficiently abated.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>uses</hi> to which hot beds may be applied are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but chiefly for the cultivation of <hi>cucumbers</hi> and <hi>melons,</hi> for which see the next section. At the spring of the year, hot beds are commonly made use of for forcing crops of several vegetables, as <hi>radishes, carrots, cauliflowers, lettuces, potatoes, turnips, peas, kidney beans, purslain, tarragon, small sallading,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fruits</hi> of several sorts, as <hi>cherries, strawberries, raspberries,</hi> &amp;c. are sometimes brought forward by dung heat; as also various <hi>shrubs</hi> and <hi>flowers,</hi> by means of <hi>forcing frames.</hi> Tender <hi>annuals,</hi> as <hi>balsams,</hi> and other flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that necessarily require heat to bring them up; and the less tender, and some even of the harder sorts, are also cultivated on hot beds, or other assistance from dung, to produce an earlier blow than could other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be had. Directions for which, will be given in their proper places.</p>

                     <p>GARDENERS usually provide three crops of <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers</hi> in the season, all of which will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to <hi>hot dung</hi> to produce them: except some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, indeed, the last sowing be upon cold ground, which, in some situations, and in some seasons, may do very well for a few picklers. We begin with the <hi>early</hi> crop.</p>
                     <p>Make a <hi>seed bed</hi> of the size of a one-light frame, (or a two-light were better) from three to four feet thick, and if amoitious of being forward, do it some time between the first and fifteenth of <hi>January,</hi> though some gardeners sow about <hi>Christmas:</hi> But the sooner this work is begun, the more hazard there is of failing,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035770_0194_1006BD3AEAFEAB08"/>
and the more skill and trouble will be necessary to manage them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>young</hi> gardener is advised not to attempt this business till the middle of <hi>February;</hi> and then, if he has the good fortune to succeed properly, he will cut fruit about the middle of <hi>May.</hi> When he has attained some skill in the work, he may begin sooner; for there is nothing that professed gardeners are so fond of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting, as <hi>early</hi> cucumbers, which is a proof, that no little ingenuity and attention is necessary to produce them. All favourable circumstances coinciding, as sowing the forwardest in kind, mild and sunny wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and plenty of dung, with good frames at the command of skill and industry, early cucumbers are sometimes raised in about eight weeks, and later in the season have been raised in six; but near upon three months must <hi>commonly</hi> be allowed.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>bed</hi> being ready, agreeable to the directions given in the last section, which may be four feet high in <hi>January,</hi> three and a half in <hi>February,</hi> and three in <hi>March,</hi> or the medium as a general rule; let it be cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with the frame and lights, raising the glasses a little to let off the steam that will come strongly from the bed.</p>
                     <p>When the heat has been up three or four days in a single light, or a day or two more, if a two-light frame, let it be taken off, and see that the surface of the bed is perfectly level; but rather rising behind, and if you think the bed is hardly strong enough, the opportunity is given to add a course or two more of dung. Having levelled the bed with the fork, beat it smooth with a shovel or spade, and put the frame and glass on again.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>temper</hi> of the bed is now to be attended to, that it be not moulded till the <hi>burning</hi> heat is over; a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which may be formed, by keeping two sharp pointed smooth sticks thrust in behind, and occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feeling them, by a quick grasp of the hand. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:035770_0195_1006BD3CAA5BCBB8"/>
to hit the <hi>exact</hi> time, not putting the mould on too soon, as it is liable to burn, not delaying too long, and so to lose time, and too much of that heat, the bed was made for.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>moulding</hi> is thus; lay all over the bed about three inches thick of <hi>rich</hi> loose (not over light) and <hi>dry</hi> earth, and add as much in the centre of the light as will raise a hill eight or nine inches deep, which as soon as warm through, is to be used, except the bed seem <hi>too</hi> hot, and likely to burn; in which case, draw the chief of the mould aside round the frame, that the heat may have vent in the middle, for a day or two. As it is a thing essentially necessary in the cultivation of early cucumbers, to have <hi>rich</hi> earth, properly <hi>dry,</hi> it should be prepared, and laid by in <hi>autumn,</hi> in some airy shed or hovel. Let it be, if possible, some fresh under turf earth, mixed with about one-fourth part of thorough rotten horse dung, and often stirred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>sowing</hi> may be made upon the hill of mould, levelled down to about six inches deep; but if any sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of burning (or in short at any rate,) it were better to sow in a small <hi>pot</hi> or two, which should be filled with the warm mould, and plunged a little way in, more or less, according to the heat of the bed, for if the bed appears to be <hi>over</hi> hot, the pot may be raised from it; cover the seeds half an inch, and add a gentle pressure of the earth upon them. In a bed of proper temper, they will be up in three or four days, and sooner or later, if there is too strong or too weak a heat; though the age of the seed will occasion some difference. <hi>Very</hi> old seed (which some gardeners are fond of, as running less to vine, and so reckoned the more fruitful,) will sometimes come up weak, and also rot, when the mould is damp, and the heat not strong; so that seed of two, three, or, at the most, four years of age is to be preferred: That of a year old only comes up certainly, but too luxuriantly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="unknown:035770_0196_1006BD4260C44A58"/>
Whether the first seeds come up, or not, on the <hi>third</hi> day, sow a few more, and so again and again; for the young plants are incident to failures at this early season, from various causes. As the seed must not be sown in wet earth, so if it gets <hi>too</hi> dry, sprinkle the mould to moisten it a little below the depth of the seed; but let it be with water previously set in the frame (in a bottle) to warm. Be sure to give the plants <hi>air,</hi> according to the weather, raising the lights from one half, to a whole inch; and now, and ever after, while there is a strong heat in the bed, tilt one corner of a light for the steam to pass off on nights, and let a mat hang, or be nailed loosely over the open part.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>pricking out</hi> the young plants is to be done when they are three or four days old, taking them up care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and the mould being warm, put three in a small <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as the common practice is; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, or one, is a good method. If one plant only is put in a <hi>small</hi> pot, it certainly may be expected to grow stronger, and be continued longer in the pot, and three of these may be planted close together in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>iting bed. If only one plant is put in, set it upright in the middle of the pot nearly up to the seed leaves. If two or three are pot in, take the mould out of the pot in a bason-like form, an inch or a little more deep, as the shanks are, laying the roots smooth towards the centre, and the leaves towards the edge of the pot; cover up to the top; and give the earth a gentle pressure.</p>
                     <p>If the mould is <hi>very</hi> dry and the bed hot, a <hi>little</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be immediately given to the <hi>roots;</hi> but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the next day will be best.</p>
                     <p>Give very little <hi>air</hi> the first day, but afterwards more, as the sun shines or not, or the day is mild, or sharp, still, or windy. As the plants get older and hardier, air may be given up to two inches, when there is a good heat, and extraordinary fine weather,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:035770_0197_1006BD4E7B6A4BF0"/>
to three or four inches of tilt: For this purpose, wedges of wood about four inches thick are proper. If suspicious of the air coming in too <hi>suddenly,</hi> tack a bit of cloth, or mat before the place. Air is to be given in different <hi>degrees,</hi> regularly as the weather alters in the course of the day;—a little air in the morning, more as the day advances, and less again as it declines.</p>
                     <p>Cucumbers will not do well, if the <hi>air</hi> in the bed is long confined, or stagnant: <hi>Sun</hi> is necessary as well as air, but as that we cannot furnish, every advantage that <hi>is</hi> in our power, we should not fail to make use of.</p>
                     <p>The plants are to be <hi>nursed,</hi> and preserved mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately warm, by keeping the pots plunged less or more in the bed, placing them towards the outsides of the frame when there is a great heat, and more in the middle when it is moderate.</p>
                     <p>Keep some <hi>mould</hi> round the inside of the frame, ready to earth up the pots to the rim, as the heat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines. There should not be less than two, or more than three inches depth of mould, in the intermediate spaces of the frame; for when the bed is moulded too thick, it keeps down the heat too much, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions <hi>burning.</hi> Young plants should be guarded from <hi>much</hi> sun, if the season is advanced, and especially when the bed is hot.</p>
                     <p>Attend to the <hi>weather,</hi> and if rain, snow, or wind, is either of them likely to chill the bed much, provide against it in time, by laying straw round; and if the heat naturally declines much, line, &amp;c. as directed page 179, in order to recover and keep it up, for the plants will soon be spoiled, or lost, if the bed gets cold. They are to grow in the pots, till their first rough leaves are two or three inches broad. When there is only one in a pot, a plant (upon a pinch,) may grow in it till it has runners and blossoms.</p>

Use <hi>water,</hi> (which should be soft) but moderately at first, till the roots get spread about the pot, and then wet the shanks of the plants, as little as can be helped, if the season is early, or there is little sun. When the roots are got <hi>to</hi> the bottom of the pot, take care to water to the bottom; but over much watering of young plants, makes them sickly. Once a week at an early season, will be sufficient, except the heat is very strong in the bed, and the weather very sunny: the water must be in a small degree warm, and given in the morning towards the middle of the day.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>seed bed</hi> is not likely to hold the plants so long as directed, or nearly, in a free growing state, an <hi>intermediate bed</hi> should be made in <hi>time</hi> to receive them; for it is not proper to plant them out into the fruit bed <hi>too</hi> soon, left there should be a failure in keeping up its heat to set the fruit and bring it on. This inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate bed should be made of proportionate strength, for the <hi>time</hi> it is wanted, and may do at two and a half, or three feet thick, nor need there be any great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to an intermediate bed, as it tends to insure success, and brings the plants on faster, and saves trouble in keeping up the heat of the seed bed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Burning</hi> is a thing to be suspected when a bed is very hot, and in proportion as the mould is damp; and should therefore be seen to, by drawing away some mould from the bottom near the middle; and if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears discoloured, of a greyish hue, and caked, let what is so, be taken out from all parts of the bed, as soon as possible; but take care that in doing it, too much cold air do not damp the bed, or injure the plants. Do this work at the best time of the day, while the sun shines, if it may be, and rather at twice, allowing an hour or so between. Fill up with fresh and dry mould, and keep the glasses close, till the earth is got thorough warm again. Burning, however, is not of so much consequence now, as when the plants are put out to fruit, for the <hi>pots</hi> may be drawn from
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:035770_0199_1006BD525E3F6880"/>
the evil; but burnt mould contaminates the air, as well as injures the roots that it reaches to. <hi>Burning</hi> will be mentioned again presently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Steaming</hi> must be guarded against, and the rank effluvia which rises in the bed at first, and whilst the dung is quite hot, must have vent night and day, by raising the lights. A little rise will do on nights, and if a mat hangs before the aperture, or is nailed down loosly over it, the too sudden entrance of cold air will be prevented. But when the strong heat of the bed is certainly over, shut close on nights, and give but little air in unfavourable days. The steam is sometimes drawn into a frame from the outside of the bed, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sined by the <hi>mats</hi> hanging over it; therefore, in cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering, it is necessary to keep up the ends of the mats, so that the glass only be covered. Danger of steam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arises also from the application of fresh linings, the smoke of which, wind may drive into the frames; so that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ning should either be covered with two or three inches of mould, or which is better, a good thickness of fine hay. Sometimes steam will insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate itself round the inside of the frame, through the bed settling unequally, so that the mould draws from it, which is easily remedied by filling the apertures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Covering</hi> up at night has been just directed to be <hi>only</hi> over the glasses, for a reason given. Put the cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on a little before sunset, and take off a little after sunrise, except very bad weather dictate otherwise; yet remember, that <hi>light</hi> is a most necessary article in the welfare of plants, and guard against permitting cover longer than compelled to it. While the bed is in a good heat, one mat is sufficient, but yet if the weather is sharp, more should be used; for if not necessary for the warmth, it will be useful to keep the steam of the bed from being so suddenly <hi>condensed</hi> as to drop on the plants, which would injure them. As the bed declines in heat, and the weather is cold, a thicker covering must be put on; and a very warm covering
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:035770_0200_1006BDC9E2075D60"/>
is made thus:—lay on a mat, and over it a coat of straw, or rather hay, and then a mat on the top, which tack down round the frame. It will help to warmth, to push into the dung some little sticks round the frame, and fill up the space with hay. Covering <hi>round</hi> the bed with straw, and <hi>lining</hi> have been spoken of; and let these applications be made in time.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seed bed</hi> by good management, may be kept with a good growing heat for six weeks, when the plants being about five weeks old, will be ready for putting into a new bed to bear fruit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Stopping</hi> the plants, is to be performed about a week before they leave the seed bed; i. e. as soon as the second rough leaf is expended, and shews in its bosom the little <hi>bud</hi> or eye, that produces a runner. This is to be nicely cut off with a penknife, or small sharp pointed scissars, or picked out with a needle, though if it gets forward, it may be pinched off. Soon after this operation, the plant thickens, and will push for runners again, which the stopping is designed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to, as also to an earlier and more plentiful bearing. The practice of stopping is <hi>again</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon the first runners when they have three joints without shewing the <hi>germen,</hi> or embryo fruit.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>fruit bed</hi> comes now, and it should be made of <hi>good</hi> materials, duly prepared, and well put together, towards four feet thick. It ought not to be for less than a two-light, but better for a three-light frame, as the heat is more certainly to be kept up a proper length of time, without which all the previous labour is lost. Preparations must be made for this bed at <hi>least</hi> a fortnight before it is wanted, in the way direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the last section.</p>
                     <p>Before <hi>earthing,</hi> take care that the <hi>burning</hi> heat is over, and that the mould to be used be properly <hi>dry.</hi> Lay it all over the bed not more than three inches thick, (for reasons given, page 185) making hills where the plants are to be set about twelve or fourteen inches
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:035770_0201_1006BDD49085A8F8"/>
depth. A two-light bed (of proper materials) will not be ready for moulding in less than a week or ten days for making; nor a three-light in less than ten days or a fortnight. But if it should be desired to plant out quick, on account of the seed beds hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got cold, a security from burning the <hi>plants</hi> is found in forming a hole in the bed, where the plants are to be, two inches deep, and about a foot or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen inches over, and filling up with fresh <hi>cow dung;</hi> through this the heat will not burn, and if it catches the other parts of the bed, the disease may be easily remedied. Some gardeners place <hi>turf</hi> under the plants, with the grass downwards, to prevent excess of heat; and it helps to keep the mould in other parts from burning, to stir it about in time. A preventa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive used by some, is to put on a layer of five or six inches of <hi>old dung,</hi> when the bed is made. It should seem that a layer of about three inches of <hi>old bark</hi> might prevent burning. See <hi>Burning,</hi> pages 185, 186, 191.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Planting</hi> is to take place as soon as the heaps of mould are warm. Spread the earth on the top a little, and having the hills a full ten inches depth; make a hole in the middle six inches deep, to receive the pot of plants, which pots will be from four and a half to five inches deep, and consequently the plants will be sunk in this hole a full inch more in mould than they were in the pot: and they will have four inches depth of mould at the bottom, which there should be below the roots. Draw the mould up to the plants, and press it gently between, and to them all round the hillock. It is spoken here of a pot of plants with three, but if only one in a pot, the whole hill must be thrown down to four inches depth, and the plants set one close by the side of the other, and then filled up and round with the mould of the bed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="190" facs="unknown:035770_0202_1006BDD62954BFE0"/>
To <hi>shift</hi> plants out of the pots with the ball of earth entire about them, put the fingers between the plants, and turning the pot up, give it a gentle tap on the knee, or edge of the frame, and the whole will come out; a little pressure at the same time through the hole at bottom, with a finger of the other hand, will assist: turn the plants up carefully, and place them in so. To secure their coming out whole, water the pots to the bottom the day before; and if not too wet they will slip out. If the plants hold tight to the pots, when turned up, a long thin narrow bladed knife, will be proper to loosen the sides. If the mould should fall from the plants, carefully spread the roots in plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they will be sure to grow, only their having no mould to them, will occasion a little loss of time till they have struck root again. Thus having <hi>settled</hi> the plants, shut the lights close till all is thorough warm, and then give a little air; if the mould pot round the roots be dry, give a little water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Management</hi> as to <hi>air, covering, watering</hi> and <hi>lining,</hi> and guarding against <hi>burning, steaming,</hi> &amp;c. is now to occupy the constant attention of the gardener: On these heads, what has been before said, may serve for instruction now; only as the season advances, and the plants get strong, the more air and watering may be ventured on, and if the heat of the bed is good, less covering will do. As the season advances, <hi>water</hi> earlier in the morning, or later in the afternoon, so as not to have a full and strong sun come directly upon the leave while wet: for drops of water act as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex glasses, to draw the rays of the sun to a focus, and scorches. As the weather may be cool, and the bed gets cool <hi>water</hi> the more sparingly, and in this case especially, avoid wetting the <hi>shanks</hi> of the plants much. It will be known when water <hi>must</hi> be given, by the larger leaves flagging, without any violent sun to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion an extraordinary perspiration. Bottles of water may be kept in the frame, which is preferable to that
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035770_0203_1006BDD82E797DD0"/>
warmed at a fire; yet the latter must be used when there is not enough of the former, to water so deeply as necessary. When the frame gets full of <hi>vine,</hi> it gets full of <hi>root;</hi> and as by this time the days get long, and may be sunny, a good portion of water for the whole may be wanted twice, or, perhaps, thrice a week, to swell the fruit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Air</hi> should be given (as before directed) in <hi>fine</hi> wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a tilt of three inches, or more. While there is a <hi>brisk</hi> heat in the bed, give a little air on <hi>nights.</hi> If the bed gets cold, it may be helped by <hi>covering</hi> up earlier and warmer, and uncovering later; though the plants should not be deprived of more <hi>light</hi> than made necessary by bad weather.</p>
                     <p>In case of <hi>burning</hi> being discovered, take the burnt mould from under the plants carefully, but quickly, but quickly, as far as can be, without throwing them down: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be cautious of <hi>steaming,</hi> and think of <hi>lining</hi> (185) in time, that the plants be not stunted by cold, for when they are materially checked, they hardly ever recover it. Sometimes the application of linings, will so increase the heat as to occasion <hi>burning;</hi> let this be seen to, and (at least) remove a part, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make it when the violent heat is sufficiently abated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Earth up</hi> the shanks with <hi>dry</hi> mould, (kept in the frame on purpose) as the plants increase; and let warm <hi>mould</hi> be added to the sides of the heaps, as soon as ever the roots begin to appear through, or the runners need support; proceeding thus from time to time, till the bed is filled up level all over. For this end keep bringing in a little cold mould frequently, laying it round the sides of the frame. When the bed is filled with mould, it is a good way to <hi>press</hi> it tightish round the frame, about a hand's breadth, to keep the roots longer from the outside.</p>
                     <p>Some <hi>gardeners</hi> mould the bed all over, as soon as they are satisfied there can be no more burning; but it is best to do it at several times, and <hi>not</hi> sooner than
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035770_0204_1006BDDBEEBDA320"/>
is necessary to cover the roots, and support the runners; because, where the mould lies thin, the heat come up better to warm the air in the frame, for the leaves will want warmth as well as the roots.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Train</hi> the runners close down regularly with neat pegs, as they proceed in growth, and prune the <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drils</hi> off as they appear, but take care not to <hi>break</hi> any of the leaves. When the days get long, and prove very sunny, the <hi>shade</hi> of a single mat, for two or three hours in the middle of the day will be proper, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose from eleven to two.</p>
                     <p>Thus very <hi>particular directions</hi> have been given, but still much will depend upon <hi>circumstances,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion must direct. Let it be remembered, no <hi>neglect</hi> will be borne with. If any imprudent person should lift the lights high, to pry into the bed in improper weather, perhaps an early tender crop might at once receive their death blow, though exposed but a very short time. Success in raising cucumbers and melons <hi>chiefly</hi> depends upon keeping the bed in <hi>due temper;</hi> the plants being neither burned nor chilled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Setting the fruit</hi> is the practice of most good gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners, as generally ensuring the <hi>embryos</hi> from going off, as they are apt to do at an early season; when not much wind can be suffered to enter the bed, and no bees or insects are about, to convey the <hi>sarina</hi> from the <hi>male</hi> flowers to the <hi>female.</hi> The <hi>male</hi> flowers have been commonly called <hi>false blossoms,</hi> and so have been regularly pulled off (as said) to strengthen the plants, but they are essential to <hi>impregnate</hi> the <hi>female</hi> flowers; i. e. those that shew the <hi>germen,</hi> or fruit at their base. This impregnation, called, <hi>setting</hi> the fruit, is artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially done thus:</p>
                     <p>As soon as any <hi>female</hi> flowers are fully open, gather a newly opened <hi>male</hi> flower, and stripping the leaf gently off from the middle, take nicely hold of the bottom, and twirling the top of the male over the centre of the female flower, the fine fertilizing dust
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:035770_0205_1006BDE885DE9FE0"/>
from the male part will fall off, and adhere to the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male part and fecundate it, causing the fruit to keep its colour, swell, and proceed rapidly towards perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so as to cut cucumbers of three or four inches long, in about three weeks after. This business of setting may be practised through the months of <hi>Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary, March,</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> but afterwards it will not be necessary; for the admission of so much air as may afterwards be given, will disperse the <hi>farina</hi> effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but if the weather still is bad, or remarkably calm, the practice may be continued a little longer. If short of male flowers, one of them may serve to impregnate two females. Pull off all the male flowers as fast as they die upon the vines.</p>
                     <p>Something of <hi>pruning</hi> may perhaps be necessary, for plants will not bear well, either in quantity or quality, if the frames are <hi>crowded.</hi> The rule (of course) is, to cut out those runners that can be best spared, as being weak, most in the way, or having the smallest fruit on them. But the better method is to cut down to the root a <hi>whole</hi> plant, in <hi>time,</hi> if there is a <hi>prospect</hi> of being too full of vine: this may seem a great sacrifice, but it will prove a profitable one. Let the discharged plant lay a day to wither, that it hang not to the others, and break their leaves, in drawing it out while fresh. About <hi>Midsummer</hi> the frame may be raised, to permit the runners to strike out, and in a fortnight after taken entirely off; though once in a frame and always in, is better, if it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
                     <p>A SECOND CROP of <hi>cucumbers</hi> may be sown at any time between the middle and end of <hi>March,</hi> if they are to be brought up in <hi>frames;</hi> but if under <hi>hand-glasses,</hi> or <hi>paper covers,</hi> then any time from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>April</hi> to the middle, is soon enough, at least
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:035770_0206_1006BDEDB57568D8"/>
in <hi>Northamptonshire.</hi> A hot bed for sowing the seed at this time, need only be from two and a half to three feet thick, and a one-light frame. On this bed also may be sown, in pots, or otherwise, <hi>tender annuals,</hi> and it is a very good time for most of them. Or the seed for plants to ridge out under hand-glasses, may be sown in pots, and placed in other hot beds, to bring them forward till they are in rough leaf, and have been stopped.</p>
                     <p>What <hi>has</hi> been said about making hot beds, and sowing and managing cucumbers, is sufficient to direct now; only at this season, mowings of <hi>grass</hi> may be put round a bed to increase the heat, and will be found useful to lay on the top of dung linings that are sunk.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>seed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

They should be covered up on nights with a single mat; and when they <hi>must</hi> run from under the glasses, sticks or hoops may keep the mats off from pressing upon them: fasten the covering down at the corners with pegged sticks, to keep them from blowing away. Let the ground about the bed be stirred, and also raised to train the plants level, and to give the roots full room to strike.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>ridging</hi> cucumbers, that are to have only hand-glasses, or some such cover, observe (as advised) not to sow too forward, for better be rather late, than have the plants cut off, or much injured, just as they are going to bear. The hot bed, or <hi>ridge</hi> made in <hi>May</hi> for hand-glasses, should be sunk in a dry soil, two spades deep; and two feet and a half thick of good dung is now enough. The mould that is thrown out, (if it is good) may be used to cover the bed; and if
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:035770_0207_1006BDF2D696D640"/>
but indifferent, may be laid round it, or on it towards the outsides. Lay on it at first only three inches or mould, except where the plants are to be, at which place lay a depth of about nine inches, rather more than less. It is not necessary that the earth should be <hi>very</hi> dry, as directed for early cucumbers, but let it be warm to plant in. If it be <hi>Mid-May</hi> before the plants are put out, <hi>holes</hi> of two or three barrows full of dung may be sufficient to bring them on through <hi>May,</hi> and then the season (if it is not bad) will be warm enough to keep them pushing forwards. There should be near four feet distance between each set of plants. Shade them for a few days at first planting.</p>
                     <p>Cucumbers not sown till the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> may be brought to bear on <hi>one</hi> good bed, if under a large frame; and such a bed would, at the same time, serve very well to sow, or to prick out <hi>tender annuals</hi> on. See section 18, <hi>On flowers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A THIRD CROP of <hi>cucumbers</hi> may be sown any time, from the middle to the end of <hi>May,</hi> (or even a little later) either in a pot or not, upon some hot bed in use, to grow for a week or ten days; or sow upon a little heat of two or three barrows full of warm dung, trod close, and previously thrown together for the purpose; or if fresh and moist from the stable, it will, though at present cold, heat itself.

plants up together by a scoop trowel, with earth to the roots, the better; and if not, plant them pretty near together, laying them aslant, so that the shanks be covered two or three inches. Keep these plants earthed up, and as much under their covers, as may be till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Midsummer,</hi> and let the parts that run out be covered on nights till this time.

                     <p>Sometimes, at this season, cucumbers are sown in <hi>cold</hi> ground, especially about <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>south</hi> or <hi>west</hi> of it; but soil, situation, and season, make a <hi>great</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the cultivation of all, and particularly of delicate plants. If any seed be sown on cold ground, let it be in dry weather; give them a favourable situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and sow in <hi>patches</hi> eight or nine seeds in a hole, formed like a shallow basin, covering half an inch deep; and if covered with hand-glasses to bring them up a little while, it were much better. Thin them when getting into rough leaf, to four or five of the best plants; spread them a little, and earth up to the seed leaves, giving a little water: and if, afterwards, the number of plants is reduced to three, it might be better than more. Those who grow cucumbers for picklers, should have a great many holes of them, or there will not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>now to gather at a time for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Give plenty of air by day, and a little on nights. Raise earth about the shanks as they grow, and let it lie about them, while the plants are small, in the form of a shallow basin.</p>
                     <p>As to saving the <hi>seed</hi> of cucumbers, as it is of some consequence to be <hi>ascertained</hi> of a good kind, when the <hi>early</hi> nature and approved quality of any sort is known, it ought to be an object to save it <hi>well;</hi> which will be best done from plants of the <hi>second</hi> crop, that have been ridged out, i. e. brought up under hand-glasses.

                     <p>Being got <hi>rotten</hi> ripe, scoop out the pulp and seed into some vessel, and stir it well up, which repeat for several days; then let it be washed in two or three waters, which will separate the pulp, and leave the seed clean: spread it thin for two or three days, that it may <hi>dry</hi> thoroughly, and putting it up in paper for use, keep it in a place free from damp. Let it be every now and then examined and rubbed in a dry cloth, and it may be kept for several years.</p>

                     <p>MELONS are raised much in the same way as <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers.</hi> They should not, however, be thought of so early, and from the middle of <hi>February</hi> to the middle of <hi>March,</hi> will (for most persons) be soon enough to sow them. The place where they are cultivated should be <hi>well</hi> sheltered, so that winds may blow over the frames, as mentioned in the directions about hot beds. They require a stronger soil to grow in than cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and more heat, bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>intermediate</hi> bed. During the whole time of the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of melons, (till high summer) they must have a <hi>lively</hi> bottom heat, in order to bring them forward, and succeed well; and, if melons are <hi>late,</hi> as soon as <hi>September</hi> enters, a lining of hot dung may be put to the bed, to afford some degree of heat to the roots, at least equivalent to the failure of the season. Melons never do well in a shady summer; and in the best summers we have, are very inferior to those grown in warmer climates. As <hi>cucumbers</hi> are about three months coming in, so <hi>melons</hi> are about four. They set their fruit in about two months, and are about the same time in ripening, though forty days will sometimes effect it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>seed</hi> of melons (procured from well ripened and fine flavoured fruit) should be about four years old, though some prefer it much older, as judging it so much the less likely to run to vine: If it is <hi>too</hi> old, however, it comes up weak, and is apt to rot, when the mould is not sufficiently dry, and the seed bed not very warm. If <hi>new</hi> seed only can be had, it should be carried a week or two in the breeches pocket, to dry away some of the more watery parts: The <hi>earlier</hi> the seed is sown, the older it should be. Melon seed may be sown in a cucumber bed, that is, in a brisk heat, in pots plunged towards the middle; but a bed should be ready, to move the young plants into before the cucumber bed gets too cool. <hi>Sow</hi> only three or four seeds in each pot, and cover a little more than half an inch: The earth in which the seed is sown, should not be so strong as that in which the plants are to grow for fruit. When the seedlings are three or four days old, take them up carefully, so as not to break any of the roots, and either plant one in a small pot, or two in a little bigger; but depend on no plants which do not appear healthy and strong. Sow a few seeds every four or five days, lest accidents happen to destroy the first plants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="unknown:035770_0211_1006BE034408F968"/>
As <hi>melons</hi> require skill, and occasion trouble to raise them, the greatest possible care should be taken that the <hi>seed</hi> is of a good kind. It is reckoned, that seed saved by the same person, and sown frequently in the same soil and situation, and under the same culture, will degenerate, so that it should be had elsewhere, from some person that may be depended on, and this may be by exchange, as he may be glad of the like opportunity. <hi>Melons</hi> should never grow near <hi>cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> especially if for seed, as the farina of the cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber may impregnate the blossom of the melon, and give it a watery flavour, or quite alter the nature of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Melons</hi> may be sown in a cucumber frame, that is in a good heat; but rather make a <hi>seed bed,</hi> of about three feet thick; and having put on the frame and light, tilt the glass a little, and when the great heat is abated, put on some dry, rich, and fine, but not very light earth, to the thickness of four inches all over, and the next day, if the mould is not <hi>too</hi> hot, sow the seed, some in the beds, and some in pots, placed just in the middle, which may be drawn up out of the way of any <hi>burning</hi> heat.</p>
                     <p>When the plants appear, give them <hi>air,</hi> and beware of rancid <hi>steam</hi> from the glasses dropping on them: They may be wiped with a woollen cloth, or turned to dry in fine weather. Consider what was said about <hi>cucumbers,</hi> concerning too much heat, too little, &amp;c. After the melons have been up two or three days, (as was said before) let them be potted and plunged to the rims, towards the middle of the bed; and the next day a <hi>little</hi> water (warmed in the bed) may be given the <hi>roots;</hi> or a little may be given at the same time, if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ould is very dry.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the plants are <hi>potted,</hi> think of making a <hi>second</hi> bed, to be ready in a week, ten days, or a fortnight, (as circumstances dictate) that so the young plants may receive no check through a decline of heat. This bed should be stronger than the seed bed, and
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:035770_0212_1006BE0AEDD47BA0"/>
rather for a two-light frame; and being moulded as soon as it can be, not to burn, set the pots in, about an inch deep, and in a day or two draw a little mould up round them, and so on again. But if the first bed is warm enough to hold the plants longer, the heat of this second bed (if violent) may be suffered to evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a little more first. Here they are to grow till in the second rough leaf, when the plants should be <hi>stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi> as was directed for cucumbers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third,</hi> or <hi>fruiting bed</hi> is to be (observe) <hi>ready</hi> by a few days after the time of this stopping the plants. It should be a <hi>strong</hi> bed of four feet thick, and for a three-light frame, and made the higher, the more strawy the dung is. <hi>As</hi> soon as the burning heat is sufficiently abated, let the bed be covered all over with good dry melon mould (the best is a rich moderately strong <hi>loam</hi>) three or four inches, and heaps made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each light of about fourteen inches depth. Melons do not fruit well in a light mould, but yet it should not be a heavy one. If the mould is thought too light, let it be pressed a little together to give it consistence.</p>
                     <p>To a fresh <hi>maiden soil,</hi> or good earth from the kitchen garden, that is known to be in heart, (by the strength of the plants it has produced) add about one-fourth, or one-third of <hi>well</hi> consumed <hi>dung,</hi> and it makes a good <hi>compost,</hi> but it must be completely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated by frequent turning and exposing to sun and air, and kept by some means dry, as under a shed, &amp;c. as directed for cucumbers. Much depends on the melons growing in a <hi>good</hi> soil.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>planting</hi> of melons takes place as soon as the hills of mould are warm through; only if a violent heat is in the bed, a day or two's delay does not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, if the plants are doing well where they are; yet the roots must not be cramped longer in the pots than necessary. Melons require a greater depth of mould to grow in than cucumbers, and the bottom of the roots, at planting, should not be nearer than five or
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:035770_0213_1006BE0D0BB8C738"/>
six inches from the dung. Shade them from much sun, till they have taken root.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>lights</hi> are small, one plant under each is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and if large, let there be only two; for melons take up much room, and never do well when they are crowded: It is a great error in the cultivation of melons not to observe this. Earth the plants up with dry mould about the shanks as they proceed in growth, and bend them <hi>gently</hi> down with pegs, to give them a regular and snug direction all over the bed. When <hi>fruit</hi> is set, there must be only one of the large, and two of the small sorts, (fair and promising) left on each principal runner, and this runner should be pinched off at the second or third joint above it, which is called <hi>stopping.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pruning</hi> is necessary in order to strengthen the bearers, and keep the frame from getting too full of vine, i. e. let all very strong, and all <hi>weak</hi> shoots be taken out, as also the <hi>tendrils;</hi> but take care that too many <hi>male</hi> blossoms are not thus cut off, for the weak shoots (if not abundant) do no great harm. As in other plants, so in melons, it is the middling shoots that bear best.</p>
                     <p>Lay the branches all regular (<hi>in time</hi>) with neat pegs, for it hurts melon plants to lie rude, and to have their leaves disturbed or damaged, to put them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. A piece of tile, or a small earthen plate under each fruit is proper, to keep it from the damp mould, and to assist its ripening by reflected heat. Three (at the most four) melons are as many as should grow upon one plant, and those are best that are situated nearest to the stem, as remote ones are not so well nourished. Do not let a great deal of vine grow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, lest they be too much robbed, and let them be <hi>stopped</hi> as before directed, for when there is a great length of vine above, nature pushes towards the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and passing by the fruit below, forms more above, sometimes to the total loss of the first set.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="202" facs="unknown:035770_0214_1006BE158A896B10"/>
Keep <hi>mould</hi> round the sides of the frame, to earth up round the hills (a little at a time) as the plants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and do not earth all over before necessary, as full earthing at first is apt to occasion burning, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to damp the heat of the bed too much, and the warmth of the air about the plants. When the bed is earthed all over, <hi>press</hi> the mould round the sides of the frame about six inches wide, to make it firm, that the roots may not get too soon to the wood, and mat against it, which often occasions sickliness.</p>
                     <p>Do not think of cultivating <hi>early</hi> melons, without plenty of dung both for beds and linings. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of management, concerning <hi>covering, shading, air, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

As melons therefore are kept rather <hi>dry,</hi> they should be shaded a little in <hi>very</hi> sunny weather by a single mat, for two or three hours in the middle of the day; i. e. when the season is forward, especially if the bed itself be in a hot state.</p>
                     <p>Melons may be <hi>watered</hi> moderately once a week, in fair weather, or twice if sultry, especially if the mould is light. Early in the season, water a little before noon, and in high summer a little before evening. When the fruit is <hi>setting,</hi> and when getting towards <hi>ripening,</hi> very little water must be given; be sure to water the <hi>extremities</hi> of the roots, but avoid the <hi>shanks,</hi> particularly while the plants are young.

Because much wet is certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, some gardeners keep their melons exceeding

dry; but their leaves should not shew <hi>too</hi> much sign of drought, lest the fruit shrivel for want of moisture. Take particular care that the heat is kept up, at the <hi>setting</hi> of the fruit, or it will become yellow, and fall off. Keep a bottom heat till about <hi>Mid-June.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Melons should not be <hi>turned</hi> about, as is the practice of some, in order to ripen the fruit all over; for it is a violence done to nature in the <hi>foot stalk,</hi> distorting the vessels that feed the melons, and so preventing a proper digestion of the juices.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>flavour</hi> of a melon being preferable to the size, is the reason why water is to be withheld (as much as can be) when they are ripening; and indeed <hi>all</hi> esculents are better tasted that grow in a dry, than in a moist soil: In the latter, they will become bigger, and so appear finer; but what is quantity without quality?</p>
                     <p>The young <hi>fruit</hi> need not be fully exposed to the sun, it had better be a little covered with leaves. Much hot sun hardens the skin of all fruit, and prevents its proper growth. When a melon has nearly attained its size, <hi>then,</hi> however, a full sun is necessary to ripen it.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>cutting</hi> the fruit, if it is to be some days before a melon is eat, (as when carried to a distance) it should not be quite ripe. Its <hi>ripeness</hi> is known by the high colour and strong odour, and the cracking of the foot stalk; and if they give not a full and pleasant scent, they will not prove good. Always cut melons in the <hi>morning,</hi> and if fully ripe they should not be kept more than two or three days. If a melon is cut <hi>before</hi> it is ripe (t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s said) it may be ripened, by wrapping it close up in cloth, and placing it in a heap of warm horse dung for twenty-four hours. But the better way would probably be, to treat them as unripe <hi>med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> which article see.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="unknown:035770_0216_1006BE1F5609F7C0"/>
A SECOND CROP of melons is to be had, by sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in any other hot-bed, or one made on purpose) from <hi>Mid-March</hi> to the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> according to situation, as in a favourable one the sowing may be ventured on the later. These must be brought up as before, till <hi>stopped,</hi> and then ridg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d out; i. e. when about a month or five weeks old. The method of which is, to make a <hi>trench</hi> in the ground four feet wide, and deep according to the soil: If the ground is dry it may be a foot, or near two feet deep, or otherwise but a few inches. Lay in <hi>hot</hi> dung full two feet and a half thick, being well shook and beat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the fork. This trench must be of length according to the number of plants designed to be put out. For each hole (which should be full four feet asunder) put on good melon earth, laid up round to fifteen or eighteen inches high; and then lay the earth, thrown out of the trench, to the sides and top, about three or four inches thick, breaking it fine, and cover all over with mats to draw up the heat: But never expect <hi>ridged</hi> out melons (particularly to do well in a light soil. When the earth is warm, put in the plants, two in a hole, (or only <hi>one</hi>) giving a little warm water, and cover with large hand, or bell glasses, or oiled paper lights, and proceed to manage according to that discretion, which the directions already given about <hi>melons</hi> and <hi>cucumbers</hi> have inculcated.</p>
                     <p>As the bed sinks, and the roots spread, take care to add a good thickness of mould around, for the plants to strike into, and to keep them up: This may be put in a week or ten days, and it will keep out cold air and wet from the dung; but it is best not done at first. When the plants spread to the extent of the bed, the ground about it should be dug over, and rotten dung buried to raise it to the level of the bed; but, perhaps, this work has been superseded by the necessity of a <hi>lining.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="unknown:035770_0217_1006BE26B08660E8"/>
If the plants are forward enough to <hi>ridge</hi> out in <hi>April,</hi> or <hi>beginning</hi> of May, it may be proper to make these beds on the level surface, or nearly so, for the sake of <hi>lining;</hi> but if later, they may be sunk as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected above, or deeper still, in a dry soil. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it will be necessary to <hi>line,</hi> if there appears any likelihood of a want of heat, before the fruit is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly <hi>set.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If two <hi>ridges</hi> of melon plants, let there be four feet (or more) of alley between them, and then a lining may be applied of that width to heat both beds; and this <hi>middle</hi> heat may be made use of to raise plants for the third crop of <hi>cucumbers,</hi> or tender <hi>annual</hi> flowers, <hi>purylain,</hi> &amp;c. Give ridged out plants <hi>air</hi> on the <hi>south</hi> side. They will need more <hi>water</hi> when in the ridges than in frames, and give it wide, but little about the stem, or hardly there at all; nor let it be applied cold, though a small degree of warmth from the <hi>sun,</hi> or otherwise, will do. This crop need never be shaded but when the leaves hang. When the plants cannot be contained under the glasses, let them be carefully trained out, and covered with mats all over on nights, and on days, in bad weather, till <hi>July,</hi> particularly if much <hi>rain</hi> falls.</p>
                     <p>With large <hi>papered frames</hi> this work of the <hi>second</hi> crop of melons may be very well managed. The plants should be kept under hand-glasses till too big for them, and then the paper lights may be put on, which containing the runners till high summer, they will be safe. Yet these covers, being set upon bricks, may be kept always on; but let the <hi>fruit</hi> that happens to be without side be covered with a <hi>hand-glass,</hi> which will help to ripen it. For <hi>summer</hi> protection, <hi>oiled paper</hi> suits all sorts of plants that grow under them, as it admits light and heat in a <hi>moderate</hi> way. Let them be protected in heavy rains, by laying some cloth, or mat, over, and towards the close of summer guard against much cold.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Oiled paper lights</hi> are either made like the tilt of a waggon, or ridged like an house. They should be from four to five feet wide at bottom, and of a height in proportion, only rather steep than flat, and of a length at pleasure, according to what they are design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cover. The <hi>oil</hi> had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

The best printing demy paper is proper, and when oiled, it should be kept in shelter till quite dry, lest the rain wash the oil off. It may be either pasted on the frame, or together, of a breadth and length proper to lay over, (as suppose of nine sheets, which is about the size of a mat) lapping a little, and being held down at bottom on each side by a string, or a moveable slip of deal, the paper may be kept fast on. The general frame should be made rather stiff, but the bars as light as can be, and assisted with lines of string to keep the paper up. If the paper is thus moveable, there should be a sort of door to open at the ends, to give air, &amp;c. as it would be troublesome to move the whole frame every time any thing is to be done. But if the paper is pasted to the frame, then the sides, in lengths of double the width of paper, should be on hinges, to lift up.</p>
                     <p>A THIRD CROP of melons may be sown (in favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able situations) towards the end of <hi>April,</hi> or beginning of <hi>May,</hi> if the former crop was sown about <hi>Mid-March,</hi> and this is to be proceeded with in the same manner as the second; only when <hi>September</hi> comes, (as was observed) late melons should be preserved as much as possible from <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>wet,</hi> that they may ripen. To this end <hi>frames</hi> may be used over all, or at least <hi>hand-glasses</hi> put over each fruit, covering warmly up with mats on nights.

                  <head>OF ESCULENTS.</head>
                  <p>THE USEFULENESS of esculent plants, as serving for the <hi>food, health,</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> of man, is pretty generally acknowledged; and that they may not fail to answer these ends in the best way, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served here, that they deserve every attention; and that, not only in their cultivation, but in their <hi>prep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aration</hi> for the table. Let there be no slight put upon the bounty of PROVIDENCE in ordaining them to our use, by an unnecessary preference to other foods. "There was a time, when bread and herbs (with a little fruit) were the only dainties wherewith the tables of the greatest voluptuaries were spread."</p>
                  <p>"Vegetables and fruits (observes <hi>Quintinye</hi>) were our innocent, primitive, and natural food; but men's depraved appetites have substituted the shambles; yet after all, the inventions of the most luxurious and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous <hi>epicure,</hi> the most <hi>Coesarian</hi> tables would want of their magnificence, noble gust, and grateful relish, without fruit and the productions of the <hi>garden,</hi> which gives the true condiment, and most agreeable closure to all the rest."</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Ray,</hi> in his History of Plants, says, "Their use is all our life long, of that universal importance and concern, that we can neither live nor subsist in any plenty, with decency or convenience, or be said to live at all without them; whatsoever contributes to delight or refresh us, are supplied and brought forth out of this plentiful and delightful store of the <hi>garden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="unknown:035770_0220_1006BE30B84B9348"/>
Let it be a rule to gather vegetables of all kinds (designed for the table) in the morning, before much sun has shined on them, and lay them by in a cool place.</p>
                  <p>ALEXANDER is a culinary plant, formerly much used, but has given away to <hi>celery,</hi> like which it is <hi>blanched,</hi> about a foot high, for use in soups and sallads. The seeds are best sown in drills two feet asunder, and thinned to six or eight inches distance, though they may be sown at broad cast and transplanted. Spring sown plants come in for autumn, and autumn ones for spring.</p>
                  <p>ARTICHOKE, there are two kinds of, the <hi>globe</hi> and the <hi>conical;</hi> (which is the hardest) but the former being generally preferred, both for size and flavour, the latter is seldom seen. Artichokes are propagated from rooted slips, or offsets in <hi>April</hi> taken from the mother plant, by drawing the mould aside. As they require a rich soil, and are stationary plants, dig a good quantity of dung in <hi>below</hi> the roots for them to strike into.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>head</hi> of the artichoke is valuable according to its size and substance, and therefore to a good soil, add good room, for though they <hi>may</hi> be planted nearer, yet they would do much better in rows six feet asunder, and three feet apart in the rows. This distance is great, but between these rows may be propagated sev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral sorts of spring or early summer crops. They should be regularly <hi>watered</hi> in dry weather, and suffered to bear only <hi>one</hi> principal head. <hi>Fresh plantations</hi> should be made every third or fourth year, to have them in perfection. Every year that they stand after planting they should be dug round, and some manure applied. Cut the heads when the leaves begin to expand, and before the centre opens for flowering; and let them
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:035770_0221_1006BE3AD29A9A90"/>
have about a foot of stalk, breaking the remaining part of the stem down to the bottom, that it may not rob the root. At the <hi>spring</hi> dressing, all the suckers are to be taken off, leaving three only of the strongest shoots to fruit.</p>
                  <p>Let the plants be <hi>protected</hi> from hard <hi>frosts;</hi> before the prospect of which, cut down the stalks and outside leaves to the inner one, dig between, and earth the plants to near the tops; and if severe weather follows, they should be covered thick with straw, which must be removed when the frost goes. The earthing up need not be levelled down till <hi>March,</hi> or may be let alone till the time of their dressing, which is best done at the beginning of <hi>April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To have a long <hi>succession</hi> of artichokes, some slips should be planted at two different times <hi>every</hi> spring, as they bear the same year, only come in later, and with smaller heads than the old plants. When planted quite late, they sometimes do not produce in the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent season, but then they are forwarder the next sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer than old stools are; but remember, a good soil and open situation are absolutely necessary for the <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choke.</hi> Though dung <hi>must</hi> be used in an indifferent soil, the finest artichokes (as indeed of all other vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) are produced from a fresh and natural good soil. 'Tis of service to lay grass mowings, or some litter, about the roots to keep them cool; for though arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes should not be planted in a moist soil, on account of frost, yet they thrive best in one. The market gardeners seldom throw away any suckers, but put them in the ground somewhere, and having borne heads, then pull them up if overstocked. Artichokes that come <hi>late,</hi> may be cut with their full stalks, and being laid up to the head in moist sand, in a cellar, will keep a month, so that they may sometimes be had at <hi>Christmas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ASTARAGUS, there is but one sort of, as an escu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but some difference occurs, as to size, colour, and
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:035770_0222_1006BE3D167498A0"/>
flavour, arising from cultivation. In order to obtain large heads, and to have the beds continue to produce the longer, <hi>much</hi> dung is used; but the less of it, the sweeter will this vegetable be, so that in a soil naturally prolific, no dung need be used by the curious.</p>
                  <p>Asparagus <hi>beds</hi> are commonly made from <hi>plants,</hi> but the best way is from <hi>seed.</hi> The time for both is <hi>March,</hi> rather early in the month than late, though the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>April</hi> may do. The plants should be only a year old, and set in rows a foot distance, and the roots the same, or a little less from one another in the rows.</p>
                  <p>Making the <hi>beds</hi> four feet and a half wide, there will be four rows of plants, and nine inches left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the outside rows and the alleys, which should be two feet wide. The beds ought to be trenched <hi>full</hi> eighteen inches deep, and enriched with dung that is well consumed, burying it <hi>below</hi> with roots; they will soon strike into the dung, which had best not lay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately about them. If some mould of rotted <hi>vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,</hi> wood pile earth, and a little pond mud, were mixed with the top soil, it would greatly help the plants; or if none other than this manure were used all through the work, it were better. As asparagus beds are designed to last many years, suppose twelve or fifteen, no pains should be spared to do the work <hi>well;</hi> and if the ground were prepared sometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, or in winter, it would be an advantage, the top soil laying trenched for the benefit of frost. The <hi>alleys,</hi> as well as the beds, should be made good, for the roots of the outer rows will strike into them. A rich sandy loam is the best soil for asparagus, and if the earth is too heavy, or too light, rectify it. See <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of soils,</hi> miscellaneous section.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>plant</hi> asparagus set the line nine inches from the edge of the bed, and cut the trench upright, close to it, so deep that the crowns of the roots lie full two inches below the surface. If the mould of the bed lies light, and is likely to settle much, the crowns of the
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:035770_0223_1006BE40CE2DCA90"/>
plants may come to the top, and two inches of mould put on afterwards; this is, indeed, the best method of planting; but if the ground is not expected to settle, two inches of the top mould must (in this method) be first drawn aside to cover with. The roots must be neatly spread against the trench, and cut as little as possible; i. e. only the damaged parts off. This should be with a sharp knife, and it would be better if done the day before they are used, that the ends may dry and heal. It is of consequence to have the plants dug up <hi>carefully,</hi> with a three pronged fork, that the roots may not be injured; for bruises, and sometimes even cuts, will occasion that part of the root to rot.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>sow</hi> asparagus beds, make little holes an inch deep, at the distance directed for plants, and having laid three seeds in each, near an inch asunder, cover them three-fourths of an inch, which will leave little hollows, to shew their places, and give occasional watering in a dry time, to fetch up the seeds. If the beds were covered with a little haulm, or straw, till the plants appeared, it would help them to germinate, as in a sunny season they are apt to lie long, especially if the work be not done till <hi>April.</hi> When the plants are above ground fill up the holes. Refresh the plants occasionally with water through the summer, and when they are two inches high, thin the holes to one plant in each, and cover the beds with an inch of mould, and they will then be two inches deep, as was directed for plants. The drawn plants may be pricked out at four or five inches distance, to make good any defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies next spring, or otherwise. In <hi>October,</hi> when the haulm is decayed, cover the bed with about half an inch of rotten dung, to keep out frost; and, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere weather, put some long litter over all. In <hi>spring,</hi> take the litter off, and gently stir (with a proper fork) the rotten dung in: do so again the next year. Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asparagus beds with the draining of a dunghill (a rich manure too often lost) in <hi>autumn,</hi> or <hi>spring,</hi> will
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:035770_0224_1006BE45ED22BFA0"/>
wash down to the roots, and greatly benefit the lower soil to the increase of the produce: It is worth while to make a rank water for this purpose, for weak or old beds.</p>
                  <p>Asparagus is <hi>cut</hi> from planted beds in three years, and from sown ones in four; but this loss of a year, will be amply repaid by the superior size and abundance of the heads. If the buds come very fine, a <hi>little</hi> may be cut the year before. A <hi>thin</hi> crop of <hi>onions</hi> or <hi>lettuces</hi> to prick out, is commonly had on planted beds the first, and on seed beds the two first years, taking care that none grow just about the plants. The best method of doing this business, is by an intermediate <hi>drill</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each row, and again across them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>management</hi> of asparagus beds is, to cut down the haulm, within an inch of the ground, when it turns yellow in <hi>autumn,</hi> clearing of weeds, stirring the ground, and covering the whole over with about an inch of rotten dung before every winter, which is to be forked in at <hi>spring,</hi> not to hurt the plants, and covered with some parings of the mould from the <hi>alleys,</hi> which should afterwards be dug over, if no crop is in them to prevent it. It may seem, that an addition every year to the beds might sink the crowns of the plants too low; but it is their nature to rise as they grow. Besides the rotten dung, as above, there may be laid some long litter over the beds, before severe weather sets in; but the covering of asparagus beds is not simply to keep out frost, (which will not hurt them without much wet) but to keep them warm, that the buds may be forward at spring. A <hi>stump</hi> ought to be kept at each corner of the beds, to shew their bounds, and as marks to pare the alleys up by, which should lay three or four inches lower.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>cutting</hi> of asparagus should be carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, not to injure adjoining buds. Move the mould a little aside to see, and then close by the head, and with a little slope, cut it off about three inches below
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:035770_0225_1006BE4FF52DF7C8"/>
the ground. The knife should have a long narrow blade, and a proper one is indented with teeth as a <hi>saw.</hi> It may be cut when from two to four inches high, and let it be done as soon as ready. If it is lain by in a cool place, as in a dairy or cellar, it will keep very well three days.</p>
                  <p>Six <hi>rods</hi> of well planted ground will produce, in the full season, about a hundred a day; and this, as a rule, will help to determine how much room to allot for this vegetable.</p>
                  <p>BEANS we have several sorts of, differing in size, colour, flower, flavour, hardiness, and time of coming in. Of the forward beans, the <hi>mazagan</hi> is generally preferred, as the earliest, hardiest, most productive, and pleasant. The <hi>Portugal</hi> ranks next to it. Of the later sorts, the <hi>Windsor</hi> stands first, as to general esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, for eating; but it is in most soils rather an idle bearer. The <hi>long-pod</hi> and <hi>Sandwich,</hi> however, are preferred by some, chiefly as more fruitful. Trials must determine taste, but it may be observed, that the <hi>white blossom</hi> bean is a very good one, if eat young.</p>
                  <p>Close under a warm wall (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o which they should be kept by packthread) some <hi>mazagans</hi> may be put in the ground early in <hi>October;</hi> but at the latter end, and the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> is best, when they commonly succeed at some distance from the wall, earthing them up regularly as they proceed in growth.</p>
                  <p>Put the <hi>small</hi> beans in three inches deep, and four asunder, in single rows, or six inches asunder every way, in double rows; and let the rows, in the first case, be two and a half, and in the latter, three feet asunder.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>dwarf</hi> bean (by some called the <hi>fan cluster</hi>) that grows but a few inches high, which is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to put in, close under a <hi>south</hi> wall, in <hi>October,</hi> and they will thus be but a few days (if any) later than the <hi>mazagan,</hi> sown in <hi>November.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="unknown:035770_0226_1006BE540D69B740"/>
'Tis a good way to sow <hi>patches</hi> of beans under a warm corner to stand the winter, placing them about an inch from one another, and <hi>transplanting</hi> them, at the above distances, the first mild weather in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March</hi> to any sheltered part of the garden, and if under a <hi>south</hi> wall, it will forward them. Beans, sown in <hi>patches,</hi> may be easily covered in severe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by a <hi>frame,</hi> &amp;c. Make <hi>trenches</hi> to lay them in when transplanted; pull off the bean adhering to the roots, shorten them a little, and put them in rather highly covered over the shanks. If planted aslant, they will soon get erect; but this is only permitted in case of a shallow soil and long roots.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>severe weather,</hi> a light covering of peas haulm, or any straw, may be lain over winter beans to protect them, but must be taken off as soon as the weather alters; for too much covering of any thing is as likely to destroy (eventually) as being wholly exposed.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>mazagan</hi> is mostly the bean put in to stand the <hi>winter,</hi> some gardeners sow other sorts for the purpose, (even <hi>Windsors</hi>) which in general may succeed; but they certainly will not come in so early be near a fortnight, and must have a dry, sheltered situation. The <hi>larger</hi> beans must be sown a little deeper, and two or three inches farther asunder than the <hi>mazagan,</hi> allowing a foot more between the roots, especially if double ones.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>early crops</hi> of beans fail, through severity of the winter, be sure to take the first opportunity of open weather in the new year, to sow some of the early sorts; and if they be covered over with some straw, they will come up the sooner; but remove the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as soon as the beans appear, if not a frost at the time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Succession crops</hi> of beans are to be sown for every three weeks, or a month, from <hi>November</hi> to <hi>July;</hi> preferring the larger sorts in <hi>February,</hi> and so on to
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:035770_0227_1006BE55B0902CB8"/>
                     <hi>June,</hi> when the smaller (or early) kinds will be the properest.</p>
                  <p>BEET, there are four sorts of, <hi>red, green, yellow,</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> which are used several ways, as <hi>pot</hi> and <hi>sallad</hi> herbs. The leaves of the latter are sometimes <hi>blanched,</hi> when full grown, for the sake of their thick ribs, being peeled for stewing, and eat as <hi>asparagus.</hi> Sow beets in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> thinly, either in drills or broad cast, and hoe them to a foot asunder: They run to seed the second year. A little also may be sown, early in autumn, for late spring use; but they will be small. The <hi>red</hi> sort is cultivated for its <hi>root,</hi> and is preserved in winter, in dry sand, as carrots are; and of this there is a turnip shaped sort, that suits best in heavy shallow soils, and a long rooted sort proper for light and deep ones: Beets, but principally the red, require a rich soil.</p>
                  <p>BOORCOLE, or <hi>cale,</hi> is a hardy green, of which we have two principal sorts, <hi>green</hi> and <hi>brown,</hi> and a little variety is in the leaf, as plain, curled, variegated: The latter is a pretty vegetable when growing, but not so hardy, or pleasant, at table as the other sorts.</p>
                  <p>Some sow two crops of this green at the end of <hi>March</hi> and of <hi>April,</hi> but one sowing may suffice; and the first day of <hi>April,</hi> or at least in the first week, is the best time. Sow in an open situation, and in cool ground, and thin the plants in time, that they may be robust, and able to support themselves.</p>
                  <p>This green should be planted out in rows a yard asunder, and two feet apart in the rows, having been previously pricked out from the seed bed, at six inches, for five or six weeks, to obtain strength for final planting in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let boorcole, and all summer planted things, have a good watering at the time, and again in a few days, if the weather proves dry and before winter let them be well earthed up to support the plants from the wind and snow, that are apt to break them down, or at
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:035770_0228_1006BE5E9CAAF188"/>
least, to set them awry; which, when it happens, should be attended to, to fix them upright again; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this of all other winter greens.</p>
                  <p>The heads of Boorcole may be cut in winter, and the sprouts come full in spring: The heads are tender and sweeter for being frost bitten. The sprouts should only be topped when gathered, and they will shoot out again below.</p>
                  <p>BROCCOLI is of two distinct kinds, the <hi>purple,</hi> and the <hi>white;</hi> for the <hi>green,</hi> &amp;c. are only varieties from them; of each, there are large and dwarf sorts, the latter of which is mostly cultivated. All the sorts, except the white, generally produce side shoots, as well as a head. The white is called <hi>cauliflower</hi> broccoli, because it resembles a cauliflower much, but is not so white. This is not so hardy as the purple, nor is it thought so good; indeed the <hi>green</hi> may be esteemed the best. Of the <hi>purple</hi> there is an early and a late sort; the former is sowed to come in at autumn, and the latter in spring.</p>
                  <p>The first day of <hi>April</hi> is a good general time to sow for the <hi>autumn</hi> crop, (though some do it sooner) and the last day of <hi>April</hi> for the spring crop. But it will be very proper to sow again a fortnight after each; and at the end of <hi>May,</hi> for late spring use; which though they produce small heads, will be very acceptable. Sow in open ground, and see that they young plants are thinned, when quite small, that they may not be drawn up weak; and prick them out when they have got six leaves, to six inches distance, where having grown to a proper robust size, (as about <hi>July)</hi> let them be planted out at two feet, or a little more asunder. The <hi>autumn</hi> sort should be planted towards a warm wall, lest it come not in at the time. Broccoli requires a <hi>rich</hi> and dry soil; yet watering, in a dry time, is necessary to help their heads to swell, and forward them, Stir the ground about the plants occasionally, and keep them well earthed up. The best <hi>broccoli</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="unknown:035770_0229_1006BE602AD09240"/>
seed comes immediately from <hi>Italy,</hi> whence we first had it.</p>
                  <p>BRUSSELS SPROUTS are winter greens, growing much like <hi>boorcole,</hi> and by some preferred as more delicate eating; but they are not so hardy or produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Their culture is the same as boorcole, only they may be planted out at rather less distance.</p>
                  <p>CABBAGE, there is a considerable variety of, as to flavour, size, time of coming in, and hardiness. Some are for the use of the table, and others for cattle, though the latter are very sweet, before they get solid. The early <hi>dwarf,</hi> early <hi>Yorksbire,</hi> and early <hi>Russian,</hi> are the chief sorts for spring use, and the early and late <hi>sugar-loaf</hi> for summer.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>April,</hi> the forwardest cabbages may be tied up, (as lettuces are) to assist them to head and whiten; a practice seldom seen, but which will certainly be helpful: Use wetted bass.</p>
                  <p>Sow for <hi>early</hi> cabbages about <hi>Mid-August;</hi> soon after up thin them, and in a month, draw the strongest, and prick them out four or five inches apart, where having grown about the same time, they will be fit to plant for spring use; or they may be put out any time after, even in winter; for should frost come directly, it will hardly affect them injuriously. Set them, if in a middling soil, two feet asunder, allowing six inches more for a rich one: There should, however, always be some dung dug into cabbage ground. If they are planted at <hi>half</hi> the above distances in the rows, taking care to draw every other plant in time for <hi>early</hi> greens, (or coleworts) it is a very good method, as the ground is better occupied, and the plants protect one another.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>late</hi> cabbages, or those of summer and autumn, should be sown early and late in the spring. For early summer uses, sow after <hi>Mid-February</hi> on a little heat, or under hand-glasses, on a warm border; and the later crops in <hi>March,</hi> to the end of it, and for the latest at the end of <hi>April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="unknown:035770_0230_1006BE67DB494290"/>
Sow <hi>red cabbage</hi> seed, either about the middle of <hi>August,</hi> or beginning of <hi>March:</hi> but as there is much more bad seed than good of this vegetable, be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the sort as possible.</p>
                  <p>CARROT, there is a little variety of, in colour, size, and time of coming in, though not much in taste. We have <hi>orange, red, yellow,</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> (each of which have their admirers) but the former is generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and the last is rarely cultivated. The sort sown for the <hi>first</hi> crop, whether in cold ground, or on a hot bed, is the early <hi>born carrot.</hi> Both this and the late horn carrot grow short and thick, and are therefore proper for heavy, or shallow soils, as the other sorts are for light and deep ones.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sow</hi> carrots always in good times, as the seed lies long in the ground, and they are, by many persons, covered early. A few should be sown in a favourable situation, the first tolerable weather in <hi>February,</hi> dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ground <hi>well</hi> and deep for the purpose; for if it is lumpy, the carrots will grow forked, as they will also if the ground is fresh dunged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carrot seed</hi> should be mixed with dry sand, or earth, rubbing them well together, in order the better to spread it equally in sowing. Use about twice as much sand as seed, and if earth, it were better to be of a different colour from that on which the seed is distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, that it may be seen.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>early</hi> in the month, the new sown beds may be covered with a little haulm, or straw, which will help the seed to germinate, and preserve them from being thrown out of the ground by frost; and this covering should be continued on nights, and taken off by day, when the plants are up; which practice being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for some time, will greatly forward, as well as preserve, the crop. Some people sow in <hi>January,</hi> if the weather is mild, but for this, (and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in gardening) <hi>situation</hi> must in a measure, gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, and discretion determine.</p>
                  <p>

If a <hi>hot bed</hi> be made for carrots, let it be about two feet and an half thick, and covered with eight inches of sifted mould, as soon as the violent heat is gone off. Sow the seed directly, a full quarter of an inch deep, and if covered with lights, give air sufficient to keep the earth only just warm. A <hi>ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ped bed</hi> to be covered with mats, may do for this purpose, but in this case, two feet of dung may answer better than more; for if the seed is hurried up, they will be too tender for the protection of such a covering, and the plants will run to top, and not bottom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thin</hi> the plants soon to an inch asunder, and in a little time again to three inches, in order to grow to a small size for use; and if not so wanted, at any rate draw some equally, that those which remain may swell properly: Carrots must have a great share of air, if covered with glass.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>principal</hi> crop of carrots should be sown early in the month of <hi>March,</hi> or before the end of it, and be soon hoed, or thinned by hand, to a small distance, and a while after to a greater; so that together with hoeing and drawing for use, they should at last stand at from eight to ten inches distance, according to the soil. This may <hi>seem</hi> too much, but certainly carrots have, in common, too little room allowed them for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their proper size. Let the first hoe be of the breadth of three inches, and the second of six. No consideration should prevail to let carrots stand too long before they are properly <hi>thinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A few <hi>late</hi> carrots may be sown in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> to draw young in the summer; and some in the autumn months to stand the winter, for early spring use, but carrots that stand the winter grow hard, and are of very little worth.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>autumn,</hi> let carrots be taken up as soon as their leaves begin to change; for when they continue too long in the ground, they are apt to get worm-eater, especially in rich soils. Cut the tops off at an inch,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:035770_0232_1006BE6D275BBEA0"/>
and lay them up dry and free from mould, in dry sand, a layer of sand, and a layer of carrots. All those that are broken, or cut, should be thrown aside for present spending, as they would decay in the heap, and spread infection in the rest. Those who grow large quantities for <hi>cattle,</hi> stack them in hovels, &amp;c. with a thick coat of straw, bottom and sides, and particularly on the top. In a soil that suits them, carrots turn to good account, and are excellent food for <hi>all</hi> sorts of cattle, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly pige.</p>
                  <p>CAULIFLOWER is sometimes distinguished into an early and late sort; though in fact, there is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, only as the seed of that called early is saved from the forwardest plants.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>time</hi> for <hi>sowing</hi> cauliflowers is rather a nice business, but it is generally settled for the 20th of <hi>August,</hi> a day under or over. It will be prudent, however, to sow again a few days after, but not earlier, as then they would be apt to form only very little heads, and run up for seed. Let the young plants, be timely <hi>thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> that they may be strong. <hi>Prick</hi> them out when the first leaves are about an inch broad. And as cauliflowers are tender, they will require to be pricked out in the warmest and driest part of the garden. Some of them should be protected under <hi>hand-glasses, frames,</hi> or <hi>ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ps</hi> and <hi>mats,</hi> covering the glasses and mats with straw in severe weather; not doing this before the weather makes it necessary, and always allowing what <hi>air</hi> they will bear, especially towards spring, otherwise they may be disposed to <hi>run,</hi> or will be weak and sickly. As the season advances, let them be wholly uncovered on fair days, and when they are got forward in <hi>March,</hi> draw the spare ones to plant out, leaving only a single plant under a small hand-glass, and two under a large one; or a few may be drawn out at the end of <hi>February,</hi> if the glasses are crowded. Continue the glasses on as long as they will contain the plants, raising them upon bricks. The number generally put under hand-glasses
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:035770_0233_1006BE77A6644EE0"/>
for the winter, is from three to five. Those drawn from these, make a good succession crop: But do not prick out or plant, those that have <hi>black shanks,</hi> for they will come to nothing: Cauliflowers are liable to this defect chiefly in wet seasons.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>autumn</hi> sown plants are cut off, the earliest opportunity must be taken in the new year to sow some seed on a <hi>gentle</hi> heat, as in <hi>February,</hi> covering with glasses, or only with hoops and mats. From this bed, when it is cold, they should be pricked out upon another, where let them grow till planted to bear. And if those <hi>weak</hi> ones that have stood all the winter were pricked out early in the spring upon a little heat, covered with good mould, it would strengthen and forward them much. In default of dung, sow under hand-glasses in a warm border.</p>
                  <p>To have a <hi>succession</hi> of cauliflowers till winter, sow on a slight heat, or under glass, in <hi>March,</hi> for plants to follow the first crop; and again in open ground, in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May.</hi> It <hi>winter</hi> should overtake some of the latest plants, they may be taken up, when in flower, with a ball of earth, and planted in a conservatory, or even in a cellar, where they will swell their heads, and be safe. All the succession crops, except the last, should be planted in a <hi>cool</hi> part of the garden.</p>
                  <p>Cauliflowers require a <hi>rich</hi> soil, and to be kept <hi>moist</hi> during summer, especially when flowering, watering them well twice a week. If the water were <hi>impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> with sheep or other dung, to the strength of about an ounce of salt to a gallon of water, if would help them in size, for cauliflowers are greedy feeders. The ground in which they grow, can hardly be too full of dung; nor need there be any fear as to making them rank; a little salt thrown in the water <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

them to protect from the weather: It preserves them white and cool, and increases the size.</p>
                  <p>CELERY we have three or four sorts of, as the common <hi>Italian upright,</hi> both <hi>hollow</hi> and <hi>solid,</hi> with the <hi>giant</hi> hollow, and <hi>turnip rooted,</hi> or <hi>celeriac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>early</hi> celery, sow in the last week of <hi>February,</hi> or first in <hi>March,</hi> on a gentle <hi>bot bed,</hi> or in a warm rich border, under a <hi>hand-glass,</hi> or not. When cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated so early, it is apt to run, but if only a few plants stand tolerably, it is worth while to sow a little, and even when in a pipy state it does for <hi>soups.</hi> Sow thin, cover so, and keep the earth moist; for the seed is slow in coming up.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>principal</hi> crops, sow at <hi>Mid-March,</hi> and again at <hi>Mid-April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For a few <hi>late</hi> plants, a little seed may be sown at the beginning and latter end of <hi>May;</hi> and if the ground is covered with a <hi>mat</hi> it will help the seed to germinate, by keeping the earth cool, and from air. But it must be taken off, and the ground lightly watered as soon as the plants appear. If the weather should be very sunny, shade they young plants a little for a few days, by raising the mat, or laying some brush wood over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prick</hi> the plants out when two or three inches high, at three or four asunder; and when about six inches high, <hi>plant</hi> them in trenches a yard distant, and six inches from one another. In a light soil the trenches may be somewhat deeper; but generally near a spade's depth is proper, and a spade's width, keeping the walls firm and upright.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>soil</hi> is not very good, dig in a little well-rotted dung at bottom; but the celery will be sounder and sweeter without dung, so that a little fresh earth were better; and though the plants will not come up so large, they will be hardier to resist frost. The <hi>later</hi> that celery is planted out, the shallower the trenches should be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="unknown:035770_0235_1006BE81275DB688"/>
                     <hi>Water</hi> celery at pricking out and planting, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally afterwards in very dry weather.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Earth up</hi> the plants frequently (as suppose every week or ten days) a little at a time, in order to <hi>blanch</hi> them, by which they become crisp, sweet, and tender: The celery gets tough when this business is let alone too long. In earthing up, it is a good way to gather them close (but carefully) with the left hand, using a trowel, or small spade.</p>
                  <p>In severe <hi>frost</hi> lay some long, dry litter over the tops, which remove when the frost goes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Celeriac</hi> requires a rich soil, and should have frequent watering to have fine tender roots. Plant in trenches about three inches deep, and earth up, (only once) when the plants are about three parts grown, to four inches height. This species is hardier than the others, and holds longer in spring; therefore, those who like the solid root should cultivate it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>seed</hi> of celery, (in default of plants) if bruised, answers very well to give soup a flavour of it. <hi>Parsley</hi> seed, &amp;c. may be used in the same way.</p>
                  <p>CHARDON is a gigantic vegetable of the <hi>artichoke</hi> kind, (now seldom cultivated, used sometimes in <hi>sallads,</hi> but chiefly in <hi>soups,</hi> or stewed, &amp;c. It should be sown about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> and end of <hi>April,</hi> in trenches, four feet asunder, a foot wide, and six inches deep. Drop the seed (which will be near a month coming up) a few inches asunder, and thin them at last to the distance of from three to four feet. They must be watered in a dry time. Those plants that are drawn may be taken up with balls of earth about them, and planted in trenched rows as <hi>celery,</hi> at the above distances, and the rows five feet from one another. The <hi>leaves</hi> only of this plant are used, after they are <hi>blanched;</hi> which is done by earthing two-thirds of their length up, when about three or four feet high, typing neat hay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>bands first close round them, to within a foot of the top; i. e. blanch when they are full grown, in
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:035770_0236_1006BE82AF2029C8"/>
                     <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> and in about six weeks they will be fit for use. In frost cover the tops with straw. It will assist the blanching to lay straw, or offal hay, <hi>close</hi> round them when untied.</p>
                  <p>CHOU DE MILAN is of the boorcole kind, and propagated like it, but the plants should be put out at a yard asunder. This is a <hi>very</hi> good winter green, and stays longer than any other at spring before it shows for seed, and is then in its highest perfection.</p>
                  <p>COLEWORT is a very hardy small open headed green, sown in <hi>July,</hi> or early in <hi>August,</hi> for winter and spring use. But instead of the <hi>true</hi> colewort (a coarse vegetable) it is common to sow the early sort of cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages as an agreeable substitute, to be eat in their open state. The <hi>sweetest</hi> of this kind of green, however, is the large sugar-loaf cabbage, sown about Midsummer, which frequently stands the winter.</p>
                  <p>These plants should be put out for use, at from eight to twelve inches asunder, according to the nature of the sort sown, some of the early cabbages being very small, as the <hi>Russian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Coleworts are seldom cultivated otherwise than for <hi>winter</hi> and <hi>spring</hi> use; but <hi>all</hi> the year it were well for the garden to supply them, as they are, what may be truly esteemed, <hi>choice greens.</hi> With this view sow some cabbage seed every month.</p>
                  <p>CUCUMBER has several shades of difference in it, arising from culture and accident; but the common and more distinct green sorts of it, are the <hi>short</hi> and the <hi>long prickly,</hi> the <hi>cluster,</hi> the early <hi>African,</hi> and the <hi>Turkey.</hi> There are also a <hi>white</hi> short prickly, (or <hi>Dutch</hi> cucumber) and a <hi>white</hi> Turkey sort. The white <hi>Dutch</hi> (like the white <hi>Turkey</hi>) is an idle bearer, and seldom met with; but it has an evident difference in flavour, and admired by most who eat of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>early</hi> nature of a cucumber is the principal object with gardeners, for as much skill and care is exercised to produce forward ones, it is a great draw-back
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:035770_0237_1006BE8696D5BFB8"/>
to have sown seed <hi>not</hi> of the forwardest kind. Of the seed called early, there is no doubt much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: How material a thing it is to improve the <hi>breed,</hi> and to be ascertained of the quality of seed for <hi>early</hi> crops is therefore evident.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>principal</hi> crop of cucumbers should be the <hi>long prickly,</hi> which is preferable on the whole to any other. The <hi>Turkey</hi> grows strait, long and large; but quality is certainly before quantity, and the cucumber that eats <hi>crispest</hi> is the best. In this respect the <hi>Dutch white</hi> (little as it is cultivated) is, perhaps, even before the justly admired long prickly, and has fewer seeds. The <hi>early African,</hi> is a very favourite cucumber with some gardeners: It clusters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seed</hi> should never be saved except from the greenest and handsomest cucumbers; but that which is bright frequently is from clumsy, smooth, yellow, seedy fruit, which is always watery and vapid.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ambition</hi> of gardeners has been pretty much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised to have cucumbers <hi>every</hi> month in the year; but the expense and trouble are surely vain, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed in the production of what, in the cold months, is unwholesome, and not much relished. A gardener that can cut a cucumber by the first of <hi>April</hi> does suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently well, or rather better than he that produces them before. See, <hi>Of raising cucumbers</hi> in the last section.</p>
                  <p>ENDIVE is a <hi>sallad</hi> and <hi>culinary</hi> vegetable, of which there are three sorts, the curled, <hi>green,</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> and the <hi>plain,</hi> or broad leaved. To these may be added, however, a plant of the same kind, which is seldom propagated in gardens, the <hi>wild succory,</hi> used sometimes <hi>medicinally.</hi> The plain, or <hi>Batavian</hi> endive, is but little used in sallads, as the curled is so much prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble though cooks prefer it for stewing: The <hi>green</hi> is the hardiest, and therefore the late sowings should be all of this. Sow <hi>succory</hi> in <hi>March.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="unknown:035770_0238_1006BE916374C840"/>
                     <hi>Sow</hi> endive at three several times, between the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>May,</hi> and the middle of <hi>July,</hi> at equal intervals. Some of the first may, perhaps, run for seed; but yet a little should be then sown; as also at the beginning of <hi>August</hi> for late use. Scatter the seeds <hi>thin,</hi> and do not suffer them to grow in clusters to become weak. When the plants are about three inches high, plant them out in an open situation a foot asunder, watering them at the time, and twice or thrice after till they have taken root. The same sowing will make several crops, drawing the strongest first, and in a week after more.</p>
                  <p>Those planted out after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> should be on warm borders; but if long after (as towards winter) the method of planting is thus, which <hi>blanches</hi> at the same time: Draw earth to an <hi>high</hi> ridge, under a sunny wall, and taking up carefully some full grown endive in a <hi>dry</hi> state, gather the leaves up close, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking, tie them neatly with bass, and put them close together sideways; i. e. horizontally, in the ridge, almost to the top of the leaves. If any suspicion of wet in them, hang the plants up by the roots, in some covered, shady, airy place, for a day or so. In severe weather lay straw over all.</p>
                  <p>Endive in open ground should be protected from sharp <hi>frost</hi> by peas haulm, or dry litter. Some may be planted in frames, or under hand-glasses, giving plenty of air, or in a shed, or hovel, open towards the sun; and this may be either in the upright, or ridged way.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>blanching</hi> of endive in open ground is thus: Gather up the leaves (being dry) when nearly of a full grown size, and tie them regularly, and carefully round, from the middle upwards, moderately close, with <hi>bass,</hi> and earth them up to the middle, if the soil is light and dry, but not otherwise. In two or three weeks, the blanching is effected, after which the endive must soon be used, or it will rot, especially if much wet comes. The object of <hi>blanching,</hi> is to take away the bitter taste of the endive, and to make it crisp and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:035770_0239_1006BE93B4DFB4A0"/>
Blanch a little at a time, once a week, that it may come in proper succession.</p>
                  <p>GARLICK is used for both <hi>culinary</hi> and <hi>medicinal</hi> purposes. The cloves should be planted in autumn, or early in spring, in rows six or eight inches asunder, three deep, and six from one another in the rows, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a light dry soil. If the leaves are tied up in knots the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> it will prevent their spind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for seed, and help their bulbs to swell. Take them up towards autumn, when their leaves turn yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and keep them in bags, or hang them up in a dry place, for use.</p>
                  <p>GOURD, SQUASH, and CALABASH, as of one fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily; see PUMPION, the culture being the same.</p>
                  <p>HORSE-RADISH is variously used for <hi>culinary</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and may be reckoned one of our most whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some roots; when scraped fine, it is a good addition to <hi>sallads,</hi> especially in the colder season. Propagate crowns, or pieces of the root, from one to two inches long, having an eye or two, set from nine to twelve inches below the surface of the ground, (according to the nature of the soil, as heavy or light) by digging a trench, and covering them over, or by making holes with a dibble; this should be the work of <hi>February,</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> and the soil must not only the be deep, but rich, or the roots will be weak.</p>
                  <p>This root will grow finer, and be more conveniently dug, to have the rows two feet, and the sets one foot asunder in them, though a less distance is the more common practice. Where there is plenty of ground, however, it is not worth while to be cramped, and the first year of planting the ground may be cropped with any early things. The roots will not be fit for use the first year; but the second it comes strong and warm. Take them up carefully and regularly, moving the earth away, and cut them off close to the stool, from whence fresh heads will spring.</p>
                  <p>

New plantations of horse-radish should be made about every fifth year; old ones should be cleared from the straggling side shoots, in order to keep the rows open, but take them up deeply.</p>
                  <p>JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE is cultivated for the root, (which eats like artichoke bottoms) and it is an ornamental plant, growing similar to the perennial <hi>sun-flower,</hi> with which it classes, but taller. Propagate in <hi>March,</hi> by planting cuttings of its root, as <hi>potatoes.</hi> The root is red, and full of indented eyes, every one of which is sure to grow; but it is not much admired. Where it has been once planted, it must be carefully dug up, or it will not easily be got rid of. Any poor ordinary spot of spare ground will do for it. Preserve the roots in dry sand, when they can be no longer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the ground, immediately dug from which they are much best.</p>
                  <p>KIDNEY BEAN we have two sorts of, <hi>dwarfs</hi> and <hi>runners,</hi> each of which has a rather numerous variety, arising from the colour of the seed, time of coming in, and taste. Both sorts have their admirers, but the dwarf is more generally esteemed, and more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cultivated.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>variety</hi> in the dwarf beans, some come earlier than others; but there is a difference in opinions, which is the best, as to earliness and quality. The <hi>yellow</hi> and the <hi>black</hi> are, perhaps, as forward as any. The early <hi>white</hi> is not long behind, and is of superior quality, but is not so hardy as the yellow and black, and some others; this may, therefore, be the second crop. The dwarf sorts come in quicker than the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For the principal crop, the <hi>Battersea</hi> and <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> beans are mostly used by the market gardeners, being good and prolific.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>runners,</hi> or climbing sort, the common <hi>scarlet,</hi> and the <hi>white</hi> Dutch, are generally preferred, and when mixed together, their blossoms make an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

show, and bear a long time, if the beans are gathered constantly as they get fit for use.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>dwarf</hi> sorts of this vegetable may be had most months in the year, by the united means of open cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hot beds, and hot houses. In cold ground they are sometimes sown, close under a <hi>south wall,</hi> towards the end of a dry <hi>March,</hi> but <hi>April</hi> is soon enough; for if they get above ground without rotting, (as the seed is apt to do, when the ground is long wet) a little frost will cut them off.</p>
                  <p>The latter end of <hi>March,</hi> however, if some are sown in a warm border, in <hi>patches,</hi> and covered with <hi>hand-glasses,</hi> they will do very well. Or an early crop may be produced by raising the beans, at this time, on a gentle <hi>hot bed,</hi> and planting them out, when two or three inches high, under glasses, in patches, tow feet asunder. If the beans are raised in small pots, three or four in each, they may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ned out whose, with great advantage, as kidney beans do not always bear transplanting well; and they may be covered on nights with hand-glasses, garden pots, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>When planted in <hi>rows</hi> singly, let it be under a warm wall, and not (if it can be avoided) till the end of <hi>April,</hi> or beginning of <hi>May;</hi> and protect them a while at first on cold nights, with matting or otherwise.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>hot bed</hi> culture of kidney beans, if any are attempted to be brought to <hi>fruit</hi> on heat, let them be raised, towards the end of <hi>February,</hi> upon one gentle bed, (or in pots, at the back of a cucumber frame) and planted out in another, in rows fifteen inches apart, and at four inches in the rows; for nearer they will not fruit well. The bed may be about two and a half feet thick, and must have on it seven or eight inches of mould, and the plants treated with as much <hi>air</hi> as can safely be given them. Line the bed before the heat is quite gone, to preserve and forward them. The sort used for forcing in <hi>hot houses</hi> is a reddish speckled one; but the early white is fittest for forcing in <hi>hot beds,</hi> as
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:035770_0242_1006BEA12D8146D8"/>
of lower growth: The early <hi>yellow</hi> and <hi>black</hi> may do, but they are not so good as the white.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Common</hi> culture of the dwarf bean, in the proper season, and open ground, is to sow them an inch or an inch and half deep, three asunder, and two feet, or a little more, to a yard between the rows, according to the size of the seed, for some sorts require more room than others. Let them be earthed up as they proceed in growth; and to have a <hi>succession,</hi> sow every three weeks; remembering that a crop produces more, and lasts longer, the <hi>oftener</hi> the beans are gathered: It is proper, therefore, to gather them constantly whilst <hi>young</hi> and good.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>last</hi> crop should be under 2 warm wall, and may be sown as late as the middle, or end of <hi>July,</hi> and if very dry weather, let the beans for this, and the <hi>June</hi> crop, be soaked about twelve hours in milk and water, and the drills watered, in order to forward their germination, and bring them more certainly and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly up. It is a good way to prepare the seed for high summer, by laying it in a garden pot, in damp mould, till it begins to chit, and then planting it in watered drills. In a course of dry warm weather, kidney beans should be watered, especially while young. The culture of <hi>runners</hi> is to sow them near two inches deep, four or five asunder, and the rows four or five feet apart. They will thus require tall brushy sticks to climb upon; but they may be sown in <hi>patches</hi> of about fifteen inches diameter, placing the beans five or six inches asunder, in the circumference, and fixing a pole in the middle for them to run upon. The end of <hi>April,</hi> or beginning of <hi>May,</hi> is soon enough to put the climbing sorts into the ground; and two more sowings, at about five weeks between each, will go through the season.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>seed</hi> is saved, let it be only from some of the <hi>first</hi> beans of the principal crop, for all late formed seeds, and particularly of the kidney bean, are not near so
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:035770_0243_1006BEA668A7E1F8"/>
good as the early ones, often failing or producing weak plants, and late ill tasted fruit.</p>
                  <p>LEEK, we have a narrow and a broad leaved sort of, the latter of which is the one generally cultivated. The leek requires a good soil and open situation in order to have them <hi>fine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sow</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> if the weather is tolerable, or at the beginning of <hi>March. Thin</hi> in <hi>April</hi> to three inches asunder, and <hi>plant</hi> them out the first moist weather after <hi>Midsummrer,</hi> in rows, a foot apart, and at six inches in the rows; though if the ground be very rich, and the leeks forward, a little more may be allowed to advantage.</p>
                  <p>Trim the tops, and ends of the roots, and plant with a dibble, two or three inches in the ground, in order to <hi>whiten</hi> the heads; but to this end, some have planted leeks in trenches, and earthed them up high, with a light soil, or sand.</p>
                  <p>Towards <hi>winter,</hi> or in prospect of frost, leeks may be taken up, and laid with their roots in sand, or earth, in some conservatory or cellar. A few sown in <hi>April</hi> to stand all winter for <hi>spring</hi> use is a proper practice.</p>
                  <p>LETTUCE is a vegetable, of which there is a great variety. The <hi>brown Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>green cabbage</hi> lettuces come earliest, and are mostly to be depended upon to stand the winter; though the other sorts often do, except the <hi>silver,</hi> and <hi>white coss.</hi> The <hi>brown</hi> and the <hi>green Egyptian goss</hi> are excellent, being hardy and large, forming close heads; but the latter is earliest. The <hi>Cabbage</hi> lettuce eats moderately well, but is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used in soups, &amp;c. The <hi>Silesia</hi> lettuce is much admired by some, though at present but little culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated: There is a brown and green sort.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>winter</hi> and <hi>spring</hi> use, the hardier sorts are sown in <hi>July, August,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> but chiefly in <hi>August,</hi> when if three sowings are made, the beginning, middle and end of the month it will generally be sufficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="unknown:035770_0244_1006BEAD82A1EF58"/>
For <hi>summer</hi> use, the <hi>white coss,</hi> and any of the others, may be sown on warm borders, either in open ground, or under hand-glasses, or other cover, in <hi>February,</hi> and a little constantly every fortnight, or three weeks after, chusing cooler ground for them when summer advances. <hi>Plant</hi> them from ten to fourteen inches asunder according to the size they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; it being an error to put lettuces out so near as many do, for it forces them to run for seed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents their growing large: The sort called the <hi>admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> should be allowed eighteen inches. Lettuces may be pricked out <hi>very</hi> young; and when three or four inches high is the best time for planting them.</p>
                  <p>It is not a <hi>common</hi> way, but spring sown lettuces will be forwarder and larger, if sown thin, and only thinned out to their proper distance: Those that are drawn may serve for a second crop. The <hi>brown Dutch, green capuchin,</hi> and the <hi>tennis,</hi> and <hi>button</hi> lettuces do not run up so soon for seed as the other sorts, and are therefore proper for <hi>late</hi> summer use. To forward early spring sown ones, a slight <hi>hot bed</hi> may be made, and by all means ought to be some time in <hi>February,</hi> if those that were to have stood the winter are cut off. When these plants are an inch high, they should be pricked out, four inches asunder, upon another gentle hot bed. When they meet, or are four or five inches high, draw every other to plant out in open ground, and let the rest remain to cabbage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hand-glasses, frames,</hi> or <hi>hoops,</hi> covered with mats, or peas straw, may be used to protect lettuces in <hi>winter,</hi> especially those that are forward, which are more likely to be destroyed than the smaller, as the wet hangs in them; let covered plants have a great deal of <hi>air</hi> at all opportunities. Winter lettuces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a dry soil and situation, and a wet one is helped by planting on hillocks, which is a method that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently saves them from rotting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="233" facs="unknown:035770_0245_1006BEAFC3686FC0"/>
To have <hi>fine winter lettuces,</hi> some of the forwardest may be taken up with balls of earth about them in <hi>November,</hi> and planted at nine or ten inches distance, on a somewhat strong <hi>hot bed,</hi> which as soon as the great heat is certainly over, should be covered with six or seven inches of dry mould for the purpose, but give a little water just about the roots: <hi>Line</hi> the bed when it gets cool. Lettuces must be well attended to, to give them plenty of air, pick off dead leaves, cover on nights, &amp;c. frequently stir the surface of the mould, and give water as occasion may dictate. The <hi>cabbage</hi> lettuce succeeds best in hot beds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tying</hi> lettuces with <hi>bass,</hi> from the middle upwards, when about three parts grown, will somewhat help them to whiten and cabbage; but let this business be done carefully. Some <hi>gardeners</hi> do not think it worth while to practise it; and indeed, right good sorts (as to seed) will cabbage themselves, and open ones it is of little use to; yet this assistance may be tried to the <hi>first</hi> crop.</p>
                  <p>This vegetable is sometimes sown <hi>thick,</hi> to draw young for small <hi>sallading;</hi> for which purpose, the <hi>lap</hi> and <hi>cabbage</hi> lettuces are the properest, as they eat ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and sweeter in their infant state, and the <hi>lap</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce seed is very cheap.</p>
                  <p>MELON there is a variety of, in size, shape, coat, and colour of the flesh: This is greater on the <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> and more than sufficiently so here. The sorts we succeed in, and which are usually sown, are the <hi>musk</hi> (or common oblong ribbed melon,) the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the <hi>Cantaleupes</hi> in variety, as the common rock, the black, the orange, and the silver. The <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> are small, but early. The <hi>Cantaleupes</hi> are justly the most admired fruit, but are not so good bearers as the others.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>seed</hi> that is brought from the continent seldom succeeds here. Whoever sows it, must not begin too early in the season, must use more heat, and give less

water than is necessary for <hi>Denizens.</hi> See, <hi>Of raising Melons,</hi> p. 197.</p>
                  <p>ONION, we have several sorts, but the <hi>Strasburgh</hi> (oval shaped) is that mostly cultivated as it keeps the best. The <hi>silver skinned</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> (flat shaped) are milder, and therefore by some preferred. The <hi>Welch</hi> sort does not bulb, and it is rank; but for its being very hardy, is sown thick in <hi>August,</hi> and suffered to stand so for winter and spring use, as a green substitute for others. At this time also, some of the <hi>Strasburgh</hi> may be sown, and perhaps stand the winter. The <hi>Welch</hi> onion is not only hardy, but <hi>perennial,</hi> by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the green tops off. These sometimes die down in severe winters, but the roots shoot again.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>small silver-skinned</hi> onion is the sort fittest for summer <hi>sallading,</hi> and <hi>pickling.</hi> Sow first at the end of <hi>March,</hi> and to have them young once a month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. There is a sort of onion that keeps <hi>two</hi> years, yet not much admired.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>scallion</hi> is a hot distinct kind of perennial on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion that does not bulb; and is got quite out of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation, having given way to the <hi>Welch</hi> onion, as also to the other sorts, that are made milder <hi>scallions</hi> of, by planting early in spring, those that decay and sprout in the house, which quickly grow. Set them in drills six inches asunder, and two inches apart in the drills.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>principal</hi> crop of onions, sow the <hi>Strasburgh</hi> or any other, towards the end of <hi>February,</hi> or soon after, though any time in <hi>March</hi> may do, for it is desirable to shun frost: Let the soil be rich. The earliest crops (of course) produce the largest bulbs. As soon as they will bear it, (perhaps in five or six weeks) let them be thinned either by hoe or hand, to an inch or two apart, and twice afterwards, till each root has full four inches square of ground to grow in.</p>
                  <p>Onions will <hi>transplant</hi> when five or six inches high, taking care to give water immediately. If any onion
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:035770_0247_1006BEBA3A880240"/>
seed is sown, that comes directly from <hi>Portugal</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> it will be very large the first year, and should have six inches room allowed them to bulb finely.</p>
                  <p>Crops of onions should be kept very <hi>clean</hi> from <hi>weeds,</hi> and it would be of advantage to water them once or twice a week in dry weather. In <hi>July</hi> or <hi>August,</hi> when the leaves begin to die at the ends, shrink and turn yellow, let them be bent down to the ground, and in about ten days after, drawn in dry weather, and laid to harden by the sun, turning them every two or three days for a fortnight. <hi>House</hi> them clean and dry, into neither a warm, nor damp, but close room; laying them thin, frequently looking them over in the winter to pick decayed ones out, which would damage the rest: But onions are best kept <hi>strung</hi> and hung up.</p>
                  <p>PARSLEY, as an esculent <hi>root,</hi> is that called <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi> it is eat as carrots, and is considered as a remedy in the <hi>gravel</hi> and <hi>stone.</hi> Sow it early in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> either at broad cast or in drills, and leave the plants six inches asunder. The roots may be preserved in sand; but it is the practice of some to sow at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer,</hi> to draw them young in winter, being best when fresh dug. See <hi>parsley,</hi> next section.</p>
                  <p>PARSNEP is a sweet and valuable root, less culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated than it deserves, being accounted very nouris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As <hi>carrots</hi> require a light soil, so the <hi>parsnep</hi> does a strong one. <hi>Sow</hi> about the end of <hi>February,</hi> or early in <hi>March,</hi> digging the ground <hi>well</hi> and deep. If the soil is light, tread the seed in twice over to fasten it; it comes up in about three weeks. <hi>Thin</hi> when about two inches high, with a small hoe, and afterwards with a large one, so as to leave the roots in a good rich soil, a foot asunder, though eight or ten inches will do in light, or indifferent land. Any thing that is to go off quick, may be sown with parsneps, as <hi>carrots</hi> to draw young, <hi>radishes, lettuces,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Parsneps</hi> are not good till arrived to maturity. These
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:035770_0248_1006BEBFC86B8098"/>
roots are to be taken up, and preserved as <hi>carrots;</hi> but they may remain longer in the ground, and are seldom hurt by frost, so that some of the roots are commonly left undug till spring, and then taken up for use <hi>just</hi> as they begin to shoot, if they are not wanted for seed; when they will keep good in sand till <hi>Mid-April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>PEA, we have a considerable <hi>garden</hi> variety of, arising from the size, time of coming in, colour of flower and fruit, and somewhat in taste. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal distinction is made, as to <hi>early</hi> and <hi>late</hi> peas, so that if the earliest pea is sown at the same time with one of the latest, there will be three weeks difference in their bearing, and a fortnight is usually reckoned between the common <hi>hotspur</hi> and <hi>marrowfat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>early frame pea</hi> (which is that forced in hot beds, &amp;c.) may be sown close under a warm wall at the middle, or rather at the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>November,</hi> and being kept <hi>to</hi> the wall, by earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and by strings, or otherwise, will commonly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the winter, and produce peas in <hi>May:</hi> But at a little distance from the wall in <hi>November,</hi> they do very well, either in a line along it, or in short rows from it, a yard asunder, at right angles with it, or inclining a point to the <hi>east,</hi> to catch the first sun.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>frame pea</hi> is not a good bearer, either in the size, or number of its pods, and therefore the <hi>hotspurs</hi> being hardier and more prolific, are sown by many gardeners for their earliest crop, and the difference of coming in is often but a few days. The <hi>frame pea,</hi> however, takes up less room than the <hi>hotspurs,</hi> and in this respect best suits a fruit border, which should not be encumbered with tall crops. <hi>Facny</hi> will rule in the choice of peas, but the established sorts of the <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hotspur,</hi> and <hi>dwarf marrowfats,</hi> are excellent for full summer crops.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>frame pea</hi> may be sown a quarter of an inch from one another, and the <hi>hotspur</hi> half; it is common indeed to sow thicker, but it is not advisable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="unknown:035770_0249_1006BEC1D1358098"/>
                     <hi>Earthing up</hi> peas, and particularly the <hi>early</hi> crops, should be done frequently, a little at a time, in dry weather, beginning when only an inch high. Before frost comes on, the early peas must be earthed up high, and some peas haulm, or dry straw laid lightly against, or over them, in hard frosts; but let the covering be immediately removed aside when the weather becomes mild.</p>
                  <p>

                        </gap>king</hi> peas is to take place as soon as they begin to vine, (put forth tendrils) or appear too weak to support themselves against wind. Let the sticks be set strait, neat, and full; and by all means <hi>high</hi> enough for the sorts; allowing sticks of three feet above ground for the <hi>frame pea,</hi> near five for the <hi>hotspur,</hi> near six for the <hi>dwarf marrowfat,</hi> and seven or eight for the larger sorts. If short of wood, sticking only the S. or W. side of the rows may do, if the wind does not set very contrary. Some people sow double rows of peas at ten inches or a foot asunder, and set sticks only in the middle, earthing the peas towards them. Peas that are to grow without sticks, may be sown, the smaller sorts at two, and the larger at three feet asunder.</p>
                  <p>The latter end of <hi>November,</hi> or beginning of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> more peas may be sown, and towards the end of <hi>January,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> in order to have a <hi>full</hi> supply at the first of the season: The earliest opportunity in the <hi>new year</hi> should be taken, if those sown before have been cut off, or greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. Peas sown at the beginning of <hi>February</hi> are often only a week behind those of <hi>November.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To have a constant <hi>succession</hi> of them, peas should be sown about once a month in winter, every three weeks in spring, and every fortnight in summer, which may be continued till the middle of <hi>July,</hi> when if some <hi>hotspurs</hi> are sown in a sheltered and sunny sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, they <hi>may</hi> do very well.</p>
                  <p>

The <hi>late</hi> and large sorts of peas, as the <hi>marrowfat Morattos, American,</hi> &amp;c. should be first sown towards the end of <hi>February,</hi> and not sooner, left they rot.</p>
                  <p>The dwarf <hi>marrowfats</hi> should be laid in the drills half an inch asunder, the large marrowfats three-quarters, the <hi>Moratto</hi> an inch, and the <hi>American</hi> two inches, and each sort covered near two inches. The <hi>Leadman's</hi> dwarf pea, for its small size, is admired at genteel tables, and is sweet and fruitful; but rather longer in coming in than the usual late sorts: It es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes the <hi>mildew</hi> better than other peas, and therefore is proper for the latest crops in open ground: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires sticks only from two to three feet high, and may be sown thicker than any other pea: It may be sown till <hi>Midsummer.</hi> On the same day that <hi>hotspurs</hi> are sown, put in a crop of any of these <hi>late</hi> peas, and they will come in proper succession; i. e. ten days or a fortnight after.</p>
                  <p>To save <hi>seed peas,</hi> let none be gathered from the rows except <hi>late</hi> formed ones, which had better not be among the rest, for the reason given in the article <hi>kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney bean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A few <hi>observations</hi> may be added. Peas will <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant,</hi> and therefore broken rows may be made up, only chuse (if possible) mild and moist weather for the work in <hi>March,</hi> and shade them with a little straw, while they have taken root. If the autumn sown crops were cut off, peas may be sown under <hi>hand-glasses</hi> in <hi>January</hi> or <hi>February,</hi> and thus forwarded, planting them out when they have been two or three weeks above ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Watering</hi> peas in a dry time answers well, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when in flower and fruiting. To receive the water there should be ridges drawn towards the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, forming a gutter on each side.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>slugs,</hi> or other insects attack young peas, strew some <hi>lime</hi> fresh slacked, or <hi>soot</hi> along the rows, so as not immediately to touch the plants, after which give

                     <hi>Mice</hi> must be guarded against as to <hi>autumn</hi> and <hi>winter</hi> sown peas, by immediately setting traps for them, of which a <hi>number</hi> of the common block ones will be found to answer best, setting one at every two yards.</p>
                  <p>Peas do not like <hi>dung,</hi> and will be more fruitful in a moderate soil than a rich one, except the <hi>rouncivals,</hi> of which we have the <hi>White, green, grey,</hi> and <hi>blue</hi> sorts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stopping</hi> peas (i. e. cropping the leading shoot) is practised by some gardeners, to promote fruitfulness and maturity: This is a reasonable practice, but chiefly relates to the <hi>early</hi> crop.</p>
                  <p>POTATOE is found to be the most useful root that is cultivated, though it is not many years that it has been in so general estimation. Its worth and uses are now pretty well known, and it seems settled, that as a substitute for <hi>bread,</hi> it is most profitably eat without mixture.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>potatoe</hi> degenerates when it is long propagated from roots, they are occasionally raised from <hi>seed,</hi> which changes the sorts. Some are denominated <hi>meally,</hi> others <hi>waxy;</hi> i. e. are either of a loose or a firm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture: The former is best adapted for food, as most farinaceous. They are distinguished again as to <hi>shape,</hi> into round, oval, and clustered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Potatoes</hi> will grow in any soil, but best in one that is light, cool and good, especially a fresh one. Season, as well as soil, makes a difference in their goodness, as does the way of boiling them in eating, on which the quality of the water has some effect, as indeed it has on all vegetables, and that is the best water in which they are boiled quickest. The <hi>white</hi> potatoes are generally preferred, but some of the <hi>red</hi> kinds are very good; and the old <hi>rough red</hi> from <hi>Lancashire,</hi> was one of the best ever cultivated: About fifty years ago, one but <hi>red</hi> ones met with a good sale at market.

                  <p>The <hi>cultivation</hi> of potatoes is various, as experiment and opinions ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                  <p>For <hi>sets</hi> or <hi>cuttings,</hi> prefer middle sized, well shaped potatoes, and let each piece have one good eye in its middle, or at the most two. They should be set in rows, eighteen inches asunder, in a poor soil, twenty-one in a middling, and two feet in a rich one. In the former, the sets may be six or seven inches apart, and in the latter eight or nine. In a light soil, plant them five or six inches deep, and in a heavy one only three or four. When planted deep, they will not need earthing up above once, but when shallow, two or three times. In a light soil, they may be put in with a blunt dibble, but in a heavy one should be laid in <hi>trenches;</hi> and if the trenches were dug deep, and first filled with long dung, old thatch, or short straw, it would be a great advantage, covering them up in ridges, and drawing mould to as they settle. Cold, moist ground should be divided into <hi>beds</hi> of two or three rows each, with sunk <hi>alleys</hi> between; and as in such
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:035770_0253_1006BED661A678B0"/>
a soil the sets should not be above three inches deep, the sinking of the alleys may be made by earthing the rows up from time to time. In a heavy soil make the rows rather wider than in a light one, that there be a due quantity of mould to draw for earthing up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Early potatoes</hi> are procured several ways. On a <hi>hot bed,</hi> some may be planted in <hi>February,</hi> or under <hi>hand-glasses,</hi> in a warm border, or without. There are early sorts on purpose for this culture, called <hi>mules,</hi> as they do not bear seed. As these potatoes are small, they may be planted whole, or rather cut in halves, paring off the eyes at the crown where they are thick, as it never answers to have many shoots come from a set; whole ones should be planted a foot asunder, and halves at eight inches.</p>
                  <p>Look over the <hi>stock</hi> of early potatoes, and plant those first carefully in trenches that have rooted shoots, for they will produce the first fruit, especially if short and bushy. When <hi>up</hi> in <hi>hot beds,</hi> or under <hi>hand-glasses,</hi> let them have plenty of air, and in open ground be protected from frost by timely earthing up, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional covering with haulm, or straw, which must not be kept on, but upon necessity. As these early potatoes are on a warm border, a little water in a dry time will forward them, and increase their size. In default of the <hi>true</hi> early potatoe, sets with good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shoots of any of the other sorts may be treated as above.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Mid-March</hi> to <hi>Mid-April</hi> is the properest time (earlier or later as the soil is dry or moist) to plant for the principal crop, though <hi>May,</hi> or even <hi>June,</hi> generally produce an increase worth the cultivation. The roots from <hi>late</hi> crops should not be used for plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they are more liable to the <hi>curl:</hi> Those pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes growing sickly in a wet soil, are also subject to this defect. <hi>Potatoes,</hi> being of superficial growth, should be regularly <hi>weeded,</hi> as long as they can be walked among without treading on the tops.</p>

Ground, designed for a <hi>field crop,</hi> should be twice ploughed, and the first time some weeks before the setting.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>potatoe counties,</hi> they <hi>change</hi> their sorts every third or fourth year; procuring fresh kinds from places farther <hi>North,</hi> as a means to avoid the <hi>curl,</hi> which seems to arise chiefly from the tender nature of the potatoe, and advises us not to be <hi>too</hi> early in planting.</p>

                     <hi>Seedling</hi> potatoes are procured by saving the first <hi>thorough</hi> ripe pods, (called apples) and either preserving them in very dry sand till spring, or immediately sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating them from the pulp, put the seed up dry in papers, when it is quite dry. In <hi>March,</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> sow the seed half an inch deep, in a light soil, in drills fifteen inches asunder, and thin the plants to six inches. Earth them up as they grow.

                  <p>That potatoes are very susceptable of <hi>frost,</hi> is well known; but it is often not sufficiently guarded against in time. If not kept in a warm <hi>cellar,</hi> they may be laid in a <hi>room,</hi> having some straw at bottom, and when in prospect of frost entering the house, they should be covered with straw, a foot thick: Let them be brought in clean and dry.</p>

                     <hi>Pying</hi> (as it is called in some places) is a good method of preserving potatoes in winter. They are piled on the surface of the ground, in a ridged form, of a width and length at pleasure, according to the quantity, but commonly about six feet wide. This is done by digging a spit of earth, and laying it round the edge, a foot wide, (if turf the better) filling the space up with straw, and them laying on a course of potatoes, dig earth from the outside, and lay upon the first earth. Put straw a few inches along the inside edge, then put in more potatoes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

thick all over; beat it close together, and the form it lies in, with the trench all round, will preserve the potatoes dry; and the severest frost will hardly affect them, in a time of which the whole may be covered thick with straw. In the <hi>spring,</hi> look over the stock, and break off the shoots of those designed for the <hi>table,</hi> and repeat this business, to preserve the potatoes longer good.</p>
                  <p>PUMPIONS there are many sorts of; but they are esculents little cultivated, because little relished. They take up much room, spreading from twenty to forty feet square of ground. As gigantic curiosities, or to cover an arbour, we now and then see them; but they must have a good deal of sun to forward their ripening. There is a great variety in the shape, colour, and rind of this fruit, and the sizes are from four inches diam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter to eighten, or more. The <hi>bottle gourd,</hi> or <hi>common pumpion,</hi> has produced fruit, even in this climate, <hi>six feet</hi> long. In <hi>America,</hi> a single plant of the gourd, without any culture, spread over so large a spot of ground, as to produce 260 fruits, one with another, as big as a half peck. They grow so large in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that the <hi>camel</hi> (so remarkable for its strength) is not able to carry above five or six of them.</p>
                  <p>Pumpions being <hi>tender,</hi> are raised on a moderate <hi>hot bed,</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> according to the time desired to have fruit at. After the seed has been up a few days, prick the plants out at four or five inches, or rather put them in small pots, one in each. When a month old, they may be planted out about four yards asunder, one of the large sorts, or two of the small ones, on a <hi>hole</hi> of two or three barrows full of hot dung, and about ten inches thick of mould. Cover with <hi>hand-glasses,</hi> or <hi>garden pots,</hi> or hoops and mats, on nights, till <hi>Mid-June.</hi> On such a hole of hot dung they may be <hi>sown</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> under a <hi>hand-glass,</hi> and there remain to fruit. Pumpions will do very well sometimes (in favourable seasons and situations) sown

in <hi>May,</hi> on cold ground. The seed should be covered near an inch, and the plants kept earthing up as they grow. <hi>Water</hi> well in dry and warm weather. The <hi>orange gourd</hi> looks very pretty when trained up a strong pole, spirally, or to a wall. <hi>Drinking vessels</hi> have been made of the shells of wellripened gourds, as is done with the <hi>cocoanut.</hi>

                  <p>RADISH is of two kinds, the spindle rooted, and the round, of each of which there is a variety. Of the former we have the early <hi>purple,</hi> and the early <hi>pink,</hi> short topped, and late large topped ones of both sorts. Of the latter there are the <hi>white, black,</hi> and <hi>red</hi> turnip radishes. The <hi>white</hi> (of which there is a small and large sort) is mostly cultivated, but the others are both good; the black grows large, and the red small. The purple sorts, and the small white and red eat the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. The order of coming in from the time of sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, the purple, and the pink, spindle sorts, and the turnip, red, white, and black: The latter is very hardy for winter use.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>first</hi> crop, the early purple short top may be sown the latter end of <hi>October, November,</hi> and <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> in a warm border, and have a chance of surviving the winter, if a little protected in frosts by <hi>short sticks,</hi> stuck sloping in the ground, to support mats; or by laying peas haulm, or <hi>wheat straw,</hi> lightly over them, which may be an inch or two thick, as the frost is; but <hi>no</hi> longer than it lasts may the covering be on. In open weather in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February</hi> sow again, and in these months, and the preceding one, cover the ground over with some straw, and it will help to fetch the seeds up, and preserve them from being thrown out of the ground by frost, as also from birds. As soon as they begin to appear, let them be uncovered to harden them to the air, if the weather is not too severe. Thin these radishes to an inch and a half, or two inches asunder, though some gardeners let them grow thicker.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>hot bed</hi> is frequently used for radishes about <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> or in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> which must not be

too warm a one, as it would hurry the seed up, and make them grow all top, and come to nothing. Two feet thick of dung is sufficient, on which seven or eight inches of light mould should be put on, (rather sifted) and the seed immediately sown on the surface, (rather thick) and covered with half an inch of earth, giving the whole a gentle pressure, that the seed may not lie too lightly in contact with the mould, a circumstance that in all cases should be avoided; for roots will grow better when the earth is somewhat firm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

In lieu of frames, a hot bed of radishes may, in <hi>February,</hi> or after be hooped, and covered with on nights, and in bad weather; and in this way, indeed, they generally succeed best. <hi>Line</hi> forward beds, when the heat declines, that they may proceed in growth, without check or interruption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repeat</hi> sowing of radishes every three weeks in spring, and fortnight in summer, sowing in cool ground as the season advances, and they may be had almost the whole year. In dry weather water. Allow three inches distance to those sown after <hi>February,</hi> or rather more for the longed topped sorts. The <hi>turnip</hi> kind may now be sown; yet their <hi>best</hi> season is after <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> But sow only the small white and red; the large white and black are considered merely as <hi>autumn</hi> and <hi>winter</hi> sorts, which will often continue good to <hi>spring:</hi> In prospect of severe weather, some of these may be taken up, and preserved in sand, having first cut the tops off short.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thin</hi> the small turnip sorts to four inches distance, and the large to six or eight: Sow the two last sorts in <hi>June, July,</hi> or even <hi>August.</hi> In <hi>August,</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> sow also some of the other sorts of radishes. Turnip

radishes are rarely sown on hot beds; but the small <hi>red</hi> sort will be found an agreeably early crop, and may stand as thick as the spindle rooted kinds.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ground</hi> should be <hi>well dug</hi> for radishes, especially the long rooted sorts, and the <hi>seed</hi> carefully covered a full half inch, leaving none on the top (if possible) to lure birds, which will frequently do much mischief to the crop.

                  <p>A <hi>sprinkle</hi> of radish seed may be frequently sown among other crops, as <hi>spinach;</hi> and the ground at spring that is designed for <hi>cauliflowers,</hi> may very prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly be sown with them, just before the plants are to be set out.</p>

                  <p>Radishes are sometimes sown thick for eating, while very young in the <hi>seed leaf,</hi> with other small sallading. And large radishes may be <hi>boiled,</hi> and eat as <hi>asparagus.</hi>

                  <p>SALSAFY, though but little cultivated, is a useful vegetable. Its young shoots are eat as <hi>asparagus</hi> in spring, and its long white <hi>roots</hi> in autumn and winter as <hi>carrots,</hi> some of which are taken up, and preserved in sand for winter use. Those left in the ground may be dug up occasionally, or left to produce shoots for spring, or may stand for seed. <hi>Sow</hi> them early in <hi>March,</hi> in drills ten inches asunder, and thin the plants to six.</p>
                  <p>SAVOY is a sort of a cabbage, peculiarly adapted for late <hi>autumn</hi> and <hi>winter</hi> use, as frost improves it, making

it tenderer and sweeter than before. Some gardeners forward them for early <hi>autumn</hi> use, but they are not then good. There is a <hi>green,</hi> and a <hi>yellow</hi> sort, the former mostly cultivated, as it looks best at table.</p>
                  <p>If savoys are desired <hi>forward,</hi> sow a little savoy seed in a warm border in <hi>February,</hi> or under a hand-glass; but a sowing in <hi>March,</hi> and another in <hi>April,</hi> in an open situation, is sufficient for late autumn, winter, and spring use. <hi>Thin</hi> the seed bed in time, that the plants may be strait and robust; and when about three inches high, prick them out to five or six inches dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, where let them grow to a proper size, (as in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi>) to plant out at two feet apart, or a little more, in a rich soil. Chuse moist weather for this work, if possible, and give some water. Earth them up as they grow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sprouts</hi> of savoys are most delicate eating greens, and therefore if the ground is wanted where the stalks grow, let them be taken up, and laid deep in a trench to produce a second crop.</p>
                  <p>SCORZONERA is a carrot-rooted esculent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requires a deep and cool soil. Cultivate it as <hi>salsafy,</hi> only let the drills be two inches wider, and the plants an inch or two more asunder.</p>
                  <p>SEA-CALE, or <hi>cabbage,</hi> is a vegetable not generally known, except in <hi>Essex, Sussex,</hi> and the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but is much liked by many, and as an early spring production is valuable.</p>
                  <p>Its natural place of growth being the <hi>sea-beach,</hi> it is evident that a sandy soil suits it best. Some people cultivate it in almost all sand, which, if the natural soil of the place, is proper, as such surface sand is endowed with vegetable principles; but when a soil for this vegetable is <hi>made,</hi> it should be one half <hi>sharp,</hi> or drift sand, and the other half any light rich mould, which may be a little gravelly, or mixed with sea-coal ashes.

It is a root that lasts many years, and therefore should be properly planted and managed; either in beds of it, like those of <hi>asparagus,</hi> (the which it precedes) of four feet and a half wide, and two feet alleys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween; or in single rows of long trenches, which is perhaps the better way. They are best raised from <hi>seed,</hi> though often from <hi>offsets,</hi> or <hi>pieces</hi> of the roots, having two or three eyes to each.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>beds</hi> must be trenched, and of a dry loose earth, (as said) to two, or two and a half feet deep; and if any suspicion of wet ever hanging at bottom, lay a course of rough gravel or stones there. The plants should be near a foot asunder, kept five of six inches below the surface, that they may grow through a body of earth to <hi>blanch</hi> the sprouts; and they are to be cut up four or five inches deep, soon after they appear above ground. In <hi>summer,</hi> the ribs of the large leaves may be peeled, and eat as <hi>asparagus.</hi> They will want earthing up from the alleys every year, to keep them at the above depth; for which purpose keep proper earth in them. It is evidently best to sow, or plant, low enough at first, to be prepared for future earthing up; not to grow too low, however, if there is a clay bottom. <hi>Sets</hi> may be planted at first only three inches deep from their crowns, and earthed up to five or six as they rise: Some do this with <hi>fine</hi> sifted <hi>coal-ashes,</hi> and the effect may also be attained with the <hi>leaves</hi> of trees laid close round. Little should be cut the first year, but the second do it freely.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>seed</hi> should be dropped three or four in a hole, half an inch deep, and thinned to one plant in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, earthing up a little as they proceed in growth. When the leaves decay in autumn, earth the plants over an inch or two, with mould from the alleys. In the spring, loosen the earth carefully with the asparagus fork, and at autumn, earth up as before. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spring, fork again in time, and about <hi>April</hi> there will be plenty to cut, which, if suffered to grow large,

                  <p>SHALOT is a perennial sort of onion, for which it is often substituted, and in some cases preferred, as being more agreeable to the palate and stomach, by its rich and mild nature.</p>
                  <p>The shalot is <hi>propagated</hi> by planting its offsets late in autumn, in a dry soil, or in spring, if a moist one. The latter time is generally adopted as safest; but autumn sets produce the finest bulbs. Plant two or three inches deep, and four or five asunder, in rows, six inches distance from one another. When the leaves wither, dig them up, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>SKIRRET is a very wholesome root, propagated by seed, as <hi>scorzonera,</hi> and sometimes by offsets of the old roots in spring, planted an inch deep over their crowns.</p>
                  <p>SPINACH is of two kinds, denominated from the seed, as prickly and smooth; the former is sown in <hi>autumn,</hi> i. e. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> end of <hi>July,</hi> and about <hi>Mid-August,</hi> to gather in winter, and the beginning of spring, being very hardy; and the latter is sown early in the new year for after use, though the prickly does very well also for the same purpose. The smooth sort is rather tender, but it grows larger, with thicker leaves, and is therefore seldom sown, otherwise than at broad cast; but the prickly is frequently sown in drills, as between rows of <hi>pens, beans,</hi> &amp;c. Soinach may be sown on pieces of ground, where it is intended to plant cauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, or cabbages.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>broad cast</hi> hoe thin, and trample the seed in with the feet, rather wide, that there may be a sufficient quantity of mould to rake down over the seed. Hoe the prickly sort to four inches apart, and the smooth to six, or more, in a rich soil. If in <hi>drills</hi> sow also thin, and cover an inch deep. Some people thin the
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:035770_0262_1006BF00F589A0A0"/>
plants in drills to three inches distance, and draw every other for use, when those left will grow large, and this may be proper with the smooth spinach; but it is more common not to thin the rows, and to <hi>gather,</hi> by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the leaves down low, when more will spring up again. It is a good way to sow spinach in <hi>beds</hi> of four feet, with alleys, that it may be the more conveniently attended and gathered, without trampling the ground: Gardening in this way of narrow <hi>beds</hi> will, in many cases, he found agreeable.</p>
                  <p>To have a full <hi>succession</hi> of spinach, sow in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> and afterwards again in three weeks, and then every fortnight, or even oftener, for it pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently runs to seed in summer, especially if the plants grow close. Some people are fond of <hi>drilled</hi> spinach, as it is quickly gathered, and fancied to eat better; but <hi>broad cast</hi> is commonly reckoned the best way, and gathering the outside leaves, the plant shoots again repeatedly: In spring, however, when the ground is wanted, and the plants are disposed to run, they should be drawn.</p>
                  <p>TURNIP we have a variety of sorts of, for table use, differing in colour and shape, earliness and flavour. The most common are the <hi>white</hi> sorts; but the <hi>yellow</hi> and <hi>red</hi> are by some admired, and are worthy of trial. The small <hi>early Dutch</hi> is that mostly cultivated in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, at least for the first crops, though the <hi>early stone</hi> sort is a good root.</p>
                  <p>Turnips are <hi>sown</hi> from <hi>March to September,</hi> but in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> for the principal crops, which may be of the larger sorts. Late crops may be sown till <hi>Mid-August,</hi> but they will produce but small roots. Those sown in <hi>March</hi> will be apt to run for seed before they have formed much bottom, and must be watched to draw them in time. Yet the turnip is so favourite a vegetable that <hi>hot beds</hi> are sometimes made in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March</hi> to forward it, though thus cultivated, it can attain but to a very small size. A bed of this sort must
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:035770_0263_1006BF06452BB330"/>
be slight, and have a great deal of air from the very sowing. A moderately light soil, with little dung, suits turnips best, and they should always have open ground that is well broke. Sow thin, trample close, and rake lightly: It is a way with some, to sow one third old seed with the new, for the greater certainly of a crop; the former sometimes succeeding when the latter misses. Do not neglect to <hi>hoe</hi> the crops in time, the early ones to five or six inches, and the late ones to eight or nine, though some large sorts should have more distance allowed them.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>fly</hi> is observed to attack young turnips, it will be proper to stir the ground, and sow again imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or to chuse another spot for the purpose.</p>
                  <p>The NAVEW, or <hi>French turnip,</hi> (which is much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by some, and said to be the most nourishing sort of turnip) should be repeatedly sown from <hi>March</hi> to <hi>August,</hi> in a moist ground; but being a small, slender root, need not stand wider than five or six inches.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>cabbage turnip</hi> is of two kinds; one apples above ground, and the other in it. This vegetable is sometimes used <hi>young</hi> for the table; but it is chiefly cultivated for cattle. Sow it in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June,</hi> for <hi>autumn</hi> use, or in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> for the <hi>spring:</hi> They are <hi>very</hi> hardy. If sown in a garden, and pricked out, they may be transplanted in fields, the first moist wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after a crop of <hi>oats,</hi> or <hi>barley,</hi> at half a yard, in a poor, or near two feet in a rich soil; and if the ground if foul, this culture gives a fine opportunity to clean it, by hoeing.</p>

                  <p>ANGELICA is cultivated for the large ribs of its leaves, cut in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> to make a candied <hi>preserve;</hi> and it is also a <hi>medicinal</hi> plant, in stalk, leaf, root, and seed. The seed should be sown after it is ripe, as in spring it does not come well. Put the plants out when a few inches high, at two feet asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It is <hi>biennial;</hi> but if not cultivated for the seed, cut the stems down in <hi>May,</hi> and the plant will put out side shoots; and by this practice, every year, may be continued long in the same place. A moist situation suits it best, and it may be planted by ditches, or ponds.</p>
                  <p>BALM is either plain, or variegated; but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer only is cultivated as a <hi>medicinal</hi> herb. It is prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated by parting the root, either in autumn or spring, but rather the latter. Slip off short pieces with roots, and plant them a foot, or fifteen inches asunder, giving a little water.</p>
                  <p>The balm that is gathered to <hi>dry,</hi> ought to be cut just as it gets into flower; as for this purpose all herbs should, being then in the highest perfection. Dry it in an airy, shady place, till fit to tie up in <hi>small</hi> bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, which must be stored in a dry airy room. Balm, and most perennial herbs, should be fresh planted in beds every third or fourth year; and every year, in <hi>autumn</hi> or <hi>spring,</hi> should have the ground stirred about them, and dressed with a little fresh earth, the plants being previously cut down.</p>

BASIL is pretty <hi>annual,</hi> of which we have two sorts, the <hi>large</hi> and the <hi>bush;</hi> (each having a variety) both are used as <hi>pot herbs,</hi> but chiefly the former. Sometimes also this herb is used in <hi>sallads,</hi> and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally in <hi>medicine.</hi> The large grows about a foot high, and the bush but a few inches. They are both sweet, but the <hi>bush</hi> most so; and for this, and its deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate round form, it is cultivated as a part of the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>flower garden.</hi> Both sorts are sown on a gentle <hi>hot bed,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> and may be pricked out in small pots, but they will hardly endure the open air till <hi>June.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BORAGE is a cordial herb, that has its varieties, as <hi>blue, red,</hi> and <hi>white</hi> flowered, and one with variegated leaves; but the former is that commonly cultivated as a <hi>pot herb,</hi> for <hi>sallads,</hi> and <hi>cool tankards.</hi> To have it young (as it should be for use) all the year, let it be sown in spring, summer, and autumn, either in drills or broad cast. Thin the plants to nine inches asunder. It sows itself in autumn, and likes a dry soil.</p>
                  <p>BUGLOSS possesses the like cordial virtues with <hi>bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> so that the one may be substituted for the other. Culture is the same.</p>
                  <p>BURNET is a warm perennial <hi>sallad herb,</hi> used also in <hi>cool tankards,</hi> propagated in spring or autumn, either by seed, or by parting its roots, and planting them a foot asunder. Keep it frequently cut down, that it may constantly furnish <hi>young</hi> shoots for use.</p>
                  <p>CAMOMILE is a useful <hi>medicinal</hi> herb, of which we have single and double flowering kinds; and of the latter, a sort with very full flowers. It is propagated by parting its roots, or by its runners in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> setting them nine or ten inches asunder. Gather the flowers in their <hi>prime,</hi> (as those of all plants should be) before they begin to fade; dry them thinly in the shade for a few days, and preserve them from damp in paper bags. The single sort is the strongest, though for quantity, the double is mostly cultivated.</p>
                  <p>

CAPSICUM is sometimes cultivated for its young pods to pickle; being raised on a gentle <hi>hot bed,</hi> or two, to bring them forward till <hi>June,</hi> when (rather about the middle) they may be planted in open ground, about half a yard asunder. See list of <hi>annuals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To have capsicums <hi>fine,</hi> if the ripe pods are wanted, sow them at the end of <hi>February,</hi> or beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and let them be well attended to, to give them as much air as the season will permit. The seed will be about a fortnight before it comes up.</p>
                  <p>CARAWAY seeds are <hi>medicinal,</hi> and being used in cakes, a few plants may have place in the garden. Sow in spring in a moist rich soil, and let them have six inches square to grow in.</p>
                  <p>CARDUUS BENEDICTUS is simply <hi>medicinal,</hi> and is of good repute. Sow it in <hi>autumn,</hi> either in drills or broad cast, and thin the plants to nine inches distance. It is <hi>annual,</hi> and must be cut down to the root for <hi>dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> just as it gets into flower, about <hi>July.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>CHERVIL is used in <hi>sallads,</hi> and is also a <hi>pot herb</hi> that was formerly in much estimation for its warm nature. Sow it thick in autumn for winter and spring use. When sown in spring, or summer, it runs quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to flower. The seed must be slightly covered, and the leaves gathered for use while <hi>young,</hi> cutting it down like parsley, (which it resembles) it springs up again.</p>
                  <p>CIVES are small bulbs, and a sort of mild perennial onion, the leaves of which are cut for <hi>sallads,</hi> and <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linary</hi> purposes, at the spring, before onions come in. As the <hi>bulbs</hi> increase fast, some of them may be slipped from the rooted clusters, and used as onions. They are propagated in <hi>autumn,</hi> or early in the <hi>spring,</hi> by planting five or six of the little bulbs in a hole, an inch deep, and eight asunder.</p>
                  <p>CLARY (the common garden) ranks as a <hi>medicinal</hi> herb, but it is used also in <hi>soups,</hi> and is very odorous. Sow it in spring, and when two or three inches high, prick the plants out fifteen or eighteen inches asunder,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:035770_0267_1006BDBE39B233E0"/>
or thin them to this distance. It is <hi>biennial,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be sown every year as parsley is. There are sorts of this plant cultivated for their ornamental flowers. See <hi>biennials.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>CORIANDER is occasionally used in <hi>soups</hi> and <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads,</hi> for its peculiar high flavour; but it has been mostly propagated for <hi>medicinal</hi> purposes, which its seeds are used in. For culinary uses, sow it in <hi>April,</hi> and once a month, or oftener, afterwards, in drills six inches asunder, to have a succession of young plants; and make a principal sowing in <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> on a warm border. Cover some of it with a frame, or it will die in hard weather, as it is a tender plant. If wanted early in the year, sow on a <hi>hot bed,</hi> in <hi>Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary</hi> or <hi>March;</hi> or in this last month under <hi>hand-glasses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>CORN SALLAD or <hi>(lamb's lettuce)</hi> is a small, warm, wholesome, hardy herb, and for winter and spring use should be sown in <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> and again in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> and once a month all summer, for it is to be eat quite young. The plants should grow about three inches distance.</p>
                  <p>CRESS, there are three sorts of, plain, curled, and broad leaved; the former of which is much used as a <hi>sallad herb,</hi> with <hi>mustard, rape, radish,</hi> &amp;c. The curled and broad leaved sorts should be thinned to half an inch asunder: but the plain is to be sown thick. The curled makes a pretty <hi>gurnish.</hi> In the cold months this sallad herb (as others) is sown on gentle <hi>hot beds,</hi> giving plenty of air; and as the spring gets up, on warm borders, or under <hi>hand-glasses.</hi> The <hi>London</hi> market gardeners sow it just within the glasses which cover their cauliflower plants, &amp;c. In summer it should be sown in shady cool ground, and daily wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; or it may be sown in the most sunny situation, if hooped over, and shaded with a mat. Break the mould <hi>fine,</hi> and draw <hi>level</hi> shallow drills, and cover only a quarter of an inch. It may, however <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

at broad cast, the ground being first raked very smooth, and the seed just covered with fine sifted mould. Let it be sown (upon an average) once a week, and cut <hi>young.</hi> It that which is sown in open ground, at an early season, be covered with a mat, it will forward the germination. The <hi>American cress</hi> is much like water cress, only of a more strong bitter flavour. It answers well as a <hi>winter</hi> and <hi>early</hi> spring sallad, being sown in <hi>August,</hi> at broad cast, or rather thin in drills. The plants being cut, or the outside leaves pulled off, shoot again.</p>
                  <p>DILL is a very stomachic herb, whose leaves and seed vessels are put among vegetable <hi>pickles,</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>cucumbers,</hi> to heighten their relish. The stem, leaves, and seed, are also used in <hi>medicine.</hi> The leaves are sometimes used in soups and sauces. Sow it either in autumn, or early in the spring, at broad cast, or in drills, a foot asunder, thinning the plants to about eight inches. It sows itself freely, and comes up at spring.</p>
                  <p>FENNEL (the common sort) is an hardy <hi>perennial</hi> herb, of the same family as <hi>dill,</hi> the uses of which are well known. It may be <hi>sown</hi> either in spring or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, and the plants ought to be kept near half a yard asunder; or it may be propagated by slips from the roots of old plants. It should be constantly cut down to prevent seeding, which would cover the ground in a very troublesome degree. <hi>Sweet fennel</hi> is an <hi>annual,</hi> cultivated for its seeds in <hi>medicine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FINOCHIO is a sort of <hi>dwarf fennel,</hi> very aromatic; the thick stalks of which, earthed up, when nearly full grown, five or six inches to <hi>blanch,</hi> are used in <hi>soups</hi> and <hi>sallads,</hi> or sliced, and eat alone with oil, vinegar, &amp;c. Sow it thick in <hi>March,</hi> in drills, about two feet asunder, and repeat the sowing every month till <hi>July,</hi> as it pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently runs for seed. Thin the plants to seven or eight inches. It likes a dry soil, and in a warm situation some may be sown in <hi>February;</hi> the last crop in <hi>June</hi>
                     <pb n="257" facs="unknown:035770_0269_1006BDB29C469620"/>
must be in a like situation, and will not be ready before winter. It takes a fortnight or three weeks to blanch.</p>
                  <p>HYSSOP is used sometimes in a <hi>culinary,</hi> but more in a <hi>medicinal</hi> way. There are white, blue, and red flowered sorts of it: but the <hi>blue</hi> spiked is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cultivated. The parts for <hi>culinary</hi> purposes are the leaves, and young shoots; and the flower spikes are cut, dried, and preserved <hi>medical</hi> uses. As <hi>hyssop</hi> is a woody evergreen <hi>perennial</hi> herb, growing little more than a foot high, it may be planted for an edging of the kitchen garden. It is propagated by seed, and rooted slips in <hi>March,</hi> by cuttings in <hi>April,</hi> or young slips in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July.</hi> A poor dry, or sandy soil suits it. The plants may be nine inches, or a foot asunder as an <hi>edging,</hi> but should be near two feet from one another in a <hi>bed,</hi> as they soon get large.</p>
                  <p>LAVENDER (that sort commonly cultivated) is, for its pleasant aromatic scent, found in most gardens, and makes a neat perennial <hi>edging</hi> in large ones. It is propagated by cuttings, or young slips, in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> set a few inches asunder, in a shady situation, and good soil; and when rooted, planted out where they are to grow. The slips should be occasionally watered, and as a mat would cover a great many, might be shaded when the sun is hot upon them, for a fortnight or three weeks, to forward their rooting. But though <hi>raised</hi> in a good soil, lavender likes a poor and dry one best to <hi>abide</hi> in. Set the plants at a foot distance from one another. In a rich moist soil, they are apt to die in the winter, but in a dry hungry one, they rarely do. This is the case with all plants, that the more luxuriantly they grow, the more likely they are to be cut off by severe weather.</p>
                  <p>MARIGOLD has its varieties, and some sorts bear very fine double flowers, but the common single kind is best as a <hi>pot herb,</hi> being most aromatic. All <hi>single</hi> flowers are preferable to the double of the same kind for <hi>medicinal,</hi> or other uses, as being of a higher flavour,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:035770_0270_1006BDB0C16A6958"/>
or stronger essence. Sow marigolds in spring, and let plants of the single sort stand a foot asunder, but the large double wider. They will grow in any soil, and are in flower most part of the year. The time of gathering them for <hi>drying</hi> is towards <hi>autumn,</hi> when they are most plentiful. Take care that they are not put up in their paper bags raw, or damp, and keep them in a very dry place. This flower is a <hi>valuable</hi> ingredient in broths and soups, however it may have got into disuse. It sows itself abundantly, and will bear transplanting about <hi>May,</hi> so that there will sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be occasion to sow.</p>
                  <p>MARJORAM is distinguished into <hi>pot, winter,</hi> and <hi>knotted</hi> sorts; the two former <hi>perennial,</hi> and the last <hi>annual.</hi> They are all occasionally used for <hi>culinary</hi> purposes, but the knotted is chiefly cultivated as a <hi>sweet</hi> companion of our flowers. The propagation of it is by parting the roots of the <hi>perennial</hi> sorts in <hi>autumn</hi> or <hi>spring,</hi> and by sowing the <hi>annual</hi> kind in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> on a warm border, and light or dry soil. The <hi>annual</hi> sort should stand at six inches distance, and the <hi>perennial</hi> at nine or ten. These (and all) herbs are to be cut for <hi>drying</hi> just as they get in bloom. The <hi>knotted</hi> sort, it planted in pots, and housed, may be preserved in the winter, cutting down the flower stems. This kind is sometimes used for <hi>medicinal</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and should be drawn up by the roots, for drying in the shade; or at least with but little sun.</p>
                  <p>MINT is a salutary herb, of which we have two sorts, the <hi>spear</hi> and the <hi>pepper;</hi> the former for <hi>culinary,</hi> and the latter for <hi>medicinal</hi> purposes. There is a little variety in the <hi>spear,</hi> as broader and narrower leaved, and also <hi>variegated</hi> sorts, white and yellow, but these are considered only as ornamental.</p>
                  <p>Mint is propagated by pieces of its roots, or rooted slips, in the spring, set an inch or two deep, and eight asunder, on beds four feet wide. Cuttings will quickly strike root in any of the summer months. It delights
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:035770_0271_1006BDAD0AC7AC90"/>
in a moist soil, and new plantations of it (particularly cuttings) should be well watered in a dry time. Mint is to be had young all winter, and early in spring, by means of a gentle <hi>hot bed,</hi> on which it should be set pretty close. Or it may be conveniently planted in <hi>pots,</hi> and placed in any bed, and so shifted from one to another, if occasion. Cut mint for drying just as it gets in flower, spread it in the shade, and do not let this, or other herbs, be <hi>badly</hi> dried, or preserved, as is too common a case. For <hi>present</hi> use, mint should be <hi>properly</hi> gathered, using only the <hi>young</hi> leaves and shoots.</p>
                  <p>MUSTARD is much used as a sallad herb, gathered quite young, and the <hi>white</hi> is the garden sort, the <hi>black</hi> being cultivated in fields, for its seeds to make <hi>flour</hi> of. It is managed as <hi>cress,</hi> which see.</p>
                  <p>NASTURTIAM, there is a greater and less sort of, both cultivated for their unripe berries to <hi>pickle,</hi> their flowers for <hi>sallad,</hi> and <hi>garnish,</hi> and as a garden <hi>orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but the large is chiefly cultivated for culinary purposes. Being <hi>climbers</hi> they should have something to lay hold of as an arbour, or brush wood. They are of free growth, and flower abundantly for a long time, even till the frost comes. Sow an inch deep, in drills, in a light soil, and warm situation, in <hi>April,</hi> or sooner, if on a gentle heat, to forward them. It is best to sow in a few small <hi>pots,</hi> holding each two plants, from which they may be turned out whole (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they get too big) in <hi>May;</hi> though sometimes they transplant without earth, about the roots, very well. Give them plenty of air while under cover, or they will be drawn up weak. A fresh, but poor, soil, is better than a rich one, which would make them too rampant, and less fruitful.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>double nasturtium</hi> is considered merely as a fine flower, but they are a beautiful <hi>garnish.</hi> It grows from cuttings: Plant these in pots, in <hi>June,</hi> and place them on a little heat, and they will soon take root. Or if
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:035770_0272_1006BDA3D4A91FA0"/>
the pots are plunged in a warm border, and covered <hi>close</hi> with a <hi>hand-glass,</hi> it may be sufficient. Gently water them, when the mould gets quite dry. This plant is <hi>tender,</hi> and will hardly survive the winter in a good green house, but must be put in a stove. In open ground, however, it flourishes all summer, flowering most in a poor soil.</p>
                  <p>PARSLEY we have a <hi>plain</hi> and a <hi>curled</hi> kind of; and though the former is mostly used, yet the latter is equally proper as a <hi>pot herb,</hi> and is much admired for its leaves as a <hi>garnish.</hi> This sort cannot be mistaken for <hi>hemlock,</hi> as the plain sometimes has been. There is more essence in an equal quantity of the plain, than of the curled; but it is only using rather more of the latter, which if not suffered to seed, will stand three years. To produce the <hi>curled</hi> sort very fine, the plants should be thinned to three or four inches asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and it may be sown either at broad cast, or in drills, about nine inches asunder, as the common sort is. Parsley may be sown <hi>early</hi> in autumn, to have it young for the winter and spring; but the usual time is <hi>early</hi> in spring, and one sowing may be sufficient for the year, cutting it down often enough to get rid of the old, and young will spring up. Cutting down parsley should never be omitted in <hi>autumn,</hi> that it may be had good through the winter and spring. This herb will bear transplanting. For <hi>Hamburgh parsley,</hi> see <hi>parsley</hi> in the last section.</p>
                  <p>PENNY-ROYAL is a <hi>pot</hi> and <hi>medicinal</hi> herb of the mint species. There is an upright and a trailing sort of it; but the latter is that chiefly used: This is prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated by rooted branches, of which it affords plenty, as it spreads fast; and it will grow in the summer months from slips, or cuttings. Set them a foot asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in <hi>spring</hi> or <hi>autumn,</hi> and in a strong moist soil, it will most flourish. If, however, it is suffered to mat thick, it is apt to rot. As this herb is often wanted in winter, let it have somewhat sheltered situation: it is
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:035770_0273_1006BD9D38B17938"/>
aptly enough called by some <hi>pudding-grass.</hi> If cut for preserving in winter, the time of flowering must be observed, and it must be very carefully dried, as it is apt to mould.</p>
                  <p>PURSLAIN is a low growing succulent herb, of a cold and tender nature, used chiefly in summer <hi>sallads,</hi> but sometimes for culinary purposes. The sorts are the <hi>green</hi> and <hi>golden,</hi> but the former is preferred. It will not succeed in the open ground till <hi>May,</hi> and then it must have a warm border. In <hi>March,</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> it is sown on a gentle heat; for which purpose the lining of a hot bed may do. Cover the seed in <hi>drills,</hi> four inches apart, cover a quarter of an inch, and let the soil be light and <hi>rich.</hi> In dry weather, water it twice or thrice a week. The end of the young shoots only are used, and when cut down it springs again. It is usual to sow it three or four times in the summer, in cooler places, as the weather gets dry and hot.</p>
                  <p>RAPE, or <hi>coleseed,</hi> is sown for a <hi>sallad</hi> herb, to be eat while in the seed leaf, with mustard the cress; and is to be treated as they are; it is stomachic, and some persons are fond of it when boiled.</p>
                  <p>RAMPION is a <hi>sallad root,</hi> in but little request. Sow it thin in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and leave the plants at four or five inches distance, for autumn and winter use: Draw it young.</p>
                  <p>ROCAMBOLE is a root much like <hi>garlick,</hi> producing small bulbs at head, as well as root; is chiefly <hi>medicinal.</hi> The cloves may be planted in autumn or spring, two inches deep, and four asunder. In <hi>June</hi> tie the leaves in knots, to prevent their spindling for seed, and to swell their bulbs. When the leaf decays, take them up, and preserve them dry. It is sometimes used as a mild substitute for garlick.</p>
                  <p>ROSEMARY we have the varieties, as <hi>plain, silver,</hi> and <hi>gold</hi> striped. The plain is a useful <hi>medicinal</hi> herb, which should be found in every garden. It is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by suckers, layers, slips or cuttings, in the <hi>spring,</hi>
                     <pb n="262" facs="unknown:035770_0274_1006BD9B71C5ED98"/>
setting the two last where they have not much sun; and when rooted, towards autumn, or in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spring, allot the young plants a station rather warm, and sheltered, as rosemary is apt to suffer, or die, in severe winters, especially the variegated.</p>
                  <p>RUE is a <hi>medicinal</hi> plant, propagated in spring, by seed, slips, or cuttings. It stands many years, but should be prevented seeding, and pruned down occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally, to keep it in a neat bushy trim, of moderate height, and strong growth.</p>
                  <p>SAGE there are several sorts of, but the common <hi>red</hi> is that used chiefly for <hi>culinary</hi> purposes, and the green both for these, and <hi>medicinally</hi> for tea, &amp;c. There is a narrow leaved green sort, called <hi>tea</hi> sage, or <hi>sage of virtue;</hi> but the broad leaved green is reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by some to be better, not being so heating, and unpleasant to the taste. The <hi>variegated</hi> sorts of sage are only considered as ornaments in the flower garden or shrubbery. Sage is propagated by slips or cuttings of the last year's shoots, in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> chusing those that are short and strong; or of the young shoots in the early part of summer, set in to an inch from the top, and about four inches distance, in some shady place. These, if they spindle tall in the summer, should be pinched down to about three inches, in order to form bushy heads. They will be well rooted in <hi>August,</hi> when they should be planted a foot asunder, in a sunny and sheltered situation, from the N. and E. that they may stand severe winters, which they will the better do, if the soil is rather poor than rich.</p>
                  <p>SAMPHIRE is by some greatly esteemed for a <hi>pickle,</hi> using its leaves, which are sometimes added to <hi>sallads,</hi> and occasionally used <hi>medicinally.</hi> It is perennial, and propagated by parting its roots, or by seed sown in <hi>spring.</hi> It likes a cool situation, but yet prefers a sandy, or a gravelly soil: Let it have plenty of water. Some have found it to do best in <hi>pots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

SAVORY, we have a summer and winter kind of; the former is <hi>annual,</hi> and the latter <hi>perennial;</hi> and both are used as <hi>medicinal</hi> and <hi>culinary</hi> herbs, but the summer sort is that mostly cultivated for medicine. The <hi>annual</hi> is propagated from seed in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> sown thin and shallow, in drills, eight or nine inches asunder. The <hi>perennial</hi> is sometimes propagated from seed, but more usually from rooted slips, or cuttings from the top, in spring, as also from side slips. The <hi>annual</hi> sort should grow at six inches distance in the drills, and the <hi>perennial</hi> be allowed a foot. <hi>Summer</hi> savory, gathered for drying, is best drawn up by the roots.</p>
                  <p>SMALLAGE is a sort of wild parsley, found in moist places, and was formerly much cultivated in gardens, and used in <hi>soups</hi> and <hi>sallads,</hi> and <hi>medicine,</hi> as a warm herb. Sow it in spring as parsley.</p>
                  <p>SCURVY GRASS (the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or round leaved) is sometimes cultivated in gardens, for its excellent <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal</hi> properties. Sow it in <hi>autumn,</hi> or <hi>spring,</hi> but best early in the former. Though it will grow in any soil, it should have a moist one.</p>
                  <p>SORREL is an acid, perennial plant, much relished by some as a <hi>sallad,</hi> often used as a <hi>pot herb,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as a <hi>medicinal</hi> one: Though found common enough in the fields, it is much improved by garden culture. The <hi>round</hi> leaved sort, commonly called the <hi>Roman,</hi> is reckoned the more grateful acid, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases in the ground apace. Sorrel is generally prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated by parting is roots, either in <hi>spring</hi> or <hi>autumn,</hi> and if propagated from seed, (which produces the finest plants) it should be sown in <hi>March.</hi> The plants of the common sorrel should be six or eight inches asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the other a foot, or fifteen inches. Sorrel likes a cool moist soil, but the round a dry one.</p>
                  <p>SUCCORY, see <hi>endive,</hi> in the last section.</p>
                  <p>TANSEY is a <hi>culinary</hi> and <hi>medicinal</hi> herb, of which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esides the common, there are curled leaved, and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated sorts; but the former only is proper to be used
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:035770_0276_1006BEE7D89A33D8"/>
medicinally. It is perennial, and propagated by rooted slips, in spring or autumn, set at eighteen inches dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in beds, four feet and a half wide; and will grow in any soil, or situation.</p>
                  <p>TARRAGON is a perennial <hi>pot</hi> and <hi>sallad</hi> herb, which was formerly much admired for its peculiar high warm flavour. It is propagated sometimes from seed, but mostly by rooted, or other slips, set in <hi>spring</hi> or <hi>autumn,</hi> at six or eight inches distance, and may be by cuttings in the summer months. The shoots die down towards winter, but the roots are hardy, and increase apace. If wanted in winter, it may be dried as other herbs are, or forced as mint, in order to have it green. When the stems begin to run, cut them down, in order to produce young shoots, for the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tops only are to be used; and that not too freely, as it is an herb that heats much.</p>
                  <p>THYME is a <hi>pot herb,</hi> of which there are commonly cultivated a <hi>broad,</hi> and a <hi>narrow</hi> leaved sort, but the former mostly. There is a sort called <hi>lemon,</hi> thyme, that is admired for its flavour, and another called <hi>silver</hi> thyme, which, with the <hi>striped,</hi> are considered rather as an herb merely ornamental. It is best to raise the common sorts from <hi>seed,</hi> though root branches, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their trailing nature, may be usually had from old plants. Slips will grow, if set in a light rich soil, in a shady situation. Loosening the earth under, and drawing it up about old plants one year, will produce plenty of rooted branches the next. The plants should grow at six or eight inches distance. If propagated from <hi>seed,</hi> let it be sown thin in <hi>March,</hi> and covered lightly. Slips are best made in <hi>April.</hi> This herb makes a neat <hi>edging</hi> when planted close, but it is a great impoverisher of the ground.</p>
                  <p>TOMATUM, or <hi>love apples,</hi> we have <hi>red, white,</hi> and <hi>yellow</hi> fruited; and of the red and yellow, a <hi>cherry-shaped</hi> sort. The first, or larger <hi>red,</hi> is that commonly cultivated, and it serves for an <hi>ornament</hi> in the garden,
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:035770_0277_1006BD5855923780"/>
as well as of use for the <hi>table,</hi> in a pickle made of the green fruit, and when red in soups, &amp;c. It is also sometimes pickled when red, (i. e. ripe.) At the end of <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of <hi>April,</hi> it must be sown in a moderate hot bed; and being soon thinned, let the plants grow two or three inches high, and be pricked in small pots, to turn into the cold ground towards the end of <hi>May;</hi> or if not long and weak, keep them under cover a little longer. Give them a <hi>sunny</hi> situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against a wall, for regular and timely <hi>training,</hi> or support them by slicks. They take up much room, and it rows should be three yards asunder. If planted out upon holes of hot dung, it would help their speedy rooting, and forward them much for ripening their fruit, which in bad seasons they sometimes fail in. They require much <hi>water</hi> in dry weather.</p>
                  <p>WORMWOOD is a useful <hi>medicinal</hi> herb; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as it is in many places, in others it is not to be met with wild. Besides the common, there is <hi>Roman</hi> wormwood, both efficacious; some preferring the one, some the other. They are commonly raised from <hi>slips</hi> and <hi>cuttings,</hi> in any of the <hi>summer</hi> months, or from seed sowm in <hi>spring.</hi>

                  <head>OF FRUITS.</head>
                  <p>THERE is a variety (and of some a great one) of each kind of fruit, and the difference of tastes makes it impossible to pronounce upon their particular merits. A sort that is deemed bad by one, may be thought good by another; and thus <hi>nurseruymen</hi> go on to propagate fruit that are generally esteemed bad, because sometimes called for. With respect to fruit, there are <hi>provinical</hi> prejudices in favour of some, and of apples in particular; so that in one country, a sort shall be generally known and admired, and in another, not be heard of.</p>
                  <p>In assisting the <hi>young gardener</hi> in his <hi>choice</hi> of the principal fruits, only a few sorts will therefore be named; such as have obtained almost an universal credit. It would be well if the number of some kinds were reduced; for their multiplicity occasions a great uncertainly, and their shades of distinction are hardly discovered by the best judges: The <hi>nursermens'</hi> cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues will furnish larger lists.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>same</hi> sort of fruit there is often a perceptable difference, owing either jointly or separately to the stock, state of the tree, soil, situation, management and season. Bad planting, by cramping the roots, &amp;c. will often induce sickliness, and of course a good plant made to produce small, ill flavoured fruit, and thus it will appear to be not itself. So that when the <hi>best</hi> method is taken to procure good fruit, (i. e. such that please us) which is by graffing, or inoculating from
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:035770_0279_1006BD638773B700"/>
the <hi>very</hi> tree we have admired the fruit of, our expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may, in a measure, be disappointed by a variety of circumstances.</p>
                  <p>NURSERYMEN, it is often said, are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, for if they have not the sort you want, they will send you one they have; and this may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be the case, as they may think it of little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence if you have one that is good. But the case is, there is a great confusion in the names of fruit, by accident, ignorance, carelessness, &amp;c. New titles have been arbitrarily imposed on old fruits that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to vary a little; and distinctions made without a difference, of which circumstance Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in his day, saying, "The discriminating the several kinds of fruit, by their <hi>characteristical</hi> notes, from the leaf, taste, colour, and other distinguishing properties, is much wanting." But as Mr. <hi>E.</hi> observes, the ability for this, is only attained by long and critical observation. In order to <hi>settle</hi> this business, Mr. <hi>Miller</hi> announced, (1733) that a society of gardeners were preparing descriptions of each sort of fruit tree, with plates coloured from Nature, which containing all the specific differences of the manner of the wood, in shooting, and leafing, &amp;c. with the appearance of the flowers and fruit, as to size, shape and shades of colour, would, no doubt, have been a valuable work. Dr. <hi>Hill</hi> (in his <hi>Eden,</hi> folio) professes to have given great assistance in this matter. "Under the section of <hi>fruits</hi> (says he) we shall give their proper names and descriptions, by which every one will know by what names to call those he fees."</p>
                  <p>Disappointment frequently originates with the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser,</hi> who having met with a fruit to his mind, inquires the name, and is told a wrong one, and that, perhaps, of a bad sort; the nurserymen then complying with his order, is blamed. A reduction of the number of sorts, to those in which there is an evident difference, and more care on the part of those who raise, and
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:035770_0280_1006BD6C83EC2A68"/>
those who buy trees, in all respects; and particularly that of preserving the true <hi>name</hi> seems necessary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the affair of fruit trees.</p>
                  <p>On this subject, it may be observed, that the fruit of even the <hi>same tree</hi> is not always alike, owing to the <hi>season,</hi> as that growing in a cold, wet, and shady sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, will be inferior to the production of a fair and sunny one; though <hi>very</hi> hot and dry weather does not suit, and will make a difference in another way.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>choice</hi> of fruit trees should be somewhat govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by soil and situation; (which has been observed) for that fruit which succeeds in one, will not in another. Later fruit may be planted in light soils than in strong ones. Some sorts grow finest in a cool, others in a warm soil, and some situations are too bleak, either for early or late fruit, though the aspect, and all other circumstances may be good. In <hi>planting</hi> fruit trees, particularly those of the wall, much <hi>discretion</hi> is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that disappointment may (if possible) be avoided.</p>
                  <p>As fruit trees are so readily <hi>purchased,</hi> few people care to <hi>raise</hi> them; but those who may be disposed this way, will find instructions in the sections <hi>nursery</hi> and <hi>graffing.</hi> The purchaser must attend carefully to the <hi>planting,</hi> for which work directions have been given in the sections of the <hi>formation</hi> of a garden, and that on <hi>planting.</hi> For the <hi>training</hi> and <hi>pruning</hi> of fruit trees, ample rules are laid down in the section <hi>On pruning;</hi> so that nothing need be said of their <hi>cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> here, making proper <hi>references.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>APPLES, as the most <hi>useful</hi> fruit, it will be proper to provide as many of as there may possibly be found due room and occasion for; taking all care to procure <hi>good</hi> sorts of the two kinds, for eating <hi>raw,</hi> and <hi>dressed;</hi> and to have a proper <hi>assortment</hi> of the summer, autumn, and winter fruits.</p>
                  <p>For the first season, <hi>jenneting, common codlin, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet apple,</hi> and <hi>summer pearmain.</hi> Second, <hi>Golden pippin, Holland pippin, golden rennet, white calville,</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="unknown:035770_0281_1006BD6E29030DD0"/>
and <hi>Kentish codlin.</hi> Third, <hi>Nonpareil, golden russel, Wheeler's russet, winter pearmain, Kentish pippin, rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone pippin, margille, Norfolk beefing, and the John apple.</hi> There are, no doubt, other apples very good; but, perhaps, these have as much merit as any. With respect to <hi>raising, planting, pruning,</hi> &amp;c. see pages 31, 36, 37, 71, 74, 86, 105, 161, 165.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>gathering</hi> of apples, and other fruit from stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, is often badly performed, damaging the branches, and breaking the spurs off; let this business, therefore, be properly attended to, particularly in young trees of good sorts. Take care not to pinch, or bruise, fruit in gathering.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>keeping</hi> of apples, those which continue long for use, should be suffered to hang late, even to <hi>November,</hi> if the frosts will permit, for they must be well ripened, or they will shrink. Lay them on heaps till they have <hi>sweated</hi> a few days, when they must be wiped dry. Let them then lay singly for about a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and be again wiped, and immediately packed in boxes and hampers, lined with double or treble sheets of paper. Place them gently in, and cover close, so as to keep <hi>air</hi> out as much as possible. Preserve them from <hi>frost</hi> through the winter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fruiterers</hi> in London preserve their apples in stiff upright baskets, that hold about two bushels; laying very dry straw over all, and thickly in severe weather.</p>
                  <p>Some of the <hi>choicest</hi> table sorts of apples may be treated as directed for the best pears.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>baking</hi> apples need not be packed, but either kept singly on the floor, or shelves, or in heaps covered over, when they have sweated a few days longer than the others, and have been wined dry; yet these, if packed, will certainly stand a better chance of keeping the longer.</p>
                  <p>APRICOT is a fruit something between a plum and a peach, partaking of a middle nature, both in growth and taste.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="270" facs="unknown:035770_0282_1006BD75A3742048"/>
The <hi>early masculine, Brussels, orange, Turkey, Breda,</hi> and <hi>Moor-park</hi> or <hi>Anson,</hi> are the common and best wall sorts; but the <hi>Turkey</hi> and the <hi>Moor-park,</hi> though excellent fruits, are idle uncertain bearers. The <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Breda</hi> (a modern fruit) is said to be excellent; ripe in <hi>September.</hi>

                  <p>BERBERRY is a pretty fruit, useful as a <hi>preserve</hi> and <hi>garnish;</hi> a handsome shrub, which makes a profitable, and also useful hedge, for by reason of its thorns it is almost impregnable.</p>
                  <p>Besides the common <hi>red,</hi> there is a <hi>stoneless</hi> red, a <hi>white</hi> and a <hi>black</hi> fruited kind. Of <hi>raising</hi> this shrub, &amp;c. see pages 77, 170.</p>
                  <p>CORNEL; i. e. <hi>Cornelian cherry.</hi> The fruit used to be by many <hi>preserved</hi> to make tarts, and a <hi>medicinal</hi> preparation was also made of it, called <hi>rob de cornis.</hi> See <hi>cherry</hi> in list of shrubs.</p>
                  <p>CHERRY: The sorts may be the <hi>early May, May-duke,</hi>(ripe in <hi>June</hi>) <hi>white, red,</hi> and <hi>black heart, bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, heart, Turkey, tradescants,</hi> and <hi>morella.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>gathering</hi> cherries take care not to pull the fruit spur off, which is a very common thing. If they are <hi>properly</hi> ripe, they will part so easy from the tree, as not to do this mischief. See pages 31, 37, 86, 92, 105, 162, 165, 168.</p>
                  <p>CHESNUT is not a garden fruit, but the manured, or <hi>Spanish</hi> sort, in an open situation, produces good nuts about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and may be kept good all winter, if covered close from the air. See page 76.</p>
                  <p>CURRANT, we have in common cultivation, a small <hi>red</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> with a larger of each, called <hi>Dutch</hi> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, the <hi>champaigne,</hi> or pale red sort, and the <hi>black.</hi>
                     <pb n="271" facs="unknown:035770_0283_1006BD77CDBC7EA8"/>
There are currant trees with variegated leaves, and a sort with a gooseberry leaf. See pages 31, 32, 38, 77, 109, 164, 168.</p>
                  <p>FIG is a fruit "esteemed by all delicate palates amongst the richest sorts of fruits; though few vulgar tastes care for it." The sorts that are mostly planted without doors in <hi>England,</hi> are the <hi>common large blue, early dwarf blue, early dwarf white,</hi> and <hi>large white.</hi> The first kind is the hardiest, though <hi>they</hi> do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ripen well with us abroad. See pages, 30, 75, 105, 108, 156, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>FILBERD, we have a <hi>white</hi> and <hi>red</hi> sort of, and the latter judged most agreeable in flavour. The <hi>nuts</hi> are the <hi>Spanish, cob,</hi> and <hi>hazel.</hi> The first is a large nut with a thin shell, and the second is a large one with a thick shell, but both are good. See pages 37, 72, 77, 163.</p>
                  <p>GOOSEBERRY, there are many sorts of, arising from their propagation by seed, differing in their time of coming in, size, colour, &amp;c. The large sorts of gooseberries (weighing from ten to fifteen penny-weights) have been much run upon, yet there are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mall ones better tasted. The <hi>names</hi> at least of the sorts are numerous, (above 200) but those that have been long commonly cultivated are, the <hi>early black, small early red, smooth green, hairy green, common and large white, hairy and smooth red, ironmonger, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne, yellow, amber,</hi> and <hi>tawney.</hi> See pages 31, 32, 38, 77, 109, 164, 168.</p>
                  <p>GRAPE. The <hi>vine</hi> should never be planted, but in a very warm situation, free of all shade, from the rising to the setting sun, or at least nearly so.</p>
                  <p>The only <hi>sorts</hi> likely to fruit well in open culture, are the <hi>black July, white</hi> and <hi>black sweet water, black, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uscadine,</hi> and <hi>black claster.</hi> When grapes are ripe, they are transparent. See pages 31, 76, 105, to 108, 452, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="272" facs="unknown:035770_0284_1006BD7B74365D10"/>
MEDLAR, there is an apple, and pear shaped sort of, but this fruit is little cultivated, less liked, and not good till rotten ripe. The sorts are the <hi>German,</hi> the <hi>Italian,</hi> and the <hi>English,</hi> or <hi>Nottingham medlar. Gather</hi> at the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> lay some on straw, and cover with straw; and others (to forward their ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) put in a box, on a two inch layer of fresh <hi>bran,</hi> moistened well with soft warm water; then strew bran between them, and cover two inches thick, which moisten also, but not so wet as before: Proceed thus, layer upon layer; and a week, ten days, or a fortnight, will do the business.</p>
                  <p>The chief value of the <hi>medlar</hi> (as also of the <hi>service</hi>) is its late coming in for table use, when there is little other fruit to be had.</p>
                  <p>MULBERRY, there is a <hi>black,</hi> a <hi>white,</hi> and a <hi>red</hi> sort of; but the former is the one generally cultivated for fruit, being much the best. The <hi>white</hi> sort of mulberry is that cultivated for feeding <hi>silk worms.</hi> The <hi>red</hi> sort is the common mulberry of <hi>Virginia,</hi> hardy, and succeeds here.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>mulberry tree</hi> should have a <hi>grass plat</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it for the fruit to fall on, for those thus picked up will be superior to what may be gathered. See pages 32, 37, 75, 161.</p>
                  <p>NECTARINE is much like the <hi>peach</hi> in all respects, only that it is smaller, it has a smooth skin, and firmer flesh. The <hi>Newington, red Roman, temple,</hi> and <hi>murry,</hi> and good sorts, to which the curious, in a good situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may add the <hi>early nutmeg,</hi> and the late <hi>green</hi> or <hi>Peterborough</hi> nectarine.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>gathering</hi> nectarines and peaches, never <hi>pinch</hi> them to try whether they are ripe; for if they are so, the <hi>touch</hi> will discover it, and when thorough ripe (as they should be) they will come from the tree with ease. See pages 30, 31, 72, 92, 105, 108, 132, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

PEACH is a more useful fruit than the <hi>nectarine,</hi> being larger, more juicy, and succeeding better in general, as to bearing and ripening. There is a great variety of peaches under cultivation in <hi>England,</hi> but on the <hi>Continent</hi> the number is much greater. The following may be recommended: The <hi>early Ann, early Newington, early purple,</hi> the red and white <hi>Magdalens,</hi> the great and small <hi>mignens, noblesse, admirable,</hi> and old <hi>Newington.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Peaches cannot be too <hi>ripe,</hi>(see <hi>nectarine</hi>) so that those which <hi>drop</hi> are by many reckoned the best; and those whose flesh adheres to the stone (called <hi>pavies</hi>) are by some thought the more delicious. See pages 30, 72, 92, 105, 108, 132, to 152.</p>
                  <p>PEAR, there is a great variety of, and they are classed into <hi>summer autumn,</hi> and <hi>winter</hi> fruits. The <hi>summer</hi> sorts may be the <hi>green chissel, Catharine, Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonelle,</hi> and <hi>summer Bonchretian.</hi> The <hi>autumn, brown buerrè, swan's egg, bergamot,</hi> and <hi>dean</hi> pear, or St. <hi>Michael.</hi> The <hi>winter</hi> St. <hi>Germain, cresan, winter bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chretian, colmar,</hi> and <hi>chaumontelle.</hi> These all come in for eating regularly, the first in <hi>July,</hi> and the last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues on to <hi>June. Baking pears, Parkinson's warden,</hi> the <hi>union,</hi> or <hi>Uuedales</hi> St. <hi>German, cadillac</hi> and <hi>black pear</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> good to Midsummer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gather</hi> pears of the <hi>summer</hi> sorts rather before they are ripe, as when thoroughly so they eat meally, and will not keep well above a day or two; even when gathered as they ought to be, in a week, or less, they will begin to go at the core: They should not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, be gathered, while they require <hi>much</hi> force to pull them off. <hi>Autumn</hi> pears must also not be full ripe at the time of gathering, though they will keep longer than those of the summer. <hi>Winter</hi> pears, on the contrary, should hand as long on the trees as they may, so as to escape <hi>frost,</hi> which would make them flat in flavour, and not keep well. Generally they may hang to the middle of <hi>October</hi> on full <hi>standards,</hi>
                     <pb n="274" facs="unknown:035770_0286_1006BD8577DA2438"/>
a week longer on <hi>dwarfs,</hi> and to the end of the month on <hi>walls;</hi> but yet not after they <hi>are</hi> ripe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>art</hi> of gathering, is to give them a <hi>lift,</hi> so as to press away the stalk, and if ripe they <hi>readily</hi> part from the tree. Those that will not come off easy, should hang a little longer; for when they come hardly off, they will not be so sit to store, and the violence done at the foot stalk may injure the <hi>bud</hi> there formed for next year's fruit.</p>
                  <p>Let the pears be quite dry when pulled, and in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling avoid <hi>pinching</hi> the fruit, or in any way (in the least) bruising it, as those which are hurt, not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay themselves, but presently spread infection to those near them: When <hi>suspected</hi> to be bruised, let them be carefully kept from others, and used first. Gather in shallow baskets, and lay them in gently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>House</hi> pears in a dry airy room, at first thinly for a few days, and then put them in heaps to sweat; in order to which, a blanket thrown over them will help. The <hi>fermentation</hi> must be watched, and when it seems to have passed the height of sweating, wipe the fruit quite dry with fine flannel, or clean soft linen, and <hi>store</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>storing</hi> is thus: Those to be used first, lay be singly on shelves, or on the floor, in a dry southern room, on clean dry moss, or sweet dry straw, so as not to touch one another. Some, or all the rest, may be stored as directed for <hi>apples;</hi> for they will th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> keep very well, having first laid a fortnight singly, and then nicely culled. But the most superior way is, to pack in large earthen, or China <hi>jars,</hi> with very dry long moss at the bottom, sides, and also between them, if it might be. Press a coat of moss on the top, and then stop the mouth <hi>close</hi> with cork, or otherwise, which should be <hi>rosined</hi> over, with about a twentieth part of <hi>bees wax</hi> in it.

may be set on dry <hi>sand,</hi> which put also between, round, and over them, to a foot thick on the top. In all close storing, observe, there should be no doubt of the soundness of the fruit. Guard in time from <hi>frost</hi> those that lie open. Jars of fruit must be soon used after unsealing, as the <hi>air</hi> would presently affect it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards decay.</p>
                  <p>PLUM, of the many sorts the following are good: <hi>Green and blue gage, Fortheringham, white</hi> and <hi>blue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigon, drop d'or, la roche Corbon, la royal,</hi> and St. <hi>Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arine.</hi> The <hi>imperial,</hi> or <hi>red magnum bonum,</hi> and <hi>white magnum white,</hi> are chiefly used in tarts, and for sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, as is the <hi>Wentworth.</hi> The <hi>early white primor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> (not a choice fruit) is valuable for its coming in the beginning of <hi>July;</hi> and the <hi>imperatrice</hi> for not coming in till <hi>October.</hi> The <hi>bullace plum,</hi> black and white, are good for tarts, late in the season, and make a fine acid preserve. See pages, 31, 37, 75, 86, 92, 105, 163, 165.</p>
                  <p>QUINCE, we have the <hi>common apple,</hi> and <hi>pear shaped,</hi> and <hi>Portugal pear shaped.</hi> This fruit cannot be eat raw, but for <hi>marmalade,</hi> and baked in <hi>pies,</hi> &amp;c. the housewife finds it useful. The <hi>Portugal</hi> sort is mostly reckoned best. Quinces may hang till <hi>November.</hi> The ripe ones only are of value, which after sweating a few days, must be laid singly (at some distance from one another) on a shelf. See pages 37, 75, 105.</p>
                  <p>RASPBERRY, the kinds are <hi>red</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> and of each a <hi>twice</hi> bearing sort, i. e. producing fruit in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and autumn, Of the <hi>red</hi> there is a prickly wooded sort, and a smooth one, sometimes called the <hi>Cane,</hi> and <hi>reed</hi> raspberry; and a large sort, called the <hi>Antwerp,</hi> of a yellow white.</p>

SERVICE, or <hi>sob apple,</hi> is rarely cultivated here, as it requires a warmer climate than <hi>England</hi> to ripen its fruit; though, in fact, it never ripens on the tree. It is gathered late in autumn, in a very austere state, and laid by on straw to decay, when it becomes sweet and very agreeable in a month or six weeks. The trees are hardy, and the curious often plant them, for the singularity of their leaves and fruit. There are three sorts of the service, the <hi>wild,</hi> the <hi>pear,</hi> and the <hi>medlar,</hi> to which fruit they are very like.</p>
                  <p>STRAWBERRY: Of this fine flavoured fruit, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and fragrant, we have the following sorts: <hi>Red, white,</hi> and <hi>green wood,</hi> and <hi>red</hi> and <hi>white Alpine, scarlet, Carolina, hautboy, red</hi> and <hi>green pine-apple,</hi> and <hi>Chili,</hi> of sorts, with some seminal varieties, as several of the <hi>hautboy,</hi> and one in particular of the <hi>Carolina,</hi> called the <hi>pink-fleshed</hi> strawberry. There is also a strawberry with <hi>one leaf,</hi> a variety of the wood and prolific.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gather</hi> strawberries regularly as fast as they ripen, with a bit of their stalk, and never lay many together to press upon one another. The fresher the finer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WALNUT, there are several sorts of, as <hi>early</hi> and <hi>late, small</hi> and <hi>large, thick</hi> and <hi>thin shelled,</hi> &amp;c. Two only need be named, the <hi>early oval thin shelled,</hi> and the <hi>Common round,</hi> or <hi>royal walnut.</hi> All the others seem to be only seminal variations from the last, which is justly reckoned the best fruit. Those planted for <hi>fruit</hi> may have the tap root shortened, and be from seven to ten year's old first, as they seldom bear till about twenty years of age. See pages 77, 105.</p>

                  <p>FLOWERS, as to their cultivation, are classed into <hi>annuals, biennials</hi> and <hi>perennials. Annuals</hi> are those that are sown, flower and die, within a year. <hi>Biennials</hi> are those that are sown one year, and flower and die the next. <hi>Perennials</hi> are those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at do not flower the year they are sown, but the next, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to live years afterwards, some fewer, some more: Of this class there is a great variety, (perhaps fifty to one of the last) mostly fibrous rooted, some fleshy, some bulbous, and some tuberous, &amp;c. Most of the <hi>perennials</hi> are annual in their stalks, which die down to the ground in winter, and fresh shoots rise in the spring. But strictly speaking, all of each class are not <hi>annual, biennial,</hi> and <hi>perennial;</hi> for some of the <hi>annuals</hi> come a second, or a third year, as <hi>Chinese holyhock,</hi> and <hi>Indian pink,</hi> and others would live through the winter if housed. Of the <hi>biennials,</hi> the same may be said of the <hi>stock July flower, sweet William,</hi> and <hi>wall flower;</hi> only these plants do not always live, and will not come so neat and strong as before, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be sown, or propagated, as they are classed, in order to have a certain and fine blow. Of the <hi>peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials,</hi> some do not flower well above three or four years, as the <hi>holyhock,</hi> &amp;c. for which a sowing should of course take place the year before they are wanted. See pages 41, 42, 56, 57, 60, 65, 66, 67, 70, 113.</p>

                        <hi>Annual flowers</hi> are divided into three classes, i. e. <hi>tender, less tender,</hi> and <hi>hardy.</hi>

In the list, section 19th. the <hi>tender</hi> annuals are marked 1, the <hi>less tender</hi> 2, and the unmarked are <hi>hardy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this <hi>list</hi> of flowers might be added others, and some possibly that are pretty; but many of the annuals that have been introduced for variety's sake in large gardens, plantations, &amp;c. are weed-like, dull and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and perhaps a few among those here mentioned may not be sufficiently <hi>ornamental</hi> (as, for instance, the <hi>whites,</hi> where there are other colours of the same flower) to give general satisfaction; for a <hi>gay appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> is certainly the first object in the cultivation of flowers.

                     <p>Some <hi>flowers</hi> are both beautiful and fragrant; but many have only one of these properties to recommend them. Some are cultivated cheifly for the elegance of their <hi>leaf,</hi> as the <hi>ice plant, palma christi,</hi> and the <hi>curled mallow;</hi> and some that bear pretty and sweet flowers, are meanly furnished with leaves, as the <hi>yellow sultan.</hi> Others obtain a place in the garden, neither for frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or flower, or leaf: but merely for the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the <hi>fruit,</hi> or seed vessel, as the <hi>egg plant, snails, catterpillars, hedge hogs, horns,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>In the given <hi>list,</hi> some of the tender annuals may occasionally be considered as <hi>less tender;</hi> as <hi>Amaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus coxcomb,</hi> and <hi>tricolor, balsams, double,</hi> as well as <hi>single,</hi> and <hi>stramonium;</hi> only they will not be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and fine.

                        <p>ABOUT <hi>Mid-March</hi> is a general good time to sow the TENDER (and in short all) sorts, though the curious and skilful being well furnished with proper frames, &amp;c. may begin a month sooner; the end of <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of <hi>April</hi> is, however, not too late, and will better suit a <hi>young</hi> gardener than if he sowed earlier. In order to succeed in this business, there should be provided, fine dry and rich earth, good stable dung, frames, or roomy hand-glasses, and mats.</p>
                        <p>A moderately strong <hi>hot bed,</hi> for a one light, must be prepared, and the violent heat being certainly over, the seeds may either be sown thinly in <hi>drills,</hi> two or three inches asunder, on five or six inches of mould, or less on a weak bed. May sow also in <hi>pots,</hi> plunged to the rims. Cover the seeds from a quarter to half an inch, or more, according to their size. Some of them will appear in a few days, and others will lie a fortnight, or more, according to the circumstances of their <hi>nature, age,</hi> and the <hi>heat,</hi> or <hi>moisture,</hi> they meet with.</p>

The seeds may also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> sown in pots, and plunged at the back part of a <hi>cucumber</hi> or <hi>melon</hi> bed. A bed may be got ready to <hi>prick</hi> them into, or into pots placed in the like manner; and where only a <hi>few</hi> are cultivated, this method is advisable, (to save trouble) not begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too early.</p>
                        <p>Provide <hi>another bed</hi> by one month from the sowing, to prick the plants out in, having six inches depth of mould, place them five or six inches asunder, allotting those to the warmest part of the bed, which were longest coming up, and which are of course the weakest, as <hi>globes,</hi> &amp;c. Let the mould be warmed through before planting. There had better be too <hi>little,</hi> than too much heat; but if the bed gets cool, <hi>line</hi> it, or <hi>cover</hi> round with straw, as directed in the management of hot beds, page 179.</p>
                        <p>If not sown till the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> this second bed may possibly go through the business, with proper management to keep up its heat, and covering well on nights; but a <hi>third</hi> bed is commonly necessary, in order to succeed <hi>well,</hi> and bring the plants on forward and fine, which is necessary to the credit of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener. In this bed, it being covered over with four or five inches of mould, the plants should be in small pots, one in each, and plunged an inch deep, close to one another. As the bed gets cooler, the pots are to be earthed higher, till up to the rims in mould; but if planted without pots, the distance should be about nine inches asunder.</p>
                        <p>More <hi>water</hi> and <hi>air</hi> is necessary as the plants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in size; and every time they are shifted, let it be carefully, with some earth about their roots, though a warm bed will soon make them strike, if without mould. Let the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>itation. As these tender annuals do not rightly bear the full open air till <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer,</hi> give them resolutely as much of it as possible in the frames, (by degrees) even to taking off the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035770_0297_1006BF26C1DA9C00"/>
glasses in mild parts of the day. Keep up a heat in the third bed as long as can be, that the plants may continue in a growing state, and not stunted by bottom cold. To this end a <hi>fourth</hi> bed, for some of the sorts, as <hi>globes, coxcombs,</hi> &amp;c. would be a great advantage, as to size.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly necessary to hint that the <hi>beds</hi> must be larger, and <hi>frames</hi> deeper, every time the plants are shifted. As the first frame was a <hi>one</hi> light, let the second be a <hi>two</hi> light, and the third a <hi>three</hi> light, which may be raised upon bricks, or boarded round the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, as occasion may require. From the small <hi>pots,</hi> let them be transplanted into bigger in time, or (as soon as they can safely be) into warm borders, where if covered with hand-glasses, set on bricks for a while, it would secure them from unkind weather, till got a little hardened. In this changeable climate of <hi>England,</hi> there is hardly and knowing when tender plants may be exposed safely; yet <hi>too</hi> much housing and covering is to be avoided as much as possible. Many flowers will need <hi>support.</hi> See page 56. For the method of <hi>shifting</hi> plants from pots, as into bigger, or to the open ground. See page 190.</p>
                        <p>Some tender flowers in pots may be in the ground, to keep their roots cool, and for the sake of being conveniently covered; in which case, put a bit of tile below the pot to keep out worms.</p>
                        <p>Good <hi>seed</hi> from tender annuals will not be well had, but from <hi>February</hi> sown plants. Skilful gardeners, sowing early and having plenty of dung and <hi>drawing frames,</hi> produce surprising plants of the tender annual class, so that the <hi>globe amaranthus</hi> to three, and the giant <hi>coxcomb</hi> and <hi>tricolor</hi> from three to five or six feet high have been seen. Flowers designed to gather <hi>seed</hi> from, should begin to have some protection of glass about <hi>Mid-August,</hi> at least on nights, till they are fully ripened in <hi>September.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Scoop trowels</hi> of two or three sizes will be found very useful in the shifting of flowers in general, but particularly of the hot bed sort; and as they should be clean from dirt when used, so also should they by free from <hi>rust,</hi> by which they will work much pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anter, and more successfully: In short, <hi>all</hi> garden tools should be kept bright, as well for use as neatness. Before a trowel is used, in the removal of a plant, it is a proper, and safe way, to cut strait down round the root, and to the bottom, with a clean, and not very blunt knife; so will the trowel take all up whole, and the fibres will not be lacerated, or barked.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>small watering pot</hi> (i. e. from two to three quarts) with a <hi>finely</hi> pierced rose, is also necessary, to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment without bending down the plants, or harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the surface of the earth. The <hi>form</hi> of many a good flower is spoiled in its infancy by <hi>rough</hi> watering, and particularly <hi>capsicums;</hi> to avoid which evil, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever watering pot is used, it should be only half full.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>potting</hi> of plants is often carelessly, but ought to be most carefully performed, that as little check as possible may be felt by the roots. Fill the pot one half or two thirds full, (as the case may require) and then make a hole in the middle, adapted in form to receive the plant, with its <hi>ball</hi> of earth; and do it right at first, so as not to be too high, or too low, for once put in, it will not be safe to take it out again, left the mould drop from the roots. Do not press the ball of earth, (as some do) but only just fasten the loose mould that is put round it. If the soil is light, press that a little which is first put in at the bottom. If a plant that is to be potted be <hi>without</hi> would about its roots, raise a <hi>billock</hi> (at a proper height) in the middle of the pot, to lay the roots on and round. It must always be avoided planting in the pots <hi>too</hi> deep, because so much of the pot is lost as is above.

                           <hi>Annuals</hi> in <hi>pots</hi> will require water every day, in very hot weather, and in moderately so, every other; but those in the open ground will do twice as long (or more) without water being given them. Some sorts will need more water than others, as <hi>egg plants</hi> and <hi>balsams,</hi> than <hi>coxcombs</hi> and <hi>tricolors.</hi> This matter and a variety of others, will be learned by <hi>observation,</hi> without a good share of which, no one can possibly become a <hi>good gardener:</hi> The most exact directions will not take in every case, and rules will be of little avail, where the mind is not in diligent exercise.</p>
                        <p>In general, <hi>potted plants</hi> require <hi>water</hi> according to the weather, their situation as to the sun, the size of the pots, the fulness of the roots, the quantity of leaves, and the particular nature of their substance, as succu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or not: The smaller pots must have the most. The <hi>earth</hi> also in which plants grow makes a great difference, as some sorts of soil retain moisture much longer than others. It may be a <hi>question</hi> whether pots of <hi>annual</hi> flowers standing in <hi>pans,</hi> should have water constantly kept in them, or only watered (in due time) on the top, till it runs through: Both practices are followed by good gardeners; but the latter seems best, as keeping the young fibres at the bottom always sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den can hardly be right: With respect to <hi>perennials</hi> (except of an <hi>aquatic</hi> nature) it must be wrong. Let pots of flowers in the summer be placed pretty much in the <hi>Shade</hi> and <hi>shelter;</hi> but not by any means be under trees, or a roof. A situation where they have only the <hi>morning sun</hi> till eleven or twelve o'clock is the best; and some persons are so curious in this respect as to have <hi>awnings</hi> for the purpose, and temporary <hi>reed fences</hi> to keep off the wind, to which flowers (particularly of the tender kind) should not be wholly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035770_0300_1006BF312CFB6950"/>
exposed. <hi>Annuals,</hi> or even a few <hi>perennials,</hi> may be put in covered places, when nearly in full blow, for the sake of their ornament; but the latter should not be continued longer than while the prime show lasts.</p>
                        <p>It is <hi>advisable</hi> not to <hi>pot</hi> more plants than necessary, as they occasion much trouble, if properly managed; and after all, will not be so fine as those growing in the open ground. Some thing are too tender for open culture, and by potting they are conveniently protected by <hi>frames,</hi> or by <hi>housing,</hi> and sometimes simply plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the ground, close against a warm wall, in winter, where a little protection may be easily given them; others it may be desirable to pot, for the sake of moving them into particular place when in <hi>blow,</hi> and to have some ready to put into the ground, where others are gone off, so as to keep certain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite borders and walks always in glow; but do not have <hi>too</hi> much to do in this way.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>second</hi> sowing of <hi>tender</hi> annuals should take place two, three, or four weeks after the first, according as that was made, late or early; for their beauties are certainly desirable, as long as the season will permit us to behold them, and they are the <hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The LESS TENDER annuals should have a slight bed (about two feet thick) made for them at <hi>Mid-March,</hi> or a little after, being sown and managed as directed for the tender sorts, when they are one or two inches high, (according to their nature) they must be taken up with a scoop trowel, so as to keep a ball of earth about their roots, and either transplanted on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other bed, about one and a half foot thick of dung, or into the cold ground; the small kinds at four or five, and the larger at six or eight inches asunder, in a <hi>good</hi> well broke soil. Let them be immediately watered
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035770_0301_1006BF3AEDE6FA00"/>
and kept moist, and shaded from sun till well settled. Here they may grow till their leaves begin to meet, when they should be cut between their roots with a knife, and lifted up neatly with a scoop trowel, to be potted or planted where they are to flower: If this business is done <hi>well,</hi> they will receive but little check in their transplantation. <hi>Spindle</hi> rooted plants (as <hi>flocks</hi>) should be moved where they are to blow, as young as may be; but <hi>fibrous</hi> rooted ones may be shifted much older.</p>
                        <p>Plants will <hi>flag</hi> a little even when removed with a large ball of earth; but as most likely <hi>some</hi> of the sibres of the roots are either broke or cut, the effect is natural, as a plant is chiefly fed by the youngest and most <hi>extreme</hi> parts of the root. If possible, let all <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> transplanted flowers be <hi>shaded</hi> from sun, by garden pots, (raised a little) or otherwise, till they have struck fresh roots, which they will soon do; but uncover on nights. This will occasion some trouble; yet the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage attending it, makes it very advisable, and especially the plants moved with none, or very little mould about their roots.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>hot bed</hi> for these, as it is moderate, may be covered with hoops and mats, and do very well, or rather bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than frames and glass; for it often happens, that annuals are kept <hi>too</hi> close, by which they become weak, and get stunted when planted out in the free air, which is made (by over nursing) unnatural to them. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of <hi>April,</hi> almost any of them will come up under <hi>hand-glasses,</hi> on a warm border, in a light and rich soil; but they will blow late, and be not near so strong. The <hi>Chinese holyhock,</hi> though it will certainly come <hi>up</hi> well at this late sowing, will be hardly able to produce flowers before winter. Those flowers of this class, however, that have been mentioned as to be occasionally considered as hardy, may be thus treated for a <hi>second</hi> blow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="13" facs="unknown:035770_0302_1006BF3CABFC5870"/>
                           <hi>Other</hi> modes of cultivation are, that a few of the less tender sorts may be sown in pots, and placed (not plunged) in any hot bed that is in work for other things; but they must not be kept close, or hot, which would draw them up weak: This plan may do for them a little while, and a slight heat may be got ready to prick them out upon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Again,</hi> both this class of annuals, and the former, if not very early sown, do exceeding well, (or rather best) when on <hi>hot beds</hi> under <hi>hand-glasses,</hi> or <hi>paper lights,</hi> particularly <hi>balsams.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What was said of <hi>tender</hi> annuals apply here, as to <hi>air, water,</hi> and <hi>cover,</hi> but more freedom in the present case should be taken. If any are under <hi>mats,</hi> the cover must be removed on days, except the weather be bad; or it may be only turned back, and half off, to let the fun and light in from the <hi>south.</hi> Never let the <hi>seeds</hi> or <hi>plants</hi> of annuals really want <hi>water</hi> when the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is dry. See page 56.</p>
                        <p>The HARDY annuals have some little difference in their temperature. Though all may be sown from the middle to the end of <hi>March,</hi> as the best average season, some may generally with safety be sown at <hi>Mid-Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary,</hi> as <hi>candy tufts, cornbottles, larkspurs, hawkweed, lavatera, lobel's catchfly, lupines, dwarf lychnis, nigella, sweet peas, poppies, mulberry blight, oriental mallow, persicaria, sun-flower, annual snap dragon, Venus' look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glass,</hi> and <hi>navel wort, virginian,</hi> or <hi>annual stock,</hi> and <hi>winged peas,</hi> with some others.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>nature</hi> seems evidently to direct an <hi>autumn</hi> sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for <hi>many</hi> sorts which are then shed (some always, and others often) come up at spring, and these make the finest <hi>blow,</hi> and produce the best <hi>seed</hi> for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A number, (all the above sorts) therefore, might be scattered on the surface of the ground at random,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035770_0303_1006BF41ED6B6930"/>
not immediately as soon as ripe, but kept a <hi>little</hi> while to harden; but this is not a common practice, as gardeners like to have their borders spring dressed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they sow their annuals.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>spring</hi> sowing, the ground being deep dug, and <hi>well</hi> broke, make hollows (by drawing the mould aside) of from six to twelve inches diameter, or more, according to the size of the garden, as large ones should have the biggest patches. Sow thin, and cover ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the size of the seed, from a quarter to an inch. Take out mould enough to leave the patches somewhat hallow, which will serve to show where they are sown, and to receive the rain, or occasional watering. If the plants come up crowding, thin them soon, and leave a number suitable to their usual size of growth; as one only of the <hi>belvidere, cornbottle, persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caria,</hi> and <hi>sun-flower;</hi> two of the <hi>lavatera, oriental mallow, mulberry blight,</hi> &amp;c. three <hi>larkspurs;</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>A <hi>second,</hi> or even a <hi>third,</hi> sowing of hardy annuals may be made, at two or three weeks between, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the blow, especially of those that come early, and are soon off: <hi>May</hi> is not too late for the sowing of these. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>There are but a few of these, and the principal sorts will be found in the <hi>list</hi> of them, <hi>next section,</hi> where observations will be made on particular plants.</p>
                        <p>These are to be <hi>sown</hi> in drills, or in beds, at broad cast, the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of <hi>April,</hi> where they have only the morning sun, and the ground should be cool, or kept so by occasional watering: The beginning of <hi>May,</hi> however, is not too late.</p>

                           <hi>Thin</hi> the young plants on the seed beds a little, soon after they appear, to about an inch, and again to three or four inches asunder, and keep them well weeded. They may either thus remain till <hi>autumn,</hi> to be planted out where they are to blow; or if they grow too strong and crowding, let every other be drawn in <hi>summer,</hi> (chusing a moist time, if possible) and planted out wider into nursery beds for use in autumn, or the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing spring: The latter season will do for final planting, though the former is best, as the roots get established in the ground; when if moved in the spring they meet with a check. It is best to transplant with earth about their roots; but shorten all straggling fibres, and cut off dead and rambling leaves. In <hi>severe</hi> winters, those moved in <hi>autumn</hi> are sometimes killed, and therefore a few may be reserved to <hi>spring,</hi> in case of such an accident.</p>

                        <p>This class (as has been observed) is very numerous, and the plants are propagated, many of them by their <hi>roots,</hi> according to their nature, as fibrous, bulbous, &amp;c. some by <hi>layers, suckers, offsets, slips, cuttings,</hi> &amp;c. and very few by <hi>seed</hi> only; though all sorts (bearing seed) are occasionally propagated this way, for <hi>new varieties,</hi> or to produce <hi>finer</hi> plants, as those from seed generally prove, with respect to strength, symmetry, and flowers. It happens, however, when propagated from <hi>seed,</hi> that sometimes a better, but more frequently a less beautiful flower is produced of many sorts; and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the other modes of propagation are so much adopted, by offsets, &amp;c. as thus they come identically the same with the mother plant. Another obstacle against some sorts being <hi>sown</hi> is, that they are several years before they come to bear, as bulbous, and tube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rooted flowers.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> have made themselves famous by their patience and perseverance in raising bulbs and tubers, and sow every year some of each kind, which <hi>pays</hi> them well, when they meet with an eminently good flower. A new sort of <hi>anemone, auricula, carnation, ranunculus,</hi> and even a <hi>polyanthus</hi> will frequently fetch a guinea, and a <hi>tulip,</hi> or a <hi>hyacinth,</hi> sometimes ten.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>raise</hi> bulbous and tuberous rooted flowers, they should be sown in boxes (suppose three feet long, two wide, and six inches deep) of light rich earth, about the middle of <hi>August,</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> and setting them in a sunny sheltered place (not under cover) sow <hi>anemonies</hi> and <hi>ranunculuses</hi> a quarter of an inch deep; <hi>irises, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicums,</hi> and <hi>cyclamens,</hi> half an inch; and <hi>tulips, frit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

with some. Sowings may take place also in <hi>March,</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> removing the boxes in <hi>May,</hi> to where they may have only the morning sun. Thin them a little, if they come up thick, and when stalks die, put on half an inch of fine mould; and after the decay of the leaf next summer, they must be planted out in nursery beds, (latter end of <hi>August</hi>) two, or three inches asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (according to their nature) and some will blow the following year, as the <hi>anemone</hi> and <hi>ranunculus,</hi> &amp;c. though the <hi>hyacinth</hi> will be four or five, and the <hi>tulip</hi> seven or eight first. These must be removed from the first nursery bed to another, (as soon as their tops are decayed) and planted at six inches distance; and ever after treated as blowing plants. Keep them very clear of <hi>weeds,</hi> particularly the seed boxes, or borders. Protect the seedlings in severe weather from frost, or heavy rain, by mats and hoops. A reed hurdle, or something else, put up at the <hi>N. E.</hi> end, to break off the wind <hi>when</hi> it is harsh, will be proper.</p>

                           <hi>Fibrous</hi> rooted, &amp;c. <hi>perennials,</hi> if propagated from <hi>seed,</hi> are to be treated as <hi>biennials;</hi> but they are mostly increased (as observed) otherways, with less trouble, and <hi>chiefly</hi> by parting the roots in <hi>autumn</hi> and <hi>spring,</hi> or by rooted slips or offsets. Many of them have creeping roots, and increase so fast, that it is necessary to take them up every three or four years; and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of this sort is proper for most perennials, in order to greater neatness, and a superior cultivation; for though large tufts look handsome, they may be <hi>too</hi> bulky, and some kinds are apt to rot (as <hi>bachelor's but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>) when thick, the stalks and flowers come weak, and the leaves, toward the bottom, turn yellow.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>next section,</hi> is a list of the most common, ornamental, or curious <hi>perennial</hi> flowers, (easy of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation) having <hi>fibrous</hi> and <hi>fleshy</hi> roots, of which not all the sorts are named, but those only which seemed most worthy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035770_0307_1006BF53D8F16810"/>
Many <hi>perennial</hi> flowers have <hi>bulbous</hi> and <hi>tuberous</hi> roots, and their <hi>general culture</hi> is, to take them up <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually</hi> soon after they have flowered, when their leaves and stalks turn yellow and decay, then the root is at <hi>rest,</hi> and its fibres die. When first taken up, lay them covered in the ground for a few days, and then clean and harden them in the sun, (sparingly, if exceeding hot) when they must be stored in a <hi>dry</hi> place, till want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for damp is apt to rot them: Never put many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for this reason.</p>
                        <p>It is not <hi>absolutely</hi> necessary to take bulbs and tubers up every year, as every second or third may do; but it is the common practice, because it gives an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to remove the <hi>offsets</hi> for propagation, and the mother bulbs are thus strengthened, as also from the renewed soil they meet with by a fresh plantation. It is not uncommon for bulbous roots to be suffered to stand <hi>many</hi> years without taking up; but then they cramp and starve one another, and are apt to go off from their original beauty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bulbs</hi> and <hi>tubers</hi> may be either replanted immediately on being taken up, or kept out of ground for several months; i.e. during their natural periods of rest. <hi>Autumn</hi> flowering bulbs are to be taken up in <hi>May,</hi> if their leaves are decayed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Spring</hi> flowering bulbs should be replanted in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> or <hi>October;</hi> those of the <hi>summer</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> or <hi>November;</hi> and those of <hi>autumn</hi> in <hi>July,</hi> or <hi>August.</hi> A little before, or after, is not very material; only when they are put in too soon, they come so forward as to be liable to be damaged in severe winters, and springs; and when kept out of the ground too long, the bulbs spend themselves first in making roots. The <hi>scaly</hi> bulbs (as lilies) should not be kept out of the ground above six weeks, or two months. Those that flower in <hi>summer,</hi> may be put in the ground at different times, as early and late in <hi>autumn,</hi> and early in the new year, (not later than <hi>February</hi>) to obtain a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession

cession of blow. This is a common practice with the <hi>anemone</hi> and <hi>ranunculus;</hi> but when planted in <hi>winter,</hi> the soil should be a <hi>dry</hi> one, or made so, by digging in a good quantity of fine sea-coal ashes, and coarse, or drift sand; else they are apt to rot, if much wet falls, especially when followed by sharp frost. They may be protected from wet by mats, and from frost by peas haulm.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Offsets</hi> of bulbs, and weak tubers, must be planted a month before the full sized roots; and as they are not expected to flower the first year, should be disposed of in <hi>nursery</hi> beds, rather close, where they may grow a year, or two, according to their strength, as some will be this time, or longer, before they flower. Those taken from <hi>scaly</hi> bulbs, will not endure to be out of ground, and must therefore be planted almost immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. <hi>Bulbs</hi> taken up <hi>out of season,</hi> i. e. when they have remained so long in the ground as to have struck out fresh roots, should be removed with balls of earth; for though they may live without this care, they will be exceeding weak; it is therefore necessary exactly to observe the proper season for removal.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>soil</hi> that best suits bulbous and tuberous roots in general, is a sandy loam; but most of the sorts are not very nice. The ground for them should be well dug, two spades deep, that their fibres may shoot freely, their offsets swell easily, and wet be completely drained from them, when much of it fans. And this work should be done a week before planting, that the ground may settle. In a light soil, roots of the <hi>rununculus</hi> have been found to strike a yard deep, which may admonish, that in a clay bottom, it is proper to lay a body of stones there, (suppose at eighteen inches) that too much moisture may not be detained.</p>

inches, &amp;c. Some bulbs will come up even when a foot below the ground, as <hi>crown imperials,</hi> and <hi>crocuses,</hi> at six inches, or more; some persons have, therefore, planted them deeper than the above rule, in order to be able to stir the surface of the ground without dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging them.</p>
                        <p>The proper <hi>disposition</hi> of bulbous and tuberous roots, is either in <hi>beds</hi> (a trifle rounded) of from three to four feet and a half wide, for the <hi>curious</hi> sorts; or in <hi>patches</hi> of the smaller sorts, to form clusters of three, four, or five, agreeable to the room they require. There should be only one in a place (generally) of the white, or orange lily, crown imperial, and such like large bulbs.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>beds,</hi> the fancy sorts of bulbs, and tubers, may be set in rows, eight or nine inches asunder, and from five to seven inches in the rows, according to their size. The distance of four inches apart is, however, by some florists, thought sufficient for <hi>anemonies</hi> and <hi>ranunculuses;</hi> but certainly more were better, where a strong blow is a first object. <hi>Hyacinths</hi> should be planted at seven, or eight, though they are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at six inches. <hi>Tulips</hi> should be at eight, or nine.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>planted,</hi> if rain does not come in about four days, beds of bulbs and tubers should be watered, to set them growing, that they may not rot.</p>
                        <p>Though bulbs may be planted by a <hi>dibble,</hi> (taking care that the mould does not lay hollow about the roots) a better way is, to draw <hi>drills,</hi> and place them in, giving them a gentle pressure into the ground, and covering neatly up. A little free <hi>sand</hi> should be strewed along the bottom of the drills, under <hi>hyacinths, anemonies</hi> and <hi>rununculuses,</hi> if the soil is not quite a light one.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>best way</hi> of planting bulbs is, to draw the mould off the bed to a <hi>sufficient</hi> depth; then lay the surface perfectly level; give a watering; and when the top it a little dry, mark it out into proper sized
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035770_0310_1006BF623793F378"/>
squares; then place a bulb in the middle of each, and carefully cover up, so as not to throw them on their sides.</p>
                        <p>Those bulbs and tubers in <hi>beds,</hi> may conveniently be <hi>protected,</hi> when in flower, from rain and sun, by an <hi>awning,</hi> which will continue them in perfection of blow much longer than if always exposed. When these flowers, in beds, first break ground, if the weather is severe, they may have an <hi>awning</hi> of mats, or cloth, occasionally over them; or a little peas <hi>haulm,</hi> or wheat <hi>straw,</hi> laid thinly on, just to protect their tender state a little; this regards particularly <hi>nights,</hi> but on <hi>days</hi> a cover should not remain on in tolerable weather. But <hi>before</hi> the shoots appear above ground, valuable beds of these flowers should be sheltered from having much wet, (even all through winter) as moisture gives <hi>frost</hi> so great power.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Spring</hi> flowering bulbs may be brought forward by planting them in <hi>pots</hi> and <hi>water-glasses,</hi> and setting them in warm rooms, or hot beds; and thus, even in <hi>winter,</hi> we may have ornaments and sweets that court our admiration.

These should be potted in <hi>October,</hi> and have a light dry soil, occasionally giving water. Bulbs may be put in <hi>glasses</hi> at this time, and once a month after, to <hi>February</hi> for a succession. Let the bulb just touch the water, which should be soft, and replenished so often as to keep it up to the bottom of the bulbs. Let it be completely changed about once a week; and if a bit of <hi>nitre,</hi> the size of a pea, be put in each time, it will strengthen the blow.</p>
                        <p>Though bulbous flowers are <hi>propagated</hi> plentifully by <hi>root</hi> offsets, yet some are increased form little bulbs

formed on the sides or tops of the <hi>stalks,</hi> as the <hi>moly</hi> tribe, and the bulbiforous <hi>lily.</hi> These should be taken off in <hi>August,</hi> dried in the sun, and then planted in nursery beds as <hi>offsets.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Bulbs propagated from <hi>offsets,</hi> produce a flower ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like the parent; and <hi>varieties</hi> are only to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from <hi>seed,</hi> which never comes quite like the original.</p>
                        <p>Let <hi>seed</hi> be saved only from choice flowers, be thorough ripe, and being hardened a little in the sun, they may be sowed soon after, in pots or boxes, of good light earth. See page 16, vol. 2. Persons of leisure and curiosity, would do well to amuse themselves in this way, that we may not be so much indebted to <hi>foreigners,</hi> for a supply of new flowers of this class.</p>
                        <p>An <hi>observation</hi> may be here made, that the <hi>same</hi> bulb (as is often thought) does not always continue; for some are <hi>renewed every</hi> year, as the <hi>tulip;</hi> and others the second, third, &amp;c. So that when taken up to remove <hi>offsets,</hi> the principal bulb of the tulip, &amp;c. which is commonly esteemed the old one, is, in fact, a new formed one, though (perhaps) not less in size, and it may be bigger.</p>
                        <p>As many SHRUBS (i. e. woody plants) are propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in a view principally to their flowers, they will properly enough be considered a little here, as to their propagation. See section <hi>On Shrubs</hi> and <hi>Shrubberies.</hi>

Of the various methods of <hi>propagating</hi> trees and shrubs, that by <hi>seed</hi> is the best, where it can be adopted, (as has been observed) and the season is <hi>autumn</hi> or <hi>spring.</hi> If in <hi>autumn,</hi> it may be earlier, or later, as the seeds ripen; for soon after they are ripe is the most proper time to commit them to the earth, covering the smaller seeds from half to a full inch; and kernels, nuts, &amp;c. from two to three inches, according to their size. Any sort that is doubted to stand the winter in seed beds, may be sown in <hi>pots,</hi> or <hi>boxes,</hi> and housed in severe frosts. If in <hi>spring,</hi> (as it is a good rule to sow a little at <hi>both</hi> seasons, and some tender sorts <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> the latter) the seed must be <hi>carefully</hi> kept from damp and vermin, and put into the ground towards the end of <hi>February,</hi> or early in <hi>March.</hi> The seeds of some of the more delicate sorts will require to be sown, at this season, on a slight <hi>hot bed;</hi> and if a few of <hi>most</hi> of the sorts were thus treated, it would be a good method, the better to insure their germination, and to forward them. Let spring sown seeds be watered oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally, according to the weather, to keep them moist. The earth they are sown in should be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately light, dry and rich, and formed into beds of four feet wide, either in <hi>drills</hi> or at <hi>broad cast,</hi> first drawing earth off into the alleys, to cover with. See page 70, 72.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>American</hi> trees and shrubs do very well in this cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, but the young plants are generally tender, and should have some protection, one, two, or three years, till they get woody, and injured to the climate.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>graffing</hi> and <hi>budding,</hi> (as some shrubs are prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated this way) see the section <hi>On Graffing;</hi> and for the propagation by <hi>suckers, cuttings, layers,</hi> &amp;c. see section 5, page 85, to the end; about <hi>suckers,</hi> see also page 114. Those trees, or shrubs, from which <hi>cuttings</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> year's growth may be had in <hi>June,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> may be greatly helped to strike root, by covering them close with a <hi>hand-glass;</hi> (as directed concerning <hi>pinks</hi>) and if a glass were put over <hi>layers,</hi> which are difficult
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035770_0313_1006BF704B46E2F8"/>
to strike, it would help them. See <hi>observations</hi> on the <hi>arbutus,</hi> list 5, next section.</p>
                        <p>This mode of <hi>propagation</hi> is particularly adapted to some sorts of <hi>evergreen</hi> shrubs, which emit fibres more freely from the <hi>youngest</hi> wood. If year old wood is treated thus, the cuttings may be set early in spring; or glasses may be put over those put out in autumn. But spring cuttings, potted, and set on a slight hot bed, with hand-glasses, is the surest method to make diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult sorts strike root.</p>
                        <p>It may prove an <hi>observation</hi> of some use, that trees and shrubs raised from <hi>seed</hi> grow the largest, from <hi>layers</hi> generally prove less, and from <hi>cuttings</hi> the least. Where <hi>budding</hi> can be practised, it is preferable to <hi>graffing.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g> The names of the choicest sorts of fruit trees, will be found in section 17.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>modes of cultivation</hi> are here directed by the letters, as in last section; adding m. for <hi>moist,</hi> w. for <hi>wet,</hi> and d. for <hi>dry.</hi> Those not marked are to be understood as (pretty much) <hi>indifferent</hi> as to soil,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035770_0314_1006BF75E5F7D940"/>
and indeed those marked otherwise <hi>may</hi> grow in a contrary kind, and often do, though not so flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>time of flowering</hi> is annexed to those trees and shrubs that are <hi>thus</hi> at all ornamental, and the more <hi>ordinary heights</hi> they are found to attain are denoted in the <hi>arrangement;</hi> a circumstance hitherto much wanted, as useful and <hi>necessary</hi> to be known, in order to a right disposal of them. Those of a naturally low growth have been, sometimes, planted behind in <hi>shrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,</hi> &amp;c. and the taller forward; but yet this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate circumstance must be unavoidable to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced planter, who has no other guide, than that this is a <hi>tree,</hi> and that is a <hi>shrub,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>colours</hi> of the flowers are mentioned when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity permitted, as agreeable to be known, and of use in the disposal of them at planting, to diversify the scene properly.</p>
                  <p>Such <hi>observations,</hi> as may be thought most useful and necessary, will follow each <hi>list;</hi> but as neither <hi>all</hi> the sorts nor the <hi>varieties</hi> of each sort, could be enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated in such a work as this, so also the <hi>minutioe</hi> of propagation, &amp;c. is more than could be comprehended, or expected: Folio volumes (so copious is the subject) have left a variety of plants unnoticed, and much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said respecting cultivation. For <hi>ordinary</hi> use, a greater enumeration, or more enlarged particulars, would (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) have made the book <hi>less</hi> valuable. If the <hi>selection</hi> and information is good, (and pains have been taken in the business) those for whom this book is designed, will have no reason to complain.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>names</hi> of trees, shrubs and flowers, are in many cases various, as sometimes the scientific name pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, and at other times the trivial; and of neither is there a perfect agreement. The object therefore here has been to give <hi>that</hi> name by which each is supposed to be best known. Different plants are often called by the same name, and a nice discrimination is made
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035770_0315_1006BF790EF285D8"/>
by botanists, according to <hi>leaf</hi> and <hi>flower;</hi> but these are no farther noticed than necessary; and such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions are given of each, as cannot (it is hoped) fail to identify the sort, when applied for to a nursery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                  <p>In the following <hi>lists</hi> of <hi>trees,</hi> the larger are marked with an <hi>asterism;</hi> and in the <hi>lists</hi> of <hi>shrubs</hi> and <hi>flowers,</hi> discrimination of size is made by <hi>figures,</hi> each being divided into four sorts, as to height; and the lowest marked No. 1.

                  <p>Where <hi>et cetera</hi> (i. e. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is affixed to sorts, it means that there are others; and where it is added to the time of flowering, it signifies of more than one month's duration.

                           <hi>Ash,</hi> the American sorts do not grow near so large as the common English. For the <hi>ornamental</hi> ashes, see next list.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Beech</hi> was formerly much used for hedges about, and the divisions of, a garden, and it serves well for this purpose, as it bears the shears; but it must be regularly clipt twice a year, the latter end of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> or it will soon get out of order.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Birch</hi> is reckoned the worst of timber, yet the wood has its uses in several particular businesses. The <hi>American</hi> sorts grow much larger than the <hi>English.</hi> The tree is of that accommodating nature, that it will

grow in any soil or situation, wet or dry. It is well known, that a <hi>wine</hi> is made of its sap, by boring holes in full grown trees in spring, before the leaves come out; and from a number of trees a great deal may be collected. Without being unpleasant, (if properly made, <hi>birch</hi> wine is relished by many, and is reckoned very medicinal in scorbutic, and other complaints. For the whole process, see <hi>Family Herbal,</hi> octavo, by <hi>W. Meyrick,</hi> surgeon, a book worthy of notice. There is a method of catching the liquor, by putting into the holes (deeply bored) <hi>faucets of elder.</hi>

                           <hi>Elm,</hi> the wych, is the quickest grower, and will flourish in any soil; but the broad leaved is reckoned the best timber, and the small leaved the most orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, but it must have a good soil to flourish. The <hi>wych</hi> is easily raised from seed (sown after it is ripe) but the other sorts are propagated from suckers, or layers, or graffing on the <hi>wych.</hi> In order to obtain <hi>suckers,</hi> and shoots for layers, <hi>stools</hi> are to be formed by cutting down some young trees, almost close to the ground. Trees from layers are better than from suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Observe, that whatever is to be propagated by <hi>layers,</hi> or <hi>suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <hi>Hornbeam,</hi> the common sort will grow very large in some soils, but the <hi>Virginian</hi> (flowering yellow) will hardly reach thirty feet, and the <hi>hop</hi> not above twenty. All the hornbeams (the <hi>hop</hi> most) have been used much for clipt hedges, and partitions in gardens and pleasure grounds, but the <hi>oriental</hi> sort suits the purpose best, being naturally dwarfish. The <hi>hornbeam</hi> feathers down lower and thicker than any other tree, and the property of holding its decayed leaves on all winter, adapts it for a screen from winds.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035770_0318_1006BF84A7204BE0"/>
and then to form a head, topping the leading shoot for the purpose, which will occasion several branches to proceed from the upper eyes; and this is the way to form all sorts of trees to good heads.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Oak,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> produces the best wood, but the <hi>American</hi> sorts are the fastest growers, though they do not attain to the size of the <hi>English.</hi> A cool strong soil produces the handsomest trees, and toughest timber. Oaks should not be above three or four years old before they are planted, for the older they are, the more check they receive, and it is a tree that does not transplant well. Hence all the care should be taken that can be in the business. See <hi>section</hi> 10. But oaks succeed best without removal, having a <hi>tap,</hi> or downright root, which is frequently broke in taking up: <hi>All</hi> trees would probably thus come finer, if it was convenient. The consequence of preserving the tap has been sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; but it is certainly Nature's direction, for rather than give up the point, the tap of the oak will make its way downward, in a direct line, through the hardest soils. See page 80.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Poplar</hi> to propagate by cuttings, see <hi>alder;</hi> but younger and smaller cuttings for this tree do better, as those of one or two years old, and half a yard long: The black poplar does not succeed well by truncheons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Walnut,</hi> when planted for timber, should be young, and the tap root, if possible, preserved whole. The black Virginian grows more erect, but the other makes the largest tree, and best wood. The white Virginian is the <hi>heckery nut.</hi> All these make the best trees, when growing from seed without transplanting.</p>

                           <hi>Annona</hi> is of North America, but somewhat tender, and therefore should have a favourable situation. It must be raised on a hot bed in spring, and the seedlings potted and housed in winter for a year or two, but not nursed too much.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Buckthorn,</hi> if raised from seed, sow early in <hi>autumn,</hi> as soon as the berries can be procured, and perhaps some may come up the following spring, but most of them will lay another year. This is the case with various seeds.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Catalpa</hi> should grow singly, that it may have its natural wide spread, and, if possible, let it be on a plat of grass, where it will appear to great advantage. It is very hardy, but as it comes out late, it is advisable to give it a favourable aspect.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Magnolias</hi> are to be considered as rather tender, especially young plants. The glaucous leaved is of the lowest growth, (about ten feet) but all are elegantly ornamental with their white flowers: There is also a blue flowered one. Let them have a dry soil, as all tender plants should, as well as a warm situation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mountain ash</hi> produces its white flowers in <hi>May,</hi> but they are little ornamental. Its foliage, however, is
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035770_0321_1006BF9326D80BC8"/>
pretty, and its fruit of red berries is one of the greatest ornaments of autumn, coming very early, and hanging all winter, <hi>if</hi> the blackbird, &amp;c. will let them alone. As it deserves the most conspicuous situation, it will be proper to plant some near the house, and where birds are likely to be disturbed from too frequent visits.</p>

                           <hi>Pishamin</hi> or <hi>date plum,</hi> is chiefly cultivated here as of ornamental foliage, for its fruit is rarely relished; and, like the <hi>medlar</hi> and <hi>sorb,</hi> must be in a state of decay before it is eatable. If propagated from layers, it must be done in <hi>spring,</hi> and the following <hi>March</hi> (just as they begin to shoot) they may be transplanted. If raised from seed, sow it on a hot bed in spring, and house the young plants in pots the first winter: Allow this tree a dry soil.</p>

                           <hi>Pistachia,</hi> this is the hardiest of three sorts. Treat it as a tender plant, whilst young, for three or four years, and let it have finally a sheltered and dry situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tulip tree</hi> is tender whilst young, but afterwards very hardy; is uncertain in flowering, but handsome in its leaf and growth, and has been used to be planted singly on lawns, &amp;c. It is a native of <hi>Virginia,</hi> where it attains to so vast a size, as to be from twenty to thirty feet in girth, though here it keeps pace only with an ordinary elm.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Virburnham,</hi> though a way faring tree, (found by the road side) is very pretty, by its hoary leaves, and white flowers, succeeded by fruit in autumn, in bunches of red berries. The <hi>American</hi> sorts grow not near so high, but they rarely ripen their berries here.

                           <hi>Andromeda tree</hi> is tender, and must therefore have a situation accordingly. It is always a part of the green house furniture, but does well sometimes abroad.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Apple,</hi> these crabs produce rather slender wood, and therefore to have them strong and fruitful, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently beautiful) should not be in a crowded, or shady situation, but rather, as much as possible, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached single plants. The fruit of the three first makes superior <hi>tarts,</hi> and the latter an excellent <hi>preserve;</hi> and the fruit of all of them may be introduced in the <hi>desert,</hi>

when full ripe. Allow the <hi>double flowering</hi> apple, a good situation, to preserve its charming blow as long as possible.</p>

                           <hi>Azederach</hi> consider as tender; its foliage is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, flowers white, and fruit yellow.</p>

                           <hi>Cashiobury bush</hi> should have a sheltered situation, particularly the young plants, which should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected for two or three winters.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Kidney bean tree,</hi> (climbers) the two latter sorts are rather green house plants, but have done abroad.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Spindle tree</hi> (sometimes called <hi>prickwood</hi>) is very beautiful with its leaves in autumn, for which (as many other plants) it is chiefly considered as ornamental, its flowers making a poor appearance. The seed lies two years before it comes up.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Trumpet flower,</hi> sometimes called <hi>scarlet jasmine,</hi> is a trailing plant, and therefore requires training to a wall for support; or having something to climb on, it will proceed much in the way of an <hi>honeysuckle.</hi> It is rather tender, and must have a good situation; but when properly managed is a great beauty. Prune it to a few eyes, precisely upon the principle of a <hi>vine.</hi>

have a dry soil, kept cool by occasional watering, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in winter: It is a very beautiful upright shrub.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Candleberry myrtle</hi> is so called, from the Americans procuring a wax from the berries of this plant to make candles of. It is rather tender, yet likes (as many <hi>American</hi> plants do) a moist soil; let it be sheltered from bleak winds.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Clethra</hi> is an elegant shrub, flowering all summer and winter; it prefers a moist soil.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Colutea</hi> is too tender to abide severe winters, but in general will do, with a little attention: Its flowers are pretty, of a bright yellow. The other sorts (three) are more tender, and are to be potted for protection from frosts, by housing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cytisus,</hi> deciduous and evergreen, there is a variety of, and all very ornamental, with their yellow flowers. They are rather too tender for the open ground, and the hardier sorts here mentioned, must have a dry warm situation. <hi>Seedlings</hi> should be housed, or well protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad for the first winter, but not kept too close.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Germander tree</hi> treat as tender, for though it will live abroad, it is mostly a green house plant.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mallow tree</hi> manage as the <hi>cytisus,</hi> though it is not quite so tender. All <hi>seedlings</hi> that can be brought up in the open air, make much finer plants; and every thing of this sort, should be effected as much as possible. Of those plants considered as <hi>rather</hi> tender, some may be put out in nursery beds, and <hi>occasionally</hi> protected by covering, and some potted to be <hi>occasionally</hi> housed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Poison trees,</hi> even the touch of the leaves of these plants will affect the skin, but the sap is <hi>very</hi> (even dangerously) acrimonious.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pomegranate</hi> must have a good south wall, and rich soil. The double sort should be occasionally matted in <hi>severe</hi> frost. In <hi>very</hi> favourable situations (however) they have succeeded in <hi>espaliers,</hi> dwarf, half, and even full standards. The best season for planting the pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate is in spring, when just beginning to shoot. It
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035770_0329_1006BFBA4276D818"/>
is rather rude of growth, and must therefore have timely training. The principal pruning should always be in <hi>autumn,</hi> and from time to time all straggling, superfluous growths taken off, that shoots may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to put out strong blossoms, in the fulness of which the great merit consists. These bearers should be six inches, or rather more, asunder. The mode of flowering is at the ends of the young shoots; and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equals this plant in fineness of blow. The double sort is more commonly planted; but the single flower is very beautiful, and its fruit, which will ripen in snug favourable situations and seasons, makes a fine show also especially when burst. Both flowers and fruit are of a fine scarlet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rose</hi> claims precedence of other shrubs. In its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties it should be planted in all situations, but the <hi>Provence</hi> more particularly. This shrub, in most (if not all its sorts) does best in a cool strong soil.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>order</hi> of blowing may be thus: <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> (sometimes called the <hi>May-rose</hi>) <hi>monthly, damask, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, Scotch, Pennsylvanian, apple,</hi> &amp;c. Then the latest roses we have, are those of the <hi>monthly</hi> again, and the <hi>musk.</hi> Occasionally every sort may bear a few <hi>late</hi> ones, but chiefly the <hi>Provence.</hi> To encourage this shrub to <hi>treat</hi> us in the latter part of the year, pulling off the first roses, as soon as they begin to decay, is a means; but to pull off all the <hi>buds,</hi> at the usual time of blow, from a few trees, is a more certain method. A more sure way still is, to top the new shoots towards the end of <hi>May,</hi> or prune down to two or three eyes; All these manoeuvies should be particularly exercised on the <hi>monthly</hi> sorts. Transplanting roses in spring, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> a means to effect a middle blow; and if not a north border, and cool ground, this may be done late in <hi>April,</hi> or even in <hi>May,</hi> (occasionally watering) prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the same time short. <hi>Early</hi> roses are obtained by being trained against a south wall. The <hi>monthly</hi> thus planted, and having glass (as the light of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber frame) put before it, will sometimes come as
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035770_0330_1006BFBF9F3FDCD8"/>
early as the end of <hi>April,</hi> or beginning of <hi>May.</hi> It is a good way to put moss round the roots of these wall trees in <hi>March</hi> to keep the ground warm, and at the same time moist, which helps us to both forward and large roses.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>dispose</hi> rose trees to bear forward, the not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any flowers to blow the present year, and pruning short in <hi>July,</hi> or <hi>August,</hi> is a means from which much may be expected, especially if there is any artificial warmth used in the spring to force them. With a view to this, some good brushy rooted, low growing plants, may be potted in <hi>autumn,</hi> not suffered to bear the next <hi>summer,</hi> and being pruned down (as above) will force well the next <hi>spring.</hi> Rose trees potted for an ordinary blow, must not be in too small ones, nor placed in a warm situation, except early in <hi>spring,</hi> and must be kept cool by watering. As to the <hi>propagation</hi> of rose trees, many will send forth <hi>suckers</hi> enow, and those that do not, may be <hi>layered,</hi> by slitting (as carnations) or budded; but <hi>may</hi> be two years before they root. See page 67. Some will come by <hi>cuttings,</hi> but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as the <hi>burgundy,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>evergreen, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blowing rose,</hi> takes well by cuttings; but it will not do abroad, except in the summer months, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not in the list: It is a semi-double dark crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and may be treated as a <hi>geranium;</hi> grows low, and rather weak. The <hi>burnet, apple,</hi> or any other sort, producing good seed, may be propagated that way; but it is a slow way, the seed seldom coming up till the second year. The <hi>double yellow</hi> rose blows indifferently, but <hi>when</hi> fair, the flowers are very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. Plant it against an east wall, and in dry, but strong ground.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Snow-drop tree</hi> is considerably ornamental. Layers will be two years in rooting. If raised from seed, (imported) sow it as soon as it arrives, in pots, or boxes, and house it before frosts come. If they come not up the first year, set them on a gentle heat the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

spring, and they will soon appear. Shelter the seedlings the first winter in a frame, or a green house.</p>

                           <hi>Tutsan</hi> grows wild in woods, and will therefore do well in the shade, as among trees. Every shrub, or plant that <hi>will</hi> flourish in such a situation is valuable; and a gardener's attention will be well employed to discover them, by trials, &amp;c. The <hi>St. John's wort,</hi> and <hi>St. Peter's wort,</hi> (allied to <hi>tutsan</hi>) may be planted in the shade.</p>

be tried on a warm border, keeping the earth cool, and the glasses perfectly close. If the cuttings are planted just within the glass, watering well round the outside will reach them, and thus they need not be uncovered: If the glasses are taking off for watering, it is not (however) material, provided they are carefully fixed close again. As soon as the cuttings appear to <hi>grow,</hi> air must be given them, or they will run up weak.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bay,</hi> the common plain sort is rather tender, and requires a situation sheltered from bleak winds; but the variegated and double flowered sorts are tenderer still; and as they rarely succeed well abroad, they are commonly considered as green house plants.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cedar,</hi> the Bermudian, is tender whilst young, and should have a favourable situation afterwards.</p>

                           <hi>Fir,</hi> there is a variety of each species, denominated from the number of the <hi>leaves,</hi> and the shape and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the <hi>cones.</hi> The <hi>balm of gilead,</hi> and <hi>hemlock</hi> sorts, are the lowest growers. To get the <hi>seed</hi> from the cones, lay them before a good fire, so as not to scorch them; and if they come not out well, after heating this way, bore a hole up the middle, and drive something of iron in to split them open.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Oak,</hi> the evergreen sorts are excellent timber, and very ornamental in pleasure grounds, page 27. The red excrescences upon the <hi>kermes oak,</hi> are occasioned b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           <hi>Pine,</hi> there are several other sorts of less estimation. The <hi>Waymouth</hi> and <hi>torch</hi> pines are the loftiest, and the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           <hi>Pyracantha</hi> requires some support of stakes, pales, or wall, though it may be trained as a standard bush, or form an hedge impregnable. It is very beautiful

when in <hi>full</hi> fruit; but it so often misses being so, (chiefly through bad pruning, page 172) that it is got too much out of repute. It does best in a dry poor soil, and an eastern aspect. Young <hi>cuttings,</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> will strike, being potted in good earth, and set in the shade till autumn, and then plunged in the ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a warm wall.

Risk of experiment in these cases, or the trouble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, should not be minded, for if a shrub <hi>will</hi> live abroad, it is surely much better there; and it has been found that several things will do so, which have been used to be housed, even in stoves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Groundsel tree,</hi> or ploughman's spikenard, must have a snug situation abroad, as hard frosts are apt to cut it; and if it is potted and housed, it must have a great deal of air, as it only needs protection in severe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is an argument for trying all things abroad, of which there is a chance of living there, for they cannot have the air they require in a <hi>green house,</hi> where are so many plants of a tenderer nature.</p>

a dry warm situation, and then a little attention in severe frosts may secure it.</p>

                           <hi>Phillyrea</hi> in all its varieties, though rather a ramb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling grower, is considered as one of the standing orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our shrubberies; yet it has beauty in neither flower, nor fruit, as is the case with some other plants, (particularly evergreens) being retained only for their foliage. The <hi>striped</hi> sort should have a sheltered situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as indeed is, in a measure, necessary to all varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated plants, as their ornamental nature, in this respect, is the consequence of hereditary weakness.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Periwinkle</hi> is a pretty under shrubby evergreen, if properly kept up to the lower part of pales, or a wall, or the larger sort may be trained to a low stake, or even kept as a little bush. It is very well to confine the roots (being apt to run) by slaty stones, or tiles: It succeeds well in shade and moisture.</p>

                           <hi>Purslain tree,</hi> the Spanish is not so hardy as the common sort, but will generally survive our winters, in good situations.</p>

                           <hi>Ragwort,</hi> this sort (as all the others) used to be housed in winter; but will stand abroad in a warm, sheltered, dry situation, and its hoary leaves are very ornamental, though there is no great beauty in its flowers. When raised from seed, it is apt to get greener in leaf, and therefore it will be best raised from cuttings, which should be taken from the whitest plants. A likeness to the original is frequently lost from seed, but is assuredly maintained from cuttings and layers, though the former method is generally to be recommended, where no inconvenience attends it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rose,</hi> this sort will need support, being rather trailing.</p>

                           <hi>Smilax,</hi> as it is nailing, or climbing, is commonly planted to run up he trunks of trees, &amp;c.

As to the <hi>spirting</hi> (or wild) <hi>cucumber,</hi> though it may be mentioned here, it is very hardy, so as to sow itself in autumn, come up in spring, and will abide as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial.

                           <hi>Amaranthus,</hi> the <hi>tree</hi> sort, grows larger than the others, and bears purple flowers. The <hi>tricolor</hi> and <hi>bicolor</hi> are so called, from the former having the <hi>leaves</hi> of three colours; i. e. a bright red, yellow and green; and the latter of two, a deep red and purple; and it is for these, and not the flower, that they are cultivated. The flowers of the <hi>globe</hi> sorts have the peculiar prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of retaining their form and colour a long time (years) when gathered, and have therefore the denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination of <hi>everlasting.</hi> Clear the seed of this flower from its downy covering before sowing, as a means of forwarding the germination.</p>

nicely saved from the fullest blossomed, and distinctly striped sorts, that have not grown near small, or self coloured ones. The plants elected for seed, should be protected from the wet and cold, after <hi>Mid-August,</hi> by putting them under lights, or in a green house window, where they may have the full sun.</p>

                           <hi>Capsicums</hi> are usually ranked in the less tender class, and though they are in nature so, yet to have them fine, and to fruit in time, they should be brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by being treated as balsams, &amp;c. at least in situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation far north of London.

When autumn approaches, a hand glass may be set on forked sticks over this, or any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der plant, and thus preserve it abroad longer.</p>

                           <hi>Egg plant</hi> must have a dry soil, and warm situation, but yet plenty of water in hot weather. The blossom is not striking, but the fruit is often as large as a swan's egg, and with common management will be as big as a hen's.

                           <hi>Humble plant</hi> is one of the <hi>sensitive plants,</hi> the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of which is to close its leaves, or drop them upon being touched. The common sensitive plant will grow erectly to eight feet, in a <hi>hot house,</hi> (which is its proper place) but the humble plant is spreading, and seldom reaches more than a stature of two feet; for its lower growth it is therefore more proper for our purpose here. It is called <hi>humble</hi> from its receding and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping so completely when touched, footstalk and all, as it were making a bow. The humble plants are distinguished from the common upright growing sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives, as the latter only closes the leaf, without drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the stalk.</p>

                           <hi>Ice plant</hi> trails and spreads wide on the ground, makes no shew in its flower, but is beautifully covered with chrystal drops, shining like <hi>diamonds</hi> when the sun is on it; or as the frozen drops of <hi>iciles.</hi> It is not nice in its culture, or weather, though it should not be put out too young. The best way is to plant one in a pot of six or seven inches diameter, without any thing at bottom over the hole; and keeping it in the frame till it gets too big for the pot, plunge it in the ground a little over the rims. Thus the plant will not be <hi>too</hi> luxuriant, but yet sufficiently nourished, (for it has small roots) and will flower sooner, and ripen the seed better for this treatment.</p>

The <hi>gourd</hi> may be added to this class; but to succeed <hi>well,</hi> it should have a good south wall to be trained against, and it will take up a good deal of room there. Sorts numerous, as to size, shape and colour. The common <hi>pumpion</hi> (see page 243) is the hardiest; and the warted <hi>orange gourd</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought the prettiest.</p>

                           <hi>After,</hi> to have it forward and fine, should have a second slight hot bed to prick a few out upon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this would be a great advantage to any of the other sorts. Those not thus forwarded, will make a second blow. The <hi>striped</hi> sorts are much the prettiest, yet the plain ones make a good shew, and do very well for shrubberies, &amp;c. particularly the <hi>superb</hi> white and red. It is a good way to plant a few <hi>asters,</hi> or any flowers designed for seed, in beds by themselves, in a way of nursery, as in the best borders it is much neater to have all flowers pulled off regularly, when their beauty is over: Pull up all bad flowers (as soon as discovered) from amongst such seeding plants.</p>

                           <hi>Balsam, yellow,</hi> is more frequently sown in cold ground, (as others of this list, <hi>carthamus, cerinthe, pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, prince's feather,</hi> and <hi>xeranthemum</hi>) but it is worth while to afford the assistance of a little heat. This flower is sufficiently ornamental to merit a place in the garden; but is chiefly curious for the elastic prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of its seed pods bursting with force, when just pressed between the fingers, throwing the seeds to a distance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Chinese hollyhock</hi> should be brought forward (especially northwards) to insure a timely blow. See page 12, vol. 2.</p>

                           <hi>Convolvulus major</hi> will need support by a wall, stake, or otherwise, to be trained, or run up, as a scarlet bean. The deep blue is called <hi>convolvulus nil,</hi> or <hi>anil.</hi> The major convolvulus makes a good shew, and may be sown in <hi>April,</hi> in the places designed to flower; but it is the best way to sow three or four seeds in a small pot, which being placed on a gentle heat, will be much forwarder and finer, and may be turned out whole (when about three inches high) into open ground; for this flower, (as many other annuals) does not transplant well: <hi>Nil</hi> will not do without heat to bring it up.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>India pink</hi> is now brought to blow much more double and variegated than formerly, and it is a very neat, engaging flower, blowing a long time. Prick them out when quite small, (for they readily strike) that they may not be drawn up weak, and let them grow in single detached plants, in a dry light soil, and they will be strong. If cut down as soon as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal blow is over, they will stand another year.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Marigold</hi> the <hi>African,</hi> grows strongly erect. There is a variety in the form of the flower, and the quilled sorts are mostly admired. The <hi>French</hi> grows weakly spreading, and there are beautiful varieties of it from seed, which should be carefully saved from the most double flowers, having had not single ones growing near them. The smell of these flowers is unpleasant, but there are sweet scented sorts of each.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Marvel of Peru</hi> is considered as an annual, yet is naturally perennial in root—our climate makes it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual. If the <hi>roots</hi> of those growing abroad are taken up in <hi>October,</hi> and dried a few days, they may be packed in dry sand, and kept in a dry place from frost) till spring; when potted and placed on a gentle heat, they will shoot, and come forward. Or if the <hi>plants</hi> are housed in <hi>autumn</hi> (before the leaves are damaged by frost) and the pots stand till the mould
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035770_0345_1006C006476B2798"/>
gets very dry, that may be cut down, and the roots (probably) live, having no moisture to rot them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Palma Christi,</hi> the <hi>large leaved</hi> (often half a yard broad) will grow from seven to ten feet high, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to culture, as early sown, &amp;c. As it is valued for its noble stature, and ample foliage, some garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers bring it forward as a tender annual, in order to produce a <hi>giant;</hi> but it is not advisable. The <hi>small</hi> leaved grows to about four feet high, and is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able plant in the leaf, in other respects then size.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nasturtium</hi> seed comes up well on natural ground, but a little frost kills the plants, hence it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in this class, to have it flower early. Late sown plants, if potted and housed, will blow in winter, and live round to spring. Cuttings of it will grow. The spreading, rambling nature of this shewy annual, makes some people object to it; but the evil may be remedied, by growing it in a poor dry soil, or treating it as directed for the <hi>ice plant,</hi> in last list. The dwarf sort is preferred by some for flower borders, but is not so floriferous as the large. See page 259.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Stock,</hi> ten week, (as beautiful and fragrant) is the most important annual flower we have. Every one admires it, and its absence is always felt. It therefore merits every attention, to raise fine double flowers, to have them early, a continued succession, and as late as possible.</p>
                        <p>There should be <hi>four</hi> sowings of this flower in the year. Let the <hi>first</hi> be in the spring, (as at the end of <hi>February,</hi> or beginning of <hi>March</hi>) on a gentle heat; and being soon thinned a little, they should be pricked out in about a fortnight upon another moderate hot bed, at four inches asunder, where they may grow till this distance is thought too crowding; but the best rule is, to give them their final station as soon as they have acquired eight leaves.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>second</hi> sowing should take place on a little heat, when the first plants are pricked out; and let this
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035770_0346_1006C007E4B0F5A8"/>
sowing be presently thinned to an inch asunder; prick the plants out in the full ground, (or on a moderate hot bed, if you wish to forward them) at six inches asunder. Here they may grow till either put out with eight leaves, or stand till their <hi>flower buds</hi> appear, which shew plainly whether they will be double or single; the double having round buds, and the single long ones. But if every other is drawn with eight leaves, the rest will do the better, and may be taken up with large balls of earth; concerning the method of doing which, see page 9, vol. 2. Or, every other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken up from the bed, the rest may remain to make a grand shew in flower. Let as many single ones as are not wanted for seed, be pulled, or cut up.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> sowing is to be upon cold ground, in a warm border, or rather under a hand-glass, some time, between the first and tenth of <hi>May.</hi> Let the plants be thinned in time, so as not to draw one another up weak, and pricked out at four inches, as soon as may be, in showery weather, for stocks will transplant very young; and when they have eight leaves, let them be planted where they are to blow. It is a good way (in furnishing borders) to plant three or four stocks together, about four inches from one another, and those that prove single, may be <hi>cut</hi> out as soon as discovered.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> sowing is designed for plants to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served through the winter for a <hi>spring</hi> blow, and should be made either the last week in <hi>July,</hi> or the first in <hi>August.</hi> Plant some close under a south wall, and pot others for housing; but let them not be shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered before, or more than necessary. If two or three plants are put in a pot, the single may be <hi>cut</hi> away from the double as soon as discovered.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>French</hi> stock is very floriferous, and there gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally comes more double of this than the others. The <hi>Prussian</hi> is sometimes called the <hi>sea-green</hi> stock,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035770_0347_1006C00D4C185040"/>
to distinguish it from the others, which are somewhat hoary leaved.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>save seed</hi> that is most promising for double, mark those flowers which have five or six leaves, by tying a bit of thread round them. A single flowering plant that has double ones growing near it, produces good seed; but those single flowers that come out before the double ones appear, it is proper to take off, as also all the late flowers, which if they ripen their seeds at all, would be weak; and a plant having but few pods to ripen, will certainly produce the boldest seed, and of course the largest plants and flowers may be expected from it. Be sure that the seed is ripe before gathered, and that it is kept dry, which will be best in their pods, close tied in paper bags.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sultan,</hi> the yellow is the finest flower, and has a very agreeable musky scent; but it is the tenderest, and will hardly do without the assistance of heat to bring the seeds up: It has a chance, however, if sown under a small hand-glass, that is air tight, on a warm border. The yellow will produce many fine flowers, if pricked out upon a second slight hot-bed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Zinnia,</hi> the colours of this flower are dingy, but yet agreeable. Some gardeners chuse to treat it as the balsam; but a moderate hot bed will produce the plants large and forward enough to ripen their seeds. Zinnia is, however, rather more impatient of cold than others of this class.</p>

                           <hi>Belvidere</hi> is of a beautiful regular growth. The autumn sown seed make far the finest plants, and as self sown ones often come up, they should be preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This flower is adapted for potting, in which sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation it looks well. See pages 5, 14, vol. 2.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ketmia,</hi> the flower fades in a short time, when the sun is out; but the plant produces a great number, in long succession.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Larkspur</hi> is seldom permitted to attain its utmost perfection, not allowing it room enough. The large sorts <hi>should</hi> be from a foot to eighteen inches asunder, and the dwarf half this distance: A first rate florist directs two feet for the branching larkspur. See page 14.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mignonette</hi> is often sown on heat, early in the spring, to obtain forward plants for pricking out into pots, boxes, or baskets, to be housed in windows, &amp;c. But, as it does not transplant well, take it up with a little earth about the roots; and, if convenient, put the pots, &amp;c. on a little heat, till well rooted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mulberry blight</hi> or more properly <hi>blite,</hi> i. e. the herb <hi>blitum,</hi> whose fruit resembles a red unripe <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry.</hi> It is also called <hi>strawberry spinach,</hi> and the fruit like a scarlet <hi>strawberry.</hi> The branches of this plant must be supported by a wall, pales, or sticks, or the weight of the fruit (not eatable) will bring them to the ground. It looks best, and is very handsome, when trained to a wall, which it should be, just as a fruit tree, suffering no side shoots to remain on. The seed is near a month coming up, which makes autumn sown plants valuable, in order to have the fruit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and fine. Some persons sow it in spring upon a slight hot bed, and prick the plants out where they are to grow; but to sow forward, in their proper place, (not to be transplanted) generally does very well; as
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035770_0351_1006C0202A0B61C8"/>
it will then decorate the autumn, when other things begin to fail.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Stock, annual,</hi> if sown about <hi>Mid-August,</hi> for an edging, or in little patches, will make a pretty early spring blow, as it is very hardy: A light soil suits it best. This little flower is commonly spoiled by being suffered to grow thick, which makes it trail, and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble too much. Four in a patch, about four inches asunder, is sufficient.</p>

                           <hi>Campion,</hi> though a perennial, should be considered as biennial, in order to a timely supply, as it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is of no longer duration: The <hi>double</hi> (as bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no seed) is propagated by <hi>slips</hi> from the roots.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Carnation</hi> is seldom considered as a <hi>biennial,</hi> though in fact it is so, as much as several others, usually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated of this class; for, after the first blow, the plants become straggling, and flower weakly; it is, therefore, that they are always <hi>layered,</hi> &amp;c. to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them. The plain, deep red, or <hi>clove</hi> scented carnation, is the original, and an established cultivated
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035770_0353_1006C028A8845080"/>
sort. The rest are classed under the heads, <hi>flakes, hizarres, picquetees,</hi> and <hi>painted ladies,</hi> according to their colours, stripes, spots, and pouncings. For <hi>layer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>raising</hi> carnations, see the end of this section.</p>

                           <hi>Chelone,</hi> the seed of this flower is best sown as soon as ripe, in autumn; and coming up in the spring, they may be planted in the borders, in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> and will flower the same season.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Primrose tree,</hi> produces so immense a quantity of seed, that it becomes rather a troublesome weed to some people. Cut the flower stems off, or pull up the plant, just before the seed pods are ripe enough to shed their contents.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rudheckia,</hi> or American sun-flower, this biennial sort is called hardy, but should nevertheless have a dry sheltered situation. The narrow leaved dwarf <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial</hi> (about three feet) sometimes proves <hi>biennial,</hi> and may be sown as such, a little every year, by those who would extend their work in the culture of flowers.</p>

                           <hi>Scabious</hi> has been noticed in the two last lists as an <hi>annual,</hi> which it becomes, if sown early; and some gardeners make a point of doing it on a little heat to forward them. As a <hi>biennial,</hi> it should not be sown too soon; but if forward plants are transplanted in <hi>June,</hi> it will prevent their flowering till next year, when they will come very fine and strong.</p>

This flower is a <hi>perennial,</hi> (see list IV.) but as it is apt to be cut off in severe weather, it is here considered as <hi>biennial,</hi> and may take its chance after the first flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                           <hi>Snapdragon</hi> we consider as biennial, it not blowing so handsome afterwards. The variegated (as all stripes are) is tenderish; this must be propagated from <hi>cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> as indeed the plain may be, though the finest
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035770_0354_1006C02C63962350"/>
plants come from seed. This flower is of longest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in a poor soil, and will grow out of cracks in walls.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Stock,</hi> or stock gilliflower, is apt to get too rampant (in some seasons) before winter, and when killed by frost, it is chiefly owing to this circumstance; for nothing stands severe weather well, that has grown very freely. Hence it used to be the custom of florists to transplant them several times in the summer; (even at every full <hi>moon</hi>) but to keep them down, and hardy, by this means, tends directly to weaken the blow, if not to kill the plant. The most reasonable method in this business is, not to sow <hi>too</hi> early, (or before the first week in <hi>April</hi>) to <hi>thin</hi> them, and to <hi>prick</hi> them out in time, that they may not be drawn up long legged; and by no means to let them have a dungy soil to grow in, or a very rich one. Prick them out the first cool weather after they have six leaves, at six or eight inches asunder, where let them remain till <hi>August,</hi> chusing a showery time, (rather about the middle) to plant them out where they are to blow; but let not this be into a moist soil, or damp situation. It is a good way to mix half sand in the mould that lies about the shanks above the roots; and when wet and frost comes, to lay coarse, or drift sand, round about them, two or three inches high, which remove at spring. Some plants may remain in the nursery bed till spring, to put out in cooler or moister ground, for in such a soil they blow best, though they do not stand the winter well in it: Stocks blow much finer in a showery summer than in a hot one. It will be a great advantage to those moved at spring, to have balls of earth to the roots, though they do not well retain it. To dispose them to it, and make them fitter to transplant, they may be cut round in autumn, with a long knife, five or six inches deep, and three inches from the stem, making one slanting cut under the root, at six inches depth, to cut those asunder that strike
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035770_0355_1006C034D1552DF8"/>
directly down. This is a practice that would answer in most things that are to be removed at spring; and if not, it would generally be of service, as the cutting off the end of a root, occasions it to throw out several others of a more fibrous nature.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sweet William</hi> (or bearded pink) is distinguished into broad and narrow leaved sorts. This flower comes very diversified, from seed, many plain, others beautifully striped, and a <hi>few</hi> double, perhaps one in thirty or forty. But the single ones are generally so ornamental, that the want of doubles is not much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. The <hi>double</hi> sorts are propagated from <hi>layers,</hi> as carnations. The <hi>sweet William</hi> is perennial, but as the plants cease to be handsome (and in some cases die) after the first blow, it is necessary to raise some every year.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wall-flowers,</hi> raised from seed, produce some dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; but the chance is not great for fine ones, which are to be continued from slips in <hi>May, June,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> planting them in a rich soil and shade till rooted. The double <hi>white</hi> wall-flower is tender, and should be pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for housing, as indeed other good sorts should be, and generally are.</p>

                           <hi>Auricula,</hi> from the great and elegant variety of its flower and leaf, arising perpetually from seed, is one of the <hi>florist's</hi> chief delights, and to which he pays much attention in the culture. It is one of the first flowers, and ranks in nature with the <hi>primrose</hi> and <hi>polyanthus.</hi> The sorts admitted in the present collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are about four hundred.

                           <hi>Bear's ear sanicle</hi> is very hardy, but is a proper plant to <hi>pot.</hi> It may be planted in any cold place, and should have a dry lean soil, but be duly watered in summer; and most things that a poor soil suits, must still have water freely in warm weather. This sanicle is about six inches high; that of <hi>Gmelin</hi> only four, and is not so pretty.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Birthwort</hi> is tender, and seedlings of it must be sheltered by a frame in winter.</p>

                           <hi>Campanula,</hi> pyramidal, may be propagated (as well as from seeds and slips) by pieces of its <hi>root,</hi> planted about an inch and half in the ground, in a shady, but not moist border. The finest plants are produced from <hi>seed;</hi> but will be three or four years before they blow. Sow a few every year in <hi>April,</hi> in a light fresh soil, where the morning sun only comes. As much wet in the cold seasons is apt to rot this root, it will be proper to guard against it, by some occasional covering, when there is a continuance of rain, or snow.

A few <hi>potted</hi> may be removed under shelter. A <hi>mat</hi> set <hi>high</hi> over is a proper covering for a bed of them. In the <hi>summer</hi> they must never want water, especially when spindling, or in blow. There is a <hi>white</hi> sort.</p>

                           <hi>Cardinal flower</hi> must have a dry soil and a warm situation; occasionally also a little protection. They are commonly potted, and some should at least be so, lest those in the open ground be cut off. This flower is very ornamental, but the scarlet much more so than the blue, and is not tall of growth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Christmas rose</hi> is very hardy, but a dry warm situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be allotted it; and when in flower, a little protection to preserve it in beauty, as a <hi>hand-glass,</hi> may be advisable. A plant or two potted (large pots as it spreads) is a agreeable enough, to house when in blow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Columbine,</hi> when sown in spring, is rather apt to miss. Autumn is therefore preferable; and these plants will also be much stronger, as they do not blow the next, but following year. The plants should not stand above two years, as afterwards they get unsightly, and plain in flower.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cowslip American</hi> is commonly potted, as indeed some plants should be, as it thus appears to advantage; but it is hardy, and grows best in borders that are somewhat shady, or have not the afternoon sun.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dragon's head</hi> should have a moist shady situation.</p>

                           <hi>Figwort,</hi> the plants are somewhat tender, and may only be expected to stand through ordinary winters, in a warm soil and situation. Let some be <hi>potted,</hi> for housing, lest those abroad be cut off. The <hi>pilewort</hi> is sometimes called <hi>figwort;</hi> but this is a different plant, whose proper name is <hi>scrophularia,</hi> whereas the <hi>pile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort</hi> is <hi>ranunculus ficaria;</hi>—this has a red flower, that a yellow;—this a fibrous, that a tuberous root—this grows to about five feet, that attains only to so many inches.</p>

                           <hi>Geranium,</hi> or <hi>crane's bill,</hi> (so called from the shape of the seed vessel) the <hi>exotic</hi> sorts are tender, <hi>Africa</hi> being their native climate. As favourite flowers, the different sorts are cultivated by all descriptions of people, as opportunity affords to preserve them in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: They are properly <hi>green house</hi> plants. The principal kinds are as follow, classed according to their ordinary height of growth:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Flaming, or Vervain mallow leaved, scarlet. Three coloured; i. e. red, black and white. Ladies mantle leaved, whitish and bluish. Sweet scented mallow leaved, white. Gooseberry leaved, reddish. Caraway leaved, or variable geranium, red, crimson, purple, white, &amp;c. Vine leaved, red and white. Night smelling, yellowish with dark spots, three sorts. Pinnated, or proliferous, of different colours.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Spear leaved, white. Fleshy stalked, or celan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine leaved, white. Square stalked, flesh coloured.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Birch leaved, reddish. Sorrel leaved blush, plain and stripe flowered, and variegated leaved. Three gouty stalked, or columbine leaved, purple. Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scented, a purplish blue. Glutinous vine leaved, red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish purple and white. Horseshoe, green leaved, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated, silver edged, silver striped, gold striped, pink, two scarlets and a purple, and one large scarlet, or grandiflorum.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Vine leaved, balm scented, blue. Shining, and mallow leaved, scarlet and deep scarlet. Butterfly, or variegated flowered, with a pointed mallow leaf. Marsh mallow, or hood leaved, purplish; and a variety of this with angular leaves. Rasp leaved, flesh colour, spotted red. Two coloured, purple and white. See the end of this section.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gentianella</hi> likes a cool loamy soil, and eastern situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and should not be often removed, or in too small pieces.</p>

The case is, they are natives of moist, shady places; and whenever this is the case, we may conclude such plants are organized accordingly, and that they must be accommodated by us agreeable to their nature. The <hi>constitution</hi> of plants is necessary to be known, in order to their proper culture; and a <hi>gardener</hi> cannot direct his attention more to his credit, than to make <hi>observations</hi> and <hi>experiments</hi> to discover it.</p>

                           <hi>Golden rod</hi> will grow in shade, and particularly the evergreen sort; but being late blowers, this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance rather directs to an open, or forward situation.</p>

                           <hi>Hellebore,</hi> the white flowered, is the common offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal plant. A light soil and dry situation, not subject to snails, suits it best.</p>

                           <hi>Helonias</hi> is a very elegant and ornamental plant, worthy of the most conspicuous part of the pleasure garden. It requires only the ordinary culture of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennials. Seeds are imported from <hi>North America,</hi> as it does not ripen them here.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hepatica</hi> is found to transplant best when in flower; but it must not be in small portions, lest it wither away; and they never look well in small patches, as is the case with all dwarf blowers. Situation and soil as <hi>gentianella.</hi>

                           <hi>Lion's foot</hi> is somewhat tender, and to do well must have a favourable place in the garden, as to sun and shelter; and it does best in a light, or sandy soil. Let some be potted, for it is pretty, and blows all summer.</p>

                           <hi>London pride</hi> (a saxifrage) used to be planted much as an edging; but it does not answer this purpose well. A few plants here and there in patches is best; and by no means allow it a good border, for it is not very handsome, though it has such fine names: It prefers a moist soil and cold situation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Loosestrife,</hi> the common, is found wild; but it is a showy plant, and where a variety is wanted is very admissable. It grows in shady moist places, and should be planted accordingly, in the borders of a shrubbery, &amp;c. The smallest is a trailer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lupine</hi> will be best raised from seed, without trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting, as the roots strike down deep: If they are transplanted, let it therefore be while quite young.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lungworts</hi> prefer a shady situation; but the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> (an elegnt little plant) rather one dry and shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lychnis,</hi> the double scarlet is a beautiful flower, but not apt to increase much at root; recourse is therefore to be had to <hi>cuttings,</hi> which also are not certain in striking root. In <hi>June,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> take cuttings from the side shoots, (without flower) and let the pieces planted have three, or at the most four eyes. Put them into a good soil, fine and rich, but not dungy, as deep as half way between the second and third joint, in an <hi>east</hi> border; and keep them cool, but not wet. A <hi>hand-glass</hi> will greatly assist in this business. See <hi>pink</hi> at the end of this section. The <hi>Chinese lychnis</hi> is rather too tender for open culture; but in a choice situation may abide moderate winters. It makes a good potted plant among myrtles and geraniums.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lychnidea,</hi> take the cuttings off close to the ground, and discharge the tops; and plant them in pots, or borders, in a place not of much sun.</p>

                           <hi>Masterwort</hi> (a medicinal plant) is of no great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament; but is commonly cultivated for borders of shrubberies, &amp;c. as being of low growth, and hardy nature. There is an <hi>alpine</hi> sort about a foot high.</p>

                           <hi>Marsh marigold</hi> is a flower, (as its name imports) that will flourish in a wet soil; but yet it does not do much amiss in a dry one. In default of a moist soil, any plant that requires one, should at least be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with a shady situation, and never want water in summer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Milk vetch</hi> is somewhat tender, particularly the seedlings, which should be protected by a garden frame in winter. <hi>Fox tail</hi> sort, see <hi>biennials.</hi>

                           <hi>Monk's hood</hi> is a poisonous plant in every part, but very ornamental, and commonly cultivated. Shade suits it, and it will even grow under trees, or in any damp place, where few other things will.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Morina</hi> is worthy of a conspicuous place in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. It has a strong taproot, and should be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted whilst young, that it may not be damaged; but sowing in the place where it is to grow (as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>lupine</hi>) is the best way.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mulleins</hi> prefer a light soil, but like a north border; and the borage leaved being very low, is proper for an edging in a cool shady situation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Orpine,</hi> this, as all succulent plants, should have a dry soil and situation, and not often watered.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Passion flower</hi> should be planted against a warm wall, where it may have room to spread, as it is a <hi>very</hi> free shooter. The sorts are numerous, (for <hi>green house</hi> and <hi>stove</hi>) but only this well suits open culture. In fine situations, and the <hi>southern</hi> parts of <hi>England,</hi> there are two more, however, that may do abroad. Prune it about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> leaving the shoots from two to four feet long, as the strength of the plants, or room, dictates, and a foot asunder. Before the frosts come, cover the roots, a yard round, with dry litter; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new it with dry, when afterwards it gets much and long wet.

frost sets in; but uncover as soon in spring as may be, or, in short, in mild weather, on <hi>days</hi> through the winter, if not too much trouble. This flower has been sometimes trained to a stake, in which case, shorter pruning must take place to keep it down. It bears upon the young shoots, which should be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly trained in, and the flowers are the glory only of a day, but generally a great number are produced in succession. This flower takes readily from cutting, of about seven or eight inches long, taken off in March, and planted in a good soil, kept cool by water, and shaded from much sun.</p>

                           <hi>Polyanthus</hi> produces an infinity of sorts from seed, and the <hi>florist</hi> pursues his object of obtaining <hi>prize</hi> flowers of this kind. The polyanthus delights in a loamy soil, and shady situation. It is an excellent edging flower for shrubberies; though fine blows are not to be expected under trees, or in much wet. An <hi>cast</hi> border is the place for producing the best flowers. For <hi>raising</hi> them, &amp;c. see the end of this section.</p>

                           <hi>Plumbago,</hi> though it be a native of <hi>Italy,</hi> is hardy enough to abide our ordinary winters in the open ground. Afford it a dry, sunny, sheltered situation, which will be a means of preserving it, and also tend to forward the blow, as it is so late: All plants that produce their flowers towards the end of autumn,

                           <hi>Reed,</hi> Portugal, is curious for its lofty and ample growth, but rarely flowers with us. It attains to ten or twelve feet high, and its stems are strong enough for walking sticks. The <hi>variegated</hi> sorts come only to half the size, and more frequently flowers.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>Rocket,</hi> (sometimes called <hi>dame's violet,</hi> and <hi>queen's gilliflower</hi>) the single is raised from seed, and the double from rooted slips and cuttings. The double is rather uncertain in continuance, and requires some attention. Cut the stems down as soon as off their principal show and time of flowering, which is a means to help them to increase, and get strong at root, as it is from offsets formed in the present year, that they flower in the next. If weak, or small roots are planted, they should not be suffered to blow the first year. To <hi>propagate</hi> by <hi>cuttings,</hi> do it when the stems are about eight or nine inches long, (i. e. before flowering) making each into two; and plant them a little more than half way deep in an <hi>east</hi> border, in good fresh undunged soil. Keep them cool by occasional watering, and if the cuttings attempt to flower, nip the buds off. Cuttings of stems that have flowered, will sometimes grow, but they make weak plants. A <hi>hand-glass</hi> would be of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice over them. See <hi>pink</hi> at the end of this section.</p>

                           <hi>Rudbeckia,</hi> or <hi>American sunflower,</hi> is a little tender, and must be accommodated accordingly. Like the <hi>rocket,</hi> it is rather (some sorts at least) unapt to form <hi>offsets;</hi> and therefore to encourage the putting them forth, (without which the plant dies) the stems may be cut down to prevent flowering: That is, when plants are more desired flowering.</p>

                           <hi>Sarracena</hi> is a native of the boggs of <hi>North America.</hi> It requires therefore a moist situation; but is found to need protection from our sharp frosts. The whole plant is of curious formation. It is not apt to ripen its seeds here, or to make offsets; so that both are frequently imported.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saxifrage</hi> plants are usually <hi>potted</hi> to move into the house when in flower, as indeed the <hi>pyramidal</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular should be; but they are all very hardy, except the <hi>strawberry</hi> sort, (not very handsome) which is too tender to endure much wet and cold.</p>

                           <hi>Senna,</hi> of Maryland, must have a dry soil and warm situation. It is annual in stalk, and therefore the roots may be well protected in winter: This flower makes a very handsome show.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Solomon's seal</hi> is in greater variety, and one with double flowers. They all suit well in shady moist places.</p>

                           <hi>Starworts</hi> are in general of that hardy nature, that they will flower almost any where, and increase apace from the least slip. They are apt, however, to lose their lower leaves, in proportion to the shade, cold, and wet, they grow in; and the <hi>Alpine</hi> sort will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an open situation, though, like the others, a stiff moist soil suits it. There are other sorts, as a <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian purple,</hi> eight feet, and two <hi>whites</hi> of rather low growth, &amp;c. The two last, as blowing late, and not rampant, may be planted near the house.</p>

                           <hi>Stock,</hi> this plant is rather of a biennial nature, but is commonly of longer duration. It is proper to <hi>pot</hi> and place in a window, on account of its size, rising only a few inches. It is sweet and floriferous, and altogether very proper for an edging.</p>

                           <hi>Throatwort,</hi> the two first sorts are classed with <hi>cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panulas.</hi> The latter, which is the proper, or <hi>mountain blue throatwort,</hi> likes the shade, but must have a light dry soil. This, as the <hi>snapdragon,</hi> and some others, will grow in the crack of walls, &amp;c. and continue longer in such a situation, than a better: In most soils it proves often biennial.</p>

                           <hi>Whitlow grass</hi> is a wild (medicinal) herb, that grows on roofs and walls of old houses, and rubbish heaps; but makes a pretty dwarf spring flower as an edging, &amp;c. in a poor soil.</p>

                           <hi>Cyclamen,</hi> the sorts flowering in <hi>winter</hi> (Persian) are too tender for open culture; but close under a warm wall, with occasional protection of a <hi>hand-glass,</hi> they have succeeded. A culture of this nature is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be <hi>attempted,</hi> as housing (except in places where they have <hi>much</hi> air) does not suit them; the roots often moulding and rotting when kept too close. The <hi>colours</hi> of the <hi>Persian</hi> sorts are red, purple and white. Let them have a light, and deeply dug dry soil, not too much water, and none at all after the leaves begin to decay; for the roots now ceasing to act, would suffer by absorbing much wet, the leaves not performing their accustomed office of drawing it up, and discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. This observation applies to all burbs and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in a degree) though few are so liable to rot as these.</p>

                           <hi>Fritillary</hi> is of several colours, plain, checquered and spotted, white, purple, black, red and yellow. The kinds are broad and narrow leaved; and there is a large double sort, a tall <hi>Persian,</hi> (a yard high) and a dwarf <hi>Persian</hi> about half size, both having deep purple flowers.</p>

                           <hi>Iris,</hi> the four first sorts rather prefer a shady moist situation; but will grow any where, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly planted in odd spare corners of ground.</p>

                           <hi>Lily</hi> is a very ornamental and hardy flower in all its varieties increasing abundantly, and needing only to be removed every three or four years, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of taking away the offsets, and renewing the soil, for a superior blow. The <hi>whites</hi> will not keep out of ground above one month, but the <hi>orange</hi> for several. The <hi>white</hi> will flower tolerably in shade, but the <hi>orange</hi> much better: and as it is a gay flower, it serves well to enliven plantations. The <hi>martagons</hi> are generally not nice as to soil and situation; but the <hi>scarlet</hi> and <hi>yellow</hi> sorts, and <hi>striped lily,</hi> should have a light dry soil, and some sun. The <hi>single</hi> white lilies are very sweet; but the doubles have no smell, as is the case with some other flowers, the fragrance arising from the <hi>stamina</hi> and <hi>antheroe,</hi> which are smothered by the numerous petals. The <hi>Atamasco Guernsey, belladonna,</hi> and <hi>parcratium lilies,</hi> are tender, and should have a warm, or a good <hi>auricula</hi> soil, a full sunny border, and well sheltered situation; with protection also from much wet in cold seasons, and security from frost. These are very elegant and noble flowers, and the <hi>Gaernsey lily</hi> is equal to, if not beyond, any competitor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035770_0378_1006C0A0F32640E8"/>
the chance of succeeding is much greater. Upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, let them be planted directly. If raised from <hi>seed,</hi> (as the <hi>biennial,</hi> though it is not always so) let it be sown as soon as gathered; and the plants being thinned, let them <hi>remain,</hi> as more likely to do well, than when transplanted. It is evidently not proper to move these bulbs (as others) often, but should stand for several years.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Poeony,</hi> the single kinds are showy, but the doubles are nobly ornamental. Let this flower have room, as it will spread (when in full sized bunches) a yard round: and let it be planted out of the way of the full sun, and of much wind. It need not be removed for many years, and will grow in any soil and situation, even among trees, which adapts it for <hi>shrubberies,</hi> &amp;c. The sorts are divided into <hi>male</hi> and <hi>female;</hi> and the former, having lost its flower, produces pods, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich crimson grains, interspersed with black berries of seed, that look very pretty when burst; and may be gathered as soon, or rather just before they open, and brought into the house as curiosities. Let this root be removed early in <hi>September,</hi> or at least before the month is out, before new fibres are formed to the knobs of the roots.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pilewort,</hi> (the double) prefers a shady moist situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and is a pretty wild plant, though an humble trailer. It is called sometimes the <hi>lesser celadine,</hi> and also <hi>figwort.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ranunculus,</hi> in all its sorts, is very ornamental; but the <hi>Persian</hi> kinds are beautiful, and of infinite variety. This flower is left too much to the culture of professed florists; for why should not every garden be adorned with it, seeing, that not much skill is necessary in the management, and that it is hardy, and increases freely?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saxifrage</hi> roots are like so many small peas, and should be planted five or six together, in order to form a full tuft of its flowers, which are double, and white like a stock. The stems, being slender, will need the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035770_0379_1006C0A56F6A0020"/>
support of a light stick, which it is best to fix in the middle at the time of planting, as putting one in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards might injure the roots. All solid rooted plants are liable to be hurt by pushing in a stick too near for tying to, and more care should be taken in the business than usually is: The practice of placing a stick at the time of planting is the best way, when it may be fixed close; and it would serve to show where the roots are, that they may not be disturbed before they appear above ground. This <hi>saxifrage</hi> is usually and properly <hi>potted,</hi> though it does very well in borders, and makes a good show.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>Star of Bethlehem,</hi> the two last sorts, are proper for the edges of borders in plantations; and the pyramidal sort is a proper flower to <hi>pot,</hi> mixing with others very ornamentally: The two first should have a light dry soil.</p>

                           <hi>Tuberose,</hi> there is a dwarf stalked, and a variegated leaf sort of, but they are not so worthy of cultivation as the common single and double; of which two the <hi>single</hi> is preferable, as it blows better, and is more fragrant.

                           <hi>Tulip</hi> (the <hi>Turkey</hi>) is classed into two sorts; the taller, called <hi>serotines,</hi> or late blowers; and the shorter, <hi>praecoces,</hi> or early blowers; some have made another distinction, <hi>medias,</hi> but it is not necessary. The <hi>plain</hi> tulips (as they generally are when they first blow from seed) are called <hi>whole blowers,</hi> or <hi>breeders;</hi> and according as they <hi>break</hi> into other colours, stripes, and variegations, are denominated and classed into <hi>baguettes, bybloemens, verports,</hi> and <hi>bizarres.</hi> As the <hi>dwarf</hi> sorts blow so early as <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> (the <hi>dake van tol</hi> earlier) allow them a warm border and soil, to preserve them from frost and wet, which they are
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035770_0380_1006C0B0D607F420"/>
rather impatient of. These are often <hi>potted</hi> and <hi>forced</hi> on a hot bed, &amp;c. or brought forward by water-glasses, in a warm room; but an increase is only to be expected from open ground culture, and there these early sorts do it sparingly. Take them up every year to remove the offsets, and renew the soil; and keep each sort separate, and <hi>plant</hi> them so, for then they will blow together, and be all of one height. There are about fifty of the early sorts; but the number of <hi>fancy</hi> tulips in <hi>Maddock's</hi> catalogue is more than eight hundred, besides breeders, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>THE following articles are detached as most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently inserted here:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Auricula</hi> is increased by parting the roots, or slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping rooted offsets from them; but offsets without roots will sometimes strike, if well managed, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in a good soil, (in pots best) where they have but little sun, and keeping them <hi>cool</hi> by occasional watering. When the roots are <hi>divided,</hi> (in autumn) let it be with a sharp knife; and cutting off any can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kered part, shorten also their ends, and let not the <hi>lap</hi> part of the root be too long.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>soil</hi> for auriculus should be a good fresh light loamy <hi>maiden</hi> one, to which is added one third of <hi>wood pile,</hi> or <hi>willow</hi> earth, one of sea, or any sharp, or drift: <hi>sand;</hi> and a quantity, equal to the whole, of rotted <hi>cow</hi> dung, or in lieu of this, <hi>horse</hi> dung. This mixture should be well incorporated, at least a year before, by frequent turning over, which ought to be repeated once a month.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dress</hi> the pots towards the end of <hi>January,</hi> for then the plants begin to push for flower, and must be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to, and assis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the roots; and fill up with the compost, a little pressed down. If the pots are dry from the shelter afforded them, give a little soft water in mild weather, about ten o'clock.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Shift,</hi> or transplant auriculas every <hi>second</hi> year, and that as soon as they are out of blow; those, however, that produce many offsets, or are luxuriant growers, may be shifted every year. The more common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is to move all in <hi>August.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To <hi>raise</hi> auriculas from the seed, in <hi>February,</hi> fill boxes, or pots, with fine sifted middling compost; smooth the top perfectly level; scatter the seeds evenly, and cover not more than the thickness of a shilling. Set the pots, &amp;c. on tiles, or boards, under a warm wall, and keep the surface moist. It is a good way to mix the seed with a like quantity (or a little more) of <hi>fine</hi> wood ashes; and to lay some small pieces of <hi>furze,</hi> or light <hi>thorns</hi> over. Remove them (as occasion dictates) to shelter, or protect them from much frost, or heavy rain, &amp;c. and by <hi>May</hi> expect them to appear, when take the furze off; after which set them where they have only the <hi>morning sun,</hi> and when they have got six leaves, prick them put three inches asunder, in boxes, or pots; and early in the next spring, plant them again at six inches asunder, and protect them from wet and frost.</p>
                        <p>Much might be advanced respecting this flower; and the most satisfaction will probably be obtained from a little tract on its <hi>"Culture and Management,"</hi> printed for BULL, at <hi>Bath,</hi> and sold by WALLIS, in <hi>Ludgate Street,</hi> 1782. Something more will occur in the <hi>calendar.</hi>

                           <hi>Carnation</hi> is usually propagated by <hi>layers,</hi> (sometimes by <hi>pipings</hi> or <hi>cuttings,</hi> as <hi>pinks</hi>) about <hi>Midsummer,</hi> or as soon after in the season as they will admit of it, by their length and strength, and the work is thus: Strip off the leaves from the lower part of the shoot; at the middle of it, close below the joint, cut it half

through by an upward direction, with a thin, narrow, sharp knife, and continue the slit exactly up the middle from half to three-fourths of an inch; peg the shoot down into the earth (being before well loosened) as low as it will bear bending, setting the layer upright. This business must be done with a nice hand, and much care, lest the layer should snap off. Now, or rather before, cut off the ends of the longest of the top leaves, that the worms may not draw them in, and disturb the layer. The soil should be <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and may be raised about the layers as occasion requires. <hi>Water</hi> them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The <hi>soil</hi> proper for carnations, is a hazelly, or sandy loam, procured from a pasture, by a spit of about eight inches depth, the turf being well broke, frequently turned, and laid so long together, as to be nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed; them add a little <hi>lime,</hi> (or not) and one-third, or one-fourth of very rotten dung, (<hi>cow's</hi> best) and let this be well mixed, and turned over, till <hi>thoroughly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, which will be some months first; then screen it, or sift through a coarse sieve. The soil for carnations must be <hi>rich;</hi> but yet <hi>dung</hi> is found so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to carnations, that some florists depend upon a good fresh soil alone; carnations are also (except in summer) impatient of much <hi>wet. Turf ashes,</hi> or those of any vegetable, may be mixed with a fresh maiden soil, but not too freely: A <hi>small</hi> quantity of fine <hi>soot,</hi> or <hi>wood ashes,</hi> may me also used, to avoid dung.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>raise</hi> carnations from <hi>seed,</hi> sow thin in boxes, or pots, (in a soil as above) early in <hi>April,</hi> and let them have only the morning sun. When advanced a little in growth, (as about <hi>Midsummer</hi>) take the first

opportunity of moist weather, and prick them out at three or four inches asunder, and give a little water. If dry weather, contrive to <hi>shade</hi> them ten days, or a fortnight, with mats hooped over, which remove in shady or showery weather. When they have grown here a month, or six weeks, (or before <hi>August</hi> is out) plant them at nine or ten inches distance, and shade, if necessary. Protect them in hard frosts by mats, or hoops, set high. <hi>Seed</hi> is best saved from good seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling plants, rather than those long propagated from layers, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Geranium</hi> (the African sorts) are propagated by <hi>seeds</hi> and <hi>cuttings.</hi> The former produces the most free growing plants; but as luxuriance is not desirable in things confined to pots, (as <hi>geraniums</hi> must be) and as the propagation by <hi>cuttings</hi> is so easy and expeditious, it is the mode of culture that generally prevails. The young plants from <hi>cuttings</hi> are also hardier than those from <hi>seed.</hi> If raised from <hi>seed,</hi> sow in <hi>April,</hi> in a light and good soil, warm border, and under a hand-glass, keeping the earth somewhat moist; but it is best to make use of a gentle <hi>hot bed,</hi> giving plenty of air to the plants, when they appear, which on natural ground will be five or six weeks in coming up, and on a moderate heat about three. If raised from <hi>cuttings,</hi> use shoots of the last year's growth, strait and short jointed. Plant them in a fine rich soil, two or three inches or at the most four deep and eight or nine inches asunder, or less, if more convenient. Or the rule may be, to plant the shorter cuttings in two thirds of their length, and the longer one half; but it is an error to put them in the ground so deep as some people do. Those raised on a little heat will be sufficiently rooted in two months to transplant into small pots; (shortening the longer roots a little) and those in the cold ground will be ready in three months, and sometimes less. A <hi>hand-glass</hi> set over <hi>geranium</hi> cuttings (or any other) will greatly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the business, as is directed for <hi>pinks.</hi> If the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035770_0384_1006C0C1517B2C88"/>
cuttings are <hi>raw,</hi> or <hi>long,</hi> take the upper part off down to an eye. In general it may be proper to keep the cuttings out of ground a day, or two; but the soft and succulent ones should by all means, in order to dry the ends, and so heal the wound, which, if put directly in the ground, might decay and rot.</p>
                        <p>The proper <hi>season</hi> for planting is from <hi>Mid-May</hi> to <hi>Mid-July;</hi> a little earlier, or later, may however do: Some chuse to forward them on <hi>heat,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> but they must not be kept close. It is advis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to take cuttings from towards the top, in order to keep the plants down; but where they can be best spared for maintaining a good form, is the general rule.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>management</hi> of geraniums is, to keep them from <hi>forst,</hi> and as much as may be from <hi>harsh winds,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the <hi>spring;</hi> as after being housed all win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they are then tender, and far less able to bear unkind weather, than in <hi>autumn;</hi> when having been used to the external air, and the colder weather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on by degrees, they are seldom hurt much, but by absoulte forst. In the <hi>spring,</hi> they must be brought to bear air by degrees, and the more carefully, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the <hi>winter</hi> has occasioned them to be more or less deprived of the external air, being let in upon them. When the weather is mild in <hi>April,</hi> let them be taken out in the day, (if convenient) and put in on nights; and venture them not wholly abroad till <hi>Mid-May,</hi> or after. In the <hi>summer,</hi> they should be placed in <hi>shelter</hi> and <hi>shade;</hi> but not under trees, or any roof: The morning sun is all they should have, for more of it dries the mould in the pots too fast, and fades the flowers. They will want frequent <hi>watering,</hi> see page 10, vol. 2. They may take up their <hi>summer</hi> residence about <hi>Mid-May,</hi> (as directed) but the <hi>season</hi> must govern; and it will not do to bring them out in a harsh one, which would pinch up the leaves, and deprive them of their beauty. If put close under a

If the roots adhere to the sides of the pot, give the edge a tap upon the knee, or something, and little pressure at the hole, with the thumb, or finger, at the same time, which will help to discharge it. Pare off the matted roots round the sides and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, with a <hi>sharp</hi> knife; and plant it in a fresh pot, (or the same again may sometimes do) putting in as much fine light rich mould, or compost, at the bottom, as will raise the ball of earth, which is about the roots, within an inch of the top of the pot; then fill round the sides, putting the mould gently in, and pressing it down a little, make all level to the top within half and inch; finally, give a watering that shall soak to the bottom, and sprinkle some dry mould over. All shifted plants should be kept rather in the <hi>shade</hi> for a week or two.</p>
                        <p>If any <hi>sticks</hi> are to the plants, they must be taken away first, and replaced (if necessary) again before watering, or rather the next day, if the plants will stand up without. This may be a proper time to <hi>trim</hi> off all dangling, or too crowding shoots; but if <hi>cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> are wanted for increase, they should not be <hi>trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> till these are to be planted. At any rate, dead leaves, or unsightly crooked parts, should be discharged, and <hi>symmetry,</hi> in a snug round head, provided for. Geraniums are free growers, and it is always advisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take off <hi>some</hi> shoots to keep them down. A few of the plants, that most need it, (as least handsome or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

judicious regular use of neat slender <hi>sticks</hi> is of much advantage to <hi>geraniums,</hi> or other potted plants.</p>
                        <p>What has been said of <hi>geraniums,</hi> applies to <hi>all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otics;</hi> in the management of which, it is a material thing not to shift into too large pots, as the roots <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Another thing is, to take off some of the top soil, not only as directed in <hi>spring,</hi> but once or twice in the <hi>summer;</hi> and always before housing in <hi>autumn,</hi> and replacing it with a rich <hi>compost,</hi> as one of almost all rotten <hi>cow</hi> dung, which being <hi>black,</hi> is the most suitable soil for the purpose; and it is cool and nourishing.</p>
                        <p>It is material to <hi>neatness,</hi> and the end of <hi>ornament,</hi> (for which plants are chiefly potted) that the pots should be occasionally washed, or scoured, and by no means suffered to get mouldy. This is a point of little attended to, that we often see a beautiful plant in a disgusting habitation. It is equally offensive, and is also injurious to suffer the surface earth to get mossy, or caked hard by the necessary waterings; to prevent which, often stir it a little depth, and lay it smooth, which makes all look neat and creditable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pints</hi> are sometimes <hi>layered,</hi> or more usually prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated by <hi>cuttings,</hi> or <hi>pipings,</hi> about <hi>Midsummer;</hi> and may be also by <hi>slips,</hi> set in <hi>March, April,</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> with, or without roots, four inches asunder. <hi>Cuttings</hi> should be young strong shoots of three or four inches long, taken off just below a joint; from which strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the lower leaves, and cutting the top ones short, plant them in a fine good soil, about two inches asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in depth full half of their length. They will strike root, so as to be fit to move, in seven or eight weeks, with a little earth about their roots; or may be left to an early time in the spring; but where this is designed, they will be best six inches asunder. They may be either put in <hi>pots,</hi> or <hi>borders,</hi> where they are to blow, or rather into a nursery bed, to grow a year

at six inches distance. <hi>Pipings</hi> are obtained by drawing the heads of the young shoots out, of their sockets, of the length of cuttings. In both methods, push the shoots carefully into the earth, gently press the mould about them, and give a watering; shade also from much sun. They will strike more certainly, and much sooner by being covered <hi>close</hi> with a <hi>hand-glass,</hi> as much as possible air tight. They must be kept cool, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional watering; but when under glass, they will not need so much shading, or may do without any; for though the inclosed air is warmer. It is always more humid, which refreshes the cuttings with answerable supply for their support; and it is this moisture and warmth that facilitates the growth.

                           <hi>Polyanthus</hi> is propagated by parting the roots in autumn, or (for new varieties) by <hi>seed</hi> sown and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged (nearly) as directed for <hi>auriculus:</hi> But as this flower is not so delicate in the cultivation, it may be sown in borders, where there is only the morning sun, any time from <hi>August</hi> to <hi>April;</hi> and as soon as the plants are at all big enough to prick out, set them four inches, asunder; and sometime in <hi>August,</hi> plant at six inches, where they are to remain for their first blow; which should be attended to, in order to mark the best flowers, dividing these into two sorts, prime and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and the rest may be either planted into ordinary ground in plantations, &amp;c. or cast away: There will be but few <hi>good</hi> ones in a great many; but the culture of this plants is so easy, that it is worth while to try for them. Some sow in <hi>pots,</hi> and <hi>boxes,</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> placing them in the sun, and housing them in severe weather; and when the plants appear, set them in an <hi>east</hi> aspect, left much sun destroy the young plants; <hi>early</hi> in autumn, or spring, is however better: The <hi>seed</hi> may be covered a little less than a quarter of an

inch. Both seeds and seedling plants should have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional watering, (except in winter) as moisture suits them.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>compost</hi> for the polyanthus is simply a light <hi>loam,</hi> (as the first spit from the pasture rotted down with the <hi>tarf</hi>) and about one fourth part <hi>cow dung,</hi> or <hi>wood pile</hi> earth. If the loam is strong, a little drift sand amongst it will be proper. The polyanthus grows any where, but a cool soil and situation suits it best; and the above <hi>compost,</hi> and an <hi>cast border,</hi> is necessary for a capital blow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tuberose</hi> is best blown in a <hi>hot house;</hi> but if planted in pots, and plunged at the back of a <hi>hot bed</hi> frame, it will succeed very well. This will be best done about <hi>Mid-April,</hi> as sooner they are apt to get too tall before they can safely be exposed abroad. Provide a good <hi>fresh</hi> light earth, and use no dung, except a little rich and dungy, to lay an inch below the bottom of the bulb; fill the pots only three parts, and place the root only half way, or a little more, in it. Let the mould be somewhat moist, but give no water till the shoot appears, and then moderately; at which time, fill up the pot, just to cover the bulb, which should be but barely hid, when the pot is full. The best shaped pots for bulbous roots is, when the bottoms are as wide as the top; and the size for the <hi>tuberose</hi> should be those of eight or nine inches diameter at top, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the bottom is for width; for the more space below, the less is required above.</p>
                        <p>As the <hi>shoots</hi> advance in growth, the more air must be given; and as freely as possible on mild days, shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting close on cold nights, and almost so on moderate ones. When they get too high for the frames, and the season is forward, with kind weather, they may be plunged in the ground, close under a warm wall; and a covering of mat contrived to protect them a while on nights, or may do if left to take their chance. If the weather is foul, they may be housed in a good
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035770_0389_1006908B6D2BB0B0"/>
window, for a week or a fortnight, and then put in the ground as directed above. Here let them remain, giving occasional <hi>watering,</hi> (and that freely in dry weather) till in flower, when the <hi>house</hi> (allowing them light and sun) will be their proper residence, to enjoy their fine powerful scent, and to protect the blow, that it may the longer continue. In their flowering state, they will want much water.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>heat</hi> on which this flower is forwarded, should be <hi>moderate,</hi> otherwise it will run up too fast. If planted under a <hi>south wall</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> covering the root about an inch, and guarding against much wet till it is growing, it will do for a late blow: A <hi>hand-glass</hi> of course would be serviceable, both to assist it in shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and shelter it from unkind weather; but close covering is as much as possible to be avoided. Fresh <hi>roots</hi> are imported every year;—the double never flowers twice with us, but the single may, if kept in a dry warm room.</p>

                  <head>A CALENDAR.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>general</hi> work of gardening has been pretty fully spoken of, in the parts concerning the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, cultivation,</hi> and <hi>management</hi> of a <hi>garden, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>particular</hi> culture of <hi>esculents, herbs, fruits,</hi> and <hi>flowers,</hi> has been treated in the sections ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to each. It therefore remains to give <hi>here</hi> little more than short <hi>hints,</hi> by way of assisting recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and to make proper <hi>references</hi> to the pages, where <hi>father instructions</hi> may be found of those that need, or chuse to consult them.</p>
                  <p>What is said concerning <hi>seeds</hi> and <hi>sowing,</hi> page 58 to 65. must be attended to. It need only be father observed, that as to the <hi>season</hi> proper to do the several works of gardening, it is not the same (exactly) every where, as <hi>soil</hi> and <hi>situation</hi> make a difference. The <hi>time</hi> mentioned in this <hi>calender</hi> is, that which the author judges will be found most <hi>generally</hi> right in the midland counties, as the extremes of <hi>north</hi> and <hi>south</hi> necessarily make a difference in this business.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>work</hi> of gardening being very multifarious, it would be a practice not unworthy, even the skilful gardener, to make it a <hi>rule,</hi> once a week, to consider what <hi>is</hi> to be done the following week; and to made <hi>memorandums</hi> accordingly, numbering them in the <hi>order</hi> he would have them performed. Thus he would never be at a loss, what to set, himself or his labourers about, and the mortification of omissions, or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035770_0391_100690936592DDB0"/>
of neglect, would be avoided: This <hi>calendar,</hi> it is presumed, will be found a ready and sufficient assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant upon such an occasion, the author having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veoured to make it as plain and comprehensive as it is concise.</p>

                     <p>LET every thing be done now, that the weather and circumstances will permit, (though not absolutely necessary) in order to lessen the work of <hi>next month,</hi> which when in happens to he an open season, is a very important one in the way of gardening, in which the loss of a single fine day is of consequence. Many things might be prepared in the <hi>winter,</hi> in readiness for <hi>spring,</hi> which are but too often neglected.</p>

                  <p>THE nature of the subject discussed in the following Essay, necessarily required that it should be treated in a scientific man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Author has endeavoured to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as perspicuous as possible; but is afraid, that, to those who may never have been versant in studies of this sort, it may still in some places appear a little abstruse. On this occasion, he hopes to meet with the indulgence of those who think no exertion

of mind improperly bestowed, when it is in the pursuit of useful knowledge.—Others who do not care to engage in intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate discussions of any sort, he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise to pass over this Essay entirely; or at least the <hi>first part</hi> of it. The <hi>reasons</hi> for what is advanced in the second part, will not indeed be in that case so clearly seen; but the practical farmer, if not thoroughly <hi>instructed</hi> by that, may at least be <hi>directed</hi> to what he ought to do.</p>

                  <head>AN ESSAY ON QUICK-LIME.</head>
                  <p>QUICK-LIME is a <hi>calx,</hi> or a very fine powder, obtained by burning marble, chalk, or lime-stone, and afterwards throwing water upon it.</p>
                  <p>This powder, when newly burnt, is soluble <note n="*" place="bottom">Capable of being dissolved. To avoid disagreeable circumlocution, I shall be obliged, in this Essay, to employ some technical terms not commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; but shall explain their meaning as I go along.</note> in water;—is capable of being formed into a firm ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if properly mixed up with water,—and is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of many other peculiar qualities that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary here to enumerate.</p>
                  <p>But if this powder has been exposed to the influence of the air for some time, it is found to be no longer capable of being dissolved in water;—it has become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being formed into a cement, and has lost many of the other peculiar qualities for which it was at first remarkable.</p>
                  <p>In common language, this powder is usually distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by the name of LIME simply. But, in the language of philosophic precision, it is called QUICK-LIME, so long as it remains soluble in water, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being used as a cement. After it loses these properties, it is distinguished by the name of EFFETE-LIME.</p>
                  <p>In either of these states, it is employed by the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer as a manure: And as it is a manure of the most universal utility that has yet been discovered, its nature and qualities deserve to be very particularly investigated.</p>
                  <p>The design of this Essay, is to point out some of the peculiarities that constitute the excellence of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as a manure, and as a cement: And as what may be said of it as a manure, will be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood after its nature as a cement has been explained, it will be necessary to consider it first in that point of view.</p>

                     <p>IF lime-stone or marble be exposed to the action of a pretty intense fire for a sufficient length of time, its colour is altered, and its weight considerably diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but it retains its former figure and dimensions.</p>
                     <p>In this state of burnt stone, it is in many places dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished by the name of <hi>lime-shells,</hi> or <hi>shell-lime,</hi> or simply <hi>shells.</hi>

                     <p>If water be thrown upon these <hi>lime-shells,</hi> a consid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable heat is in a short time generated; the burnt stones begin to crack and fall asunder, and the mass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases in bulk as it gradually crumbles down, or <hi>falls,</hi> as it is more commonly said, into a fine powder; which is always of a white colour, whatever was the colour of the stone before calcination.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                              <hi>Calcination</hi> is the operation by which any solid compact body is, by means of fire, reduced from its former coherent state, to that of a dry incoherent powder, which is called a <hi>calx.</hi>

                     <p>This powder is called <hi>slacked lime,</hi> or simply <hi>lime;</hi> and the operation that reduces it from <hi>shells</hi> to this state is called <hi>slacking.</hi>

                     <head>§ 3.</head>
                     <p>If this powder is intimately mixed with as much water as reduces it to the consistence of a thin paste, and afterwards dried, it concretes into one coherent

mass, which adheres to stones, or other unpolished bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, very firmly; and thus it becomes a proper cement for building walls of any sort.</p>
                     <p>After this paste has been once fully dried, it becomes indissoluble in water, so as never to be softened by the moisture of the air; on which account, it greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels clay, or any other cement that can be easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>This cement, when composed for building walls, is called <hi>mortar.</hi> When intended to be applied only as a smooth coating upon the surface of any place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being mixed with stones, it is called in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try simply <hi>plaster.</hi>

                     <p>It has been found by experience, that the cement made of lime that had been obtained from a lime-stone which consisted of pure <hi>calcerous</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Calcerous</hi> is a general term denoting all those substances that consist of the matter of which lime may be made, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever state it may be found—whether alone—or mixed with other substances, that prevent it from being reduced to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after calcination.</note> earth alone, without any proportion of sand, never attained any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of hardness but remained a soft crumbly mass, that might be easily broken down by any small force applied to it.</p>
                     <p>And, on the contrary, if the original lime-stone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a very large proportion of sand, the cement made of it alone was a much harder, firmer, and more durable substance.</p>
                     <p>And as it was discovered, that the purest lime might be rendered a very firm cement by the addition of a due proportion of clean hard sand, the practice of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sand with lime, when intended for mortar, came to prevail very universally—The oldest lime built walls that are now to be found, clearly show that this practice has been adopted before these were built.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:035770_0430_1006C16A69B9B788"/>
But it still remains a <hi>desideratum</hi> to ascertain the due proportion of sand; as authors, as well as practical masons, differ very much from one another as to this particular.</p>
                     <p>They likewise differ very much in their directions about the mode of mixing the materials, and of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cement;—some modern authors especially, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing amazing effects to a small variation in these particulars, while others deny that these circumstances have any sensible effect on the durability or firmness of the cement.</p>
                     <p>These different and contradictory opinions seem to arise from an imperfect knowledge of the nature of quick-lime, and the variations it may admit of: For, these variations are so very great, as to render it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to give any general rules that can possibly apply in all cases.

                     <p>4<hi>th.</hi> When the chrystals are tolerably perfect, but have had a considerable proportion of sand entangled among them, it is no longer called marble, but <hi>lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi> And this is more or less <hi>pure,</hi> or affords a richer or poorer lime, as it contains a greater or smaller pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of calcareous matter; and is more or less <hi>hard,</hi> according to the degree of perfection of the chrystals.</p>
                     <p>Even the purest calcareous matter, perfectly chrys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallized, is called lime-stone, and not marble, when it consists of small pieces that have not been concreted into regular strata.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>These are all the substances that have hitherto been employed for making lime. The other varieties of calcareous matter, (that I may bring them all under one view, and point out their essential distinctions) are as follow:</p>
                     <p>7<hi>th.</hi> When the calcareous matter, while in its fluid state, has been absorbed into a bed of clayey matter, and with it concreted into an uniform, compact, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrystallized mass, it has been denominated <hi>marle;</hi> which is more or less <hi>pure,</hi> according to the proportion of calcareous matter it contains; and more or less <hi>hard,</hi> according to the nature of the clay, and the proportion of sand that may have been mixed with it. And,</p>
                     <p>8<hi>th.</hi> When <hi>shells,</hi> by the lapse of time, and by long macerating in water, have lost the animals gluten that cemented them, and are crumbled down to a fine whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish powder, they are denominated <hi>shell-marle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9<hi>th.</hi> When shells are broken into down small frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are still hard and gritty, it is called <hi>shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It would be a curious disquisition to inquire how these masses of calcareous matter were originally form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?—How they were reduced to a state that rendered them soluble in water, which must have been the case before they could admit of being chrystallized?—What were the circumstances which contributed to render some of these chrystals so much more perfect than others? &amp;c. &amp;c.—But these disquisitions, however curious they might be, are here omitted, as not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary for the elucidation of our subject. The explanation of the nature of the different calcareous

matters above given, was necessary; as, without a knowledge of these, it would have been impossible to have explained, in a satisfactory manner, the way in which these substances are more or less fitted to be employed as a cement, or a manure.</p>
                     <p>To avoid unnecessary repetitions, the Reader is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to observe, that for the future, I shall mention all maters that can be converted into quick-lime, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>lime-stone,</hi> whether they be in the form of marble, chalk, or common lime-stone, distinguishing either of these when it may become necessary.</p>

                     <p>Lime-stone, in the state we find it, is always a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound substance.—In its purest state, it consists of a calcareous earth, united with a considerable proportion of water; for saline matters, when chrystallized, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways contain water.</p>
                     <p>Lime-stone likewise contains another substance, the nature of which will be afterwards explained.</p>
                     <p>When lime-stone has been exposed for a sufficient length of time to the action of a sufficiently intense fire, the whole of the water it contained is evaporated: So that lime-shells are always lighter than the stone of which they are made, by the whole weight, at loast, of the water the chrystals contained.</p>
                     <p>And as perfect chrystals always contain a much larger proportian of water than those that are less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it follows, that of two kinds of lime-stone of equal <hi>purity,</hi> that which is hardest, and most transparent, will lose a greater proportion of its weight in calcination, than that which is softer and more opaque.—Hence <hi>marble</hi> loses more weight by burning than <hi>chalk.</hi>

                           <p>Such readers as are totally unacquainted with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that are necessary to the formation of chrystals in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, will probably be at a loss easily to comprehend the chain of argumentation followed here, and in some other parts of this Essay. The following explanation will make it more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </p> 
                           <p>As saline matters, properly so called, are more easily chrys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallized by art than any others, it will be best to take our illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations from that class of bodies.</p>
                           <p>It is a property of saline bodies, that they may all be dissolved in water.</p>
                           <p>They may also be separated from that water, and obtained in a dry form; but they assume very different appearances, according to the nature of the process that is followed for sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arating them from that water.</p>
                           <p>If a watery solution of any salt be suddenly evaporated by means of fire, there remains behind a white substance, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times slightly conherent, as in pearl-ashes, &amp;c. and sometimes it falls into a powdery calx, as in evaporating a solution of Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber's salts, alum, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>But if the water be gently evaporated by a moderated heat—before it becomes a dry powder, the salt quits the water, and shoots out into regular figures of a transparent glassy-like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, which have obtained the name of chrystals.</p>
                           <p>These chrystals vary in figure, hardness, &amp;c. according to the nature of the salts of which they are composed.</p>
                           <p>But they all agree in one re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>pect, that they contain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable proportion of water united with the saline matter.—Some kinds of salt absorb a very large proportion of water in this way.—Chrystallized Glauber's salts contain two thirds of their weight of water.—Common salt does not contain near such a large proportion.</p>
                           <p>Hence is happens, that no chrystals of any kind of salt can possibly be formed, unless these salts have been perfectly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in water.</p>
                           <p>And the perfection and transparency of these chrystals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend entirely on their being allowed to shoot leisurely, in that degree of heat which is best adapted to themature of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kind of salt.</p>
                           <p>For it often happens, that water can be made to dissolve a much larger proportion of salt, when it is hot, than when it is cold; so that if a solution of these kinds of salts is continued in a considerable heat, it will still remain fluid, even after it has less water than would be necessary for forming the chrys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.—In which case, if it is taken from the fire, and allowed to cool, it suddenly <hi>concretes</hi> into a solid opaque kind of mass between a chrystal and a calx—as may easily be experienced, by melting chrystallized Clauber's salt in a fire-shovel, and allowing it to cool before it is entirely evaporated to dryness.</p>
                           <p>The same circumstances contribute to the formation of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous matters into chrystals, and may be easily applied by the Reader.—Lime is the <hi>calx</hi> produced by evaporating the chrystals to dryness;—and it only differs from other <hi>saline calces</hi> in this respect, that <hi>they</hi> always retain the quality of being soluble in water, and may be converted into a liquid mass, and again chrystallized what ever that is administered to them:—whereas lime loses that quality in a short time; and if it has not been dissolved, and again chrystallized, in that short space, it must ever remain unalterably in the state it chanced to be in when it lost its saline quality.—Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all the different stages of more or less perfect chrys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallization, from the most transparent spar, or marble, to the most opaque chalk,—from the hardness nearly of a slint, to the looseness of an almost incoherent powder.</p>

Again,—As sand loses, nothing of its weight by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, it likewise follows, that in two kinds of lime-stone equally firm and well chrystallized, the <hi>purest,</hi> or that which contains the greatest proportion of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous

matter, will lose in calcination, the greatest proportion of weight.</p>
                     <p>From these facts it appears, that no rule can be given for ascertaining the proportion of weight <hi>that</hi> lime-stone loses by calcination. It must vary in all possible degrees, according to circumstances.</p>

                     <p>Lime-stone, besides the ingredients abovementioned, contains a considerable proportion of another fluid, that enters into its composition, and greatly alters its chemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal qualities, to which philosophers have given the name of <hi>fixed air.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Since this Essay was written, a total change has taken place in regard to the names of chemical substances—but I do not think it necessary here to make any change in that respect, the terms being here all explained as they occur, so as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ambiguity.</note> This is also disentangled from the stone, and dispersed, in the act of calcination; as has been demonstrated by the very ingenious Dr. Black, of Edinburgh, to whose most satisfactory Essay on this
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035770_0436_1006C186D3919908"/>
subject, in the Physical and Literary Essays, I refer the curious Reader.</p>
                     <p>When lime-stone is thus deprived of its <hi>fixed air,</hi> it acquires many of the properties of saline bodies. It is in consequence of this that it then becomes capable of being dissolved in water,—is extremely acrid,—and acts most powerfully on many bodies upon which it has no sensible effect while in the state of lime-stone.</p>
                     <p>On these accounts, chemists have given it the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>caustic,</hi> when in this state, in contradistinction to its ordinary state before calcination, or after it is again united with its fixed air, when it is said to be in its <hi>mild</hi> state.</p>
                     <p>Hence, then, the phrase <hi>mild</hi> when applied to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous earth, denotes that it is <hi>then</hi> united with its fixed air; which may be said equally of it before cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, when it is called lime-stone; or after calcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, when it is denominated <hi>effete</hi> lime: And <hi>caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> calcareous earth is a phrase exactly synonymous with <hi>quick-lime,</hi> in its strict and philosophical acceptation;—that is, calcareous earth perfectly deteached, in a chemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal sense, from every other substance.</p>

                     <p>But although it is possible by art to free lime-stone from its water and air, and reduce it to the state of an unmixed acrid saline <hi>calx;</hi>—yet no art can keep it long in that state, as it has an irresistible propensity to unite itself again to these substances.</p>
                     <p>If water is poured upon the stone immediately after calcination, which in that state is usually called <hi>lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells,</hi> it has been already said, that it pervades every part of the stone; each particle of the lime seems greed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily to seize some portion of the water, with which it instantly and intimately unites. In the act of union, a considerable heat is generated, and in a short time its whole particles are perfectly detached from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035770_0437_1006C1886BD21038"/>
so as to fall down in the form of a fine, white, and seemingly dry powder, notwithstanding the large quantity of water that is thus united with it.<note n="*" place="bottom">The quantity of water contained in dry slaked lime, is much greater than any one could possible imagine.—By exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iment, I find that <hi>pure</hi> lime <hi>perfectly calcined,</hi> requires <hi>at least</hi> its own weight of water, before it can be reduced to a powder. By the heat generated in the operation, about one tenth of that water is evaporated,—so that the <hi>direst</hi> slaked lime, if pure, consists of about equal parts of calcareous earth and water.—Such as is slaked to the <hi>ordinary degree,</hi> contains a great deal more water than is here mentioned.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>If lime-shells be exposed to the influence of the air, without throwing water upon them, they quickly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract moisture from thence, which slowly, and without any sensible heat, slakes the lime-shells, and reduces them to powder.</p>
                     <p>Still, however, the lime retains its <hi>caustic</hi> quality, even after its partial union with the water: But it as irresistibly, though more slowly, continues to absorb the <hi>air,</hi> as the <hi>water</hi> of which it had been deprived by this calcination, and without intermission, perpetually tends towards that <hi>mild</hi> state which seems to be natural to it.</p>

                     <p>If water is poured upon slaked lime in large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, that water dissolves a certain portion of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line <hi>calx,</hi> which forms the solution called <hi>lime-water,</hi> that has been much praised as a medicine by physicians.</p>
                     <p>But the lime has hardly had time to be dissolved by the water, before the calcareous earth absorbs a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of its fixed air from the water itself, and the surrounding atmosphere; with which it forcibly unites, and immediately again becomes <hi>mild</hi> calcareous earth, or, if you will, lime-stone. And as it is not in <hi>this state</hi> soluble in water, it immediately separates from it, and forms a thin film of chrystallized lime-stone on the surface of the water.</p>
                     <p>

In this way, all the lime is in a short time separated from the lime water; and it quickly loses all those qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities for which it was remarkable, becoming pure and simple water again, unless some caustic lime be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remain at the bottom of the vessel, upon which the water may again act, after what it had formerly dissolved had left it.</p>

                     <p>It is by a process somewhat similar to the former, that calcareous <hi>stalactities</hi> are formed in caverns under the earth, depending from the roof in the form of very large icicles, and other grotesque figures, that afford matter of admiration and astonishment to the curious who visit these subterraneous caverns. It is but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that we are able to give such a distinct account of the operations of nature, as in the present case.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>stalactities</hi> are always formed by water drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from the roof. This water, in these cases, is always slightly impregnated with caustic calcareous matter, which it meets with in the bowels of the earth, and dissolves.—By what process that calcareous matter is there rendered <hi>caustic,</hi> remains as yet to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and affords a subject well worthy the investigation of the curious.<note n="*" place="bottom">Chemical philosophers have now been enabled to account for this phenomenon by the solvent power of certain <hi>gass</hi>—but it is unnecessary here to enter more at large into that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion, as it does not affect the explanation in the text.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This natural lime-water, when it comes to the roof of the cavern, hangs for some time in the form of a drop, till at length so much water is accumulated there, as, by its natural gravity, overcomes the power of cohesion, and makes it fall to the ground. But it is no sooner fallen, than it is again succeeded by anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,—and another,—and so on <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>

While these drops remain suspended from the roof, the calcareous matter contained in them greedily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the air all around the surface of the drop; and before it falls, and small part of it is reduced to a <hi>mild</hi> state, leaves the water with which it was formerly united, and adheres firmly to the roof; which in time accumulates so much solid matter as to form a sort of nipple depending directly downwards.</p>
                     <p>After this nipple is formed, each drop, as it descends, flows from its root towards its point, so as to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused in a thin stream over its whole surface. In this situation, the water is so much exposed to the action of the air in its descent, that a part of the calcareous matter is rendered <hi>mild,</hi> and is left adhering to the former, so as to increase its diameter towards the root; while a part flows forward to the point, and adds to its strength, in the same manner as it first began to be formed.</p>

While these natural <hi>stalactites</hi> are of a small size, they will continue to be regularly formed, and retain the figure of icicles; because the water, as it oozes out, will be sufficient to surround the whole of the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and augment it equally on every side. But, in time, these will become so large, as to cause the water to flow down only on one side, after which the figure will become distorted and irregular. Two or more will sometimes unite into one; and, in the course of ages, and infinite diversity of fantastic forms will grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually be produced which may exhibit, on many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, figures of stupendous magnificence.</p>

                     <p>The operations of nature are so simple, that when we once get a glimpse of the manner in which they are effected in one instance, it is easy to extend our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, in a satisfactory manner, to others of a similar nature. When we once perceive the manner in which calcareous <hi>stalactites</hi> are formed, it is easy to comprehend the way in which more regular strata of calcareous substances have been produced. The same cavern that produces the one, will always afford ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the other.</p>
                     <p>The drop of lime-water that falls from the roof of the cavern, although it has lost some of the calcareous matter with which it was impregnated, still retains a part. When it reaches the ground, it either remains stagnant, so as to form a poole, or flows over a smooth surface. In either of these cases, it will be allowed time to absorb some more of its air; and a part, or the whole, of the calcareous earth will be rendered <hi>mild,</hi> and remain in a firm chrystallized solid caked of marble.</p>
                     <p>If the stream is considerable, the sheet of calcareous matter may be extended to a great distance, thinly spread over a large declivity, as the water flows in its course, till at last the whole cavity may be filled with a regular stratum of lime-stone or marble.</p>

In this manner, within the memory of man, have huge rocks of marble been formed near Matlock, in Derbyshire, which furnish matter of astonishment to those numerous travellers who flock to see this uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon phenomenon. It is seldom that nature's opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are so rapid as in this instance. But there is no room to doubt, that all the strata of calcareous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the world, have been formed by a process exactly similar to this.</p>
                     <p>When the drops are smaller, so as not to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to form a large stream, but still to flow over a small part of the surface, irregular swelling cakes of lime stone are produced.—When smaller still, they rise up into high prominences, with roundish heads,—sometimes resembling collyflower, and sometimes broc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coli-heads.</p>
                     <p>If a current of air hastily promotes the evaporation of the water, the chrystallization will be less perfect. But enough has already been said to illustrate the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I have undertaken.</p>

                     <p>If a large quantity of water be added to fresh slaked quick-lime, and beat up with it into a thin paste, the water dissolves a small proportion of the lime, which, as it gradually absorbs its air, is converted into chrys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; between the particles of which chrystals, that part of the lime which was not dissolved, and the other extraneous matters that may have been mixed with it, are entangled, so as to form a firm coherent mass of the whole.</p>

and perfection of that cement, must depend upon the perfection of the chrystals, and the hardness of the matters that are entangled among them.

                     <p>And as the undissolved lime in this mass will in time absorb its air, and be converted into <hi>mild</hi> calcareous earth without having had a susticiency of water to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to chrystallize, it must concrete into a friable mass, exactly resembling chalk: It follows, that this kind of mortar, when as dry as it can be made, and in its highest degree of perfection, will be always soft, and easily crumbled into powder.</p>

                     <p>And as the granules of sand are perfectly hard of themselves, so as not to admit of being broken down like the particles of chalk, it necessarily follows, that the cement made of these materials must be much more perfect, in every respect, than the former.</p>

                     <p>That the reader may see the full force of the above reasoning, it is necessary be should be informed, that when calcareous matter is reduced to a caustic calx, it becomes, in every sense of the word, a perfect saline substance, and is in this state as entirely soluble in water as common salt or sugar; although with this difference, that lime can be suspended by water only in a much smaller proportion. Water can dissolve one third of its weight of common salt, and keep it sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in a fluid state; but it can hardly dissolve one thousandth part of quick-lime before it is saturated<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>The term <hi>saturation</hi> is employed to denote that state of a fluid, when it has dissolved as much of a solid body as it can possibly suspend in it at one time.</p>
                           <p>When any saline substance is put into water, it is dissolved by the water, and suspended in it till it attains what is called the point of saturation;—after which, if every so much salt be added, not one particle more will be dissolved,—but it will remain at the bottom in its original solid state.</p>
                           <p>Water dissolved very different proportions of different salts before it is saturated. It will dissolved its own weight of Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber's salt, one-third of its weight of common salt, and not one-thousandth of its weight of lime.</p>
                           <p>Hence it may very readily happen, that although any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular salt could be wholly dissolved in water, a part of the salt may remain untouched, if too much has been added. Thus, if one ounce of lime is put into ten ounces of water, that water will become saturated before it shall have dissolved one-third of the quick-lime, and the remainder will remain in a solid state, untouched.</p>

But as the salt is not in this state <hi>perfectly</hi> mild, the caustic part of the alkali attracts the moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure from the air with so much power as soon to obtain enough to reduced the whole to a watery solution, if it is not preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from damp air with the utmost care.</p>

In consequence of this peculiarity, it necessarily happens, that in proportion as these chrystals separate from lime-water, a part of it becomes pure water again, and it instantly capable of dissolving as much
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035770_0447_1006C1B9D4342268"/>
caustic lime as it had lost by the former chrystalliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so that it immediately acts upon, and dissolves another portion of the quick-lime that remained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after the water was saturated. This portion of lime is also chrystallized in its turn, and a fresh solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion takes place; and so on, it continues constantly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035770_0448_1006C1BCEAD151A8"/>
chrystallizing and dissolving anew, as long as any caustic lime remains in the water to be dissolved.</p>
                     <p>It is in consequence of this constant action of the water and air, that lime-water always continues of an equal degree of strength, so long as any caustic lime remains in the vessel for the water to act upon, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the large proportions of calcareous chryst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als that are continually separating from it.</p>

                     <p>From the foregoing induction, it appears, that when a large quantity of sand is mixed in the mortar, that sand will bear a great proportion to the whole mass; so that the water that may be mixed with the mortar will be much greater in proportion to the quantity of lime contained in this mortar, than if the whole had consisted of pure calcareous matter.—And as the sand absorbs none of that water, after a part of the lime is chrystallized, and separated from the water, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, now pure, is left at liberty to act once more upon those few particles of caustic lime that may still remain in the mortar, which will be dissolved and converted into chrystals in their turn.</p>
                     <p>In this manner, it may happen, in some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that a very large proportion of the lime may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come chrystallized; so that the mortar shall consist almost entirely of sand enveloped in chrystalline mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and become, in due time, as hard as stone itself; whereas mortar, consisting of pure lime, without sand, can hardly ever be much harder than chalk.</p>

                     <p>It is not, however, to be expected, that in any case, this dried mortar will assume that transparent chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line from, or the compact firmness of marble, or lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.—In mortar, in spite of the utmost care that can ever be taken, a very considerable quantity of the lime
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035770_0449_1006C1C0880BD468"/>
must remain undissolved; which undissolved lime, although it may be so much separated by the sand and chrystallized lime-stone, as not much to affect the hardness of the mortar, yet it must still retain its white chalky-like appearance.</p>
                     <p>But, as marble and lime-stone, are always formed by those particles of lime that have been wholly dissolved in water, and from which, they have been gradually separated by a more slow and more perfect mode of chrystallization, they have nothing of that opaque <hi>calx</hi>-like appearance, but assume other colours, and appear more firm, uniform, and compact; the sand, and other matters that may be enveloped in them, being entirely surrounded with a pure chrystallized matter.</p>

                     <p>To obtain the most perfect kind of mortar, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is not enough that a large proportion of sand should be employed, and that the sand should be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately mixed with the lime. It is also of the utmost importance, that a large proportion of water be added: For, without this, it is impossible that a large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lime can be chrystallized; and the mortar, in that case, would consist only of a mixture of chalky matter and sand, which could hardly be made to unite all—would be little more coherent than sand by itself, and less so that pure chalk. In that case, pure lime alone would afford rather a firmer cement than lime with sand.</p>

                     <p>It is also of very great importance, that the water he retained as long in the mortar as possible: For, if it be suddenly evaporated, it will not only be prevented from acting a second time upon the lime, after a part of what was first dissolved has been chrystallized, but of even the few chrystals that would be formed when the water was suddenly evaporating, would be of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035770_0450_1006C1C3FAF0D248"/>
much more imperfect than they otherwise most certainly would have been.</p>
                     <p>Common salt, which consists of chrystals hastily formed by a sudden evaporation of sea-water by means of fire, has the appearance of a dry whitish calx, that may be easily broken to pieces:—The same salt, when slowly chrystallized by a gentle evaporation in the shade, consists of large cubical chrystals, as transparent, and little softer, than crown-glass.</p>
                     <p>Ordinary lump sugar, it has been said, likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of another substance hastily concreted by a sudden evaporation of the fluid in which it was dissolved:—Sugar-candy, is the same substance, slowly chrystallized by a more moderate evaporation. Every one knows, what a difference there is between the firmness of these two substance. As great must be the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firmness of that cement which has been slowly dried, and that which has been hastily hardened by the powerful action of warm air.</p>
                     <p>It is owing to this circumstance, that the lime which remains all winter in a mortar-tub filled with water, is always found to be much firmer, and more coherent than the mortar that was taken from the same tub, and used in any work of masonry; although, in this case, the materials were exactly the same. From the same cause, any work cemented with lime under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if it has been allowed to remain unhurt till it has once become hard, is always much firmer than that which is above the surface of the water.</p>

                     <p>To make the reader comprehend the full force of the foregoing reasoning, I would compare lime-ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or mortar, to a mass of matter consisting of a congeries of stones closely compacted together, and united by a strong cementing matter, that had, while in a said state, pervaded all the interstices between the stones, and had afterwards become a solid indissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble substance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="unknown:035770_0451_1006C1CB12131EF8"/>
If the cementing matter be exceedingly hard and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, and if the stones bedded among it are also very hard and firm, the whole mass will become like a solid rock, without fissures, that can hardly be broken to pieces by the power of man.</p>
                     <p>But although the cement should be equally firm, if the stone of which it consists be of a soft and friable nature, suppose chalk or sand-stone, the whole mass will never be capable of attaining such a degree of firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as in the former case; for, when any force is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to break it in pieces, although the cement should keep its hold, the solid matter cemented by it would give way, and the whole would be easily broke to pieces.</p>
                     <p>Now—in mortar, the sand that is added to it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the stones of a solid matter in the composition, the particles of which are united together by the lime that had been formerly dissolved, and now chrystallized, which becomes an exceedingly solid and indissoluble concretion.</p>
                     <p>And as the particles of sand are of themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly hard, and the cement by which they are united equally so, it is plain, that the whole concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must become extremely firm, so as to require a very great force to disunite any particle of it from the whole mass.</p>
                     <p>But if, instead of employing sand, the only solid body that is entangled among the cementing matter should be chalk (which, as has been said, must always be the case when the mortar consists of pure lime alone) or any other slightly coherent substance, let the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting particles of that composition be ever so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is impossible that the whole can ever attain a great degree of firmness; as these chalky matters will be easily broken asunder.</p>

                     <p>Many conjectures have been made about the nature of the lime-cement employed by the Ancients. It has
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035770_0452_1006C1CCC33EF2A8"/>
been thought they possessed an art of making mortar, that has been long since entirely lost; as the cement in the walls that have been built by them, appears to be, in many cases, much firmer than that which has been made in modern times.—Yet, when the mortar of these old buildings is analized, it is found to consist of the same materials, and nearly in the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which we now employ.</p>
                     <p>It is probable, however, that their only secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in mixing the materials more perfectly than the rapidity or avarice of modern builders will permit; in employing their mortar in a much more fluid state than we do now; and in allowing it to dry more slowly, which the immoderate thickness of many of their walls would naturally produce, without any preconcerted design on their part.</p>
                     <p>Tradition has even handed down to our times the memory of the most essential of these particulars; as the lower class of people, in every part of the country, at this moment, invariably believe that these old walls were composed of a mortar so very thin, as to admit of its being poured, like a fluid, between the stones, after they were laid in the wall. And the appearance of these old walls, when taken down, seems to favour this popular tradition.</p>
                     <p>Nor have I any doubt but this may have been actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the case. The stones in the outer part of the wall were probably bedded in mortar, nearly as we prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise at present; and the heart, after being packed well with irregular stones, might have the interstices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them entirely filled up with fluid mortar, which would insinuate itself into every cranny, and in time adhere as firmly as the stones themselves, or even more so, if the stones were of a sandy friable nature.</p>
                     <p>As these walls were usually of very great thickness, it might often happen that the water in this mortar, by acting successively upon different particles of caustic-lime, would at length be entirely absorbed by succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035770_0453_1006C1D6247CD200"/>
chrystallizations, so as to become perfectly dry, without any evaporation at all; in which case, a very large proportion of the original lime must have been regularly chrystallized in a slow and tolerably perfect manner, so as to attain a firmness little inferior to lime-stone or marble itself.</p>
                     <p>Upon these principles, it is easy to account for the superior hardness of some old cement, when compared with that of modern times, in which a practice very different is usually followed, without having recourse to any wonderful <hi>arcana</hi> whatever.</p>

                     <p>A modern French author, <hi>Monsieur Loriot,</hi> after meditating much upon this subject, imagines, he has made a perfect discovery of the way in which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients employed their quick-lime, so as to obtain such an extraordinary firm cement; from which discovery, he thinks very important benefits may be derived to society.</p>
                     <p>According to his opinion, the ancient cement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of lime and sand, nearly in the same proportions as are commonly employed, for that purpose at present. But instead of making it of slaked lime entirely, as we do now, he says they employed a certain proportion of their lime <hi>unslaked,</hi> which they mixed with their mortar immediately before it was used.</p>
                     <p>This composition, he says, forms a firm and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cement, possessing so many valuable properties, that I choose to give them in words of his own pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrist:</p>

                           <hi>Loriot</hi> had the happiness to discover a kind of mystery in Nature, which for several ages past, had not, it is most probable, manifested itself to any body but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;—a mystery on which all the merit of his discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is founded.</p>
                        <p>Taking some lime which had been a long time slaked, out of a pit covered with boards, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable quantity of earth over them again, by which means the lime had preserved all its original freshness, he made two parts of it, and plashed and beat them both perfectly well.</p>
                        <p>He then put one of these parts, without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, into a glazed earthen pot, and in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion set it to dry of itself in the shade. Here, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as it lost its moisture by evaporation, it cracked and split in every direction; parted from the sides of the pot, and crumbled into a thousand pieces, all of them equally friable with the bits of lime dried up with the sun, which we usually meet on the banks of our lime-pits.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is impossible, in reading this Essay, not to remark the extreme ignorance or inaccuracy of the compiler of it, on many occasions. The present paragraph affords a proof of it. There can be no doubt, but that lime, if it has been <hi>very long slaked,</hi> will lose all its qualities as a <hi>quick-lime,</hi> and become perfectly <hi>effette,</hi> let it be ever so carefully covered.—He gives no other test of the lime being still possessed of its caustic qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, but that it was covered.—For ought that appears, it might have been entirely <hi>effette</hi>-lime; in which case, it is not at all surprising if it should not be capable of being converted into a cement of any kind.—Indeed the effects he describes, could only arise from its having been actually in this state: For, there is no man, who does not know, that lime which has been some time slaked, may, on many occasions, be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as a cement, which, at least, is capable of adhering together, and not falling down at once into a loose powder as it dries.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>

With regard to the other part, Monsieur Loriot, just added to it one-third of its quantity of powdered quick-lime, and then had the whole well kneaded, in order to make the two kinds of lime perfectly incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with each other. This done, he put this mixture likewise into a glazed earthen pot, as he had done the first; when, behold, it soon began to heat, and, in the space of a few minutes, acquired a degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence equal to the best plaster, when prepared in the best manner. In short, it set and consolidated as readily as metals in fusion when taken from the fire, and turned out a kind of instantaneous lapidification, having dried completely within a very small space of time, and that too without the least crack or flaw; nay, it adhered so strongly to the sides of the pot, as not to be parted from them without breaking it.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>As to this passage, I shall only say, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the above experiment several times, with all the accuracy I was capable of; with this only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that I employed lime that had lain a consid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time beat up with water, as is usual, to allow it to <hi>sour,</hi> in the common language of masons, instead of lime that had been long covered up in a pit, like that which he employed.</p>
                     <p>The result was, what any man who bestows a mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate degree of attention to the subject, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of masons, might have expected,—but extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from that of Monsieur Loriot.</p>
                     <p>The paste made of the old slaked lime alone, dried slowly,—became in time a mass slightly coherent, somewhat harder than chalk, it having been very pure lime I employed, without sand or any other addition.</p>
                     <p>That which was made with the same slaked lime, with one-third of its quantity of unslaked lime reduced to powder, kneaded through it, did indeed heat, as is
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035770_0456_1006C1E106168860"/>
usual in all cases when the lime is slaked,—swelled up, as is also usual;—but acquired no degree of hardness greater than the other, nor differed in any respect from it, excepting that it absorbed the water more quickly; and in a day or so after it was kneaded up, when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came pretty dry, some particles of lime-stone, which had not been burnt so perfectly as the rest, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore longer of slaking, began to heave up afresh, having lain till this time unslaked.</p>
                     <p>On this account, although it must only be considered as an accidental misfortune that will not always hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, it was evidently a much worse cement than the other.</p>
                     <p>Such is the fact. Nor is it easy to see a reason why any beneficial consequences should result from the practice recommended.—It is well known, that if water be added to burnt lime-stone <hi>in any way,</hi> the first effect is, that it heats, swells, and falls down to a powder.—Even under the water, the effect is the same. After that powder is formed, it may, by remaining under water, concrete into a solid mass; but with whatever substances it is mixed, it must first separate before it unites. In the name of common sense, then, where can be the difference in first reducing it to that powdery state, and then beating it up with the water; or in pouring the water that is necessary to reduce it to powder upon it, and allowing that powder to remain as it may fall, without being beat up with the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials?—Some of the watery particles will at first be absorbed, which is evidently a loss to the mortar; and the lime will be far less intimately mixed with the other ingredients, than if it had been properly blended and heat up with them after it was in its smallest powdery state; which must tend to render the mortar still less perfect.</p>
                     <p>Monsieur Loriot's panegyrist, however, is at no loss to produce reasons for these wonderful effects, that seem to him to be entirely satisfactory. He thus proceeds:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>

The result of this addition of the quick-lime, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising as at first sight it might seem, is, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so easily explained and accounted for, that it seems somewhat strange that Monsieur Loriot should be the first to suspect and discover it. In fact, what can be plainer than that the sudden setting and consolidating of these two substances must necessarily arise from the quick-lime's being carried, by a perfect amalgamation, or admixture, into the inmost recefles of the slaked lime, saturating itself with the moisture it there meets with, and thereby effecting that instantaneous and absolute deliccation<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>Any one who has bestowed a moderate degree of attention to the operation of slaking lime, as it is usually performed, must have observed many instances of that sort of sudden desic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,—but without perceiving any of the other effects her mentioned.</p>
                              <p>In slaking lime-stones, especially when of the purest sort, so much water is necessary, and it is imbibed so slowly, that the operators, knowing it will be all drunk up in due time, often to throw so much on one place at once, as to reduce it to almost a fluid state.—This water soon sinks through it to the unslaked lime below.—But if the lime on the top was regularly slaked before the last effusion of water, it retains a smooth uniform surface, like plaster, is dried almost entirely in a few minutes,—and, if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not broke by the swelling of the lime below, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ever afterwards to retain that form without crumbling away at all. If this is allowed to dry perfectly, and no more water is poured on it, till it has absorbed all its air, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect chalk. It has the same hardness, consistency, &amp;c. and cannot be distinguished from it, either in appearance or by any other property.</p>
                              <p>This, however, will never be the case, unless the lime has been perfectly pure, so as to dissolve in acids as entirely as sugar does in water.</p>
                           </note>, which, because we are so well accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, we so little mind in the use of gypses or plaster?"</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>If I understand this paragraph, it means neither more nor less than that these two substances unite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they necessarily do unite most perfectly. If it has any other meaning, I am dull enough not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>

Let it suffice to observe, that the author proceeds to tell, that this newly discovered cement dries and hardens almost under the hand of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, without cracks or flaws of any sort;<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 31.</note> that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expands nor contracts with the air;<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 32.</note>—that it is impervious to moisture,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>—and may not only be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for making roofs to houses that are subjected to the continual dropping of water,<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 44.</note> basons, acqueducts, canals,<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 44,45,46.</note> &amp;c. that will instantly contain water in any quantities, but even finer works of the pottery kind:<note n="¶" place="bottom">P. 52.</note> that it perfectly resists frosts; with a long <hi>et coetera</hi> of other qualities which it would be tiresome to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; for an account of which I must refer to the pamphlet itself.</p>
                     <p>That Monsieur Loriot has not discovered a cement possessing these peculiar qualities, it would be unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in me to say; seeing <hi>it is affirmed,</hi> that works have been erected with it that prove that facts in the clearest manner. But that such effects will be inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably produced, merely by adding a certain proportion of unslaked lime in powder to mortar, as he asserts, or even by making the mortar entirely with powdered quick-lime, I may without hesitation venture to deny, not only from the reasoning above given, but from actual experiment again and again repeated by myself; which is likewise in some measure corroborated by the experience of Mr. Dossie.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>Although Mr. Dossie recommends his new discovered cement for many qualities, yet he differs extremely from M. Loriot in his account of the manner in which the union is effected: For, instead of saying that 'it consolidates as readily as metals in fusion when newly taken from the fire,' he says, 'it continues soft for some time, and only gradually hardens in the air.' See Dossie's Mem. of Agriculture, vol. 11. p. 20.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Dossie does indeed ascribe to his cement some of the same qualities that M. Loriot attributes to his.—Some of these, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are common to every sort of lime-mortar, when care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made; and were it not a little foreign from our subject, it would be no difficult matter to show in what manner an inexperienced person might have his judgement missed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to some of the other qualities that may be called more equivocal.—The imagination is a more powerful magician than all the wise men of Egypt!</p>
                        </note>

                        <pb n="37" facs="unknown:035770_0459_1006C1EC76861970"/>
For these reasons, I am induced to think, that if Monsieur Loriot has really experienced these uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon effects from the mortar he has tried, it must have been occasioned by some other unobserved peculiarity, and not merely by the circumstance to which he seems to ascribe it. Possibly it may have been impregnated with <hi>gypsum,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Gypsum</hi> is an earthly salt, consisting of the vitriolic acid and calcareous earth.—It is best known among artizans in this country, by the name of <hi>Plaster of Paris.</hi>
                        </note> a saline substance, naturally abounding in France; and as one of its principal ingredients is lime-stone, there is nothing extraordinary in its being found in the same quarry chrystallized along with the lime-stone, nor any impossibility of its escaping unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed, on some occasions, during the calcination of the lime. Or it may perhaps have been otherwise accidentally mixed with the lime in these experiments.</p>
                     <p>But in whatever way the <hi>gypsum</hi> may come there, if it be present, it is not to be doubted but effects similar in kind (though not in degree) to what M. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot describes, would, in some measure, result from the practice he recommends: For, if <hi>gypsum</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its moisture by calcination, it becomes a fine powder, greatly resembling the purest lime, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulates, if I may use that phrase, immediately upon the addition of water, and acquires at once all the firmness that it ever can be made to attain.</p>
                     <p>These properties of <hi>gypsum</hi> have been long well enough known; but it never acquires the stony hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that lime-cement is sometimes endowed with, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035770_0460_1006C1F26F9E4308"/>
it takes the smoothest polish of any cement we know: on which account, it has long been employed as a plaster where fine ornaments are required.</p>
                     <p>I have bestowed more attention on this performance of M. Loriot than my own opinion of its importance would have exacted from me; and it is purely in def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence to the opinion of others that I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to account for some of those <hi>phoenomena</hi> he describes, supposing they have really happened. The inaccurate and unscientific manner in which that pamphlet is written, makes it afford the philosophic reader but very little satisfaction; and that affectation of the marvellous which runs through the whole, and the many hyperbolic compliments paid to M. Loriot with which it abounds, are but ill calculated for giving the reader a favourable opinion of the intention of the compiler. Future experiments will bring to light those circumstances which seem to be at present doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and mysterious.—I now proceed to point out some other circumstances, that may influence the quality of lime-mortar.</p>

                  <div n="25" type="section">

                     <p>If lime-stone be sufficiently caleined, it is deprived of all its moisture, and of <hi>all</hi> its fixed air. But experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shows, that lime-stone will fall to a powder on the effusion of water upon it, when it is much less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly calcined, and while it still retains almost the whole of its fixed air. And as masons have hardly any other rule for judging whether lime-stone be sufficiently calcined, except this single circumstance of its falling to a powder when water is poured upon it, we may thus easily perceive, that the same lime may be more or less fitted for making good mortar, according to a circumstance that, in a great measure, eludes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of operative masons: For, if it should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that all the lime-shells drawn from a kiln at one time, were just sufficiently calcined to make it fall to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035770_0461_1006C1FB2F8154C8"/>
a powder with water, and no more, that powder would be altogether unfit for making mortar of any kind.</p>
                     <p>This is a case that can seldom happen.—But as there are a great many intermediate degrees between that state and perfect calcination, it must often happen that the stone will approach nearer to one of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes at one time, than at another, so that mortar may be much more perfect at one time than at anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; owing to a variation as to this particular.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="26" type="section">
                     <head>§ 26.</head>
                     <p>Every author who has written on the subject of lime as a cement, has endeavoured to ascertain what is the due proportion of sand for making the most perfect cement. But a little attention to the subject will show, that all rules that could be prescribed as to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, must be so vague and uncertain, as to be of little use to the practical mason. For,</p>
                     <p>Besides the variation that may arise from a more or less perfect degree of calcination, and which has just now been taken notice of, it is a certain fact, that some kinds of lime-stone are much more pure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a much smaller proportion of sand, than others do.</p>
                     <p>I have examined lime-stone that was so perfectly free from any mixture of sand whatever, as to dissolve in acids as entirely as sugar does among water: I have also tried another kind that contained eleven-twelfths of its whole weight of sand, and only one-twelfth part of lime; and have met with other sorts in all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate proportions between these two extremes.</p>
                     <p>Now it would surely be absurd to say, that the pure lime would require as small a proportion of sand when made into mortar, as that which originally contained in itself a much larger proportion of sand than any writer on the subject has ever ventured to prescribe for being put into mortar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="unknown:035770_0462_1006C1FCC63CA630"/>
What adds to this uncertainty is, the variation that may arise from the circumstance last mentioned, <abbr>
                           <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </abbr> the greater or less perfect degree of calcination that the stone may have undergone. For it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that although lime-stone, when pure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a very intense degree of heat to convert it into a <hi>vitrified</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">A <hi>vitrified</hi> substance is one that has been melted by heat, and assumes somewhat of a glass-like appearance.</note> mass; yet when sand is mixed with the lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone in certain proportions, a very moderate heat is sufficient to convert the whole mass into vitrified <hi>scorioe,</hi> or in the common language of the country, make it <hi>run into danders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From this circumstance, it happens, that those who are possessed of a very impure lime-stone, are obliged to be extremely cautious not to give it an over propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fuel, lest it should vitrify the stone; and they are very happy if they can get their stone calcined just enough to make it fall with water, and no more; so that, in general, it may be presumed, that a very large proportion of <hi>such</hi> lime is <hi>never</hi> so sufficiently burnt as to be reduced to a perfectly caustic state, or to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of forming a cement.</p>
                     <p>But as there is no danger at any time of giving <hi>pure</hi> lime-stone too much fire, those who possess such a lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone are not under the necessity of being afraid of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on that side: And as it is a loss to them if the whole does not fall after it is drawn from the kiln, it is natural to think they will in general give it a full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of fuel. From hence it may be reasonably concluded, that, in general, a much larger proportion of this kind of stone will be perfectly calcined, than of the other sort.</p>
                     <p>At a venture, we may with some show of probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, conclude, that about one-tenth of <hi>pure</hi> lime-stone is not enough calcined to admit of being made into mortar; and that, of the most impure sorts of lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035770_0463_1006C2004F75F648"/>
stone, not above one-fourth part of the lime contained in it is so much calcined as to be in a caustic state.</p>
                     <p>Let us see what variation this ought to produce as to the proportion of sand that might be added to the lime in the one or the other case: and, that the calculation may be more easily made, we shall suppose that the poorest lime-stone that is ever burnt, contains one-tenth of its whole weight of lime.</p>
                     <p>Ten parts of pure lime, before it could be reduced to the same degree of sandiness with the other, without considering the variation that arises from the burning, would require each of them nine parts of sand to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Therefore, ninety parts of sand should be added to the ten, to reduce them to an equality with the other lime in its native state.</p>
                     <p>But if we are likewise to take into the account the variation above supposed, that arises from their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent degrees of calcination, the account will stand thus:</p>
                     <p>Of the ten parts of pure lime, one is supposed to be not enough burnt to be capable of acting as a cement; so that there remains nine only in a perfectly caustic state.</p>
                     <p>Of the ten parts of impure lime, nine are sand, and only one is lime;—and from this one is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced three-fourths as not enough calcined. Hence there remains just one-fourth of one tenth-part (one-fortieth) of pure caustic lime.</p>
                     <p>But this fortieth part of the whole is united to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-nine other equal parts of sand and uncalcined lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
                     <p>There remained nine whole tenth parts of the pure lime in a caustic state; to each of which must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thirty-nine tenths, including the one-tenth of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calcined lime;—so that to reduce it to the same state with the former, there would need to be three hundred and fifty parts of sand added.</p>
                     <p>It seems to be altogether inconceivable, that such a small proportion of calcareous matter could ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035770_0464_1006C204AE008CE0"/>
sufficient to cement firmly together such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious mass of other matters: Nor do I pretend to say, that this could actually be the case, as there may be some error in the <hi>data.</hi> The following, however, I know to be a fact:</p>
                     <p>The best modern mortar I ever saw, was made of lime, that I myself had analysed, and found it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eleven parts of sand to one of lime. To this there was added between twice and thrice its whole bulk of sand <hi>by measure;</hi> which may be allowed to have been at least three times its quantity <hi>by weight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, supposing that every particle of that lime had been so perfectly calcined as to be in a caustic state, there could not be less than forty-seven parts of sand to one of lime. The reader may allow what he pleases for the uncaustic part of the lime, and make his calculation accordingly. But it is hardly possible to suppose, that above one-hundredth part of this mass, independent of the water, consisted of pure caustic cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous earth.</p>
                     <p>But, whatever was the exact proportion of caustic lime, the mortar was made of these materials in the proportions expressed, and was employed for pinning the outside joints of the stone-walls of a house situated in a tempestuous climate, and exposed to every blast. It is now about fourteen years since it was finished; and I do not believe there has fallen to the ground, in all that time, one pound weight of the mortar.<note n="*" place="bottom">After seven years longer trail, the mortar still proves good and firm, and exhibits no appearance of ever falling.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Had this mortar been employed in building a thick wall, where it would have been suffered to dry slow enough, there seems to be little reason to doubt but it would in time have become as firm as the stones of the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l itself.</p>
                     <p>From these considerations we may clearly see, that it is impossible to prescribe any determinate proportion
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035770_0465_1006C20D80B778C0"/>
of sand to lime, as that must vary according to the nature of the lime, and other incidental circumstances, which it would be tiresome to enumerate, and which would form an infinity of exceptions to any general rule.</p>
                     <p>But it would seem we might safely infer, that the moderns in general, rather err in giving too little sand, than in giving too much.</p>
                     <p>It deserves, however, to be remarked, that the sand, when naturally in the lime-stone, is more intimately blended with the lime, than can possibly be ever effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any mechanical operation;—so that it would be in vain to hope to make good mortar artificially from pure lime, with such a small proportion of caustic cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous matter as may sometimes be effected when the lime naturally contains a very large proportion of sand. But, there seems to be no doubt, that if a much larger proportion of sand were employed, and if that were more carefully blended and expeditiously worked than is common, the mortar would be much more perfect than usual in modern times.</p>
                     <p>This I have tried experimentally, with the desired success.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="27" type="section">
                     <head>§ 27.</head>
                     <p>Another circumstance that tends greatly to vary the quality of the cement, and to make a greater or small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proportion of sand necessary, is the mode of prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lime before it is beaten up into mortar.</p>
                     <p>When lime is to be employed for making plaster, it is of great importance that every particle of the lime-stone be slaked before it is worked up: For, as the smoothness of the surface is the circumstance most wished for in plaster, if any particles of lime should be beaten up in it, and employed in work before they had had sufficient time to <hi>fall,</hi> the water still continuing to act upon them after it was worked up, would infallibly <hi>slake</hi> these particles, which would then expand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035770_0466_1006C20F47B25640"/>
with great force, and produce those excrescences upon the surface of the plaster, that are commonly known by the name of <hi>blisters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence, therefore, if we hope to obtain a perfect kind of plaster, that shall remain smooth on the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and free of blisters, there is an absolute necessity to allow the lime to lie for a considerable time mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in water before it is worked up.</p>
                     <p>This operation is called in this country, <hi>souring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the lime-stone be pure, and has been very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly calcined, there will be little danger but that the whole of the lime will fall at first: But if it has been less perfectly burnt, there will be many particles that will require to lie a long time before they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to powder. This operation is therefore more necessary with impure than pure lime; but it ought on no occasion to be omitted, as there is not the smallest probability but <hi>some</hi> blisters would appear on plaster made even of the <hi>purest</hi> lime, if worked up and used immediately after it has been slaked.</p>
                     <p>It is also a common practice to <hi>sour</hi> the lime when it is intended to be used in <hi>mortar.</hi> And although it is not so indispensably necessary in this case as when it is intended for plaster, yet, if properly performed, it is evident, that it must, even here, be of use; as any dry knots that may fall after the mortar is used, must tend to disunite the parts of it that had been already united, and render the cement much less perfect than if the whole had been properly mixed up with the materials before using.</p>
                     <p>But more circumspection is requisite in souring lime for mortar, than for plaster. For,</p>
                     <p>As it is not necessary that plaster should be endowed with a stony degree of hardness, there is no loss sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by allowing a great proportion of the lime that is intended for that purpose, to absorb its air before it be used; for a very small quantity of <hi>quick-lime</hi> will be-sufficient to unite the whole into one slightly coherent mass.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:035770_0467_1006C21441929E50"/>
Therefore, the only circumstance necessary to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in souring lime for plaster, is, that it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to macerate long enough, as there is no danger of ever erring on the opposite extreme. It is indeed necessary that it should lie a very long time on some occasions, before we can be certain that all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are thoroughly slaked. I have known pieces of lime-shells lie upwards of six months exposed to all the vicissitudes of winter-weather, and <hi>fall</hi> after that time. Such slightly burnt stones are indeed usually separated in sifting the lime for plaster; but as some small chips may escape, it is always safest to allow it to lie <hi>in the sour</hi> a very long time.</p>
                     <p>This practice is also attended with another advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of some consequence.—For, if by this means a great proportion of the lime be allowed to absorb its air, and become <hi>effette,</hi> when it is beaten up for use, the water can have no sensible effect upon that <hi>effette</hi>-lime—it will only separate the particles of caustic lime more perfectly from one another, so as to suffer it to dry without cracks of any sort, and render the surface of the plaster much more smooth and entire than it could have been if the whole had been employed while in its perfectly caustic state. By this means also, those chrystalline exudations, so common on newly plastered walls, will be most effectually obviated. On all which accounts, the practice of allowing lime intended for plaster to macerate <hi>very long</hi> with water, ought never to be omitted but in cases of necessity.</p>
                     <p>But as lime is no sooner slaked than it begins to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorb its air, and as it continues to absorb more and more every minute from that period, till it becomes entirely <hi>effette,</hi> so as to be rendered gradually less and less fit for forming a cement of any sort:—it follows, that if lime intended for <hi>mortar</hi> is allowed to lie long <hi>in the sour,</hi> much of it will be converted into chalk, or unchrystallized <hi>effette-lime;</hi> in which condition it will neither admit of so much sand in using, nor ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035770_0468_1006C21620F178C0"/>
such a firm cement, as if a larger proportion of sand had been employed at first, and worked up as quickly as possible into mortar, and used.</p>
                     <p>This malady will be increased, if the lime-stone has not been very well burnt; therefore care ought to be taken to choose the very best burnt lime for <hi>mortar;</hi> in which case, a very short time, if it has been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sifted after slaking, will be sufficient to make it <hi>fall</hi> as much as is necessary. For the object of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal importance here, is to have the cement as <hi>firm</hi> as possible; and the bursting of a very small particle of unslaked lime amongst it afterwards, will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such a sensible inconvenience as it would have done in plaster.</p>
                     <p>Those, therefore, who wish to obtain the hardest and firmest <hi>mortar,</hi> will be careful to get <hi>well-burnt</hi> lime, and allow it to macerate with the water only a <hi>very short time</hi> before it is used. But the best burnt lime I ever saw, would require to macerate some days in the water, before there can be a certainty that the whole will be sufficiently slaked.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>It is no unsatisfactory proof of the justness of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reasoning, to observe, that the practice which would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow from it, is exactly what was followed by the ancients, if we can rely on the account given of this matter by <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and <hi>Pliny.</hi>

                           <p>Pliny points out, still more clearly, the difference between the quality of the lime necessary for making <hi>mortar</hi> and <hi>plaster</hi>—a certain proof that the ancients had been very accurate in observing <hi>facts,</hi> as they could have no idea of the reasoning by which these facts might have been explained or corroborated.</p>
                           <p>'Ruinarum urbis,' says he, 'ea maxime causa, quod furto, calcis <hi>sine ferrumine suo coementa</hi> componuntur. <hi>Intrita</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que <hi>quo vetuslior, eo melior.</hi> In antiquarum (antiquis) aedium legibus invenitur, ne recentiore trima uteretur redemptor; <hi>idio nulla (nullae) tectoria eorum rimoe foedavere.'</hi> Plin. Hist. lib. xxxvi. cap. 23.</p>
                           <p>In this passage, Pliny strongly contrasts <hi>mortar (coementa)</hi> with <hi>plaster (intria.)</hi> The first, he says (by implication) ought always to be composed of lime <hi>cum ferrumine suo,</hi> that is, lime that still retains its <hi>gluten,</hi>—lime that still retains that quality by which it is enabled to unite detached matters into a solid body, and <hi>glue</hi> them as it were together. In other places of his work, he describes it as <hi>calcis quam vehementis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simoe,</hi> lime in its most acid state, that is, perfectly <hi>caustic</hi> lime.</p>
                           <p>This quality, he plainly hints, it gradually loses by time, so as to come at length to be <hi>sine ferrunune suo;</hi> in which state, as it is impossible to become a firm cement for building, he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reprehends those who use it as such.</p>
                           <p>But although he condemns the practice of using that old and inert lime for mortar, he immediately adds, that for plaster it is better than new, because it is not so subject to crack in the work. "<hi>Intrita</hi> quoque quo vetustior, eo melior—<hi>ideo nulla tectoria eorum rimoe foedavere."</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Monsieur Loriot quotes this passage, and contends, that <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis sine ferrumine suo,</hi> means merely slaked lime, in opposition to his favourite powdered lime-shells.—What reason he has to think so, the reader is left to judge.—It is to be observed, however, that Monsieur Loriot does not confine the use of his cement to making mortar.—Like those medicines that cure all diseases, it is equally proper for plaster, and indeed it is as a plaster he chiefly recommends it. There can be no doubt, however, from the authorities above quoted, that the <hi>Ancients</hi> were as great strangers to the use of it in this sense, as the <hi>Moderns.</hi>

                     <p>The reader, if he has followed me thus far, will easily perceive, that although it be in vain to expect those wonderful effects from the practice recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Monsieur Loriot, that he so pompously describes, yet it may happen, that if circumstances accidentally
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035770_0470_1006C222CA194038"/>
concur to that end, a very perfect mortar may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by following his directions. For, if the slak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lime that shall be employed has not had time to become, in a great measure, <hi>effette;</hi>—if the unslaked shells that are to be pounded have been <hi>perfectly</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined;—if the lime-stone has been of a sandy sort of itself;—if the sand added to it has been of a proper kind, and in due proportion; and if these materials be carefully mixed before they are applied, there can be no doubt but the mortar would be very good: So that it may <hi>sometimes</hi> happen, that those who follow the practice recommended by him, in making mortar for ordinary uses, may be lucky enough to succeed to their wish. But, as these favourable circumstances may not chance to occur in other cases, they may be at other times very far from succeeding.</p>
                     <p>That gentleman, with his usual want of accuracy, takes no notice of any of these circumstances.—He only recommends that powdered quick-lime, by which he means pounded lime-shells, be mixed up with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mortar, made of old slaked lime, in certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions. He does not give the smallest hint as to the state of <hi>old slaked lime</hi> to be used as common mortar; but seems to think it a matter of no moment, whether it shall have been so long slaked, as to be perfectly <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fette,</hi> or the reverse;—he does not, indeed, seem to know any thing about that peculiarity of lime distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by that term.</p>
                     <p>But, independent of that circumstance, the practice he recommends is much worse in other respects than that usually followed in modern times, either for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plaster or cement, especially the first. For, in the ordinary operation of slaking, those lime-shells that are not enough burnt, have some chance of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected when the lime is sifted; whereas, in this method of pounding the whole promiscuously, these will be mixed with the others; and therefore it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that some of the particles will remain unslaked
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035770_0471_1006C226F63FB200"/>
for a very long time, which will be in danger of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting, and blistering the work long after it is put up.</p>

                     <p>Authors almost universally agree in asserting, that the hardest lime-stone affords a lime that will consoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date into the firmest cement; and hence it has been, in general concluded, that lime made of chalk, affords a much weaker cement than what is made of marble or lime-stone.</p>
                     <p>It appears, however, from the foregoing observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that if ever this be the case, it is only <hi>incidentally,</hi> and not <hi>necessarily</hi> so.</p>
                     <p>Lime made of pure chalk, differs not in the least from lime made of the purest marble. Both consist of a fine impalpable powder, without any mixture of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous matter; and if they have been equally calcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are possessed of the same chemical qualities in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery respect. Indeed, nothing is more easy, than to form artificial chalk from pure lime-stone, as I have more than once experienced, which the reader may also do, by following the directions in the margin,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>In slaking lime composed of <hi>pure</hi> lime-stone, it will be observed, that the pieces fall into powder much more slowly than when the lime-stone has contained any sand in it.</p>
                           <p>If a great quantity of water be successively poured upon a large heap of these pure lime-shells, without stirring them, and if it be allowed to lie some time afterwards, it will be found, on opening the heap, that some pieces of lime-shells have only expanded considerably in bulk by the operation of slaking, without being crumbled down to a powder. These pieces, if allowed to remain in a close place, where they are not exposed to the vicissitudes of the weather, will still retain their form; and as they gradually absorb their air, they acquire a sort of firmness of consistence, and in time become chalk in every sense of the word,—having the same degree of firmness, of softness, and every other quality of chalk.</p>
                           <p>This is the most perfect resemblance of chalk that can be made: but, if any quantity of that pure lime be reduced to a very thin paste, at the time of slaking, and be hastily dried to a certain degree, it acquires a sort of consistency so as to be capable of retaining its form. And if this be kept in a place not exposed to the vicissitudes of the weather, till it has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained its whole air, it will resemble chalk almost as much as the former, and might be employed for every purpose that the chalk is used for.</p>
                           <p>The reader will please to observe, that this can only be done with lime that is <hi>perfectly</hi> free of sand; for if it has the least particle of sand among it, no art can give it the softness of chalk.</p>

And the practice of the southern provinces of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain, sufficiently confirms the justness of these observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For, to the south of the Humber, on the east coast, almost all the lime they use is made of chalk; yet, there are many buildings in these counties, in which the cement is as firm as in any part of the isl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and. Nor does the ordinary mode of building in these places, indicate any deficiency in the quality of their mortar; for many of their houses are coated on the outside with a crust of lime, stuck full of small peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which remain in it very firmly for many years. We know well, that this is the most trying manner of employing mortar.</p>
                     <p>There is, however, greater danger that lime made of chalk, should form, on some occasions, a weak ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than that from lime-stone.</p>
                     <p>For, as chalk never contains any sand, its lime will always form a very soft cement, unless care be taken to mix a large proportion of sand with it, in beating up the mortar; which is not so indispensably necessary in forming mortar from lime-stone, as it sometimes contains so much sand as to form a pretty firm cement, without any additional sand at all.</p>
                     <p>Even if the lime-stone should be equally <hi>pure</hi> calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous matter as the chalk, the lime of the first has a chance of becoming a firmer cement than that of the last</p>
                     <p>For, as it is impossible to reduce the pure <hi>lime-stone</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="unknown:035770_0473_1006C23185FA0780"/>
to a powdery <hi>calx,</hi> without subjecting it to the action of a very strong fire, which, while it dissipates the water, and fully dries the chrystals, carries off the <hi>whole</hi> of its fixed air, so that the <hi>calx</hi> is almost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely caustic.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>chalk</hi> may be reduced to <hi>calx,</hi> by such a moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate heat as is scarcely sufficient to dissipate any of its air;—so, that what assumes the appearance of lime made from it, may be nothing else than a powdered <hi>effette</hi> calcareous earth, which never can become a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any sort. But as there is no danger of vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying chalk by over-burning, this inconvenience may be entirely obviated by a careful and perfect calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>In those countries, therefore, where chalk-lime is common, care ought to be taken to choose only that kind of it for mortar, that has been calcined by a <hi>very strong</hi> fire, and to reject that which has been burnt by furze or brakes, as unfit for that purpose.</p>
                     <p>But it is obvious, that as this defect arises entirely from the unskilfulness of the operator, which may be easily avoided, it ought not to be considered as any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the quality of the lime, considered in itself.</p>

                     <p>It is unnecessary to extend our observations to all the other kinds of lime-stone that may be met with; as these general observations on the two extremes, marble and chalk, may be easily applied to all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate kinds. It has been already said, that the different friability of different sorts of lime-stone aris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es entirely from a smaller or greater degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the chrystallization, which must have been occasioned by accidental circumstances that have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred at the time the concretion was effected, and can have no influence on the quality of the lime when it is once more reduced to the state of a <hi>caustic calx.</hi>

And as it does not yet appear that there is the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est difference between the chemical qualities of any one kind of fossile calcareous earth and another, <hi>when perfectly pure,</hi> there is no reason to suspect that there can be any difference between one kind of <hi>lime</hi> and another, <hi>as a cement,</hi> unless what may arise from the nature of the extraneous bodies that may be accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mixed with that calcareous matter in its native state, or from its being more or less perfectly calcined.</p>
                     <p>But the only extraneous matter that is ever found in lime-stone is <hi>sand,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">This expression requires some limitation. See the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script to this Essay.</note> in greater or smaller propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And as no lime-stone that <hi>can be calcined,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains such a large proportion of sand as is necessary for making a perfect cement, we may naturally conclude, that every kind of lime is equally fit for becoming a firm cement, if it be first reduced to a proper degree of causticity, and has afterwards a due proportion of sand <hi>properly</hi> mixed with it, before it be employed in work.</p>
                     <p>Different sorts of lime, no doubt, vary very much from one another in the proportion of sand they natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contain, and therefore must require very different proportions of sand to be added to them before they can be made equally perfect as a cement. This is an economical consideration, of no small moment in some cases, as it may make one sort of lime vastly <hi>cheaper</hi> than another on some occasions, and therefore deserves to be attended to by every builder. Directions shall be given in the Second Part of this Essay, by the help of which he may be enabled to discover the exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of sand contained in any sort of lime he may wish to examine.</p>

                     <p>In the preceding parts of this Essay, I have spoken of <hi>sand</hi> as the only substance that is ever added to lime
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035770_0475_1006C238800BEAC8"/>
in forming cement; but as others have, on some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, been employed for this purpose, it will be proper here to point out their several excellencies and defects.</p>
                     <p>Almost the only substances that I have known used as an addition to mortar, besides sand of various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, are <hi>powdered sand-stone, brick-dust,</hi> and <hi>sea-shells,</hi> that have been broken into small fragments.</p>
                     <p>And for forming plaster, where closeness rather than hardness is required, the useful additions are, lime that has been slaked, and kept long in a dry place, till it has become nearly <hi>effette;</hi> powdered chalk or whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>gypsum</hi> in various proportions; besides hair, and other substances of that sort.</p>
                     <p>Others that have been lately recommended by Mons. Loriot, are, balls of any sort of earth slightly burnt and pounded;—the rubbish of old buildings (by which I understand the old mortar after it has been separated from the stones) reduced to powder, and sifted; or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most any other thing that can be reduced to a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately fine powder.</p>
                     <p>From what has incidentally occurred relating to this head, the reader will be able to judge, in some measure, of the comparative value of these several ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. But, to render the subject still more clear, the following observations may be of use:</p>
                     <p>It is sufficiently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ain, that none of these additions enter into the composition, so as to affect its qualities as a <hi>chemical mixt;</hi> they only operate in a manner purely <hi>mechanical:</hi> For, whatever the nature of the addition may be, it possesses the same qualities, when so united, as if by itself, and may be separated by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical means from the compound, unaltered. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we need give ourselves no trouble about ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their chemical qualities, but consider them merely as masses of matter that may be more or less fitted for this purpose by their peculiar form, degrees of hardness, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="unknown:035770_0476_1006C23A24AFE050"/>
It has been already shown, that <hi>sand</hi> ought to be preferred to chalky matters, chiefly on account of the hardness and firmness of the particles of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists. And as the purest sand consists of detached chrys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, which are so hard as scarcely to admit of being broken into smaller parts, this kind of pure chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line transparent sand is, perhaps, on this account, the most proper addition that can possibly be made to lime in forming <hi>mortar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sand-stone</hi> consists of an almost innumerable conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of small particles of sand united to one another, in a slight manner, by some kind of natural cement. But as it is troublesome to reduce this kind of stone to its smallest component parts, and as the particles of it, when not reduced to that ultimate degree of fineness, may be easily broken into smaller parts, it can never be looked upon as such a proper addition for a lime-cement as the purest sand.</p>
                     <p>There are also many substances that are called <hi>sand,</hi> which are nothing else than fragments of decomposed granite, moor-stone, sand-stone, &amp;c. all of which may be easily reduced into smaller particles by moderate triture, and are liable to the same objections as pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sand-stone.</p>
                     <p>But almost any of these is preferable to <hi>brick-dust.</hi> Fine clay, when <hi>perfectly</hi> burnt in the fire, may be made to assume almost a stony hardness. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon brick is so imperfectly burnt, as to admit of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced, without much trouble, to a fine impalpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble powder; insomuch, that it is often used, when in this state, for scouring polished iron or brass, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the brick has had no fine sharp sand in its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
                     <p>As the rough particles of brick-dust may be so easily reduced to a fine powder, the mortar formed with it can in no case be of the most perfect sort.</p>
                     <p>But brick-dust is still liable to a greater objection, when considered as a component part of mortar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:035770_0477_1006C2448DD36DC0"/>
Clay only looses its quality of absorbing water, and in some measure of dissolving in it, by a very perfect degree of burning; so that if any part of it has escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the violent action of the fire, that part, when mixed in mortar, will still be apt to absorb water whenever it may reach it, and lose its firmness, and make the mass of which it is a part, crumble to dust.</p>
                     <p>It is exactly in this manner that all sorts of <hi>marle</hi> are liable to fall into powder when drenched in water, and exposed to the air; even although they sometimes appear, when dry, to be endowed with a stony hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>On this account, brick-dust, which usually consists of the imperfect burnt bricks, ought to be considered as a very dangerous mixture for mortar, and should never be employed but in cases of absolute necessity.</p>
                     <p>But the balls of other sorts of earth, slightly burned, as recommended by Monsieur Loriot, must be, on many accounts, far less proper; as many of these sorts of earth cannot, by the action of fire, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their quality of absorbing water, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming soft with it. So that he who should be foolish enough to employ these substances, may be certain that his cement will not only be incapable of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any considerable degree of hardness at any time, but will also be liable to turn moist in a damp air, nor will be capable of retaining its firmness or cohesive quality in an exposed situation.</p>
                     <p>Powdered <hi>lime-rubbish</hi> is liable to the same objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the softest sand-stone or brick-dust; as the particles of which it consists, never can be endowed with the adhesive firmness that is necessary for forming a perfect cement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fine shells</hi> are perhaps firmer than any other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, next to pure sand, and may be employed where the other cannot be got, if this abounds. I have seen a cement that was as little affected by the weather as any other, and had stood firm in the work a great many
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035770_0478_1006C24662EA4738"/>
years, that had been originally formed with a sand consisting almost entirely of the fragments of shells. But it had not the rocky hardness of some old mortar that we frequently meet with.</p>
                     <p>Roughly <hi>powdered glass,</hi> if such a thing could be got, at a moderate expense, would form a most perfect sort of mortar; as it would not be liable to be affected with the weather, would be sufficiently hard, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of very irregular fragments.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears, that of all the substances that can be easily met with, <hi>sand</hi> forms the most proper addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lime in making mortar; on which account, it has been justly preferred to all others for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                     <p>Pure firm chrystallized sand is better than any other sort:—But all pure sands are not equally proper for this use.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="32" type="section">
                     <head>§ 32.</head>
                     <p>It has been already shown, that the principal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which resulted from the addition of sand in making lime-mortar, were, that it augmented the quantity of hard indissoluble matter,—and put it in our power to employ a larger quantity of water in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the lime, and thus forwarded the chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization of the calcareous matter, augmented the <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of these chrystals, and rendered their quality more perfect. Those kinds of sand, therefore, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote these purposes in the highest degree, will be best adapted for mixing with mortar.</p>
                     <p>But if sand consists of irregular angular particles, a greater quantity of water will be retained in the vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities formed between these angular pieces, than could have been if the whole had consisted of round smooth globules; and therefore it is natural to think, that rough angular sand, will be more proper for this use than that which is smoother.</p>
                     <p>Hence, if equally pure, sea-sand, which consists of round globules, that have been worn perfectly smooth

by the continued attrition upon one another on the shore, (like the larger pebbles in the same situation) will be worse than any other sort.—River-sand will be better than it;—and pit-sand, when quite free of earth, the best of all.</p>

                  <div n="33" type="section">
                     <head>§ 33.</head>
                     <p>If the sand be hard, and the particles angular, it is perhaps of very little importance whether these be very small, or of a larger size.—The sand in the lime that formed the extraordinary firm cement mentioned § 26, was as small as could well be imagined.</p>
                     <p>Because sea-sand is usually smaller than any other sort, and is acknowledged to be less proper for making mortar than many other kinds of sand, a prejudice has been in general adopted against <hi>fine</hi> sand for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. But this, there is reason to imagine, is only a vulgar prejudice, arising from the peculiar figure of that sort of sand.</p>

                  <div n="34" type="section">
                     <head>§ 34.</head>
                     <p>There is another and better reason for not employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sea-sand in mortar, <abbr>
                           <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </abbr> that there is always a chance that some particles of salt may be formed among it, by the evaporation of the sea-water upon the shore. And as common salt continues always to be a deliquescent substance, it will have a perpetual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to attract moisture from a humid air, and thus render the wall in which this mortar has been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed extremely damp and unwholesome.</p>
                     <p>It is from the same cause that any porous sort of stone, that has been taken from the sea shore, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues at all times to be wet in damp weather: For, while the stone remained on the shore, its pores would be, from time to time, filled with salt water; upon the evaporation of which, the salt it contained would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main behind, within the pores of the stone, which would thus become endowed with the quality of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting moisture from a damp air, sufficient to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035770_0480_10069084612AD070"/>
the salt, and make the watery solution ooze out through all its pores.</p>
                     <p>This is a phenomenon for which it is more easy to account, than to prescribe an effectual cure.—Perhaps, no art can render the stone sufficiently dry, after it is once put into the wall.—To let it lie for a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time in a stream of running fresh water before it was employed, might mitigate, at least, if not entirely obviate, the disease.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="35" type="section">
                     <head>§ 35.</head>
                     <p>For the same reason, lime that has been slaked with sea-water, is always unfit for being used as a mortar. For, as it is impossible ever to extract that salt from the mortar, it continually attracts moisture from the air in damp weather, and oozes through the pores of the wall in form of drops of sweat, which again disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear when the weather becomes dry.</p>
                     <p>This is an inconvenience often felt:—But as the real cause of it is seldom known, few persons are at proper pains to guard against it. Those who obtain their lime by water-carriage, are in a peculiar manner liable to be hurt by this circumstance, as the lime is, for the most part, slaked at the ship's side, by the sea-water, which is more easily got than any other.</p>
                     <p>When lime that has been slaked in this manner is employed as a plaster, it is rather worse than when used as a mortar, as it has less sand added to it, and has fewer pores in the inside, in which the drops of water might be allowed to lodge; so that the wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes alternately covered with a crust of dry powdery salt, and with damp tears running down its surface.</p>
                     <p>Too much care, therefore, cannot be taken to avoid using lime that has been slaked with sea-water,—as it will be impossible, or extremely difficult, ever to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these walls perfectly dry.</p>
                     <p>I have thus enumerated at much greater length than I originally intended, the several circumstances that
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035770_0481_1006C252D2756720"/>
contribute to render lime-cement more or less perfect. In doing this, I have had occasion to explain the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of many of those calcareous matters which have been generally used as a manure, which will consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably shorten our labour in what remains of this Essay.</p>
                     <p>If I have reprehended, with some degree of asperity, those who, either through ignorance, or a wilful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to deceive, have endeavoured, by specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, to mislead the ignorant, I hope the candid will be rather ready to ascribe this to a desire of rectifying those abuses that might have been introduced by their means, than to any other motive. I have never found fault, but where it was necessary to correct.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>Before I quit this branch of our subject, I may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remark, that although the discoveries of Modern Philos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophers have enabled us to account for some of the <hi>phoenomena</hi> relating to quick-lime as a cement, that were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable to the Ancients, yet here, as in almost every branch of natural knowledge, we are still far from having attained that summit of perfection which some may, perhaps too hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, be disposed to imagine.—In many respects, we have as yet been just able to penetrate the mysterious veil of nature, so far, as to let us know that much remains to be discovered, of which we have now only a very saint idea.—The following hints will illustrate my meaning, and deserve the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chemical Philosophers;</p>
                           <p>There is little reason to doubt, that <hi>flint</hi> is nothing else than calcareous matter combined with some substance that has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto eluded the knowledge of Chymists.</p>
                           <p>It is likewise highly probable, that the native chrystalline concretion called <hi>quartz,</hi> by Naturalists, is only another mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification of the same calcareous matter, combined with some other substances that prevents the action of acids upon it, and gives it other sensible qualities very different from calcareous substances in their ordinary state.</p>
                           <p>There is even some reason to suspect, that all the other varieties of <hi>chrystalline</hi> earths, including sand of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, are other modifications of the same calcareous matter.</p>
                           <p>Even <hi>argillaceous</hi> earths (clays) however different in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and natural qualities, in their ordinary state, afford evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marks of the same original.</p>
                           <p>But in what manner it comes to be so differently disguised in these several bodies,—what are their several component parts,—how they may be analysed and recompounded, are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Nature, reserved for the discovery of future ages: And, till these are discovered, it is probable, we will never be able to account for the manner in which the most perfect ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be sometimes produced.</p>

                  <head>OF QUICK-LIME AND OTHER CALCAREOUS SUBSTANCES, AS A MANURE.</head>
                  <p>IN the First Part of this Essay, I have been able to give, as I hope, a tolerably satisfactory account of the <hi>raticuale</hi> of the operation of lime as <hi>a cement;</hi> and it is much to be wished, that I could pursue the same method in the investigation of this substance <hi>as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure.</hi> But in this respect, I have as yet been able to discover no clue that could, with safety, be trusted for leading through the intricate labyrinth that lies before us; on which account, I willingly shun the arduous undertaking.</p>
                  <p>It would be easy for me here to amuse the reader with a critical analysis of the several theories that have been invented by ingenious men, to account for the <hi>manner</hi> in which lime operates as a manure. It would be no difficult matter to demonstrate the defects of their several systems; and I might, with great facility, make an idle display of <hi>apparent</hi> superiority by ridicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their several hypotheses. But as I could not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute any thing in their stead, that would be more satisfactory to the sensible Reader, I choose to wave this ungracious discussion; and shall content myself with enumerating a few <hi>facts</hi> concerning the use of calcareous substances as a manure, that it much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the practical farmer fully to understand.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>§ 1.</head>
                     <p>The first idea that occurs in reflecting on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is, that all substances in which calcareous matter is contained, have been successfully employed as a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, at different times, and in different places.</p>
                     <p>Thus—<hi>lime,</hi>—<hi>marie</hi> of all sorts,—<hi>chalk,</hi>—<hi>lime-stone</hi>—
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035770_0484_1006C26006584480"/>
                        <hi>gravel,</hi>—<hi>shelly</hi> sand, or pure <hi>shells</hi> of every denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have all been employed as manures, with the greatest success.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="section">
                     <head>§ 2.</head>
                     <p>And as all these, excepting lime, always contain the calcareous matter in its <hi>mild</hi> state, we are led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>they</hi> operate on the soil merely as <hi>calcareous,</hi> and not as <hi>saline</hi> substances.</p>
                     <p>Lime, indeed, is sometimes applied to the soil in its <hi>caustic</hi> state, as it comes fresh from being slaked, but more commonly at some considerable distance of time after it has been burnt. However, as burning is the only mode usually employed for reducing lime-stone to powder, and thus preparing it for a manure, the opinion in general prevails, that calcination is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for rendering lime capable of becoming a manure, as for making it fit to be employed as a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>It is, however, of importance to the practical far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to be informed that this is not the case.—Mr. Du-Hamel, was the first, who, from an accidental experiment, was led to believe that <hi>powdered lime-stone</hi> was a manure equally efficacious with <hi>lime</hi> itself. He recorded the experiment as a great discovery.</p>
                     <p>Having had occasion to dress a marble chimney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, for repairing one of his country-houses, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son chose a lawn near the house as the most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place for hewing the stone. After the operation was finished, all the large chips were picked up and carried away, that they might not disfigure the lawn; but the fine powder that had been grinded off by the action of the chissel, mixed so intimately with the grass, that it could not be gathered up.—In conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this very full dressing of powdered lime-stone, the grass afterwards grew upon that spot with much greater luxuriance than on any other part of the lawn, and always continued to have a much livelier verdure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="unknown:035770_0485_1006C26578EC4BD0"/>
From hence, he, with good reason, concluded, that powdered lime-stone might be employed as a manure with success. To try if this would always be the case, he repeated the experiment several times, by caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some lime-stone to be pounded on purpose; and found that it never failed to promote the fertility of the spot on which he applied it, in very high degree.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="section">
                     <head>§ 3.</head>
                     <p>I chose to relate this experiment at large, for the satisfaction of those who may be unacquainted with the <hi>physical</hi> cause of the difference between lime and lime-stone. To such as are fully apprised of this, a little reasoning might have been sufficient to afford a certain conviction, that the result of the experiment must have been what Mr. Du-Hamel found it.</p>
                     <p>Lime is no sooner slaked, than it immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to absorb its air, and return to its former <hi>mild</hi> state; or, in other words, it becomes <hi>off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tte;</hi> in which state it possesses the same chemical qualities, in every respect, as lime-stone.</p>
                     <p>If this be spread out thinly upon the surface of the earth, it absorbs its air in a very short time.—A few hours, in this situation, restores a large proportion of its air; and, in a day or two, at most, it becomes perfectly <hi>effette,</hi> as masons experience when they sweep together the scattered particles that have lain round their heaps of lime, and attempt to use it in mortar by itself, for it is then no more coherent than sand, or moistened earth.</p>
                     <p>Hence, then, it must follow, that in every case, <hi>lime</hi> is converted into the same state with <hi>lime-stone,</hi> in a few days after it is mixed with the soil; so that if it produces any effect at all as <hi>lime,</hi> as a <hi>saline</hi> substance,—it must only be at the <hi>very first,</hi> when it is applied; and it must act ever afterwards merely as <hi>powdered lime-stone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is well know, that lime produces scarcely
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035770_0486_1006C308C617F790"/>
any sensible effect as a manure at the beginning. Even the first year after it is applied to the soil, its effects are inconsiderable, in comparison of what it produces in the second and succeeding years. From whence we must conclude, that it operates upon the soil, merely as a <hi>mild</hi> calcareous earth; and that its calcination is of no farther utility in preparing it for manure, than as a cheap and efficacious method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the lime-stone to a fine powder.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="4" type="section">
                     <head>§ 4.</head>
                     <p>It is of importance, that these facts should be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally known; because it may sometimes happen, that good lime-stone shall be found in places where fuel could not be obtained for burning it; in which case, such lime-stone could be of no use to the farmer, if calcination were absolutely necessary. But, seeing this is not the case, lime-stone, even in these situations, may be converted into a most beneficial manure, if a stream of water can be commanded, sufficient for driving a mill, for reducing the stone to powder.</p>
                     <p>I have seen the model of a mill that had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for that purpose, which was constructed on the same principles with an ordinary gun-powder mill. It had several large massy stampers, composed of huge blocks of cast-iron, that were successively lifted up and let fall by a wheel that catched their handles, and, after a proper time, slipped them again as it revolved round its axis. These stampers fell with great force upon the lime-stone, that had been previously broken into pieces of a moderate size, and placed in a strong trough, formed for that purpose. Through this trough, a small stream of water was conveyed, which washed away with it, the small pieces of lime-stone as they were successively reduced to powder by the stampers. This stream of water was received into a large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servoir, in which it was allowed to stagnate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035770_0487_1006909D3668AE30"/>
as a sediment, the lime-stone powder it brought along with it; the pure water flowing gently over a part of the brim, which was made lower for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                     <p>When the reservoir was nearly full of this fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the work was stopped; the water was drawn off from the reservoir, by taking out some plugs left for that purpose at different heights, till all that was clear had run off: the powdered stone was afterwards thrown out to the bank, and allowed to dry sufficiently for use.</p>
                     <p>I have heard that a mill, upon these principles, was erected by the Honourable the Trustees for managing the forfeited estates in Scotland, and that a good deal of lime-stone was pounded with it. But, as it was erected in the Highlands of Scotland, where roads were bad, and where there was but little, spirit for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in agriculture; as there was no public de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the manure, after the experiment was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently tried to show that it might be practised with advantage in other places, the mill was suffered to lie unemployed.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="5" type="section">
                     <head>§ 5.</head>
                     <p>But although this may be considered as a most val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable discovery for those who may have a good lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarry so situated as not to be within the reach of any kind of fuel for burning lime-stone; yet, to such as can obtain fuel at a moderate expense, there can be no doubt but that burning is the easiest and most efficacious mode of reducing lime-stone to powder that ever was invented, and therefore ought always to be adopted where necessity does not prevent it.</p>
                     <p>Reducing lime-stone to powder by calcination, is attended with this farther advantage to the farmer, that it considerably diminishes his expense of carriage. <hi>Pure</hi> lime-stone loses about two-thirds of its weight by
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035770_0488_100690D3E154B318"/>
being thoroughly burned; so that the man who is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to drive this manure from a great distance, will find a very considerable saving by driving it in the state of <hi>shells.</hi> But if it were reduced to a powder by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical triture, he could not be benefitted by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance.</p>
                     <p>Many persons choose to drive lime-stone from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable distance, and burn it at home: But it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious they then subject themselves to a very heavy charge in carriage, which would be avoided by an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite conduct. This, therefore, ought never to be practised but where other circumstances may counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance this unfavourable one.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="6" type="section">
                     <head>§ 6.</head>
                     <p>But as lime-stone is often, in its native state, mixed with sand in various proportions; and as sand loses nothing of its weight by calcination, it must happen, that those kinds of lime-stone which contain the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est proportion of sand, will lose least in calcination, and of course afford the weightiest lime-shells.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is obvious, that those who are under the necessity of driving lime from a great distance, ought to be particularly careful to make choice of a kind of lime-stone as free from sand as possible, and to drive it in the state of <hi>shells;</hi> as they will thus obtain an equal quantity of manure, at the least expense of carriage that is possible; and the lightest shells ought, of course, to be always preferred.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="7" type="section">
                     <head>§ 7.</head>
                     <p>When lime is slaked, that which contains most sand <hi>falls</hi> most quickly, and absorbs the smallest proportion of water. What is pure, requires a very large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of water, and is much longer before it begins to fall.</p>
                     <p>Hence it happens, that those who drive sandy lime-shells in open carriages, must be very careful to guard
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035770_0489_100690D628C8B450"/>
against rain; because a heavy shower would make the whole fall, and generate such a heat as to be in danger of setting the carts on fire; whereas <hi>pure</hi> lime-shells are in no danger of being damaged by that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. I have seen a cart loaded with such shells, which had been exposed to a continued shower of rain, as violent as is ever known in this country, for more than three hours, and seemed hardly to be affected by it in the smallest degree. I ought to observe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that my experiments were continued to only one kind of pure lime, so that it is not from hence demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, that <hi>all</hi> kinds of pure lime will be possessed of the same qualities.</p>

                     <p>Hence it is much worse economy in those who have pure lime-shells, to slake and carry them home in the state of powdered lime, than it is in those who have only a sandy kind of lime-shells.</p>

                     <p>It is even, on some occasions, more advisable for those who have very sandy lime, to drive it in the state of powdered lime, than in that of <hi>shells:</hi> For, as it is dangerous to give that kind of lime-stone too much heat, lest it should be vitrified, those who burn it can never be <hi>certain</hi> that the whole of the stone will fall to powder when water is added, till they have actually
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035770_0490_100690DAC1835FF8"/>
tried it; nor do they think it a great loss if some part of it should be imperfectly burned, as it requires much less fuel on a future occasion than fresh lime-stone; and therefore they much rather choose to err on this, than on the opposite extreme.</p>
                     <p>But, should any one attempt to drive this <hi>poor</hi> sort of lime in the state of <hi>shells,</hi> he would be in danger of carrying home many stones that would never <hi>fall,</hi> which would more than counterbalance the benefit he would derive from the want of the small quantity of water that is required to slake it.</p>
                     <p>On these accounts, it may be admitted, as a general rule, that those who can have access to lime-stone which is free of sand, will save a <hi>great deal</hi> in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of it, by driving it in the state of <hi>shells;</hi>—and that, on the contrary, it will be most economical in those who can only get lime of a very sandy quality, to drive it in the state of powdered lime.</p>
                     <p>From hence it follows, that the practice which now prevails, of carrying shell-lime by water from one part of the country to another, is only an imaginary saving, obtained at a very high risque, to those who drive shells of a sandy quality;—but a real and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal advantage, of very high importance to the community, at large, if these <hi>shells</hi> are obtained from a pure lime-stone.</p>
                     <p>These observations relate only to the saving of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the farmer; an article of capital importance to him. It is proper now to take notice of some other particulars that may equally affect him in this way, as well as in the application of the lime to his ground.</p>

                     <p>A vague opinion, in general, prevails in every part of the country, that one sort of lime may be more valuable than another: but it does not appear that farmers have hitherto had almost any rule to direct
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035770_0491_1006C26CAE92E9A0"/>
them in the choice of different sorts of lime; some esteeming one sort <hi>strongest,</hi> as they term it, and some valuing another sort more highly, without being able to assign any satisfactory reason for the preference they give, in either case.</p>
                     <p>It is of importance, that this matter should be elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidated.</p>
                     <p>Although it does not always happen, yet, in many parts of the country, the real nature of lime is so little understood, that the weightiest lime is preferred, as a manure, to that which is lighter; because it is imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the first has more <hi>substance,</hi> and will therefore produce a more powerful effect upon ground, than the finest and lightest lime.</p>
                     <p>But, there seems to be no reason to think, there is any difference in the specific gravity of different parcels of <hi>pure</hi> calcareous matter, when fully calcined; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if there is any difference in the weight of various sorts of lime, it must arise entirely from a variation in the quantity or <hi>gravity</hi> of some extraneous matter that is mixed with the lime.</p>
                     <p>And as <hi>sand</hi> is almost the only extraneous body that is ever found in lime-stone, and is always of much greater specific gravity than pure quick-lime,—it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, than the weighty lime only owes its superior grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to a larger proportion of sand that is mixed with it.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>sand</hi> is of no value as a manure; so that he who voluntarily purchases this kind of lime, in preference to the other, is guilty of a great degree of folly; which will be the greater, if he has likewise to drive it from a considerable distance. It would be better for him, if he is determined to use nothing but weighty lime, to buy such as is pure, if it can be obtained, and mix it with sand after he has got it home, so as to give it the grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity required. Some might laugh at this, as a proof of his folly, and justly: but, it is, surely, less foolish in him to do this, than to pay money for the sand which he would thus obtain for nothing, and drive it from a
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035770_0492_1006C26E710FEFC0"/>
distance, when he might have it at his door. This practice would also be attended with the farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of enabling him to know exactly, what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>real</hi> lime he applied to his ground, as he would not be in danger of considering the sand as a part of it.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="11" type="section">
                     <head>§ 11.</head>
                     <p>Those who have access to only one sort of lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, must be contented with it, whatever may be its quality. But such as have an opportunity of choosing, may be benefitted by the following observations:</p>
                     <p>Pure lime-stone, when fully calcined and slaked, is reduced to a fine impalpable powder, that feels soft between the singers, without the smallest tendency to grittiness Such lime as contains sand, is never so fine nor so soft, but feels gritty between the fingers, and is more or less so as the sand is coarser or finer, or in greater or smaller proportions.</p>
                     <p>The lime from pure lime-stone, is always of a bright white, when perfectly calcined, without a tendency to any colour. When it has any colour, it proceeds from the sand, or other uncalcareous matters in its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. There are, however, some sorts of sand, that are of such a pure whiteness, as not to debase the colour of the lime in the smallest degree; but these are rare:—And there are some matters that alter the colour of the lime a good deal, without debasing its quality in any considerable degree; but these are still more rare than the former.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows, that the best lime for the purpose of the farmer, is that which is lightest, softest to the touch,<note n="*" place="bottom">Softness to the touch is not an unequivocal proof of the purity of lime. I have seen <hi>one</hi> kind of lime, that contained a large proportion of an uncalcareous impalpable powder, that was as soft to the touch as the purest lime; but this was a singular exception to a rule that is very general.</note> and whitest. The more they deviate from either of these tests of purity, the worse they are for him.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="12" type="section">

                     <p>That the farmer may have under his eye, at one time, the several criteria of the purity of lime, that have been enumerated in different places of this Essay; I choose to mention them here all at once. If he is attentive to mark these peculiarities, he needs be very little solicitous about examining the qualities of his lime, by any more minute or troublesome trails. They are as under:</p>
                     <p>If the lime-stone loses much of its weight in calcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and the lime-shells are extremely light; if the shells require a very large proportion of water to slake them fully; if it is long before they begin to fall; if the lime-stone is not apt to <hi>run</hi> (or be vitrified) in the operation of burning; if it falls entirely when it gets a sufficient quantity of water, after it has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly calcined; if it swells very much in slaking, and if the lime is light, fine to the touch, and of a pure white; he may be satisfied, that it is extremely good, and may use it in preference to any other lime that is inferior to it in any of these respects.</p>
                     <p>These rules are perfectly sufficient to decide as to the comparative value of any two kinds of lime that may be opposed to one another and may be relied upon as sufficiently accurate for the ordinary purposes of the farmers.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="13" type="section">

                     <p>But such as may discover a new quarry of lime stone, and who wish to ascertain with certainly its real value, before they put themselves to any expense about it, will do well to employ the following more accurate, and in that case, more easy analysis.</p>
                     <p>As all calcareous matters are capable of being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in acids—and as no other earthy matter can be dissolved in them—it follows, that if a sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of acid is poured upon any body that contains cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035770_0494_1006C27DCCCA8940"/>
matter, this matter will be quickly dissolved, while the others are left behind; and the proportions of each may be accurately ascertained.</p>
                     <p>To try the exact value of any kind of lime-stone, or other calcareous matter,—take a quantity of aquafor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,<note n="*" place="bottom">Nitrous acid.</note> or spirit of salt;<note n="†" place="bottom">Muriatic acid.</note> and having prepared them as in the margin,<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                           <p>All the mineral acids effervesce and unite with calcareous earths. But as the vitriolic acid (spirit or oil of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                                 <desc>•••</desc>
                              </gap>riol) does not <hi>dissolve</hi> the calcareous matter, but forms a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, that still retains its solid state, it is not fit for this exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iment.</p>
                           <p>And as it sometimes happens, that a little vitriolic acid is mixed with either the nitrous or muriatic acids, it becomes necessary to be certain that this is not the case, before they are employed in this experiment.</p>
                           <p>The easiest way of trying if these acids are free from the vitriolic, is to put a little chalk into them before you employ them. If the acid is pure, the chalk will dissolve very read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily; but if not, some part of the chalk will fall to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, in the form of a pure white sediment. When this is the case, add small bits of chalk, by little and little, till no more of that white sediment appears; after which, the acid may be kept for use, as sufficiently pure.</p>
                           <p>If the nitrous acid is so strong as to have a slight brown, or reddish appearance, it ought to be diluted with water, till it assumes a greenish look. As it is bought in the shops, for the use of dyers, &amp;c. it is usually weak enough.</p>
                           <p>If the muriatic acid is so strong as to have a bright yellow colour, or emits fumes when the bottle is opened, it ought to be diluted, by adding water, till it assumes almost a colourless transparency, with a very faint tinge of yellow.</p>
                           <p>When they are thus prepared, either of these acids may be used indiscriminately for this experiment, as they are equally proper.</p>
                        </note> put them into a glass or earthen vessel;—add to that, by little and little, a known a quantity of the matter you mean to examine, which had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viously dried, and reduced to power. After each ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, suffer the violent effervescence or ebullition that will ensue to abate before more is added. When the whole of the powder is put to the acid, and the effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap> of the matter, and thoroughly dissolve it. And to be certain that there has not been too little acid, put a few drops of fresh acid to the solution, which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a fresh effervescence if the whole is not fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved. When no change is produced by this addition, it is a certain proof that the whole of the calcareous matter is already dissolved.</p>
                     <p>Take then a piece of filtering paper, thoroughly dry, the weight of which is also known, fold it prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly, and put it in a glass funnel; pour the whole of the solution, with the matter that may have subsided, into the funnel, and allow it to filtre through the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per slowly. When the fluid part has thus drained off, fill up the filtre again with pure water, to wash off the whole of the saline parts from the <hi>residuum.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">The matter that remains undissolved.</note> Add water, in this manner, till it comes off without any saline taste; suffer it then to drop off entirely, dry it thoroughly, and weigh the paper, with its contents. The difference between which, and what the powder and paper were at the beginning, is the whole weight of the calcareous matter; so that its proportion to the whole mass is perfectly ascertained.</p>
                     <p>In this manner I have examined a great many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of lime-stone, and have found them vary in all degrees of purity, from such as were entirely sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uble in acids, as sugar or salt is in water, to others that contained only one-twelfth of their weight of soluble matter, and eleven-twelfths of sand. The ordinary kinds of lime-stone contain from one-third to two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirds of their weight of sand. Hard chalk is usually a pure calcareous earth, soluble in acids; and some sorts of lime-stone may be met with that are equally pure, but these are rare. The only extensive lime
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035770_0496_1006C2838D5AE648"/>
quarries of such pure lime-stone, that I have met with, are at Sunderland, in the county of Durham, where there are several quarries of exceedingly fine lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, the best of which belonged, in the year 1777, to Mr. James Galley of that place. There are some quarries farther up the river WEAR, the stone of which is of a much inferior quality.</p>
                     <p>Were all the stones in the same quarry equally pure, the above would be a perfect and unexceptionable method of ascertaining the purity of any lime-stone: But it often happens, that in a quarry of the very worst quality, there are some pieces found that consist of pure spar, that are entirely free of any mixture of sand; and in other quarries of a better sort, there are often small veins of an impure sort of stone, mixed through the rock; so that if either of these should chance to be picked out as a specimen for trial, the result would not be just.</p>
                     <p>To avoid falling into this mistake, any one who wishes to make an accurate analysis of any newly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered lime-stone, will do well to take eight or ten stones from different parts of the quarry, that are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different in appearance from one another; and, having taken a chip from each, pound the whole to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to afford a proper subject for the experiment.</p>
                     <p>The same experiment might be tried with <hi>lime;</hi> but it is evident the proportions would be different in the same stone, from what they would be if tried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calcination—as lime wants its fixed air, &amp;c. which it had when in the state of lime-stone. But as the lime is more liable to be varied by accidental cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, it is best to try the experiment with lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>

                     <p>It is in general believed, that the lime made of the hardest lime-stone is <hi>stronger,</hi> as it is called, by which is meant more powerfully efficacious as a manure, than
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035770_0497_1006C287B0511C30"/>
that which is made from materials of a softer nature. Hence it is in general asserted, that lime made from chalk, is much weaker, as a manure, than that which is made from harder lime-stone.</p>
                     <p>Nothing, however, can be more erroneous than this hypothesis. In the former part of this Essay, I have had occasion to explain pretty fully what is the real differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between chalk and lime-stone; and nothing can be more certain, than that the lime made of chalk is purer than that made from almost any lime-stone, and contains a much larger proportion of calcareous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; on which account, it must be more efficacious as a manure, than any of these more impure kinds of lime.</p>
                     <p>The hardest lime-stone that I know, is that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. Galley, at Sunderland. Its external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance rather resembles flint than lime-stone; yet the lime made of this exceedingly hard stone, is as light, as white, and as soft to the touch, as the purest chalk-lime. It differs not from that in any respect, insomuch that I defy the greatest connoisseur in these matters to distinguish between it and the purest chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, when perfectly calcined, by any other means than by the pieces of flint that are so often met with among chalk-lime.</p>
                     <p>And from this lime, obtained from these very hard stones, as perfect chalk may be artificially made by the simple process described § 24, as was ever obtained from any quarry in England.</p>
                     <p>From these considerations, therefore, I am obliged to conclude, contrary to the common opinion, that chalk-lime is, almost in all cases, more efficacious as a manure, than any lime obtained from lime-stone, in equal quantities; as it is extremely rare to meet with a lime-stone that contains near such a large proportion of calcareous matter; on which account it ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be preferred by the farmer, where both can be had at the same price.</p>

                     <p>We know little certain about the mode in which lime operates, excepting that it acts merely in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of its being mixed with the soil in substance. If a heap of lime, of a considerable thickness, shall have lain ever so long upon one spot, and be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried clean away from it, so that none of the particles of the lime remain to be mixed with the soil,—that spot will not be richer, or carry more luxuriant crops, than the places around it; which, every one knows, is not the case with regard to dung.</p>
                     <p>Again—If lime be spread upon the surface of the soil, and allowed to remain there, without being plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, its effects will scarcely be perceived for several years, till it has had time gradually to sink through the sward, and mix with the soil; after which, its effects begin to be perceived, although much less sensibly than if the same quantity of lime had been intimately mixed with the soil by means of the plough and harrow.</p>
                     <p>I am not a stranger to the improvements that have been made in Derbyshire, by means of lime, without the plough; but this is no exception to what I have said. The effects are slow though certain. Those who inhabit countries that admit of the plough, are often advised to lay lime upon the grass, and are made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that their pasture will be instantly mended by it, nearly in the same perceptible manner as if it had been dunged. This, I myself have tried, and have seen it tried by others, but always found that the grass for the first year was rather hurt than benefitted by it; nor was it so much improved in succeeding years, as if the same quantity of lime had been applied, and intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixed with the soil. In this mode of applying lime, therefore, it is long before it yields a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and is not to be recommended to a poor man, unless where necessity obliges him to practise it.</p>

                     <p>If, then, lime acts upon the soil more efficaciously in consequence of being intimately mixed with it, we may naturally conclude, that it will produce a more sensible effect, when it is reduced to exceedingly small particles, than when it is applied to the soil in larger lumps; as these do not admit of being so intimately mixed with the particles of the soil.</p>
                     <p>But no method has ever yet been discovered for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing calcareous matter to such small component parts, or of spreading it so evenly over a field, or of mixing it so intimately with the soil, as by calcination. Accordingly, it is found, that <hi>lime</hi> will produce a very sensible effect upon the soil, when applied in much smaller quantities, than any other calcareous matter whatever.</p>
                     <p>Considered in this view, it can never be expected that lime-stone, reduced to powder by any kind of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical triture, will produce, such a sensible effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soil, as the same quantity of calcareous matter in the state of <hi>lime, if properly applied;</hi> because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, by mechanical means, ever to reduce it to such a fine powder as it naturally falls into after calcination.</p>

                     <p>Much, however, depends upon the mode of applying the lime to the soil, after calcination. If it is spread as soon as it is slaked, while yet in a powdery state, a very small quantity may be made to cover the whole surface of the ground, and to touch an exceedingly great number of particles of earth. But if it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lie for some time after slaking, and to get so much moisture as to make it run into clods, or cake into large lumps, it can never be again divided into such small parts; and, therefore, a much greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is necessary to produce the same effect, than if it had been applied in its powdery state.</p>

But if the soil is afterwards to be continued long in tillage—as these clods are annually broken smaller by the action of the plough and harrows, the lime must continue to exert its influence anew upon the soil for a great course of years:—it will produce an effect nearly similar to that which would be experienced by annually strewing a small quantity of powdered lime over the surface of the soil. But as the price of the lime must, in the first case, he paid by the farmer alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at the beginning, which only comes to be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively demanded in the other case, this deserves to be attended to, as it may become a consideration of some importance where lime is dear, and money not very plentiful.</p>

                     <p>In few particulars are practical farmers more divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in opinion, than about the quantity of lime that may be laid upon an acre of ground with profit, or even with safety. Some require that it should be applied in such small quantities, as thirty or forty bushels to the acre; and aver, that if more is used, the ground will be absolutely ruined: while others maintain, that ten times that quantity may be applied with safety.</p>
                     <p>A great variation may, no doubt, be produced in this respect, by a difference in the nature of the soil,—in the state of culture it is under at the time,—in the quantity of calcareous matter with which it may have been formerly impregnated;—and perhaps a variation may sometimes arise from other circumstances that have never yet been attended to.</p>
                     <p>A difference will likewise arise from the quality of the lime that is applied, and from the manner in which it is employed. Some kinds of lime contain, perhaps, ten times more calcareous matter than other kinds:—And it has been shown above, that a very great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may arise from the mode of applying the lime.</p>

Considering all these circumstances, it would appear a little presumptuous in any one to prescribe positive rules that should be generally adopted in this respect. This I shall not attempt—but shall relate, with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, such observations as have occurred to myself, in the course of a pretty extensive experience of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure.</p>

                     <p>It is common to hear those, who have had little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of lime as a manure, recommend very great caution, lest too great a quantity be employed, for fear of <hi>burning the soil,</hi> as they express it. This idea of <hi>burning</hi> has been evidently adopted, from what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced by applying caustic lime to animals or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, in large quantities, as it often corrodes and shrivels them up, and produces other effects which greatly resemble those of fire: But it cannot produce any such effects, unless there are vegetables growing upon the soil at the time. In that case, the vegetables might, indeed, be corroded by the lime, if rain should fall immediately after it was spread, when newly slak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;—but as it loses this fiery corrosive power in a few days after it is spread, nothing of that kind can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to happen to the <hi>soil.</hi> Accordingly, we never hear of crops being burnt up with too great a quantity of lime, in those countries where it has long been used as a common manure—although it is there often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in much larger quantities than in any other places where it is more rare.</p>
                     <p>I myself have had the experience of lime in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, from one hundred to above seven hundred bushels to the acre, upon a great variety of soils; and have always found, that its effect in promoting the fertility of the soil, has been in proportion to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity employed, other circumstances being alike.</p>
                     <p>The expense in most cases prevents farmers from employing this manure in greater quantities than those
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035770_0502_1006C29D5A14E910"/>
above mentioned; but accidental circumstances clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly show, that if it were applied in much larger quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, the effect would only be to promote the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance of the crop in a higher degree.</p>

                     <p>A gentleman of my acquaintance, in whose verac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity I perfectly confide, happening to be from home when a large field was limed; and having no occasion for the whole quantity of lime that had been brought for that purpose, and laid down in one corner of the field, his servants, without driving it away, mixed what remained with the soil, although the lime lay there about four inches thick over the whole surface. The effect was, that for many years afterwards, the grain in that place was so immoderately luxuriant, that it fell over, and rotted before it came to the ear. After many years, this luxuriance abated a little, so as to allow the grain to ripen;—but it was there always much more luxuriant than in any other part of the field.</p>
                     <p>An accidental experiment, nearly similar to this, fell under my own observation. It happened that the servants of another farmer laid, by mistake, a few heaps of lime upon a grass field that he did not intend should be broken up at the time. The mistake was soon discovered, and no more lime was laid down at that place, and the few heaps (about a bushel in each) were allowed to lie, neglected, without being spread. The field was pastured upon for seven or eight years after that, before it was converted into tillage; and the heaps were by that time become so flat, and so far sunk into the ground, that they could hardly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                     <p>Before it was ploughed up, the whole of the field was limed, and this part of it equally so with the rest; nor were the old heaps touched till the plough went through them in tilling the field, when the lime was
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035770_0503_1006C2A4EA984048"/>
there turned up, with only a very small mixture of soil. The consequence was, that at every one of these heaps, a tuft of corn sprung up with such luxuriance as to be entirely rotted before harvest;—and for many years afterwards, these tufts could be distinguished from the other parts of the field, at a very great distance, like so many buttons on a coat;—and, perhaps, continue so to this day.</p>
                     <p>From these experiments, as well as other consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations that will afterwards occur,—there seems to be reason to conclude, that on soils which do not naturally abound with chalk, or other calcareous matter, there is less danger in giving too much lime, than in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too little; except in those cases where an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luxuriance is dreaded.</p>

                     <p>I have often heard it urged, as an objection to the use of lime as a manure, that although it does indeed promote the fertility of a soil, in a higher degree at first, yet, in the end, it renders it much more steril than formerly; on which account, they say, it ought not to be at all employed.</p>
                     <p>This, like many other objections to useful practices, takes its rise entirely from the avarice and unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those who complain. It is chiefly heard of in those parts of the country where it is not uncommon for a farmer, after once liming a poor soil, to take fifteen or sixteen crops of oats successively, without any other dressing or alternation of crops. It must be a good manure that enables these soils to produce such a number of successive scourging crops of any sort: But it would be a marvellous one, indeed, if it should prevent those fields from being exhausted by them.</p>
                     <p>But, is it not well known, that in all the richest and best improved parts of the country, lime has been long employed as a manure? Yet, so far are these soils from being rendered steril by it, that it is doubtful if
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035770_0504_1006C2A6D534FC50"/>
any art, without the assistance of lime, or some calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous matter, could ever have brought these fields to their present degree of fertility. Those, therefore, who complain of the hurtful effects of lime as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, proclaim what they ought to conceal,—that they have had in their possession a treasure, which might have enriched their posterity, but which they have idly squandered away in their own life-time.</p>

                     <p>We are not only unacquainted with the mode in which lime operates upon the soil, but we are even, in a great measure, ignorant of the actual changes that are produced upon the earth, after this manure is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. So much time is necessary to discover these,—and such accuracy of observation is required, that it will, perhaps, be long before the whole shall be fully ascertained. I shall mention a few that have occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to myself.</p>
                     <p>It is often asked, how long the effects of lime may be perceived on the soil? and, if by this question it be meant to ascertain the length of time that the effects of lime will be perceptible in promoting the luxuriance of the crop after one manuring, it is no wonder that very different answers should be given, as the effects must vary with the quantity or quality of the lime employed; the nature of the crops that follow, and many other circumstances, that it would be impossible here to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate.</p>
                     <p>But if it be viewed in another light; if lime be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to alter the soil, so as to render it susceptible of being affected by other manures in a more sensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, so as to make it capable of producing crops, that no art could otherwise have effected, and to admit of being improved by modes of culture that would not otherwise have produced any sensible benefit; the answer to the question would be more easy, as, in this light, it is pretty plain, that its effects will be felt, perhaps, as long as the soil exists.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="unknown:035770_0505_1006C2AA665D9050"/>
I believe, farmers are seldom accustomed to consider lime, or other calcareous manures, in this last point of view; although, when it comes to be inquired into, I doubt not but this will be found to be by far the most valuable effect of these manures. A few facts will best illustrate my meaning:</p>
                     <p>In Derbyshire, the farmers have found, that by spreading lime in considerable quantities upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face or their heathy moots, after a few years, the heath disappears, and the whole surface becomes covered with a fine pile of grass, consisting of white clover, and the other valuable sorts of pasture-grasses. This shows, that lime renders the soil unfriendly to the growth of heath, and friendly to that of clover.</p>
                     <p>It is found by experience, that in all porous soils, which are not exposed to too much dampness, in every part of Scotland, where lime ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not been employed, heath has a natural, and almost irresistible propensity to establish itself. In those parts of the country where lime has been much used as a manure, we find, that the fields may be allowed to remain long in grass, without being covered with that noxious plant.</p>
                     <p>Again:—It is well known by those who have been attentive, and have had opportunities of observing the fact, that peas, of any sort, can never be successfully cultivated in any part of the country, where the soil is not of a very strong clayey nature, or where lime or other calcareous manures have never been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If the ground be made as rich as possible with common dung, although the peas, in that case, will vegetate, and grow for some time with vigour; yet, before they begin to ripen, they become blighted; usually die away entirely before the pod is formed, and but rarely produce a few half-formed peas.</p>
                     <p>But if the ground has ever been limed, although, perhaps, at the distance of thousands of years before that period, it never loses its power of producing good crops of peas, if it is put in a proper tilth for carrying them at that time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="unknown:035770_0506_1006C2B252E933A8"/>
Again:—In countries that have never been limed, the kinds of grass that spontaneously appear, if left to themselves, are the small bent-grass and feather-grass. In places where lime has ever been used, the ground, if exhausted, produces fewer plants of these grasses; but in their stead, white clover, the poa and fescue grasses, chiefly abound.</p>
                     <p>The soil, in either of these cases, may become equally <hi>poor;</hi>—that is, may produce equally scanty crops: But, the means of recovering them will be somewhat different. In the last case, a fallow seldom fails to prove beneficial. In the first, it is often of no effect, sometimes, even hurtful. In the last, a moderate dressing of dung, produces a much more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and lasting effect, than in the other. In the last, the quality of the grass, as well as its quantity, rather improves by age. In the first, these circumstances are reversed.</p>
                     <p>I might mention several other observations, tending to show that ground, which has been once impregnated with calcareous matter, acquires qualities from that moment which it did not possess before, which it ever afterwards retains, and never returns exactly to its former state. But, I have said enough to suggest this idea:—future observations will show how justly it is founded.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="23" type="section">

                     <p>Although lime has such powerful effects on the soil, it does not seem ever to incorporate with the mould, so as to form one homegeneous mass; but the lime remains always in detached particles, which are larger or smaller, in proportion as it has been more or less perfectly divided when it was spread, or broken down by the subsequent mechanical operations the soil may have been made to undergo.</p>
                     <p>Hence it happens, that in ploughing, if there chance to be any lumps of calcareous matter in a dry state,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035770_0507_1006C2B80FDF2410"/>
upon the surface, they naturally tumble into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the open furrow, as soon as the earth is edged up upon the mould-board, so as to fall into the lowest place that has been made by the plough before the furrow is fairly turned over.</p>
                     <p>In consequence of this circumstance, it must hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that, in the course of many repeated ploughings, more of the lime will be accumulated at the bottom of the soil, than in any other part of it. And as the plough sometimes goes a little deeper than ordinary, the lime, that on these occasions chances to be deposit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bottom of these furrows will be <hi>below</hi> the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary staple of the soil, it will be useless for the purposes of the farmer. It is commonly thought, that the lime has <hi>sunk</hi> through the soil by its own gravity;—although it is certain, that lime is specifically lighter than any soil, and can only be accumulated at the bottom of the mould by the means above described; others think, that the lime is chemically dissolved, and afterwards deposited there; but this idea is not corroborated by the facts that have fallen under my observation. The directions that follow are equally applicable in either case.</p>
                     <p>To obviate this inconvenience, it behoves the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in the first place, to be extremely attentive to have his lime divided into as small particles as possible at the time of spreading: For, if these are sufficiently small, they incorporate so intimately with the mould, as to be incapable of being easily detached from it. On this account, as well as others, it is always most advisable to spread the lime when in its dry powdery state, immediately after slaking, before it has had time to run into lumps.</p>
                     <p>It is also of importance to plough the soil with a more shallow furrow than usual, when lime is put upon it; especially the first time it is ploughed after the lime has been spread upon its surface: Because, at that ploughing, the lime being all on the surface, a
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035770_0508_1006C2B9BB7F81A0"/>
larger proportion of it is turned into the bottom of the last-made furrow, than at any succeeding ploughing; and therefore more of it will be buried beneath the staple than at any other time, if the furrow shall have been very deep.</p>
                     <p>This circumstance becomes more essentially neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in ploughing grass-ground that has been newly limed; because, in this case, the lime is less capable of being mixed with any part of the soil than in any other.</p>
                     <p>It also becomes extremely necessary, in all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times, to guard as much as possible against ploughing to unequal depths.</p>
                     <p>I have hitherto spoken only of <hi>lime</hi> as a manure; but most of these observation, it will appear, may be equally applied to other calcareous matters. That the comparative value of these, and the real difference between them, when compared separately with lime, as well as with one another, may be fully understood, it will be necessary to consider each class of these sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances separately, and point our with precision its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar distinctive qualities.</p>

                     <p>All the writers on agriculture whom I have ever yet met with, have considered the several classes of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous substances as distinct kinds of manures, and as possessing qualities extremely different from one anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on many occasions. And hence it happens, that sometimes one of these, which chances to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the favourite of the author, and sometimes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is highly recommended, while the others are des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised as useless, or reprobated as pernicious.</p>
                     <p>In this manner, a very late Writer, <note n="*" place="bottom">The Author of the Complete English Farmer.</note> with whom chalk is a peculiar favourite, says, 'I will lay it
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035770_0509_1006C2BE5B565250"/>
down as a certain and incontrovertible maxim, that <hi>chalk</hi> fresh from the pit, laid on and managed as before directed, in the proper season, will enrich every sort of earth it is laid upon; and that <hi>lime,</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, laid on at whatever time, or managed in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever manner, will, after the first or second year, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish every soil it mixes with.</p>
                     <p>It would be no difficult matter to produce other authors, who, in a like decisive manner, reprobate the use of <hi>chalk,</hi> while they enlarge, without bounds, on the qualities of <hi>lime;</hi> and others who prefer <hi>marle</hi> of different sorts, or some of the other classes of calcareous earths, as the most valuable of all manures, while they condemn the others beyond all bounds of moderation.</p>
                     <p>The truth, however, is, that although these authors may be right in recommending their own favourite manures, the beneficial effects of which they may have often experienced; as they usually condemn the others merely from early prejudices, or imperfect trials of them, which have not succeeded, their decisions ought only to be considered as a proof of their being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>real</hi> qualities of the matters they condemn, and of that presumptuous weakness which is ever the attendant of ignorance.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can afford a stronger proof, that the author above mentioned was totally unacquainted, either in theory or practice, with the <hi>real</hi> difference between chalk and lime, than the positive distinction he has made between these two substance as a manure.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Reader ought to be informed, that the <hi>lime</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, is lime made from the very <hi>chalk</hi> he so much approves of.</note>

                     <p>CHALK, as has been often said in the course of this Essay, is a pure calcareous earth, hastily concreted. Sometimes it is mixed with a small proportion of <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillaceous</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Clayey,</note> matter, in which state it approaches to the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035770_0511_1006C2C9A3FB3268"/>
nature of <hi>marle.</hi> In either the one or the other of these states, it is employed as a manure in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where it abounds.</p>
                     <p>Chalk differs not from lime in any particular that can affect the farmer, unless it be that <hi>lime,</hi> by being in the state of a fine powder, admits of being more equally spread upon the ground, and more intimately mixed with the soil, than <hi>chalk;</hi>—from whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that a much smaller quantity of lime may be employed successfully as a dressing for ground, than could possibly be the case with chalk.</p>
                     <p>In order, therefore, to make chalk produce the greatest possible effect upon the soil, it becomes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to reduce it into as small pieces as can be done; so that it ought to be an object of great importance to those farmers who have an opportunity of employing this substance, to discover what is the easiest and least expensive method of reducing it, as soon as possible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is spread upon the soil, into very small portions.</p>
                     <p>Chalk is such a porous substance, that when in its native bed, after long and continued rains, it is found to have imbibed a great deal of moisture, by which it assumes a softish feel to the touch.</p>
                     <p>But if chalk be dug out of the pit and dried slowly and perfectly by the heat of a summer's sun, its pores become in some degree contracted;—it resists, in a great measure; the fresh admission of water, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a much greater degree of hardness, than when it was originally dug from the quarry.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, if it be taken from the pit during the wet weather in winter, and exposed to the rains that usually fall at that season, it has never time to dry—its pores remain quite full of water; and when the frost comes on, that water in the act of freezing, being greatly expanded, bursts it forcibly asunder, and makes it crumble down into a slimy kind of powder: And as the pieces that may remain undecomposed, continue to absorb more as the rains fall from the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035770_0512_1006C2CD41DA3E40"/>
heavens, the frosts that may succeed occasion a new dissolution;—so that by these alternate rains and frosts, the whole is in time totally divided, so as to admit of being pretty evenly spread, and mixed with the soil.</p>
                     <p>For these reasons, it is always expedient to dig the chalk in the beginning of winter, and to spread it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the field as well as can be done, so as to expose it to the vicissitudes of the winter weather, before it has had time to harden after being taken from the pit.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="27" type="section">
                     <head>§ 27.</head>
                     <p>As the chalk ought always to be carried to the field while yet wet, it, in a great measure, prevents those who may be at a distance from the place where it is found, from being benefitted by this manure; because the carriage of it would in these circumstances be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely burdensome.</p>
                     <p>To obviate this inconvenience, it becomes a very economical practice, to reduce it to the state of lime before it is carried home: For, in this way, the weight is not only much diminished by the dissipation of all the moisture from the chalk, but it can also be carried home in summer, when the weather and roads are at the best; and a much smaller quantity will produce an equal effect, than when it is in the state of chalk.</p>
                     <p>Those, therefore, who have no other calcareous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure within reach of them but chalk, when that is at a considerable distance, ought always to drive it in the state of lime. But those who are close by the pit, will, in general, find it more economical to employ it in the state of chalk.</p>

                     <p>Chalk so much abounds in the southern parts of Britain, that ships sometimes bring it as a ballast to the north; on which occasions, it may be purchased at a moderate price by the farmer. But although it
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035770_0513_1006C2D14A2021F0"/>
contains perhaps nearly an equal quantity of calcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter as the same bulk of some very pure kinds of lime, yet it will not be good economy in him to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase it at the same price with the lime, as at least three or four times more chalk than lime will need to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to his soil, before it produces an equal effect: For, as it is impossible to get that hard dry chalk re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to small enough parts, a great quantity must be applied before it can produce any sensible effect; and although the effects of this manure may be lasting, yet it is never any thing near equal to lime, if applied in equal quantities.</p>
                     <p>Another calcareous matter, of great utility as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, is <hi>marle</hi>—The distinctive properties of which fall now to be considered.</p>

                     <head>OF MARLE.</head>
                     <p>Few substances appear under a greater diversity of forms, than marle. Hence it is usual for writers on agriculture, to enumerate, as distinct manures, the several varieties of this general class of bodies. But as all the different kinds of marle that have hitherto been discovered, may be reduced to two general classes, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                        <hi>earthy</hi> marles, which are always found in festal strata under the earth, and <hi>shell</hi> marle, which always retains evident marks of its animal origin. I shall consider each of these separately, as distinct substances.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="30" type="section">

                     <head>Of Earthy or Fossil Marle.</head>
                     <p>The varieties of this class of bodies are distinguished by names suggested by the appearance they assume when fresh dug from their native beds. When they are soft, and of an uniform texture, they are called clay marles; when firm and hard, stone marles; when
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035770_0514_1006C2DA472C0F40"/>
these assume a thin foliacious appearance, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated slate marles, and so on.</p>
                     <p>But whatever appearance they assume when fresh dug, or by whatever name they are known, they all agree in this, that if they be exposed for a sufficient time to the action of the air, they crumble into smaller parts, and fertilize the earth to which they have been properly applied.</p>
                     <p>The ingenious Dr. Ainslie has demonstrated, by an accurate set of experiments recorded in the Physical and Literary Essays, in the third vol. of my Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Essays, That all the varieties of this class of bodies contain a considerable proportion of clay; unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with calcareous matter; whereas lime-stone, if it does not consist of pure calcareous matter, is usually united with sand in various proportions.</p>
                     <p>The calcareous matter in marle, does not differ in any respect from that in lime-stone, and its proportions in many cases is the same in marle as in lime-stone;—so that the difference between the appearance and qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of these two substances, arises entirely from the nature of the heterogeneous bodies mixed with the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous matters.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>marle</hi> is exposed to the air, the clay, in its composition, absorbs the moisture that falls from the clouds—swells with it—becomes soft—and, gradually losing its cohesion, crumbles to pieces. If lime-stone is exposed to the air, the sand in its composition is not in the least affected by moisture, and it retains its original figure and dimensions for a great length of lime.</p>
                     <p>When sand is mixed with the clay that enters into the composition of marle, it assumes a stony-like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and is more or less firm, according to the quantity of sand, or other circumstances. But where there is clay at all in the composition, it will be gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally softened by water acting upon it; and it is owing to this circumstance alone, that stone-marles fall in time to pieces when exposed to the air.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:035770_0515_1006C2DC3228B2C0"/>
But if marle be exposed to the action of a moderate fire, the clay in its composition, becomes hard—it is no longer capable of absorbing water, or of being affected by it in any degree; so that the marle, if not of a very pure sort, or such as contains only a very small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of clay mixed with the sand in its composition, will become firmer after burning than it was before, and be in this state with more difficulty reduced to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is the reverse of what happens with lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
                     <p>Marle, therefore, is fit to act as a manure, without any other preparation than digging it from the pit, and spreading it upon the ground; whereas lime-stone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways requires to be reduced to a powder, either by burning or otherwise, before it can be of any use in that way.</p>
                     <p>But as lime-stone is at once reduced into much smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler parts by calcination than marle ever can be brought to at first, a much smaller proportion of lime may be equally spread over an acre of ground, than of marle; and therefore it will produce, in equal quantities, a much more sensible effect.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>The discerning reader, who attends to these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, will easily perceive the reasons for all the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities of practice that prevail with regard to the application of lime and marle, and be able, without embarrassment, to judge in what cases it may be most for his profit to employ the one or the other of these manures, when they are both within his power.</p>
                     <p>He may ascertain the proportion of calcareous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in the marle, by the same process al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready described for trying lime stone, page 72, and thus compare the intrinsic value of the lime and marle in any case. For this is always in proportion to the calcareous matter contained in either.</p>
                     <p>He will easily perceive, however, that the same
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035770_0516_1006C2DFE1B75900"/>
quantity of calcareous matter in the state of <hi>lime,</hi> will produce a much greater effect than when it is in the state of <hi>marle;</hi> because it is divided into infinitely smaller particles, can be more equally spread upon the ground, and more intimately mixed with the soil.</p>
                     <p>Hence it universally happens, that a much larger quantity of marle is applied at one dressing, than of lime. From one to two hundred cart-loads of marle is a common dressing to an acre, that is, from three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to six thousand bushels; whereas, from thirty to three hundred bushels of lime is a common dressing for an acre of ground.</p>
                     <p>In these proportions, it is reasonable to think that the effects of the marle will continue to be longer felt than those of the lime: For, as the marle is gradually broken into smaller pieces every year, these will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively mix with the soil, and produce an effect nearly similar to what might be expected from an annual dressing of lime.</p>
                     <p>It may likewise be expected, that a full dressing of marle, in the proportions above named, will produce a more capital improvement upon light spungy grounds, than an ordinary dressing of lime;—because, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the calcareous matter, the large proportion of clay applied in this manner, may produce some altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the quality of the soil. This alteration, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, will be different, according to the nature of the extraneous matter contained in the marle.</p>
                     <p>But as all marles contain clay, it is natural to think that clay lands will not be benefitted at all by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, as in these cases the calcareous matter alone in the marle will be to such soils an useful addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence light land will be in general more highly benefitted by this manure than clay land, which has given rise to the following vulgar rhyme:

The truth, however, is, that clay is as highly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted by the calcareous matter in marle, as sand is; so that a rich marle will be nearly equally beneficial in both cases. But there are some kinds of clays that are very free from any mixture of sand, and assume the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of marle; and are so called, although they hardly contain almost any calcareous matter at all. These may perhaps, on some occasions, be an useful addition to light soils, and worth the expense of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them when near, but could scarcely be of any use at all upon clayey soils. It has probably been some poor kind of marle of this sort that has given rise to the proverb above quoted.</p>

                     <p>I shall not pretend to prescribe positive rules for determining when the one or the other of these sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, <hi>lime</hi> or <hi>marle,</hi> ought to be preferred as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure; as a decision in favour of the one or the other must, in a great measure, depend upon the situation of the place where they can be both obtained; the purity of either of them respectively; the price at which they may be purchased, and the expense of carriage: all these circumstances may be best ascertained by every individual for himself.</p>
                     <p>But I may be allowed to observe, that it argues a great want of knowledge of the real qualities of these substances, when a man prefers the one of these, and condemns the other, in all cases. For it is mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a matter of calculation, <hi>when</hi> the one, or <hi>when</hi> the other, may be most valuable to any particular person.</p>
                     <p>If the marle be tolerably rich, and can be obtained at little expense near the field in the proportions usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed, it will be, in general, more advantageous to the possessor, who has a prospect of enjoying his farm for a long time, to use marle in preference to lime.</p>
                     <p>But when it must be brought from a distance, <hi>lime,</hi>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:035770_0518_1006C2EA8E1A8CC8"/>
in all cases, will be cheaper, and on that account better than <hi>marle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If marle contains a great proportion of clay, it may be worth the expense of driving to a light soil on some occasions, even where lime could be procured as cheap: But, on all occasions, if the same quantity of calcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter in the state of lime can be obtained at the same price, <hi>that</hi> will be a much more beneficial ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure for clayey soils than marle. Impure marle is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed seldom worth the expense of carting on a clayey soil.</p>
                     <p>Some readers will be much dissatisfied at reading this short account of the nature of marle, and its oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as a manure. For as they have been accustomed to look upon this manure as possessing some very sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular qualities peculiar to itself, and to think that it differed from lime in some very essential respects, and would produce effects upon the soil nowise similar to that which would be produced by lime in any case; they will feel a kind of uneasiness at being obliged to strike this one off their list of distinct and separate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures. But it is the business of true philosophy to eradicate that spirit for mysterious credulity, which is so apt to lull the reasoning faculty asleep, and make the mind rest satisfied with the contemplation of ideal phantoms created by the fancy, instead of real objects of useful knowledge.</p>

                     <head>Of Shell Marle.</head>
                     <p>Shell marle is always found in low places, that either are, or have been covered with water. It is a whitish powder, that has been formed by the gradual decomposition of shells, in the course of many ages. It is, therefore, a pure calcareous matter, without any other mixture than the mud and other sediments, that may have sunk to the bottom of the water, in ponds where it has been formed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="unknown:035770_0519_1006C2EFB6C335F8"/>
As the proportion of sediment that may have mixed with the shells, may be very different in different situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; this kind of marle, like all others, may be more or less pure, and, of consequence, of greater of smaller value to the farmer. Its purity may be determined by the mode prescribed, page 72, and its value thus ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with precision.</p>
                     <p>It is usually a light, spungy substance, very slightly coherent; and contains more calcareous matter in proportion to its weight, than the common sorts of lime. And as it admits of being spread as equally as lime, it may in general be carried with profit as far as lime.</p>
                     <p>But as it is more spungy than lime, perhaps a smaller quantity will fill the measure; on which account, the prime cost of the same quantity of marle ought to be a little below that of lime, to be equally profitable to the farmer.</p>
                     <p>Shell marle, however, cannot be carried so far with profit as shell lime of the best sort; as this last, in that state, wants a great proportion of its moisture, air, &amp;c. which greatly diminishes its weight.</p>
                     <p>It is, nevertheless, a very great treasure to those who can discover it, as it is almost in all cases of equal value with lime, produces the same effect upon the soil, admits of being equally easily spread, and can for the most part be obtained, upon the spot, at a much smaller expense.</p>
                     <p>But, in situations where fuel is scarce and dear, it is of much greater value than the best lime-stone, and ought to be prized accordingly by every possessor of ground: nor ought any one, in such a situation, to omit searching diligently every place where there is the smallest probability of finding it.</p>

                     <p>On many parts of the sea-coast, great beds of shells are to be found, which have been broken into such small parts as to assume the appearance of sand. This is a rich and valuable manure, that deserves to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prized by those who are within reach of it; but, it is too often neglected and unobserved, as this kind of sand has, on many occasions, very much the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ordinary sand.</p>
                     <p>This may readily be discovered, by pouring a little aqua-fortis, or any other mineral acid, <note n="*" place="bottom">Many persons make this trial with <hi>vinegar,</hi> instead of the mineral acids; but this ought never to be done, as it often happens, that vinegar makes no sensible effervescence with calcareous substances. I would, therefore, advise every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gentleman, to keep a phial of aqua-fortis, or muriatic acid, always by him, for making trials of calcareous substances: the expense is next to nothing; and I am pursuaded, from the want of it alone, many persons have failed to make dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of calcareous matters that might have been of high importance to themselves and families.</note> upon the sand you wish to examine. If it contains shells, an effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence will ensue; and the proportion of calcareous matter contained in any sort of sand, may be ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the same process already so often referred to, p. 72. Nor ought this trial ever to be omitted before the sand is employed as a manure; because, a very small proportion of shells will make it effervesce vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, so that the degree of effervescence is no proof of its purity, and because the proportion of shells va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in all possible degrees.</p>
                     <p>If the shells are broken into very small fragments, and if the proportion of sand be inconsiderable, it will be nearly as valuable as lime, and may be driven to a great distance with profit. If the proportion of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

                     <p>But as it may, for the most part, be procured at little expense, those who are possessed of it, are usually able to employ it in great quantities; in which case, it will produce amazing effects, especially upon strong clay-land.</p>
                     <p>A much smaller quantity of calcareous matter in this state, will produce a more sensible effect, than when it is in any sort of earthy marle; because it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of being more equally spread upon the ground, and more intimately mixed with the soil. Those, therefore, who are upon the sea-coast, ought to search for it with care, as they will usually obtain an invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treasure when they discover it.</p>
                     <p>This sort of sand is much more common on the east coast of Scotland, than is usually imagined. All along the coast of Fife, especially about St. Andrew's, the sand upon the shore is richly impregnated with shells;—but, it has never there been employed as a manure. On the north coast of Aberdeenshire, shelly sand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, and has been of late employed as a manure, with the greatest success, by a gentleman distinguished for his knowledge and public spirit in that corner. It is likewise found in Banff-shire, where it has been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the highest success. And all along the coast of Southerland and Caithness, the sands upon the shore consist almost entirely of shells.</p>
                     <p>These are treasures which will enrich posterity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are at present, in a great measure neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I mention them here, to induce my countrymen not to neglect a treasure of such inestimable value. But on the west coasts of Scotland, and among the isl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands, shelly-sand much more abounds, and its effects as a manure, are much more generally known than on the cast coast, so that it is there universally employed as the most efficacious manure with which they are acquainted. Its effects upon some of their heathy
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035770_0522_1006C2FCAE190E50"/>
mossy soils, appears to be, in some cases, little short of enchantment.</p>
                     <p>The ingenious Mr. Craik, in Dumfrieshire, so well known for his judicious improvements in the drill husbandry, has, I am told, employed this manure for a longer time, and in greater quantities, than any other person in Scotland, and has been highly benefitted by it. I wish to produce such a respectable authority, with a view to induce others to follow his example.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Arthur Young, in one of his Tours, mentions a bed of shells near Colchester, in Essex, which the inhabitants distinguish by the name of <hi>Cragg,</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy as a manure, with great success. From his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this substance, it would seem doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was a real calcareous matter or not: But he only tried it with vinegar, an acid too weak to produce any sensible effect on many sorts of calcareous matters, in certain circumstances. There is little room to doubt, but that, with a mineral acid, the effervescence would have been sufficiently violent.</p>

                     <p>In some places, there are found large beds of oyster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells, almost entire. These are so large as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be broken into smaller fragments, before they can be profitably employed as a manure.—And as these may be easily calcined, they ought always to be reduced to the state of lime before they are used. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever finds a bed of these shells, finds a lime-quarry of the most valuable sort, and ought to value it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                     <p>It may be sometimes necessary to burn shelly sand into lime; and this may, on extraordinary emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, be practised, although it is rather a troublesome operation: For, as the incoherent sand always mixes with the fuel, and extinguishes the fire when in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035770_0523_1006C301707A81D8"/>
state, it becomes necessary to reduce it first to some degree of consistency.—This may be effected by knead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sand with a little clay, and moulding it into the form of bricks; which, when dried, will retain their form so long as to permit the fire to act upon the shells, and burn them to lime, which may be afterwards slaked and used. A manufacture of this kind was for some time carried on at the Duke of Bridgewater's great works, near Warrington, in Lancashire, as I am told, under the direction of the ingenious Mr. Brindley.</p>
                     <p>In situations where lime-stone cannot possibly be had, and where the carriage of <hi>lime</hi> would be extremely expensive, it may sometimes be advisable to burn some of this shelly sand into lime, for the <hi>purpose of building;</hi>

                     <p>This is a manure little known in Britain, although it is common in many parts of Ireland. It is a hard sort of marle, that assumes the appearance of small stones, or gravel, which, when spread upon the ground, and mixed with it, gradually falls into smaller pieces, and fertilizes the soil in proportion as it breaks down and mixes with it.</p>
                     <p>After what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> already occurred, little needs be said as to the qualities or mode of applying this manure.
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035770_0524_1006C3071F76D328"/>
The reader will easily be able to perceive, that if the pieces of which this gravel consists are large, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve but slowly, the quantity applied at one dressing ought to be great, and the effects will be slow and lasting;—and, if the gravel is small, it will require a smaller quantity, will operate more quickly, and last for a shorter time, like all other calcareous substances in the same circumstances.</p>
                     <p>These are all the varieties of calcareous matter that I have ever known to be used as a manure. They are all extremely useful in proper circumstances—perhaps equally so, if these circumstances are duly attended to. To assist the farmer still farther, the following general Aphorisms relating to the application of calcareous matters, as a manure, may be of use:</p>
                  </div>

                     <head>§ 38.</head>
                     <head>APHORISM 1.</head>
                     <p>There seems to be only one kind of calcareous matter; and all the varieties of calcareous substances that we meet with, are entirely occasioned by a diversity in the nature of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous bodies with which the calcareous matter is united, or a difference in the form it may appear in at the time.</p>
                     <p>Considered as a manure, these extraneous matters may be more or less beneficial, according to particular circumstances relating to the soil, &amp;c. In all the fossil calcareous concretions, clay or sand seem to be the only extraneous matters worth attending to, neither of which can ever be of great consequence as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, although they may be more or less proper for different soils. In those calcareous substances that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the animal kingdom, the fleshy parts of the animals may be sometimes united with the calcareous, which will greatly promote their effects as a manure on every sort of soil whatever. This does not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, seem to be the case, either with shell-marle, or
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035770_0525_10069094F4C83118"/>
fine shelly sand; as, in both these cases, the animals which once inhabited these shells, have been so long dead that no part of the fleshy substance can remain. But the recent shells obtained from fishing towns, operate much more powerfully as an animal manure, than as a calcareous matter, when first applied.</p>
                     <p>It is not impossible but that man may in time fall upon some contrivance for obtaining this animal cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous manure in much greater abundance and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than it has hitherto been obtained. There is a small species of fresh water <hi>wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>—which increases so fast, as, in a surprisingly short time, to fill a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable space with solid wilks, if a few of them have been placed in a proper receptacle for that purpose, and water duly administered to them. If then ponds were prepared for this purpose, and properly stocked with this animal, and if they were allowed to increase till a bed of them, of considerable thickness, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated, might they not then be taken out in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to be employed as a manure? These, if bruised under a stone like a tanner's wheel, to reduce the shells to small fragments, would certainly form as rich and efficacious a manure as could possibly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised: nor could there be any difficulty in disposing the ponds in such a manner as to afford a constant annual supply.</p>
                     <p>It has probably been by a natural process similar to this, that all those beds of shell-marle we now meet with, have been originally produced. This species of marle is generally found to consist of the shells of this sort of small wilk, more or less decomposed. The animals which inhabited these shells have been once nourished by the water contained in those hollow places where this sort of marle is always found, and have probably been entirely destroyed by some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental drought, which deprived them of the water necessary for their existence, or to some other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astrous circumstance that it is impossible for us now to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035770_0526_1006C3123B4DEA50"/>
point out; and the shells remaining behind, gradually mouldered down to the state in which we now find them.</p>

                     <p>The same quantity of calcareous matter, will, in all cases, operate equally powerful on soils of a similar quality, when in a similar state. But these effects may be accelerated or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> applied to the soil.</p>
                     <p>If the calcareous matter be divided into very small Particles, so as to admit of being equally spread over a very large surface, a small quantity of it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a much more sensible effect, than if the same quantity of calcareous matter had been applied in large lumps, which could, in that case, have operated only upon a very few particles of the soil:—Therefore, <hi>lime, sine shelly sand, or shell marle,</hi> if equally pure, may be applied, with profit, in much smaller quantities than any other class of calcareous manures.</p>
                     <p>Hence also it follows, that if equal quantities of calcareous matter are employed as a manure, that kind which admits of being most minutely divided; will produce the greatest effect at the beginning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the separate particles will be at liberty to act on a much greater number of particles of the soil at once, than when it is less perfectly divided.</p>
                     <p>But if a sufficient quantity of calcareous matter has been applied, when in pretty large masses, so as to cover the ground pretty equally; and if these lumps continue to dissolve in the soil in all after-periods, the effect of this dressing will be much longer perceived, than that of a dressing of calcareous matter in fine powder, that should produce at first an effect equal to this.—Perhaps, in this case, the virtue of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035770_0527_1006C3165C41D748"/>
of the calcareous matter will come, in time, to produce a full effect upon the soil, and benefit it nearly as much as an equal quantity of very finely powdered calcareous matter would have done, applied at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times. Stone and clay marles, therefore, are equally efficacious manures as powdered lime, although more slow in their operation.</p>
                     <p>But as lime that has been suffered to run into solid cakes before it is applied to the soil, can neither be properly spread upon it, nor has any chance of being dissolved by the action of the air afterwards, it never can be made to produce its full influence on the soil; and therefore this mode of applying calcareous matter is the most uneconomical that could ever be practised.</p>

                     <p>Calcareous matter, alone, is not capable of rearing plants to perfection: mould is necessary to be mixed with it, in certain proportions before it can form a proper soil. It remains, however, to be determined, what is the due proportion of these ingredients for forming a proper soil.</p>
                     <p>We know, that neither chalk, nor marle, nor lime, can be made to nourish plants alone; and soils are sometimes found, that naturally abound with the two first of these to a faulty degree. But the proportion of calcareous matter in these is so much larger than could ever be produced by art, where the soil was naturally destitute of these substances, that there seems to be no danger of erring on that side. Probably, it would be much easier to correct the defects of those soils in which calcareous matters superabound, by driving earth upon them as a manure, than is generally imagined, as a very small proportion of it sometimes affords a very perfect soil. I shall illustrate my meaning by a few examples.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="unknown:035770_0528_1006C319916337B8"/>
Near Sandside, in the county of Caithness, there is a pretty extensive plain on the sea-coast, endowed with a most singular degree of fertility. In all seasons, it produces a most luxuriant herbage, although it never got any manure since the creation, and has been for time immemorial subjected to the following course of crops:</p>
                     <p>1<hi>st,</hi> Bear, after once ploughing from grass, usually a good crop.</p>
                     <p>2<hi>d,</hi> Bear after once ploughing, a better crop than the first.</p>
                     <p>3<hi>d,</hi> Bear after once ploughing, a crop equal to the first.</p>
                     <p>4<hi>th,</hi> 5<hi>th,</hi> and 6<hi>th,</hi> Natural grass, as close and rich as could be imagined,—might be cut if the possessor so inclined, and would yield an extraordinary crop of hay each year.</p>
                     <p>After this, the same course of cropping is renewed. The soil that admits of this singular mode of farming, appears to be a pure incoherent sand, destitute of the smallest particle of vegetable mould;—but, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, it is found to consist almost entirely of brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en shells: the fine mould here, bears such a small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the calcareous matter, as to be scarcely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, and yet it forms the most fertile soil that ever I yet met with.</p>
                     <p>I have seen many other links (downs) upon the sea shore, which produced the most luxuriant herbage, and the closest and sweetest pile of grass, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of shelly sand, which, without doubt, derive their extraordinary fertility from that cause.</p>
                     <p>A very remarkable plain is found in the Island of <hi>Tir-eye</hi> or <hi>Tyre-ty,</hi> one of the Hebrides.—It has long been employed as a common, so that it has never been disturbed by the plough; and affords annually the most luxuriant crop of herbage, consisting of white clover, and other valuable pasture-grasses, that can be met with any where.—The soil consists of a very pure
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035770_0529_1006C31B1AC689B8"/>
shelly sand. And the finest crop of bear, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, I ever saw grow out of the earth, I found in the island of Barra, one of the Hebrides, growing upon a bed of shell-sand, in which, I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the smallest particle of earth. I do suppose, that the produce would have exceeded that of the best crop of barley I ever saw, by two quarters, at least, per acre.—It had been manured with sea ware.</p>
                     <p>From these examples, I think it is evident, that a very small proportion of vegetable mould, is sufficient to render calcareous matter a very rich soil Perhaps, however, a larger proportion may be necessary when it is mixed with clay, than with sand; as poor chalky soils seem to be of the nature of that composition.</p>
                     <p>At any rate, however, from these examples, as well as from those that have occurred in the preceding parts of this Essay, I think we may be sufficiently authorised to conclude, that there is no danger of ever applying calcareous substances to any soil in an over-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if that soil was not originally impregnated with some kind of calcareous matters, and if it shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, cropped in a judicious manner.</p>

                     <p>Calcareous matters act as powerfully upon land that is nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally poor, as upon land that is more richly impregnated with those substances which tend to produce a luxuriant veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etation.</p>
                     <p>Writers on agriculture have been long in the custom of dividing manures into two classes, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                        <hi>enriching</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, or those that tended directly to render the soil more prolific, however sterile it may be,—among the foremost of which was reckoned <hi>dung,</hi>—and <hi>exciting</hi> manures, or those that were supposed to have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to render the soil more prolific, merely by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035770_0530_1006C31F651554F8"/>
upon those enriching manures that had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the soil, and giving them a new stimulus, so as to enable them to operate anew upon that soil which they had formerly fertilized. In which class of stimulating manures, <hi>lime,</hi> was always allowed to hold the foremost rank.</p>
                     <p>In consequence of this theory, it would follow, that lime could only be of use as a manure when applied to rich soils, and, when applied to poor soils, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hardly any,—or even perhaps hurtful effects.</p>
                     <p>I will frankly acknowledge, that I myself, was so far imposed upon by the beauty of this theory, as to be hurried along with the general current of mankind, in the firm persuasion of the truth of this observation, and for many years did not sufficiently advert to those facts that were daily occurring to contradict this theory. I am now, however, firmly convinced, from repeated observations, that lime and other calcareous manures, produce a much greater <hi>proportional</hi> improvement upon poor soils, than on such as are richer: And that lime alone, upon a poor soil, will, in many cases, produce a much greater and more lasting degree of fertility, than dung alone.</p>
                     <p>In direct contradiction to the theory, I must add, that I never yet met with a poor soil in its natural state, which was not benefitted in a very great degree by calcareous matters, when administered in proper quantities. But I have met with several rich soils, that were fully impregnated with dung, and therefore exactly in that state in which the theory supposes that lime would produce the greatest effect; but, upon which, lime, applied in any quantities, produced not the smallest sensible effect.</p>
                     <p>As I concern myself little about theories, this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery gave me much less uneasiness than it will give to some of my readers; on which account, I shall not be much surprised, if they withhold their assent to this proposition for a very long time.

                     <p>I shall conclude this very long Essay with a caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary advice, that might, perhaps, have been more prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly introduced before, if it had occurred at the time; but it is of too much importance to be omitted entirely. It is this:</p>
                     <p>When farmers employ a great deal of lime, it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens that their horses' feet are burnt by it, which is extremely troublesome, and sometimes proves even fatal to the poor animals,<note n="*" place="bottom">I have known several horses actually killed by this means, and others so disabled as never to be perfectly well after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note>; a method of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or remedying that inconvenience will therefore be of use.</p>
                     <p>The best method of preventing any inconvenience of this sort, is to spread the lime, when in its powdery state, upon the field, as evenly as possible, and allow it to lie in that state for some time, before you begin to plough it. If the lime has been in fine powder, it will have become perfectly <hi>eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tte</hi> in a week or so; after which time it will be as little corrosive as any kind of common earth, so that the horses may work among it with perfect safety. But if it has been suffered to run into clods before it was spread, these, if not broken small, will be longer in absorbing their air, and, of consequence, will remain longer in an acrid state, so that the ploughing may, in that case, be deferred for a week or so longer; nor will it be even then so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly safe as the other.</p>
                     <p>But if it becomes necessary at any time to plough in the lime immediately after it is spread,—take care to do it only when the soil is perfectly dry; and in lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

your horses to the plough, take care to prevent them from going through any wet place, so as to wet their hoofs or ankles; for lime acts not at all upon any dry substance,—but when it is in its acrid caustic state, it would corrode the hair and flesh in a moment, if it has access to water. As soon as the horses are unyoked, keep their feet dry till you have got them carefully brushed, so as to wipe away all the dry pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery lime that may adhere to them; and if the least shower should fall, unyoke your horses immediately and carry them off the field.</p>
                     <p>With these precautions, they may work among caustic lime for any length of time, without receiving any damage.</p>
                     <p>But in case of any accident, by which a horse or man that is working among lime should be scalded by it, it is always advisable for every farmer who has work of that kind going forward, to keep a tub of very sour milk or whey in some place ready to wash the part affected well with it, which will quickly des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy the poignancy of the lime, and prevent the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that would otherwise arise from it. The sourer the milk or whey is, the better it will be for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; it ought therefore to be long kept. For want of this, vinegar will produce the same effect, or very stale urine will be of use; but, the milk or whey is the cheapest and best remedy, and ought to be always in readiness.</p>

                     <p>In the preceding Essay, I have supposed that no other <hi>absorbent</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Absorbent earths are all those that unite with acids, of which there are several varieties; calcareous earths being one of these.</note> earth is ever mixed with the <hi>calcareous</hi> in any sort of lime-stone; because, in fact, if ever any of these are mixed with the calcareous in these substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are in such small proportion as not to be worth regarding. Those, however, who want to be critically exact in their analysis of lime-stone, may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover if there is any other sort of absorbent earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, by dropping into the filtred solution ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the process § 13, p. 72, a few drops of a clear solution of volatile alkali. If no turbidness en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, the calcareous earth has been pure. If any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation takes place on adding the alkali, drop more, and more, till no turbidness arises: then filtre the whole: what remains in the filtre, is absorbent earth, that is not calcareous; for acids attract volatile alkali more strongly than any of the absorbent earths, except the calcareous class alone.</p>

                     <p>It may oftener happen, that a considerable proportion of <hi>gypsum</hi> may be united with lime-stone in the same quarry; and as this substance would greatly alter the nature of the lime as a cement (see p. 37) and would probably affect it as much as a manure, it is of more importance to inform the reader of the easiest way of discovering this substance when it is present in lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="unknown:035770_0534_1006C332D5BEECD0"/>
It has been already said, that <hi>gypsum</hi> is a compound, consisting of the vitriolic acid and calcareous earth; and as the vitriolic acid attracts this earth more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than any of the other acids, this composition is not in the least affected by either the nitrous or muriatic acids.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows, that if <hi>gypsum</hi> shall be contained in any calcareous mass examined by the process des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed § 13, p. 72, it will remain untouched by the acid, and be found in the filtre, after the calcareous earth dissolved in the acid shall have passed through it, forming a part of the <hi>residuum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take this <hi>residuum,</hi> therefore,—add to it nearly its weight of fixed alkali<note n="*" place="bottom">Potash.</note> previously dissolved in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable quantity of water, and filtered; digest it in a warm bath, or even boil it for some hours; pour the whole into a filtre, while yet warm; as the fluid passes through the filtre, pour upon it more boiling water; as that passes off, continued to add more water, till it comes through the filtre quite insipid and pure, and then let it run off entirely.</p>
                     <p>By this process, the vitriolic acid leaves the calcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous earth to unite with the fixed alkali (to which it has a stronger affinity) and with it forms a vitriolated tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar:—this vitriolated tartar, and the superfluous alkali, are dissolved by the water, and carried through the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre along with it; so that what remains behind is the earthy part of the <hi>gypsum,</hi> and the heterogeneous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters contained in the original lime-stone. By pouring upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>residuum,</hi> therefore, some nitrous or muriatic acid, and treating it as directed in § 13, page 72, the calcareous earth that was in the <hi>gypsum</hi> will be now entirely dissolved; so that when it is filtered and dry, the difference between the weight of this <hi>residuum,</hi> and what it formerly was, is the real weight of the <hi>gypsum</hi> originally contained in the lime-stone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="unknown:035770_0535_1006C33468B5F770"/>
N. B. If the alkali employed to decompose the <hi>gyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi> was in a <hi>mild</hi> state, the calcareous earth that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains will effervesce strongly when it is dissolving in the acid; but if a <hi>caustic</hi> alkali has been employed, the solution will be effected without any effervescence at all.</p>
                     <p>As vitriolated tartar is not readily soluble in water, a considerable quantity of water requires to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, which ought always to be hot, that the solution may be effected the more readily.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="section">
                     <head>§ 3.</head>
                     <p>It has also been said, (§ 30, p. 52,) that the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous matter contained in lime-stone is sand. But although sand, in general does predominate so much over the other extraneous matters in lime-stone, as to authorise the expression <hi>in general,</hi> yet there are some exceptions that ought to be taken notice of.</p>
                     <p>1<hi>st,</hi> There are some kinds of lime-stone, that, when analysed, are found to contain a <hi>residuum</hi> consisting of a soft slimy-like substance. This is always in very small proportions, and has probably been formed by a sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment subsiding from the water while the rock was forming. It seems probable, that this kind of lime would be less proper to be employed as a cement than as a manure.</p>
                     <p>2<hi>d,</hi> Although marle and lime-stone are justly enough distinguished in the text (§ 5;) yet it happens, that clay and sand are found naturally mixed with one another, in such various proportions, and in these states joined with calcareous matter, than there is no possibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of ascertaining the exact point where marle ends, and lime-stone begins.</p>
                     <p>A very small proportion of clay is sufficient to make an exceedingly hard lime-stone relent in time in the air, and fall to pieces; so that there are many sorts of stone marle that consist chiefly of sand and calcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous earth, and only a very little clay.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="unknown:035770_0536_1006C3379DF87088"/>
These very hard kinds of marle may be easily burnt into lime, so that they may be indifferently called marle or lime-stone.</p>
                     <p>3<hi>d,</hi> The same may be said of the distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween marle and chalk (§ 5. p. 9.) Many substances which have the appearance and distinguishing properties of chalk, contain clay in different proportions. These dissolve in the air, or <hi>run,</hi> as it is termed, more readily than the pure hard kinds of chalk, and feel more unc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous or fatty to the touch; from whence they are called <hi>fat</hi> chalks. These, however, may be converted into lime; so that they might indifferently be called <hi>chalk, marle,</hi> or <hi>lime-stone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The lime that is made from any of those substances that contain clay in their composition, is more proper for manure than for cement; especially that made from those substances that may be made to <hi>fall</hi> after they have undergone only a small degree of heat in calcining them, as in <hi>chalk;</hi> because, in these cases, the clay will not be sufficiently burnt to prevent it from being affected by water, and rendered soft by it.</p>
                     <p>The proportion of clay and sand contained in any lime-stone or marle, may be ascertained, by diffusing in water the <hi>residuum</hi> obtained by the analysis, (§ 13, p. 72<note n="*" place="bottom">Observe, it is <hi>unburnt</hi> lime-stone, or marle only, that should be subjected to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>This is rather a mechanical, than a chemical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, which is called <hi>elutriation.</hi>

                     <p>It has been demonstrated above, § 35, p. 58, that the quality of lime, considered as a cement, is greatly altered, by being more or less perfectly calcined;—it may therefore be, on many occasions, of use to those who are concerned in building, to be able to escertain what proportion of any particular kind of lime is really reduced to a caustic state.—This may be done as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</p>
                     <p>Take a known quantity of the quick-lime, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly dry;—add to that its own weight, or more, of common crude sal-ammoniac,<note n="*" place="bottom">Observe, it is not volatile sal-ammoniac.</note> previously dissolved in a large proportion of water, and filtered;—digest this nearly in a boiling heat for some hours, till no more smell of volatile alkali is found to arise from it, adding fresh water as it evaporates. When the volatile alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line smell is no longer perceived, throw the whole into a filtre,—let that pass off,—add more hot water,—and more still, till it come through the filtre tasteless and pure;—then dry the <hi>residuum,</hi> and weigh it;—the difference between that and the weight of the original lime, denotes the proportion of pure caustic lime that was contained in the original mass.</p>
                     <p>For, as the muriatic acid attracts <hi>caustic</hi> calcareous earth more strongly than it does the volatile alkali, the acid of the sal-ammoniac,<note n="†" place="bottom">Crude sal-ammoniac is a compound salt, consisting of the muriatic acid and the volatile alkali.</note> during the process, quits the alkali, and unites with the lime, and the alkali is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to fly off in a pungent vapour. The now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance formed by the union of the quick-lime with the muriatic acid, is called <hi>liquid shell;</hi> and as this is readily soluble in water, it passes off, together with the remaining undecomposed ammoniacal salt, with the water through the filtre; while the uncaustic lime, as it was neither capable of acting upon the ammonia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"The Author has given Directions for avoiding Dangers, and all other information that he could collect necessary for Pilotage; and he has carefully consulted the Discoveries of modern Navigators. The whole bears the Mark of Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Ability; and we are of opinion that the NAVAL GAZETTEER is a valuable Addition to the Seaman's Library."</p>

                     <p>"We may venture to recommend the NAVAL GAZETTEER as an important Acquisition in the Study of maritime Affairs, and no less useful to the general Student than to the Merchant. The Charts are numerous, and distinctly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated."</p>

                        <hi>Of Fenelon, the Monthly Reviewers said in March, 1796. "The annals of time do not, perhaps, contain a name more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, by the best and wisest friends of the human race, than that of Fenelon; and it is to be doubted, whether any production of human genius ever was so effectual in enlightening mankind, and in rendering them benevolent and just, as the beautiful philosophic poem of Telemachus.
