            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A variety of beautiful examples as well as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable rules for the regulation of our conduct in life, ſo as to be ornaments to ſociety, and bleſſings to our fellow creatures, are ſcattered in the divine oracles.</p>
            <p>Among the numerous <hi>examples</hi> of this kind, ſcarce any are either more lovely in themſelves, or more worthy of our obſervation, eſpecially at the preſent day, than thoſe wherein the ſaint and the ſoldier were united.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>A character like this ſhines with a peculiarly charming luſtre.</p>
            <p>What can give us a more exalted idea of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, than to ſee Moſes, Joſhua, David, and others of a like nobleneſs of ſoul going forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly againſt their enemies, with <hi>the word of God in their mouths,</hi> as well as <hi>a two-edged ſword in their hands?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One but little inferior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to them, either as to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or heroiſm, is preſented us in our text, which is part of a conciſe or ſhort prayer to heaven.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to the words, I ſhall by divine leave conſider particularly, though very briefly, the character of the perſon who makes this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;—the occaſion upon which he prays;—and alſo the prayer itſelf.</p>
            <p>The perſon, who thus ſolemnly addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to heaven, is the excellent and renowned king Jehoſhaphat.—A prince very rich, prudent and powerful, of an amiable diſpoſition and unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed character.</p>
            <p>The ſacred Hiſtorian obſerves, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the beginning of his reign, <hi>he ſtrengthened himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſrael, and placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and ſet garriſons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim, which Aſa his father had taken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was acting a very prudent and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part; but ſenſible however of this eternal truth, that <hi>there was no wiſdom or counſel againſt the Lord;</hi> it is added, that <hi>he ſought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments: Therefore the Lord eſtabliſhed the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Johoſhaphat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and he had riches in abundance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014450_0005_0F925F7542C83820"/>He now ſets upon the very pinacle of honour, in a ſituation extremely critical. For in honor of preferment, there is ſomething intoxicating, which is commonly too much for weak heads.</p>
            <p>But how is it with Jehoſhaphat? How does he behave himſelf in this exalted ſtation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the richeſt ſmiles of proſperity?</p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid, that hereupon <hi>his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Little contracted ſouls would have been lifted up with pride; but the noble Prince was of too generous and exalted a make to be guilty of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious haughtineſs. <hi>His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.</hi> A ſublime elation of ſpirit this!</p>
            <p>Jehoſhaphat's <hi>pleaſantneſs</hi> and <hi>affability</hi> to his ſoldiers, is alſo worthy of remark.</p>
            <p>When <hi>they roſe up early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderneſs of Tek<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And when he had conſulted with the people, he appointed ſingers unto the Lord, that ſhould praiſe the beauty of holineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they went out before the Army, and to ſay, Praiſe the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such an apparent tenderneſs toward his men, accompanied with profeſſed confidence in the divine protection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was doubtleſs of very happy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, filling them with great love and reſpect to their generous commander, and raiſing their ſpirits to a ſublime pitch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:014450_0006_0F925F7600334CD0"/>How beautiful to ſee intrepidity, without raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or pride? Courage guided by counſel and wiſdom, and an air of dignity ſoftened by gentleneſs and ſweetneſs of behaviour! But I can recollect ſcarce any thing recorded of this good king that does him more honor than the <hi>prayer</hi> in our <hi>text;</hi> the occaſion whereof was this—A very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous hoſt, conſiſting of the inhabitants of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Moab and Mount Seir, had come up againſt him, and invaded his dominions.</p>
            <p>Upon receiving intelligence of which, <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord, and proclaimed a Faſt throughout all Judah: And Judah gathered themſelves together to aſk help of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>And Jehoſhaphat ſtood in the congregation of Judah and Jeruſalem, in the houſe of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the new Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I figure to myſelf the pious and amiable Monarch, ſtanding on the <hi>brazen Scaffold</hi> which Solomon had erected for <hi>that purpoſe,</hi> and in the midſt of a very numerous aſſembly, ſpreading forth his hands, and ſolemnly addreſſing the bleſſed and only Potentate, in behalf of himſelf and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved people, I confeſs I am <hi>ſtruck with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold, on <hi>one</hi> ſide, the young, the delicate and fair, ſinking under diſtreſs and fear at the <hi>preſent</hi> alarm; on <hi>another</hi> ſtand the venerable Judges and Elders of Iſrael, whoſe heads were whitened with age.</p>
            <p>On <hi>one</hi> ſide are fathers anxious for the ſafety of their dear families and country; on <hi>another,</hi> tender afflicted mothers, with their little children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here,</hi> with countenances <hi>ſedate,</hi> ſtand rows of ſtateſmen and politicians; <hi>there,</hi> a numerous
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014450_0007_0F925F7A641FAA58"/>
throng of brave and gallant ſoldiers: <hi>All</hi> in <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſilence,</hi> and with their eyes <hi>fixed</hi> on their greatly beloved and much reſpected <hi>Prince,</hi> liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear him begin his ſolemn addreſs to heaven.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, with the greateſt ſolemnity, he at length breaks forth in theſe pertinent and moving expreſſions, <hi>O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in Heaven? And ruleſt not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? And in thine hand is there not power and might, ſo that none is able to withſtand thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How lovely to ſee a <hi>Prince</hi> earneſtly <hi>interceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at the throne of grace for his <hi>people,</hi> and the people all joining in the interceſſion, no leſs anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the preſervation of their prince!</p>
            <p>The moſt noble king Jehoſhaphat, upon ſome <hi>ſpecial</hi> occaſions, did not diſdain or refuſe to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate as <hi>Chaplain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Far from thinking this beneath his dignity (as too many others have done who were unworthy to looſe the latchet of his ſhoes) he rather accounts it a great honour and privilege, that he who feels himſelf to be but duſt, is permited to ſpeak to the ſupreme, infinite Majeſty.</p>
            <p>But I now proceed to a particular conſideration of Jehoſhaphat's <hi>prayer,</hi> more eſpecially that part of it which our <hi>text</hi> contains; wherein theſe <hi>four</hi> things are very obſervable:</p>
            <p>He pleads the goodneſs and righteouſneſs of his <hi>cauſe,</hi> appeals to God to judge between him and his enemies, acknowledges his utter <hi>inability</hi> without divine aſſiſtance, either to conquer or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and profeſſes to repoſe an entire truſt and confidence in God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014450_0008_0F925F7A98A6F578"/>Firſt, He pleads the goodneſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his <hi>cauſe. Behold, I ſay, how they reward us, to come to caſt us out of thy poſſeſſion, which thou haſt given us to inherit.</hi> In the preceeding verſe, he intimates that his people had always behaved <hi>inoffenſive</hi> toward theſe invaders; never giving them any occaſion thus to commence hoſtilities. And now behold, ſays he, <hi>the children of Ammon, and Moab, and Mount Seir, whom thou wouldeſt not let Iſrael invade, when they came out of the land of Epypt; but they turned from them and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Moſes in the ſecond chapter of Deuteronomy relates that God had forbidden Iſrael to deſtroy or diſtreſs theſe nations, commanding them to live peaceably by them as neighbours and brethren.</p>

            <p>And now what vile returns are made by the children of Ammon, Moab, and Edom, for this indulgence? Living nigh, they knew full well what wonders God had wrought for Iſrael; how he had deſtroyed the heathen before them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them the land of Canaan for their inheritance.</p>
            <p>They could not fail of knowing likewiſe, that unleſs propitious Heaven had forbid, <hi>they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> no leſs than the nations round about them, would have been deſtroyed by Iſrael's conquering ſword.</p>

            <p>To <hi>Him</hi> is the glory due, who hath animated our ſoldiers with courage truly aſtoniſhing.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Him</hi> is the glory due, who hath <hi>already</hi> crowned ſome of them with the brighteſt laurels of victory; and hath ſo diſpirited our enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that they are pining away in tormenting diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, almoſt forced to confeſs that <hi>there is no enchantment againſt Jacob, or divination againſt Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then remains, but that we repoſe our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire truſt and confidence in this almighty, moſt kind and gracious Being, who hath thus begun to appear for us?</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, if we look to <hi>ſecond</hi> cauſes, we have wiſe and able politicians, gallant officers, and many thouſands of as brave, undaunted ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as ever faced a foe; but ſtill there is abundant

reaſon to confeſs that of ourſelves <hi>we have no might</hi> againſt our enemies, <hi>neither know what to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this confeſſion, we may juſtly add an humble acknowledgment of our ſhameful <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings</hi> and <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> as a people, and our utter <hi>unworthineſs</hi> of divine favors.</p>
            <p>With hearts deeply affected under a ſenſe of this, may we all break off our <hi>ſins</hi> by repentance, ſaying with afflicted Iſrael, "Come and let us return unto the Lord; for he hath torn, and he will heal us, he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up."</p>
            <p>O, what a favourable proſpect might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us by a univerſal <hi>reformation</hi>!—The whole face of nature would ſeem hereby to be changed, and to put on a chearful ſmile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our light would break forth as the morning, and our health ſpring forth ſpeedily: our righteouſneſs would go before us, and the glory of the Lord be our rereward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this therefore would be ſo <hi>beautiful</hi> in <hi>it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and productive of ſo many happy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, you will not be offended, <hi>gentlemen and ſoldiers,</hi> if upon <hi>this ſolemn occaſion</hi> I earneſtly urge it upon <hi>you,</hi> not forgetting that I <hi>myſelf</hi> alſo have great need of the exhortation.</p>
            <p>You have come forth to jeopard your lives in defence of your friends and relations, your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, religion, liberty, and almoſt every thing that is dear and ſacred. In a <hi>nobler</hi> cauſe, mortals were never engaged</p>
            <p>Of your cordial love to your country and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral courage and reſolution to defend it, none can entertain a doubt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:014450_0020_0F925F84F06000B0"/>There is not, I preſume, a <hi>ſingle one</hi> among you all, who would not <hi>diſdain</hi> to be guilty of <hi>cowardice,</hi> to deſert his colours, or let his ſword reſt quietly in its ſcabbard, whenever <hi>the Lord gives it a charge</hi> againſt the invaders of <hi>Boſton and the ſea ſhore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May your abhorrence of every vicious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and ſtrict adherence to the rules of virtue and religion, be no leſs conſpicuous than your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and magnanimity.</p>
            <p>What a pity 'tis, dear friends, that the <hi>camp</hi> ſhould ſo commonly be a ſchool of <hi>vice?</hi> that they who are <hi>moſt expoſed</hi> to death, ſhould be <hi>leaſt</hi> careful to <hi>prepare</hi> for it?</p>
            <p>Will you not endeavour to <hi>wipe</hi> off this odium, which of late years, I am ſorry to ſay, has with <hi>too much</hi> reaſon, been caſt upon ſoldiers? If you are careful that your behaviour be virtuous and exemplary, thoſe abandoned, diſſolute troops, that <hi>diſgrace</hi> Britain, inſtead of bringing a ſoldier's life <hi>hare</hi> into contempt, would be <hi>foils</hi> to ſet off <hi>your characters,</hi> and make them ſhine with a more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful luſtre.</p>
            <p>It has been frequently obſerved, to the ſignal honour of our <hi>preſent</hi> American forces, that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, they are remarkably <hi>civil well-behaved,</hi> and <hi>free</hi> from <hi>drunkeneſs, prophaneneſs,</hi> or any <hi>other</hi> ſcandalous practices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How goodly are thy tents. O Jacob, and thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, O Iſrael!</hi> —How beautiful and lovely to ſee ſo large an army of men inſpired with heroic ſentiments, engaged in a glorious cauſe, animated therein by the moſt generous motives, and in a <hi>general</hi> view, <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to the

ſhameful <hi>vices,</hi> to which ſoldiers of the preſent age (our provincials excepted) have been <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly</hi> and almoſt <hi>univerſally</hi> addicted!</p>
            <p>That each day may ſet your reſpective charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a ſtill <hi>fairer</hi> light, is the hearty prayer of every well-wiſher to his country.—I beg and beſeech you induſtriouſly to cultivate and promote union, peace, love, harmony and friendſhip among yourſelves.— <hi>Behold, how good and how pleaſant it is for brethren,</hi> or ſoldiers in one common cauſe, <hi>to dwell together in unity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With reſpect to thoſe of you who are in <hi>office,</hi> may I be allowed, gentlemen, to ſay, I flatter myſelf that you will always endeavour to anſwer the <hi>juſt</hi> expectations of thoſe, who have volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily choſen you for their commanders, treating your men with <hi>affability, kindneſs</hi> and <hi>tenderneſs,</hi> ſetting before them examples of <hi>virtue,</hi> and uſing your utmoſt influence to <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> all vice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality.</p>
            <p>You, who are <hi>ſoldiers,</hi> will I truſt do honour to yourſelves and country, by being <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable,</hi> as well as <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>courageous</hi> always paying a <hi>due defference</hi> to the commands of your <hi>officers.</hi>

            <p>And may all of you, <hi>gentlemen</hi> and <hi>ſoldiers,</hi> in your ſeveral departments, exert yourſelves to <hi>purge</hi> from the <hi>camp every accurſed thing.</hi> Nor is it ſufficient that you be <hi>negatively</hi> good or free from <hi>open, ſcandalous</hi> vices; but, if you would be ſafe and happy here, and at laſt enjoy the bright unfading glories of <hi>Heaven,</hi> you <hi>muſt</hi> be <hi>born again, waſhed, ſanctified and juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and by his ſpirit.</p>
