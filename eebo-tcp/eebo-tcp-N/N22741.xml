            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>TO perform the promiſe which I made to you before I began my journey, I will give you ſuch an account of this, once foreſt, but now cultivated and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant country, as I can collect from my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with its inhabitants, and from the peruſal of their old family papers,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030051_0011_0FE415B106E7E220"/>
which they have kindly permitted me to look into for my entertainment. By theſe means I have acquainted myſelf with the ſtory of their firſt planting, conſequent improvements, and preſent ſtate; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of which will occupy the hours which I ſhall be able to ſpare from buſineſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and ſleep, during my reſidence among them.</p>
               <p>IN reading the character of <hi>John Bull,</hi> which was committed to paper ſome years ago by one who knew him well, you muſt have obſerved, that though "he was in the main an honeſt, plain dealing fellow, yet he was choleric and inconſtant, and very apt to <hi>quarrel with his beſt friends.</hi>" This obſervation you will find fully verified in the courſe of the narrative; and as the opinions and manners of ſuperiors have a very great influence in forming the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of inferiors, you need not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed if you find a family likeneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing among the perſons whoſe hiſtory I
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030051_0012_0FE415B4D4A22678"/>
am about to recite, moſt of whom were formerly reſidents in Mr. Bull's houſe, or apprentices in his ſhop.</p>
               <p>THERE was among the appendages to John's eſtate, a pretty large tract of land, which had been neglected by his anceſtors, and which he never cared much about, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that now and then ſome of his family went thither a hunting, and brought home veniſon and furs. Indeed this was, as far as I can find, the beſt pretence that John had to call the land his; for he had no legal title to it. It was then a very woody country, in ſome parts rocky and hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in other parts level; well watered with brooks and ponds, and the whole of it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on a large lake, in which were plenty of fiſh, ſome of which were often ſerved up at John's table, on faſt days.</p>
               <p>THE ſtories told by one and another of theſe adventurers, had made a deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the mind of <hi>Walter Pipeweed,</hi> one
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030051_0013_0FE415B69B9AF4A0"/>
of John's domeſtics, a fellow of a roving and projecting diſpoſition, and who had learned the art of ſurveying. Walter hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently liſtened to their chat, began to think within himſelf, "If theſe fellows make ſo many pence by their excurſions to this wild ſpot, what might not I gain by ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down upon it? There is plenty of game and fiſh at hand, for a preſent ſupply; plenty of nuts and acorns to fatten pigs, and with ſome ſmall labour I may be able to raiſe corn and feed poultry, which will fetch me a good price at market.—I can carry biſket enough in my pockets to keep me alive till my firſt crop comes in, and my dog can live upon the offals of the game that I ſhall kill.—Beſides, who knows what treaſures the land itſelf may contain—per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome <hi>rich mines!</hi>—then I am made for this world—I ſhall be as rich as <hi>Lord Strut!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FULL of this dream, Walter applied to his maſter one day for a leaſe of part of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030051_0014_0FE415B89063D8B8"/>
                  <hi>the foreſt,</hi> as it was called. Bull at firſt laughed at the propoſal, and put him off; but Walter followed it up ſo cloſe, and told what advantages might be gained by ſettling there, and promiſed, if he ſhould ſucceed, to turn all his trade into his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's hand, and give him the refuſal of whatever he might bring to market, and withal ſhewed him ſome drafts, which he had made with chalk, from the reports of the huntſmen, that Bull began to think of the matter in good earneſt, and conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his lawyer upon the ſubject, who, after due conſideration of the premiſes, and ſtrok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his band, adviſed him as follows. "Why yes, Mr. Bull, I don't ſee why you ought not to look about you as well as your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. You know that old <hi>Lord Peter</hi> lays claim to the whole country, and has aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to parcel it out among his devotees. He has given all the weſtern part of it, where this foreſt lies, to <hi>Lord Strut,</hi> and he has a large manor adjoining to your foreſt, which, they ſay, yields him a fine rent, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030051_0015_0FE415BA370F4E70"/>
who knows but this may bring you in as much, or more?—Then there is <hi>Lewis,</hi> the cudgel player, and <hi>Nicholas Frog,</hi> the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who have, perhaps, (I ſay <hi>perhaps,</hi> Mr. Bull, becauſe there may be a little doubt on both ſides, and in that caſe, you know Sir, it would not become gentlemen of our cloth to ſpeak poſitively) as good a claim as your Honor to this land; but then it is a maxim, you know, that poſſeſſion is elev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en points of the law, and if you once get your foot upon it, they cannot ouſt you without a proceſs, and your Honor knows that your purſe is as long as theirs, and you are as able to ſtand a ſuit with them as they are with you. I therefore adviſe you to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour your man Walter, and give him a leaſe, and a pretty large one—you may find more advantages in it than you are aware of—but leaſe it, leaſe it, at any rate." Upon this he was ordered to make out a leaſe; and Walter being thus inveſted with as good authority as could be obtained, fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his pockets with bread and cheeſe, took
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030051_0016_0FE415BD53EBD698"/>
his gun, powder-flaſk, and ſhot of various kinds, with a parcel of fiſhing-lines and hooks, his ſurveying inſtruments, and a bag of corn on his ſhoulders, and off he trotted to his new paradiſe.</p>
               <p>IT was ſome time before he could fix upon a ſpot to his liking, and he at firſt met with ſome oppoſition from the bears and wolves, and was greatly expoſed to the weather, before he could build him a hut; once or twice the ſavage animals had almoſt devoured him, but being made of good ſtuff, he ſtood his ground, cleared a little ſpot, put his ſeed into the earth, and lived as well as ſuch adventurers can expect, poorly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at firſt, but ſupported, as all new planters are, by the hope of better times. After a while he began to thrive, and his maſter Bull recommended a <hi>wife,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The charter of Virginia.</note> whom he married, and by whom he had a number of children. Having found a new ſort of grain in the foreſt, and a certain plant of a narcotic quality, he cultivated both, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030051_0017_0FE415BF8B6D27D8"/>
having procured a number of <hi>black cattle,</hi> he went on pretty gaily in the planting way, and brought his narcotic weed into great repute, by ſending a preſent of a quantity of it to his old maſter, who grew exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fond of it, and kept calling for more, till he got the whole trade of it into his own hands, and ſold it out of his own ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to Lewis, Frog, and all the other tradeſmen around him. In return, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Walter with cloths and ſtuffs for his family, and utenſils for his huſbandry; and as a reward for being the firſt, who had courage to make a ſettlement in his foreſt, he dignified his plantation with the name of the <hi>ancient dominion.</hi> Beſide this mark of reſpect, and in token of his high eſteem of him as a cuſtomer, as well as for certain other reaſons, he made it a practice, every year, to preſent him with a waggon load of <hi>Ordure,</hi> the ſweepings of his back yard, the ſcrapings of his dog kennel, and contents of his own water cloſet. This was a mark of politeneſs which John valued himſelf
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030051_0018_0FE415C18099E670"/>
much upon. "It may ſeem odd (ſaid he one day to a friend) that I make ſuch a kind of compliment as this to my good cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but if you conſider it aright, you will find it a piece of refined policy; for by this means I get rid of a deal of traſh and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh that is neceſſarily made in ſuch a fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily as mine; I get a curſed ſtink removed from under my noſe, and my good friend has the advantage of it upon his farm, to manure his grounds, and make them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more plentifully that precious weed in which we all ſo much delight." Walter was often ſeen, on the arrival of Bull's waggon, to clap his handkerchief to his noſe; but as he knew his old maſter was an odd ſort of a fellow, and it was his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to keep in with him, he generally turned off the compliment with a laugh, ſaying, good-naturedly enough, "Let him laugh that wins," without explaining his meaning, though it might admit of a <hi>double entendre;</hi> then calling ſome of his ſervants, he ordered them to ſhovel out the dung,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030051_0019_0FE4159075D382B0"/>
and make his black cattle mix theirs with it. When ſpread over the land, the air took out moſt of the ſcent, and the ſalts were of ſome advantage to the ſoil.</p>
               <p>AFTER Walter Pipeweed had got his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs into tolerable order, he was viſited in his retirement by <hi>Cecilius Peterſon,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Baltimore, who firſt ſettled Maryland, was a Papiſt; his ſucceſſors abjured Popery, and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church of England.</note> anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Bull's apprentices, who had taken a fancy to the ſame kind of life, from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt to ſome things that had happened in the family. He had not been long with Walter before he found it would not do for him to remain there. Peterſon was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be a natural ſon of old <hi>Lord Peter,</hi> after whom he was nick-named. He had the ſame affected airs, and a tincture of the high-flying notions of his reputed father. Theſe made him rather diſguſtful to Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had learned his manners of Mr. Bull's mother, when ſhe was in her ſober
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030051_0020_0FE415C60219DB68"/>
ſenſes, and between her and Lord Peter there had been a long variance. When Peterſon perceived that his company was not deſired, he had ſo much good ſenſe as to leave Walter's plantation, and, paddling acroſs a creek, ſeated himſelf on a point of land that ran out into the lake. Of this he obtained a leaſe of his old maſter, and went to work in the ſame manner as Walter had done, who, liking his company beſt at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was willing to ſupply him with bread and meat till he could ſcramble for himſelf. Here he took to huſbandry raiſing corn and the narcotic weed, and buying up <hi>black cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and after a while turned his produce into his old maſter's ware-houſe, and received from him the annual compliment of a wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon load of dung, excepting that when there had not been ſo much as uſual made, he and Walter were to ſhare a load between them.</p>
               <p>TO ingratiate himſelf ſtill farther with his old maſter, he accepted of a girl out of his family for a wife, (for John was always
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030051_0021_0FE415C7EACB5280"/>
fond of his tenants marrying for fear of their doing worſe) he took as little notice as poſſible of his reputed father, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or diſowning his nick-name of Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he aſſumed that of <hi>Marygold,</hi> which old Madam Bull underſtood as a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to one of her daughters. He alſo made his court to the old lady by kneeling down and kiſſing the golden fringe of her embroidered petticoat, as was the faſhion of that day. This ceremony, though a trifle in itſelf, helped much to recommend him to Mr. Bull, who was a very dutiful ſon, and took his mother's advice in moſt parts of his buſineſs. In ſhort, Cecilius was too much of a politician to ſuppoſe that filial affection ought to ſtand in the way of a man's intereſt, and in this he judged as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other men would have done in the ſame circumſtances.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>ABOUT the time in which theſe firſt attempts were making, and the fame of them had raiſed much jealouſy among ſome, and much expectation among others, there happened a ſad quarrel in <hi>John Bull</hi>'s family. His mother, poor woman, had been ſeized with hyſteric fits, which cauſed her at times to be delirious and full of all ſorts of whims. She had taken it into her head that every one of the family muſt hold
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030051_0023_0FE415CB89F725C0"/>
knife and fork and ſpoon exactly alike; that they muſt all waſh their hands and face preciſely in the ſame manner; that they muſt ſit, ſtand, walk, kneel, bow, ſpit, blow their noſes, and perform every other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal function by the exact rule of <hi>uniformity,</hi> which ſhe had drawn up with her own hand, and from which they were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to vary one hair's breadth. If any one of the family complained of a lame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or ſtiff knee, or had the crick in his neck, or happened to cut his finger, or was any other way ſo diſabled as not to perform his duty to a tittle, ſhe was ſo far from making the leaſt allowance, that ſhe would frown, and ſcold, and rave like a bedlamite; and John was ſuch an obedient ſon to his moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he would lend her his hand to box their cars, or his foot to kick their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, for not complying with her humours. This way of proceeding raiſed an uproar in the family; for though moſt of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, either through affection for the old lady, or through fear, or ſome other motive,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030051_0024_0FE415CFAD7659F8"/>
yet others looked ſour, and grumbled; ſome would openly find fault and attempt to remonſtrate, but they were anſwered with a kick or a thump, or a cat-o'nine-tails, or ſhut up in a dark garret till they promiſed a compliance. Such was the logic of the family in thoſe days!</p>
               <p>AMONG the number of the diſaffected, was <hi>Peregrine Pickle,</hi> a pretty clever ſort of a fellow about his buſineſs, but a great lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſour crout, and of an humour that would not bear contradiction. However, as he knew it would be fruitleſs to enter into a downright quarrel, and yet could not live there in peace; he had ſo much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as to quit the houſe, which he did by getting out of the window in the night. Not liking to be out of employment, he went to the houſe of <hi>Nicholas Frog,</hi> his maſter's old friend and rival, told him the ſtory of his ſufferings, and got leave to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himſelf in one of his workſhops till the ſtorm ſhould be over. After he had been here a while, he thought Nick's family were
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030051_0025_0FE415D15A606D18"/>
as much too looſe in their manners as Bull's were too ſtrict; and having heard a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Foreſt, to which Nick had ſome kind of claim, he packed up his little all, and hired one of Nick's ſervants who had been there a hunting, to pilot him to that part of the Foreſt to which Nick laid claim. But Frog had laid an anchor to windward of him; for as Pickle had ſaid nothing to him about a leaſe, he ſuppoſed that when Peregrine had got into the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt he would take a leaſe of his old maſter Bull, which would ſtrengthen his title, and weaken his own; he therefore bribed the pilot to ſhew Peregrine to a barren part of the Foreſt, inſtead of that fertile place<note n="*" place="bottom">Hudſon's River.</note> to which he had already ſent his ſurveyors, and of which he was contriving to get poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. Accordingly the pilot having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted Pickle to a ſandy point which runs into the lake,<note n="†" place="bottom">Cape Cod.</note> it being the duſk of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note n="‡" place="bottom">The month of December.</note> bade him good night, and walked off. Peregrine, who was fatigued with his
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030051_0026_0FE415D307174EC0"/>
march, laid down and went to ſleep, but waking in the morning, ſaw himſelf alone in a very dreary ſituation, where he could get nothing to live upon but clams, and a few acorns which the ſquirrels had left. In this piteous plight, the poor fellow folded his arms, and walking along the ſandy beach, fell into ſuch a ſoliloquy as this. "So much for travelling! Abuſed by Bull, cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Frog, what am I at laſt come to? Here I am alone, no creatures but bears, and wolves, and ſuch vermin around me! Nothing in the ſhape of an human being that I know of, nearer than Pipeweed's plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and with him I cannot agree; he is ſo devoted to old Dame Bull that he and I cannot live together any more than I could with the old woman. But, why ſhould I deſpair? That is unmanly; there is at leaſt a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of my living here, and if I am diſappointed in my worldly proſpects, it is but right, for I profeſſed not to have any. My wiſh was to have my own way without diſturbance or contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſurely I can here enjoy my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030051_0027_0FE415D4FB48A2C0"/>
I have nobody here to curſe me, or kick me, or cheat me. If I have only clams to eat, I can cook them my own way, and ſay as long a grace over them as I pleaſe. I can ſit or ſtand, or kneel, or uſe any other poſture at my devotions, without any croſs old woman to growl at me, or any hector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bully to cuff me for it. So that if I have loſt in one way I have gained in anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I had better therefore reconcile myſelf to my ſituation, and make the beſt of a bad market. But company is good! A propos! I will write to ſome of my fellow-appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices; I know they were as diſcontented as myſelf in old Bull's family, though they did not care to ſpeak their minds as plainly as I did. I'll tell them how much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I enjoy here in my ſolitude. I'll point out to them the charms of liberty, and coax them to follow me into the wilderneſs; and by and by, when we get all together, we ſhall make a brave hand of it." Full of this reſolution, he ſat down on a wind-fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en tree, and pulling out his inkhorn and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; wrote a letter to <hi>John Codline, Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030051_0028_0FE415D8AE1C17A8"/>
Ploughſhare,</hi> and <hi>Roger Carrier,</hi> three of his fellow-apprentices, informing them of the extreme happineſs he enjoyed in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberty to eat his ſcanty meals in his own way, and to lay his ſwelled ancles and ſtiff knee in whatever poſture was moſt eaſy to him; conjuring them by their former friendſhip, to come to join him in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the good work ſo happily begun, &amp;c. &amp;c. As ſoon as he had finiſhed the letter, (which had deeply engaged his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) a huntſman happened to come along in queſt of game. This was a lucky cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance indeed, for Peregrine had not once thought of a conveyance for his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it proved alſo favourable to him in another view, for the huntſman taking pity on his forlorn ſituation, ſpared him ſome powder and ſhot, and a few biſcuit which he happened to have in his pocket; ſo tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charge of the letter, he delivered it as it was directed.</p>
               <p>THIS letter arrived in good ſeaſon, for old Madam had grown much worſe ſince
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030051_0029_0FE415DAA5F8B400"/>
Pickle had left the family; her vapours had increaſed, and her longings and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were much ſtronger. She had a ſtrange lurch for embroidered petticoats and high waving plumes; her Chriſtmas pies muſt have double the quantity of ſpice that was uſual; the ſervants muſt make three bows where they formerly made but one, and they muſt never come into her preſence without having curled and powdered their hair in the pink of the mode, for ſhe had an averſion to every thing plain, and a ſtrong reliſh for every thing gaudy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſhe had an high-mettled chaplain<note n="*" place="bottom">Archbiſhop Laud.</note> who was conſtantly at her elbow, and ſaid prayers night and morning in a brocaded cope with a gilded mitre on his head; and he exacted ſo many bows and ſcrapes of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one in the family, that it would have puzzled a French dancing-maſter to have kept pace with him. Nor would he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſervice at all, unleſs a verger ſtood by him all the while with a yard-wand in his hand; and if any ſervant or apprentice
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030051_0030_0FE415DC9A504460"/>
miſſed one bow or ſcrape, or made it at the wrong time, or dared to look off his book, or ſaid Amen in the wrong place, rap went the ſtick over his head and ears or knuckles. It was in vain to appeal from the chaplain or the old Dame to their maſter, for he was ſo obedient a ſon that he ſuffered them to govern him as they pleaſed; nay, though broad hints were given that the chaplain was an emiſſary of lord Peter, and was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantage of the old lady's hyſterics to bring the whole family into his intereſt, John gave no heed to any of theſe inſinuations.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as the letter of Peregrine Pickle arrived, the apprentices, to whom it was directed, held a conſultation what they ſhould do. They were heartily tired of the conduct of the chaplain; they lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the old lady's ill health, and wiſhed for a cure; but there was at preſent no hope of it, and they concluded that it was beſt to follow Pickle's advice, and retire with him into the Foreſt. Though they were infected with the ſpirit of adventure, yet
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030051_0031_0FE415DE46CCA960"/>
they were a ſet of wary fellows, and knew they could not with ſafety venture thither unleſs they had a leaſe of the land. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, however, for them, Bull had a little while before that put the affairs of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt into the hands of a gentleman of the law,<note place="bottom">The Council of Plymouth in Devonſhire.</note> with orders to ſee that the matter was properly managed, ſo as to yield him ſome certain profit. To this ſage they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and for the proper fees, which they clubbed for between them, they obtained a leaſe, under hand and ſeal; wherein, for "ſundry cauſes him thereunto moving, the ſaid Bull did grant and convey unto John Codline and his aſſociates, ſo many acres of his Foreſt, bounded ſo and ſo, and which they were to have, hold, and enjoy for ever and ever, yielding and paying ſo and ſo, and ſo forth." When this grand point was gained by the aſſiſtance of the lawyer and <hi>his clerks,</hi> who knew how to manage buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the adventurers ſold all their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities to the pawn-brokers, and got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether what things they ſuppoſed they
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030051_0032_0FE415E2B02CF260"/>
ſhould want, and leaving behind them a note on the compter,<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter written on board the Arabella, after the embarkation of the Maſſachuſetts ſettlers.</note> to tell their maſter where they were bound, and what were their deſigns; they ſet off all together and got ſafe into a part of the Foreſt adjoining to Pickle, who, hearing of their arrival, took his oaken ſtaff in his hand, and hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled along as faſt as his lame legs could carry him to ſee them, and a joyful meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed they had. Having laid their heads together, it was agreed that Codline ſhould ſend for a girl whom he had court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note n="†" place="bottom">The Maſſachuſetts charter.</note> and marry her, and that he ſhould be conſidered as the lord of the manor, that Pickle ſhould have a leaſe of that part which he had pitched upon, and that Ploughſhare and Carrier ſhould for the preſent be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as members of Codline's family. John had taken a great fancy to fiſhing, and thought he could wholly or chiefly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by it; but Humphry had a mind for a farm; ſo after a while they parted in
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030051_0033_0FE4166362139648"/>
friendſhip. Humphry, with a pack on his back and a ſpade in his hand, travelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the Foreſt till he found a wide mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow with a large brook<note n="*" place="bottom">Connecticut River.</note> running through it, which he ſuppoſed to be within John's grant, and intended ſtill to conſider himſelf as a diſtant member of the family. But as it fell out otherwiſe, he was obliged to get a new leaſe, to which Mr. Frog made ſome objections, but they were over-ruled; and ſoon after another old fellow ſervant, THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OPHILUS WHEAT-EAR, came and ſat down by him. They being ſo much alike in their views and diſpoſitions, agreed to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as intimates, though in two families, which they did till Wheat-ear's death, when Ploughſhare became his ſole heir, and the eſtate has ever ſince been his. This Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry was always a very induſtrious, frugal, ſaving huſband; and his wife, though a formal ſtrait-laced ſort of a body, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways minded her ſpinning and knitting, and took excellent care of her dairy. She al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cloathed her children in homeſpun gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030051_0034_0FE415E4613C4148"/>
and ſcarcely ever ſpent a farthing for outlandiſh trinkets. The family and all its concerns were under very exact reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulations: not one of them was ſuffered to peep out of doors after the ſun was ſet. It was never allowed to brew on Saturday, leſt the beer ſhould break the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment by working on Sunday: and once, it is ſaid, the ſtallion was impounded a whole week for holding <hi>crim. con.</hi> with the mare while the Old gentleman was at his devotions. Bating theſe peculiarities, (and every body has ſome) Humphry was a very good ſort of a man, a kind neighbour, very thriving, and made a reſpectable fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. Though he lived a retired life, and did not much follow the faſhions, yet he raiſed a good eſtate, and brought up a large family. His children and grand-children have penetrated the interior parts of the country, and ſeated themſelves on the beſt ſoil, which they know how to diſtinguiſh at firſt ſight, and to cultivate to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage. Whereever you find them, you find good huſbandmen.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AFTER Ploughſhare's departure, John Codline with his family kept on their fiſhing and planting, and ſometimes went a hunting, ſo that they made out to get a tolerable ſubſiſtence. John's family grew, and he ſettled his ſons as faſt as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of age, to live by themſelves; and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030051_0036_0FE415E806999728"/>
when any of his old acquaintance came to ſee him, he bade them welcome, and was their very good friend, <hi>as long as they contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be of his mind,</hi> and no longer; for he was a very pragmatical ſort of a fellow, and loved to have his own way in every thing. This was the cauſe of a quarrel between him and <hi>Roger Carrier,</hi> for it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that Roger had taken a fancy to dip his head into water,<note n="*" place="bottom">Anabaptiſts.</note> as the moſt effectual way of waſhing his face, and thought it could not be made ſo clean in any other way. John, who uſed the common way of taking water in his hand, to waſh his face, was diſpleaſed with Roger's innovation, and remonſtrated againſt it. The remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance had no other effect, than to fix Roger's opinion more firmly; and as a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improvement on his new plan, he pretended that no perſon ought to have his face waſhed till he was capable of doing it himſelf, without any aſſiſtance from his parents. John was out of patience with this addition, and plumply told him, that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030051_0037_0FE415EC45881788"/>
if he did not reform his principles and practice, he would fine him, or flog him, or kick him out of doors. Theſe threats put Roger on inventing other odd and whimſical opinions. He took offence at the letter X, and would have had it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged from the alphabet, becauſe it was the ſhape of a croſs, and had a tendency to introduce Popery.<note n="*" place="bottom">Roger Williams's zeal againſt the ſign of the croſs.</note> He would not do his duty at a military muſter, becauſe there was an X in the colours. After a while he began to ſcruple the lawfulneſs of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arms, and killing wild beaſts. But, poor fellow! the worſt of all was, that being ſeized with a ſhaking palſy,<note n="†" place="bottom">Quakers.</note> which affected every limb and joint of him, his ſpeech was ſo altered that he was unable to pronounce certain letters and ſyllables as he had been uſed to do. Theſe oddities and defects rendered him more and more diſagreeable to his old friend, who, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, kept his temper as well as he could, till one day, as John was ſaying a long
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030051_0038_0FE415EDEEA46630"/>
grace over his meat, Roger kept his hat on the whole time. As ſoon as the ceremony was over, John took up a caſe-knife from the table, and gave Roger a blow on the ear with the broad ſide of it, then with a riſing ſtroke turned off his hat. Roger ſaid nothing, but taking up his hat put it on again; at which John broke out into ſuch a paſſionate ſpeech as this—"You impudent ſcoundrel! is it come to this? Have I not borne with your whims and fidgets theſe many years, and yet they grow upon you? Have I not talked with you time after time, and proved to you as plain as the noſe in your face that your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are wrong? Have I not ordered you to leave them off, and warned you of the conſequence, and yet you have gone on from bad to worſe? You began with dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping your head into water, and would have all the family do the ſame, pretending there was no other way of waſhing the face. You would have had the children go dirty all their days, under pretence that they were not able to waſh their own faces,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030051_0039_0FE415EFE28D8520"/>
and ſo they muſt have been as filthy as the pigs till they were grown up Then you would talk your own balderdaſh lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, <hi>thee and thou, and nan forſooth</hi>—and now you muſt keep your hat on when I am at my devotions, and I ſuppoſe would be glad to have the whole family do the ſame! There is no bearing with you any longer—ſo now, hear me, I give you fair warning, if you don't mend your manners, and retract your errors, and promiſe refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I'll kick you out of the houſe. I'll have no ſuch refractory fellows here: I came into this foreſt for <hi>reformation,</hi> and reformation I <hi>will</hi> have."</p>
               <p>"FRIEND John (ſaid Roger) doſt not thou remember when thou and I lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in friend Bull's family, how hard thou didſt think it to be compelled to look on thy book all the time that the hooded chaplain was reading the prayers, and how many knocks and thumps thou and I had for offering to uſe our liberty, which we thought we had a right to? Didſt thou
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030051_0040_0FE415F18ECE2558"/>
not come hitherunto for the ſake of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy liberty, and did not I come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy mine? Wherefore then doſt thou aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to deprive me of the right which thou claimeſt for thyſelf?"</p>
               <p>"DON'T tell me (anſwered John) of right and of liberty—you have as much liberty as any man ought to have. You have liberty to do right, and no man ought to have liberty to do wrong."</p>
               <p>"WHO is to be judge (replied Roger) of what is right or what is wrong? Ought not I to judge for myſelf? or, Thinkeſt thou it is thy place to judge for me?"</p>
               <p>"WHO is to be judge? (ſaid John) why <hi>the book</hi> is to be judge; and I have proved by the book over and over again that you are wrong, and therefore you are wrong, and you have no liberty to do any thing but what is right."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:030051_0041_0FE415F56BD79260"/>"BUT friend John, (ſaid Roger) who is to judge whether thou haſt proved my opinions or conduct to be wrong—thou or I?"</p>
               <p>"COME, come, (ſaid John) not ſo cloſe neither; none of your idle diſtinctions: I <hi>ſay</hi> you are in the wrong, I have <hi>proved</hi> it, and <hi>you know</hi> it; you have ſinned againſt <hi>your own conſcience,</hi> and therefore you deſerve to be cut off as an incorrigible heretic."</p>
               <p>"HOW doſt thou know (ſaid Roger) that I have ſinned againſt my own conſcience? Canſt thou ſearch the heart?"</p>
               <p>AT this John was ſo enraged that he gave him a ſmart kick on the poſteriors, and bade him be gone out of his houſe, and off his lands, and called after him to tell him, that if ever he ſhould catch him there again he would knock his brains out. Roger, having experienced the logic of the foot, applied to the ſeat of honour, walked off, with as much <hi>meekneſs</hi> as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030051_0042_0FE415F71F5702A0"/>
nature is capable of, on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and having travelled as far as he ſuppoſed to be out of the limits of John's leaſe, laid himſelf down by the ſide of a clear rivulet, which ſlowed down a hill; here he compoſed himſelf to ſleep, and on his awaking found ſeveral bears about him, but none offered him any inſult. Upon which he ſaid, and minuted it down in his pocket-book, "Surely the beaſts of the wilderneſs are in friendſhip with me, and this is deſigned by <hi>Providence</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The town of Providence was built by emigrants from Maſſachuſetts, of whom Roger Williams was head.</note> as my reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place; here, therefore, will I pitch my tabernacle, and here ſhall I dwell more in peace, though ſurrounded by bears and wolves, than when in the midſt of thoſe whom I counted my brethren."</p>
               <p>On this ſpot he built an hut, and having taken poſſeſſion, made a viſit to his old maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bull, who gave him a leaſe of the place, with an iſland or two in an adjoining cove
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030051_0043_0FE415F8CC1BE638"/>
of the great lake, and recommended to him a wife, by whom he had a few chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but his plantation was chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the flocking of ſtrangers to him; for he was a very hoſpitable man, and made it a rule in his family not to refuſe any who ſhould come, whether lame or blind, ſhort or tall, whether they had two eyes or one, whether they ſquinted, or ſtammered, or limped, or had any other natural defect or impediment; it was another rule that all ſhould bear with the infirmities of their neighbours, and help them as they were able. Once, as I was paſſing through Roger's plantation, I ſaw one man carrying another on his ſhoulders, which, at firſt, I thought a very odd ſight; upon coming up to them, I perceived that the lower one was blind, and the upper one was lame, ſo as they had but one pair of eyes and one pair of legs between them, the lame man availed himſelf of the blind man's legs, and he of the other's eyes, and both went along very well together. I remember alſo, that as I paſſed along, the fences were in
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030051_0044_0FE415FAC6936920"/>
ſome places made of very crooked, knotty rails; but the crooks and knots were made to ſay into each other ſo cleverly, that the fences were as tight as if they had been made of ſtuff ſawed ever ſo even; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which convinced me that very crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things might be put together, to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if proper pains were taken.</p>
               <p>WHEN John Codline had ſettled the controverſy with Roger, by kicking him out of doors, he began to look about him to ſee what his neighbours were doing. Having found a young fellow on his north-eaſtern limits, who had come thither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledge or permiſſion, he took it into his head to ſurvey the extent of his grounds. The words of his leaſe were rather ambiguous, and by virtue thereof, he thought it convenient to extend his claims over the lands on which <hi>Robert Lumber</hi> (for that was the name of the young fellow) had ſettled. It ſeems that Bob had been ſent by ſome of John Bull's family to erect a fiſhing ſtage on the borders of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030051_0045_0FE415FF9BDE1050"/>
the lake, and the lawyer who had the care of the foreſt not being acquainted ſo much as he ought to have been with the ſituation of the lands, or having no knowledge of the art of ſurveying, had made out a leaſe which lapped over Codline's; ſo that each of them had a claim upon the ſame land. In ſome circumſtances this might have been deemed unfortunate, but as it happened it proved lucky for poor Bob. His employers had left him in the lurch, and he would have ſtarved to death if John had not taken him under his wing and ſent him proviſions to keep him alive. He alſo lent him a hand to clear up the buſhes, and furniſhed him with materials to build a ſaw-mill. This ſet Bob on his own legs, and he proved a ſturdy faithful fellow. He was of great ſervice to John in killing bears and wolves that infeſted his plantation; and when he himſelf was in danger, John lent him pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhot, and flints, and ſent hands to help him; and in ſo doing he ſerved himſelf as well as his neighbour, which was no breach of morality. Thus they lived pretty peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030051_0046_0FE41601464F95D8"/>
together, till after a while Bob's old owners found the land was grown good for ſomething, and then (without paying John for his aſſiſtance in making it ſo) appealed to Mr. Bull, <hi>and got it away,</hi> and took a large ſlice of John's land into the bargain.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſettling the line between Maſſachuſetts and New Hampſhire.</note> This was a matter which ſtuck in John's throat a great while, and if I am rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed he has hardly ſwallowed it yet. He did not think himſelf fairly dealt by, though he had all Peregrine Pickle's land put into a new leaſe which Bull gave him. To be ſhort, John Codline and John Bull never heartily loved one another; they were in their temper and diſpoſition too much alike; each was eternally jealous of the other; and this jealouſy was kept alive by a variety of incidents which it would be too tedious to enumerate. One of them, however, was of ſo ſingular a nature that I think it deſerves to be remembered. It was this. Lewis had erected a fiſhing
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030051_0047_0FE41602F0422FE0"/>
ſtage and ware-houſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Louiſburg.</note> on the northeaſt, which interfered with Codline's favourite employment. Without conſulting his old Maſter Bull, or waiting for his advice or orders, Jack ſent a bailiff with a writ of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion to the fiſhermen, and began a ſuit in law. Mr. Bull hearing of it, was glad to take advantage of the circumſtance and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee council in the cauſe, which finally went in his favour. But though the iſſue of the cauſe was of ſo much advantage to him; yet he ever after looked upon Codline as a forward, meddling fellow, for running on that errand before he was ſent; and there were not wanting perſons who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually buzzing in his ear, to keep a good look out on that impudent jackanapes, or he would ſoon begin to think himſelf as good a man as his maſter.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN my laſt letter I had got a little too forward in my ſtory, in point of time; but as I write by piecemeal, and often in a hurry, you muſt excuſe chronological in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracy. I now go back to tell you, that between the lands occupied by Marygold, and thoſe on which Ploughſhare had made
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030051_0049_0FE4160974319E38"/>
his ſettlement, was a large tract of waſte, where none of Mr. Bull's family had ever been; but the report of the plantations which one and another of them had made, drew the attention of Bull's neighbours. Among theſe, <hi>Nicholas Frog</hi> was not an idle ſpectator. He was as ſly a fellow as you will meet with in a ſummer's day, always attentive to his intereſt, and never let ſlip an opportunity to promote it. Obſerving that Mr. Bull was rather careleſs of the Foreſt, and truſted his lawyers and ſervants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the management of it, and knowing there was a large ſlice of it unoccupied, he clandeſtinely ſent out ſome ſurveyors in the diſguiſe of hunters, to make a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country, and report to him at their return. Another good neighbour, <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the ironmonger, was gaping after it, and gave out word among his journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that if any of them would adventure thither and ſet up their trade, he would uphold them in their pretenſions, and lend them any aſſiſtance in his power. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly one of them, by the name of <hi>Caſimir,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:030051_0050_0FE4165FACEED690"/>
ventured to make a beginning on the ſhore of a navigable creek;<note n="*" place="bottom">The Delaware.</note> but did not care to penetrate far into the country, on account of the wolves and bears, which were very numerous thereabout. As ſoon as Frog heard of this, he picked a quarrel with Guſtavus, and inſiſted that the land was his, by poſſeſſion, becauſe he had already ſent ſurveyors thither. It happened, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the place which Frog's people had pitched upon was at the mouth of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other creek,<note n="†" place="bottom">Hudſon's river.</note> at a conſiderable diſtance; where they had built a hut, on a point of land, and farther up the creek had erected a kind of lodge or hunting houſe,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Albany.</note> for the convenience of collecting game. On this plantation Frog had placed <hi>Peter Stiver,</hi> a one-legged fellow, as his overſeer. As ſoon as Peter heard of the quarrel between his maſter and Guſtavus, he thought the quickeſt way of ending it was the beſt; and therefore, without waiting for orders or ceremony, he went and commanded Caſimir off the ground; and with one of
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030051_0051_0FE4160B62F2C318"/>
his crutches beat his houſe to pieces about his ears. The poor fellow ſtared at this rough treatment; but was glad to eſcape with whole bones, and humbly requeſted leave to remain there with his tools, prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſing to follow his buſineſs quietly, and become an obedient ſervant to Mr. Frog. Upon theſe conditions he was permitted to remain, and the whole tract was reputed Frog's property.</p>
               <p>WHILE theſe things were doing, John Bull was confined to his houſe with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fever and delirium, which ended in the hypochondria,<note n="*" place="bottom">The civil wars in England.</note> and his imagination was the ſeat of every wild freak and ſtrange vagary. One while he fancied himſelf an abſolute monarch; then, a preſbyterian clergyman; then a general of horſe; then a lord protector: His noddle was filled with a jumble of polemic divinity, political diſputes, and military arrangements, and it was not till after much blood-letting, bliſtering, vomiting, purging, cold-bathing,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030051_0052_0FE4160D10625218"/>
and horſe-trotting, that he began to mend. Under this ſevere but wholeſome regimen, he at length grew cool and came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but found on his recovery that his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs had gone behind hand during his ſickneſs. Beſide the loſs of buſineſs, he had phyſicians' and apothecaries' bills to pay, and thoſe who had attended upon him as nurſes, watchers, porters, &amp;c. all expected wages or douceurs, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually haunting him with, "How does your honor do? I am glad to ſee your honor ſo well as to be abroad." They were continually putting themſelves in his way; and if they did not directly <hi>dun</hi> him for payment, their looks were ſo ſignificant that a man of leſs penetration could eaſily have gueſſed what was their meaning.</p>
               <p>BULL was ſomewhat perplexed how to anſwer all their demands and expectations. He was too far behind hand to be able to ſatisfy them, and withal too generous to let them remain unpaid. At length he hit on this expedient: "Theſe fellows, ſaid
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030051_0053_0FE4160F0B746F20"/>
he to himſelf, have ſerved me well, and may be of uſe to me again. There is yet a conſiderable part of my foreſt unoccupied. I'll offer to leaſe them tracts of land which <hi>coſt me nothing,</hi> and if they will accept them at a low rent, they may prove uſeful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and I ſhall be a gainer as well as they." Having come to this reſolution, he began to inquire into the affairs of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and found that his neighbours had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon his claim. Lewis had taken poſſeſſion at one end;<note n="*" place="bottom">Canada, poſſeſſed by the French.</note> Lord Strut at the other;<note n="†" place="bottom">Florida, poſſeſſed by the Spaniards.</note> Nicholas Frog in the middle,<note n="‡" place="bottom">New Amſterdam and the New Netherlands, by the Dutch.</note> and his own tenants had heen quarrelling with their new neighbours, as well as among themſelves. "Hey-day! ſays John, this will never do; I muſt keep a good look out upon theſe dogs, or they will get the advantage of me." Away he goes to Frog, and begun to complain of the ill treatment which he had received. Frog, who had
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030051_0054_0FE41612E2F3B160"/>
no mind either to quarrel, or to cry <hi>peccavi,</hi> like a ſly, evaſive whore-ſon as he was, ſhrugged up his ſhoulders, diſowned what his ſervants had done, and ſaid, "he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they only meant to kill game, and did not intend to hold poſſeſſion." Bull was not to be put off ſo; his blood was up, and he determined to treat Frog's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as they had treated Caſimir. So, calling a truſty old ſtud out of his compting houſe, "Here Bob,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Robert Carr's expedition againſt New Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, now New York.</note> ſaid he, take one of my hunters with a pair of blood-hounds, and go to that part of the foreſt where Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Stiver has encroached, give him fair warning; tell him the land is mine, and I will have it; if he gives up at once, treat him well, and tell him I'll give him leave to remain there; but if he offers to make any reſiſtance, or heſitates about an anſwer, ſet your dogs at him and drive him off; kill his cattle, and ſet his houſe on fire: Never fear, I'll bear you out in it." Away goes Bob, and delivered his meſſage.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030051_0055_0FE41614D98BBFC8"/>
Peter at firſt thought it a matter of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and began to divert himſelf with it; but as ſoon as the dogs opened upon him, he found his miſtake, and rather than run the riſk of being driven off, he quietly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the conditions propoſed. "Hang it, ſaid he to himſelf, what care I who is my landlord? Gain is my object; I have already been at great expenſe, and have a proſpect of getting an eſtate. To remove will ruin me; I'll therefore ſtay here, and make money under Bull, or Frog, or any other maſter that will let me ſtay."</p>
               <p>IN a ſubſequent quarrel which happened between Bull and Frog, the latter ſeized upon this plantation again, and Peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized his old maſter; but upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe it was given up to Bull in exchange for a tract of ſwamp<note n="*" place="bottom">Surrinam.</note> which lay far to the ſouthward. Peter continued on the ground through all theſe changes, and followed his buſineſs with great diligence, collecting game and pelts, and vending them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030051_0056_0FE4161687CB4510"/>
to Mr. Bull, and ſometimes to Mr. Frog. However, Bull thought it beſt, that in token of ſubjection, he ſhould change his name; to which he conſented, and partly to pleaſe his new maſter, and partly to retain the remembrance of his old one, he dropped the name of <hi>Stiver,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the name of <hi>Bullfrog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE whole tract which was thus gotten from Frog, was thought too large for one plantation, and therefore Mr. Bull, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the plan which he had formed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated the rents of the plantation, on which Bullfrog was ſeated, to his brother,<note n="*" place="bottom">Duke of York.</note> and the other was leaſed to two of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, CART-RUT and BARE-CLAY, and ſome time after another tract was ſet off to WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM BROADBRIM, whoſe father had been an aſſiduous rat-catcher in Bull's family; but more of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>CART-RUT and <hi>Bare-clay</hi> agreed to divide their land into two farms, which they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030051_0057_0FE4161877F6A130"/>
the eaſt and weſt farms; but when they came to run the diviſion line, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes differed ſo much that they could not fix the boundary. This was one cauſe of diſſention. Another was the different hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and diſpoſitions of their families. Thoſe on the eaſt farm were brought up under Mr. Bull's ſiſter PEG, and as it is well known that ſhe and her brother had long been at variance, ſo their domeſtics had got tinctured with the notions and prej<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udices of their reſpective families. The family on the weſt farm was made up of perſons who were ſubject to the epidemic ague or ſhaking palſy;<note n="*" place="bottom">The Quakers.</note> with ſome ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers from Bullfrog's and Caſimir's families. From this diverſity of conſtitutions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours aroſe bickerings and quarrels, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclination to work and ſubmit to family government. Theſe diſorders continued a long while, and buſineſs went on very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till at length the heads of both families agreed to give up their ſeparate leaſes, and take a new one of the whole, and let Mr.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030051_0058_0FE4161C21CE30A8"/>
Bull appoint an overſeer. By theſe means peace was reſtored, and the new overſeer, who was ſuppoſed to be a deſcendant of a natural ſon of JULIUS CAESAR, gave the name of his anceſtor to the farm, which has ever ſince been called CAESAREA.</p>
               <p>THERE was another portion of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, which lay ſouthward of Walter Pipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed's plantation, and which no perſon had yet taken up, though ſome had made attempts and had been driven off by the numberleſs muſquetoes and ſand-flies, which abound in thoſe places. Mr. Bull was ſtill deſirous to reward his friends in the <hi>cheapeſt manner,</hi> and at the ſame time to keep his neighbours from encroaching upon him, and ſecure the poſſeſſion of the foreſt to himſelf. In purſuance of his plan, and to make ſhort work of it at once, he leaſed the whole of this ſouthern extremity to CHARLES INDIGO, who was expreſsly order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take under his care and into his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all perſons who had attended Mr. Bull, in his late ſickneſs, in quality of nurſes,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030051_0059_0FE4161E30378568"/>
druggiſts, apothecaries, laundreſſes, uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, porters, watchers, &amp;c. &amp;c. By this order Charles found himſelf at once ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a large body of retainers of various ranks and qualities, and, being a ſpeculator himſelf, he employed a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive man, Mr. <hi>Padlock,</hi> who had written a large treatiſe upon <hi>Ideas,</hi> to draw up ſome rules, for the management of ſuch a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, intending when he ſhould build an houſe, to paſte it up in the parlour, as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory to his wife. Accordingly Mr. Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock went to work, and with an exquiſite mixture of political and metaphyſical knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, diſtinguiſhed between the hall, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the dreſſing-room, the gallery, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic-room, the bed-chambers, the chapel, the kitchen, the water-cloſet, &amp;c. ſhewing what was to be done in each, and the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſubordination of one to the other, all which would have been of excellent ſervice in a palace, and among people who had got to a high degree of refinement, but was ill ſuited to the circumſtances of new adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030051_0060_0FE4161FDC2EA920"/>
in a foreſt. They rather needed to be inſtructed in the method of felling trees, draining ſwamps, digging clams, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt muſquetoes, killing wolves and bears, and erecting huts to keep off the weather. To theſe neceſſary affairs they were obliged to attend, and Mr. Padlock's fine ſpun rules were laid by and little thought of.</p>
               <p>CHARLES had pitched upon a ſandy point, between two brooks, for his manſion houſe, and had made a ſmall beginning, when his repoſe was diſturbed by one AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUSTINE, a lubberly fellow, who had taken a leaſe of Lord Strut, and lived farther ſouthward. This Strut was the largeſt landholder in the country, and was never ſatisfied with adding field to field. He had already got much mere than he could man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and had greatly impoveriſhed his homeſtead by attending to his extra territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. His tenants were infected with the ſame land fever, and wiſhed to have no neighbours within ſight or call. With this
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030051_0061_0FE41621D39C2058"/>
envious diſpoſition, Auguſtine collected a rabble of louſy fellows, and was coming to diſpoſſeſs Charles, thinking him too weak to make a defence; but Charles was a lad of too much <hi>ſpunk</hi> to be brow-beaten. He armed all his people with ſome weapon or other, and advanced till he came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of the place where Auguſtine was, who, on ſeeing him, took wit in his anger, and went back, without attempting any miſchief.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER difficulty which Charles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to encounter was from the wild beaſts; but luckily for him, theſe creatures got into a quarrel among themſelves, and fought with each other till they had thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their numbers conſiderably, ſo that Charles and his companions could venture into the woods, where they caught ſome few and tamed them, as was the uſual prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice among all Mr. Bull's tenants at that day. Of this practice a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhall be given in my next letter.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU muſt have remarked in your acquaintance with the life and character of Mr. John Bull, that he is very whimſical, and as poſitive as whimſical. Among oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantages which he expected from the ſettlement of his Foreſt, one was, that the wild animals, whom nature had made fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and untractable in the higheſt degree, would be rendered tame and ſerviceable, by receiving inſtruction and education from the nurturing hand of humanity. He had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a notion that every creature has certain
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030051_0063_0FE41628806593E8"/>
latent principles and qualities which form a foundation for improvement; and he thought it a great piece of injuſtice that theſe qualities ſhould be ſuffered to remain uncultivated: he had a mind that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be attempted to diſcover how far this kind of cultivation was practicable, and what uſe could be made of the animal powers under the direction and control of rational government. Full of this idea, he came to a reſolution, that it ſhould be the duty of every one of his tenants to catch wild beaſts of various ſorts, and diſcipline them ſo as to find out their ſeveral proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and capacities, and uſe them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and this kind of ſervice was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in their reſpective leaſes as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the grants.</p>
               <p>SOME of the tenants, particularly Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine Pickle, John Codline, and Humphry Ploughſhare, entered zealouſly into the meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure from principle. They had, during Mr. Bull's ſickneſs and delirium, before ſpoken of, formed an aſſociation for their mutual
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030051_0064_0FE4162A2A8A59B0"/>
ſafety.<note n="*" place="bottom">The united colonies of New England, 1643.</note> The object of their union was two fold: firſt, to endeavour by all fair means to tame and diſcipline the wild beaſts; and ſecondly, in caſe of their prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refractory, to defend themſelves againſt their attacks. The other tenants did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſame way; ſome from one principle, and ſome from another. Peter Bullfrog, who was as cunning as any of them, made uſe of thoſe which he had tamed, as his caterers, to provide game for his table, of which the feathers and furs ſerved him as articles of traffic, and brought him in a profitable return.</p>
               <p>THE principal conſideration (ſetting aſide intereſt) which induced the more zealous of the Foreſters to enter into this buſineſs, was an idea that theſe animals were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated part of the human ſpecies, and might be reſtored to their proper rank and order, if due pains were taken. The grounds of this opinion were theſe: Among the traditions of the ancient Druids there was

a ſtory, that out of <hi>twelve</hi> families which inhabited a certain diſtrict by themſelves, <hi>ten</hi> had been loſt, and no account could be given of them; and, where, ſaid they, is it more likely to find them than in this foreſt, in the ſhape of ſome other creatures? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if the doctrine of TRANSMIGRATION, which the Druids held, be true. Another tradition was, that one of Mr. Bull's great-great-uncles, by the name of <hi>Madok,</hi> had many years ago diſappeared, and the laſt account which had been received of him was, that he had been ſeen going towards this foreſt; hence it was concluded that his deſcendants muſt be found here. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this argument, it was alleged, that the ſounds which ſome of theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made in their howlings, reſembled the language ſpoken in that day: nay, ſome were poſitive that they had heard them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the word <hi>Madokawando</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom">The name of a Sachem, at Penobſcot.</note> and one hunter roundly ſwore that he had ſeen in the den of a bear, an old <hi>book</hi> which he ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Bible</hi> written in the Celtic
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030051_0066_0FE41631B9819A78"/>
language, and this book they concluded muſt have been left there by <hi>Madok,</hi> who could read and ſpeak no other language. Another very material circumſtance was the diſcovery of a rock by the ſide of a brook,<note n="*" place="bottom">The celebrated rock at Dighton, in Maſſachuſetts.</note> inſcribed with ſome characters which bore no reſemblance to any kind of writing, ancient or modern; the concluſion from hence was, that it muſt be of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt antiquity: this rock was deemed an unaccountable curioſity, till a certain virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſo took it into his noddle, firſt to imagine, and then to become extremely poſitive that the characters were <hi>Punic</hi>; and finally this inſcription was tranſlated, and affirmed to be nothing leſs than a treaty of alliance and commerce between the <hi>Phenicians</hi> and the firſt inhabitants of this foreſt. From all theſe premiſes it was inferred, with ſome plauſibility, and more poſitiveneſs, that one ſpecies at leaſt of the ſavage animals was deſcended from <hi>Madok,</hi> and that the others were the poſterity of the long loſt <hi>ten</hi> fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies, who were well known to have had a
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030051_0067_0FE4163364BE0D38"/>
commercial connexion with the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> and that theſe probably found out their haunt, and followed them for the ſake of their former friendſhip.—What happy light do modern diſcoveries and conjectures throw on the dark pages of antiquity.</p>
               <p>FROM theſe principles, as well as from motives of humanity and of intereſt, ſome of the Foreſters entered with zeal on the conſideration and practice of the beſt meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods to fulfil this condition of their grants, the diſciplining of the ſavage animals, and they certainly deſerve praiſe for their honeſt endeavours; but, others who pretended to the ſame zeal, it is to be lamented, made uſe of this pretence to cover their vanity or their avarice. Had none but gentle means been uſed, it is probable more good might, on the whole, have been produced; but as it often happens that many a good project has been ruined for want of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the execution, ſo it fared with this; for while the new comers were buſy in putting up their huts, and preparing the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030051_0068_0FE416355A85EEA8"/>
land for cultivation, both of which were neceſſary before they could attend to any other buſineſs, ſome of the ſavage tribe would be a little impertinent, either by peeping into the huts, or breaking up a neſt where the poultry were hatching, or carrying off a chick or a goſling. Theſe impertinencies bred frequent quarrels, and the poor creatures were ſometimes driven off with bloody noſes, or obliged to hop on three legs, or even laid ſprawling and ſlyly covered with earth, no ſervice or ceremony being ſaid over the carcaſs, and no other epitaph, than "Poh, they are nothing but brutes, and where's the harm of killing them!" or in rhyme thus:</p>
               <l>"Tit for tat, tit for tat,</l>
               <l>"He ſtole my chick, and I broke his back."</l>
               <p>WHATEVER plauſible excuſes might have been made for theſe proceedings, they ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to render the creatures jealous of their new neighbours; but inſtead of abating their appetite for miſchief, it ſharpened their invention to take more ſly methods of
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030051_0069_0FE416615B2A50B0"/>
accompliſhing it. The more wary of them kept aloof in the day time, and would not be enticed by the arts which were uſed to draw them in; however, they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pinched for food, and the new inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants uſed to throw cruſts of bread, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of corn, and other eatables, in their way, which allured them by degrees to familiarity. After a while it was found that nothing ſucceeded ſo well as <hi>molaſſes.</hi> It was therefore thought a capital manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre to drop a train of it on the ground, which the creatures would follow, licking it, till they had inſenſibly got up to the doors of the houſes, where if any body held a bowl or a plate beſmeared with the liquor, they would come and put their noſes into it, and then you might pat them on the back and ſides, or ſtroke them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "Poor Bruin, poor Iſgrim, poor Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, poor Puſs," and the like, and they would ſuffer themſelves to be handled and fondled till they dropped aſleep. When they awaked, they would make a moan and wag their tails, as if they were aſking for
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030051_0070_0FE4163705FA3E30"/>
more, and if it was denied them, they would retire to the woods in diſguſt, till the ſcent of the molaſſes operating on their depraved appetites, invited them to return where it was to be had. This was, upon repeated trial, found to be the moſt effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual way of taming them, as they might be taught to imitate any kind of tricks and geſtures, if a diſh of molaſſes was held out as a reward.</p>
               <p>THE Foreſters knew that they could not ingratiate themſelves better with their old maſter Bull, than by humouring his itch for projects. They therefore took care to raiſe reports and write letters from time to time concerning the wonderful ſucceſs which they had met with in civilizing the ſavage animals. Bull was greatly pleaſed with theſe reports, and made a practice of ſending preſents of trinkets to be diſtributed among them; ſuch as collars, ear-rings, and noſe-jewels. Several times ſome of the moſt ſtately and beſt inſtructed of them were carried to his houſe for a ſhow, where
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030051_0071_0FE4163ACEBDA2C8"/>
he had them dreſſed up in ſcarlet and gold trappings, and led through all his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the entertainment of his family, and feaſted with every nick-nack which his cook and confectioner could procure. He was ſo fond of being thought their patron and protector, that he uſually ſpoke of them as his <hi>red children,</hi> from the colour of their hides. It is not many years ſince one of them, after being led through ſeveral fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies and plantations of the tenants, was carried by a certain <hi>witty cur,</hi> to Mr. Bull's own houſe, dreſſed in the habit of a <hi>clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> having been previouſly taught to lift his paws and roll his eyes, as if in the act of devotion. This trick was ſo well carried on, that the managers of it picked up a large pocket full of pence, by exhibiting him for a raree ſhow, and the money was applied toward building a <hi>menagerie,</hi> to which beaſts of all kinds might be brought and tamed. This project, like many ſuch whims, has made more noiſe than profit; for moſt of thoſe who were ſuppoſed to be tamed and domeſticated, after they had been ſent back
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030051_0072_0FE4163C784F1D88"/>
to their native woods, with a view to their being inſtrumental in taming their fellow ſavages, have returned to their former fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocious habits, and ſome of them have proved greater rogues than ever, and have done more miſchief than they could other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been capable of.</p>
               <p>MR. Bull himſelf was once ſo full of the project, that he got his chaplain and ſome others to form themſelves into a club; the profeſſed object of which was, to <hi>propagate knowledge</hi> among theſe ſavage creatures. After ſome trials, which did not anſwer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, old Madam Bull conceived that the money which was collected might as well be expended in teaching Mr. Bull's own tenants themſelves a little better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for ſome of them were rather awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſlovenly in their deportment, while others were decent and devout <hi>in their own way.</hi> Madam, as we have before obſerved, was a great zealot in the cauſe of <hi>uniformity,</hi> and had a vaſt influence over her ſon, by virtue of which, the attention of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030051_0073_0FE4163E2890DB70"/>
the club was principally directed to the promoting of this grand object. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, every one of the tenants was furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Bible and a Prayer Book, a clean napkin, baſon, platter, and chalice, with a few devotional tracts, and ſome young ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers who had been educated in the family, were recommended as chaplains; who had alſo by-orders to keep a look out toward the ſavage animals, when they ſhould fall in their way.</p>
               <p>THE chaplains were tolerably well receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in moſt of the families; but ſome, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Codline and Ploughſhare, who gloried in being able to ſay their prayers <hi>without book,</hi> always looked ſour upon them, and would frequently ſay to them, "Go, take care of the ſavage objects of your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and don't come here to teach us, till you have learned better yourſelves." The chaplains in diſguſt, and perhaps in revenge, (for they were but men of like paſſions) would pout and ſwell and call <hi>ſchiſmatic</hi> and other canonical nick-names, of which there
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030051_0074_0FE4164032015C70"/>
is extant a large vocabulary, and would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently write letters, much to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their opponents. It is not many years ſince they, with the club which ſent them, were pretty ſeverely handled by one of Codline's own chaplains,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. M—y—w.</note> and it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they have ever ſince been more modeſt; certain it is, that they are now on better terms with their neighbours than formerly; this may, in part, be owing to Mr. Bull's deſerting them and refuſing to pay them for their ſervices ever ſince the time that he began to quarrel with his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. On that occaſion ſome of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved their quarters; others kept their old places, and have got along as well as they could without the help which they formerly received.</p>

               </argument>
               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE obſerved in a former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the leaſe which Mr. Bull gave to Charles Indigo, obliged him to receive into his family all ſuch perſons as had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants on Mr. Bull during his ſickneſs, and for whom he had no other means of providing. This general indulgence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to Charles the reputation of a very friendly, hoſpitable perſon, and induced great numbers of other people of various characters, views, and intereſts, to ſeek an
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030051_0076_0FE4164548078AC0"/>
aſylum within his limits. About this time Mr. Lewis had grown ſick and peeviſh, and had ſeverely cudgelled ſome of his appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, becauſe they did not make their P's and Q's exactly to his mind.<note n="*" place="bottom">Revocation of the edict of Nantz, by Lewis XIV. 168<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> The poor fellows, to prevent worſe treatment, fled from his houſe, and took refuge with Mr. Bull, who treated them civilly, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to the Foreſt, where they diſperſed themſelves in the ſeveral families of his tenants, and a large party of them took up their abode with Charles, to whom they proved an induſtrious, profitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, though ſome of the family looked a little ſourly upon them.</p>
               <p>THIS facility of admitting ſtrangers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an effect which had almoſt proved fatal to the reputation of the family; for a number of <hi>highwaymen</hi> alſo ſought ſhelter there, and by means of their gold and ſilver, which they had in plenty, made friends in the houſe, and were admitted by night
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030051_0077_0FE4164738359E30"/>
at a back door. After a while they grew more bold, and came in the day time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſguiſe of pedlars, with packs on their ſhoulders. One of them actually took his ſtand behind a corner of one of the fences, from whence he ſallied out on travellers; this corner obtained, from that circumſtance, the name of <hi>Cape Fear;</hi> and as the firſt names of places are not eaſily got rid of, it retains the name to this day, and perhaps will ever retain it. Here the raſcal intended to have built himſelf a lodge, and taken up his quarters for life; but the matter was now grown ſo public, that Charles, for the honour of his family, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all ſtragglers to be ſeized, and this fellow in particular, after a ſevere ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, was apprehended and brought to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>THE ſame ſpot was afterward taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of by PETER PITCH, a poor fellow who got his living as he did his name, from collecting the reſmous juice of the numerous pines which grew thereabout.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030051_0078_0FE41648E3370B90"/>
He had to work hard and fare hard, and go a great way for his victuals and clothes; but after he had lived alone for ſome time, he picked up one or two acquaintances of his own ſtamp, and they formed a family, which was at firſt rather diſorderly. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery of the lands, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the water carriage, induced ſome other people to ſit down by him, and in proceſs of time he became ſo reſpectable as to be noticed by Mr. Bull, who, though he never gave him a leaſe in form, yet let him have cloth and haberdaſhery upon credit, and took his pitch in payment as faſt as he could collect it. This kept him in a dependent ſtate, and ſubjected him to impoſitions from Bull's clerks and journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. About five and twenty years ago, Bull ſent him a taylor to <hi>try on</hi> a new coat,<note n="*" place="bottom">Inſurrections in North Carolina, 1771.</note> which was ſo ſtrait that it ſplit in ſeveral places, and never could be altered ſo as to fit him; but he was obliged to wear it, rather than quarrel with his patron. This ſame taylor was remarkable for <hi>cabbaging,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="unknown:030051_0079_0FE4164BD4E90700"/>
as Peter Bullfrog and Humphry Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhare have ſince had large experience.</p>
               <p>TO finiſh what relates to Charles Indigo, I ſhall obſerve, that the land on which he began his plantation, was in general ſo wet and miry, that it was unfavourable to the production of wheat, and it was for ſome time doubtful whether he would be able to raiſe his own bread. Chance at length effected what labour and ingenuity could not: a bird of paſſage having dropped ſome kernels of rice in his dung, it was found to thrive exceedingly well; from whence the hint was taken, and rice became the ſtandard grain of the plantation. By the cultivation of this, and of a weed which was uſeful to the dyers, he grew rich, and made a ſightly figure among his neighbours in point of dreſs and equipage; though his countenance is rather ſallow, and he is ſubject to frequent returns of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent fever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:030051_0080_0FE4164E06BB1D30"/>BY the extenſive leaſe given to Indigo and his aſſociates, moſt of Mr. Bull's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants and attendants were provided for, and their ſervices recompenſed with a ſhew of generoſity on his part, and of ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on theirs. I have before juſt hinted at a grant made to WILLIAM BROADBRIM, of which I ſhall now give a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account.</p>
               <p>HIS father had been an old ſervant of Mr. Bull, and had been employed in the very laborious and neceſſary buſineſs of catching and killing rats. In this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was ſo very dexterous and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, that he recommended himſelf high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his maſter, who not only allowed him large wages, but promiſed him farther recompenſe. During Mr. Bull's ſickneſs, the care and diligence of this faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had been unremitted, and his merits were thereby increaſed, ſo that Mr. Bull, on his recovery, found himſelf deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him, and he ſtill continued his ſervices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till, worn out with age and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030051_0081_0FE4165000A1B288"/>
he died and had an honourable funeral.</p>
               <p>HIS ſon William then became his heir, and ſolicited for payment of the arrears due to his father, which Mr. Bull, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the maxim he had laid down for himſelf, and urged by the neceſſity of the occaſion, propoſed to diſcharge by a leaſe of part of the Foreſt. This happened to fall in, exactly, with William's views, which were of a ſingular nature.</p>
               <p>ABOUT this time a nervous diſorder ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Bull's family, which went by the name of the <hi>ſhaking palſy.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Quakeriſm.</note> We ſhall not pretend to trace the cauſes of it, as the origin of ſuch things is often obſcure and impenetrable; but the effects were, a trembling of the nerves, a ſtiffneſs in the neck and ſhoulders, and a heſitancy in the ſpeech, ſo that it was impoſſible for the patients to incline the head, or pronounce certain words and ſyllables, ſuch as Sir,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030051_0082_0FE41596175A1E70"/>
Madam, your Honor, my Lord, &amp;c. nor could one of them raiſe his hand to take off his hat, or hold it on the book when an oath was to be adminiſtered.</p>
               <p>MR. Bull's choleric temper miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted this natural infirmity into a ſullen diſreſpect. When he found a change in the behaviour of theſe domeſtics; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bowing to him they ſtood upright as a may-pole, and inſtead of Sir, and your Honor, they could utter nothing but <hi>Friend,</hi> he grew angry, and made a pretty free uſe of his fiſt; and when he found that they could not be cured by ſuch means, he thruſt ſome of them into a dark cloſet, and ſhut them up till they ſhould, as he termed it, "learn better manners;" and it is ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he would have carried his reſentment much further, but for this circumſtance: William Broadbrim, who had himſelf ſtrong ſymptoms of the diſorder, whiſpered to Mr. Bull, that if he would give him time to ripen a project, which he had conceived, he would rid him of all trouble with theſe
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030051_0083_0FE41651A7EFADB8"/>
people. William had a plodding genius, and the ſcheme with which his head was pregnant at this time, was nothing more or leſs than to make a ſettlement in the foreſt, and take all theſe people with him. Bull, who was glad to get rid of them, and of the debt which he owed to William, readily fell in with the project; and a grant was made out under hand and ſeal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in William Broadbrim, and his heirs, were inveſted with the right of ſoil, and all oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er privileges of proprietorſhip, in a certain part of the foreſt, between the plantation of Marygold and that of Cart-rut and Bare-clay, being in the neighbourhood of the ſpot where Caſimir had rebuilt his hut, and lived in an ambiguous ſituation, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who was his landlord. With him Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam made a peaceable compromiſe, ſaying, "Friend, I will do thee no violence, there is room enough for us both." Caſimir was glad of ſo good a neighbour, and he had reaſon to be, for he throve more rapidly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this than before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:030051_0084_0FE41655935DB7C8"/>WILLIAM pitched upon a level piece of ground, where two large brooks met, for the ſituation of his manſion houſe, and went to work to draw up rules for the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of his family. One of which was, that no perſon ſhould be refuſed admittance into it, or diſturbed in it, or caſt out of it, on account of any natural infirmity. Anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was, that no arms nor ammunition ſhould ever be made uſe of, on any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The firſt of theſe rules gained Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam great reputation among all ſenſible men; the latter was a notion which candor would lead us to ſuppoſe proceeded from a love of peace, and the exerciſe of good will toward his fellow-creatures; though ſome were ſo ill-natured as to imagine that it was an effect of the diſorder in his nerves.</p>
               <p>WHEN any of William's neighbours, who were of a different way of thinking, ſpake to him of the impolicy of this rule, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him how he expected to defend himſelf and his family againſt the wild beaſts, if they ſhould attack him; William, who was
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030051_0085_0FE416573B1DBA60"/>
fond of harangue, would anſwer thus— "There is in all creatures a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, which diſpoſeth them to peace. This inſtinct is ſo ſtrong and fixed, that upon it, as upon a foundation, may be erected a complete ſyſtem of love and concord, which all the powers of anarchy ſhall not be able to overthrow. To cultivate and improve this inſtinct, is the buſineſs of every wiſe man, and he may reaſonably expect that an example of this kind, if ſteadily and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly adhered to, will have a very extenſive and beneficial influence, on all ſorts of creatures; even the wild beaſts of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt will become tame as lambs, and birds of prey harmleſs as doves. Doſt thou not ſee, friend, what influence my example has already had on thoſe creatures which are deemed ſavage? I go into their dens with ſafety, and they enter my habitation without fear. When they are hungry I feed them, when they are thirſty I give them drink, and they in return bear my burdens, and do ſuch other kind offices as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, end I require of them. I have even
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030051_0086_0FE416592DFFCD78"/>
tamed ſome of them ſo far, that they have ſold me the land on which they live, and have acknowledged the bargain by a mark made with their toe-nails on parchment. They are certainly ſome of the beſt natured creatures in the world; their native inſtinct leads them to love and peace, and ſociabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and as long as I ſet them a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I have no doubt they will follow it. When ſuch is my opinion and expectation, why ſhould I be anxious about what may, and I truſt never will happen? Why ſhould I put myſelf in a poſture of defence againſt thoſe who may never attack me? or, why ſhould I, by the appearance of jealouſy and diſtruſt on my part, offend thoſe who now put confidence in me? No, no, I will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they will ever hurt me. I will not ſuffer the <hi>carnal weapon</hi> to be ſeen in my houſe, nor ſhall one of my family ever learn the deteſtable practice of pulling the <hi>trigger.</hi> I leave the inſtruments of deſtruction to the offſpring of Cain and the ſeed of the ſerpent; whilſt I meekly imitate the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030051_0087_0FE4165ADBBFBE98"/>
of the lamb, and the innocence of the dove."</p>
               <p>WITH ſuch harangues William would frequently entertain himſelf and his friends, and he was ſo ſanguine in his benevolent project, that inſtead of having his own name, as was uſual, written over his door, he had the words BROTHERLY LOVE, tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Greek language, ΦΙΛΑΔΕΛΦΙΑ, and inſcribed in golden characters, as a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invitation to perſons of all nations and characters, to come and take ſhelter under his roof.</p>

               <p>THE general invitation which Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Broadbrim had given to all perſons who were deſtitute of a home, to come and take ſhelter under his roof, and the gentle, humane treatment which thoſe who accepted the invitation met with, ſpread his fame abroad, and brought him much company. His family was ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030051_0089_0FE4168B4C36DC90"/>
to the Ark of Noah, becauſe there was ſcarcely any kind of being, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhape, ſize, complexion, diſpoſition, or language, but what might be found there. He had alſo the art to keep them pretty well employed. Induſtry, frugality, and temperance, were the leading princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his family; and their thriving was in a ratio compounded of theſe three forces. Nothing was wanting to make them as happy a family as any in the world, but a diſpoſition <hi>among themſelves,</hi> to live in peace. Unluckily, this deſirable bleſſing, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the variety of their humours and intereſts, was ſeldom found among them. Ambition, jealouſy, avarice, and party ſpirit, had frequent out-breakings, and were with difficulty quelled. It is needleſs to enter into a very particular diſcuſſion of the grounds or effects of theſe diſſenſions: family quarrels are not very entertaining either at home or abroad, unleſs to ſuch as delight in ſcandal. But there was one cauſe of diſſenſion which it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper not to notice, becauſe I have already
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030051_0090_0FE3F1AC2957ADE0"/>
hinted at the principle from which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. William's averſion to fire-arms was ſo ſtrong, that he would not ſuffer any of his family to moleſt the wild inhabitants of the foreſt, though they were ever ſo miſchievous. While the family was ſmall, the ſavage animals who lived in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, being well fed, were tolerably tame and civil, but when the increaſed number of the family had penetrated far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the foreſt, the haunts of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were diſturbed, and the ſtraggling labourers were ſometimes ſurpriſed, and having nothing to defend themſelves with, fell a ſacrifice to ſavage reſentment. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances were preſented to Mr. Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brim one after another, but he always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on it that the ſufferer muſt have been the aggreſſor, and that "they who take the ſword, muſt expect to periſh by the ſword." At length the dead corpſe of one of the labourers, mangled and torn in a dreadful manner, was brought and laid at the door of William's parlour,<note n="*" place="bottom">State houſe, 1755.</note> with a label affixed
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030051_0091_0FE4166685261998"/>
to the breaſt, on which were written theſe words, "Thou thyſelf muſt be accounted my murderer, becauſe thou didſt deny me the means of defence." At ſight of this horrid ſpectacle, Broadbrim turned pale! the eye of his mind looked inward! Nature began to plead her own cauſe within him! he gave way in ſome degree to her opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though contrary to his pre-conceived opinion, and with a trembling hand ſigned a permiſſion for thoſe to uſe the <hi>carnal weapon,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Militia act.</note> who could do it without ſcruple; and when they aſked him for money to buy guns, powder and ball, he gave them a certain ſum to provide <hi>the neceſſaries of life,</hi> leaving them to put their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction on the words. By degrees his ſqueamiſhneſs decreaſed, and though it is imagined he has ſtill ſome remainder of it, yet neceſſity has ſo often overcome it, that there is not much ſaid on the ſubject, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be very privately and among <hi>friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:030051_0092_0FE41668B0269960"/>DURING the time of which we have been ſpeaking, Mr. John Bull had undergone another ſickneſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Revolution, 1688.</note> not ſo long nor ſo violent as the former, but much more beneficial in its effects. His new phyſicians had admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtered medicines which compoſed his nerves; he ate, drank, and ſlept more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; and he was adviſed to marry again, for his former wife had died of a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a little before this ſickneſs came on. By theſe means his vigour was renewed, but ſtill his whimſical diſpoſition remained, and broke out on ſeveral occaſions. When he viewed his extenſive foreſt, now planted and thriving, under the honeſt hand of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, he thought within himſelf that ſtill greater advantages might be derived from that territory. There was yet a part of it unſettled between the plantation of Charles Indigo, and the dominions of Lord Strut; and Bull thought it a pity to let ſo much remain a wilderneſs. The other plantations had been made by diſcontented ſervants and needy adventurers, who, ſtruggling
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030051_0093_0FE4166AAA44B590"/>
with hardſhips, by a ſteady perſeverance had ſurmounted many difficulties, and obtained a comfortable living. "Now, ſaid Bull, if theſe fellows have done ſo well, and got ſo far aforehand, without having any capital of their own to begin with, what cannot be done by the force of my great capital? If they have performed ſuch wonders, what greater wonders may be brought into view by my own exertions, with all the advantages which it is in my power to command? To it, boys; I vow I'll have a farm of my own that ſhall beat you all!"—Having hit upon this project, his brains immediately became pregnant with ideas; but according to the rule which he had lately preſcribed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he communicated the matter to his wife. This good lady was not free from an ambitious turn of mind. She was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fond of having it thought that ſhe had great influence over her huſband, and would ſometimes gratify his humour at the expenſe of her own judgment, rather than not keep up this idea. His expectations from his new project were very ſanguine.
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030051_0094_0FE4166C54FCD550"/>
The land on which he had caſt his eye was enough for a large farm; it had a ſouthern expoſure; it was warm, rich and fertile in ſome parts, and in others boggy or ſandy. He had converſed with ſome foreigners, who told him that it was proper for the cultivation of wine and ſilk, and he imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that if he could but add theſe articles to the liſt of his own productions, there would be a great ſaving in the family. Mrs. Bull too was pleaſed with the idea of having her ſilk gowns and ribbands of her own growth, and with the expectation of having the vaults filled with wine, made on her own plantation; for theſe and other good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, her thereunto moving, Madam gave her conſent to the project. The perſon appointed to carry it into execution was <hi>George Truſty,</hi> a ſenſible well bred merchant, but one who had only ſpeculated in the ſcience of agriculture, and knew nothing of it by experience. Having collected a number of poor people who were out of employment, he ſent them to the ſpot, with ſtrict orders to work ſix days in ſeven,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030051_0095_0FE4167036BB1008"/>
to keep their tools free from ruſt, and their fire-arms in readineſs for their defence. Whatever they ſhould earn was to be <hi>their own</hi> as long as they lived, and after their death their poſſeſſions were to deſcend to their <hi>ſons,</hi> and in default of male iſſue to revert to the original grantor. They were not allowed to uſe black cattle in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the field; and were expreſsly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to drink grog. Their buſineſs was to cultivate vines and mulberry trees, and to manufacture wine and ſilk. Upon this project another was grafted by the very ſagacious <hi>Doctor Squintum,</hi> who choſe this new plantation as the moſt convenient ſpot in the world for a charity ſchool, where <hi>Orphans</hi> might receive the beſt education, and be fitted to be the pillars of church and State.</p>
               <p>BUT notwithſtanding the ſums which Bull ſo freely laviſhed out of his bags for the ſupport of the vine and mulberry plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; and notwithſtanding the collections which Squintum made among his numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030051_0096_0FE41671E5589F88"/>
devotees, theſe projects were either ſo impracticable in themſelves, or ſo ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted in the execution, that neither of them anſwered the expectations of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors. For want of black cattle, the ſoil could not be properly tilled; and for want of grog, the labourers fainted at their work; the right of inheritance being limited to the male line, women and girls were not fond of living there, and the men could not well live without them; land, cattle, women and grog, were to be had elſewhere, and who would be confined to ſuch a place? The land, too, was claimed by Lord Strut, who ſent them writs of ejectment. As to the charity ſchool, it was on trial found that the coſt was more than the profit, and the building, which had ſwallowed up thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of charity money, was finally conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by fire. Poor George Truſty was diſcouraged, and begged Mr. Bull to take the plantation into his own hands; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Bull continued to ſupply him with caſh, and he kept on making attempts. Alterations were made in the terms of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030051_0097_0FE41673E03CCAD8"/>
the reſtrictions were removed, cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and grog were allowed, Lord Strut was ouſted, and poſſeſſion held; the ſwamps were drained; rice and indigo were culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated inſtead of ſilk and wine; and upon the whole, conſiderable improvements were made, though at ſuch a vaſt expenſe, that Mr. Bull never ſaw any adequate returns.</p>
               <p>THE ill ſucceſs of this adventure did not deter him from another project. He was extremely fond of <hi>Trout,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Cod fiſhery.</note> and thought if he could have them regularly catched and brought to his table, he ſhould exceed all his neighbours in delicate living; and now and then be able to ſend a meſs to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friends. Lord Peter's family, too, he thought, would be glad to buy them, as they were very uſeful in the long lents, and frequent meagre days obſerved by them. There was a part of the foreſt on the north-eaſt quarter, which was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſituated for this employment. It had been occupied by ALEXANDER SCOTUS,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030051_0098_0FE416758D100E20"/>
a purblind fellow, who had ſtraggled thither no one could tell how; and it was matter of doubt whether he derived his right from Bull, or Lewis; for both of them laid claim to the land, and their claims had not been fairly decided in law. To make ſure of the matter, Mr. Bull, by advice of his wife, ſent a waggon to bring off the family of Scotus, whom he diſtributed among the other families of his tenants; and in their room ſent thither<note n="*" place="bottom">1749.</note> a parcel of naked, half ſtarved people, who could live no where elſe, and ſupported them for ſeveral years with proviſions, furniſhed them with ſkiffs, lines, hooks and other implements to carry on the fiſhery; but every trout which they catched, coſt him ten times as much as if he had bought it in the common market; nor could he, after all, get half of what he wanted for his own conſumption. His trout fiſhery, and his mulberry plantation, rendered him the laughing ſtock of his neighbours, nor could he ever gain even the intereſt of the money which he had laid
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030051_0099_0FE41678780F1EB8"/>
out upon them; while the foreſters who had ſettled at their own expenſe, grew rich and became reſpectable. He had indeed the benefit of their trade, which kept his journeymen at work, and obliged him to enlarge their number; for the foreſters had a reſpect for their old maſter and landlord, and when they had any thing to ſell, they always let him have the refuſal of it, and bought all their goods of him. But though he called himſelf their father, and his wife their mother, yet he began to abate of his parental affection for them; and rather looked on them with a jealous eye, as if they were aiming to deprive him of his claim, and ſet up for independence. Had he been contented with the profits of their trade, as was certainly his intereſt, they might have remained his tenants to this day; but ambition, avarice, jealouſy and choler, inflamed by bad counſellors, have wrought ſuch a ſeparation, that it is thought Mr. Bull will go mourning all the remainder of his days, and his grey hairs will be brought down with ſorrow to the grave.</p>

               <p>IN my former letters I have endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to trace the ſeveral ſteps by which the foreſt became cultivated and peopled. Mr. Bull had no leſs than fourteen tenants who held under him, and were ſettled on lands which he claimed as his own, and which he had granted to them in ſeparate parcels. Their names, were as follows:

               </p>
               <p>IT was obſerved that of all the adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, thoſe generally were the <hi>leaſt thriving,</hi> who received <hi>moſt aſſiſtance</hi> from their old maſter. I cannot tell whether it was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their being employed in buſineſs to which they had not ſerved a regular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip, or to a natural indolence, and a diſpoſition to continue hangers-on where they had got a good hold; for it muſt be noted, that Mr. Bull was very generous to ſome perſons, and on ſome occaſions where it ſuited his fancy; and this diſpoſition in him was ſo prevalent, that they who ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and would humour his whims, could work him out of any thing which they had a mind to.</p>
               <p>ON the other hand, thoſe adventurers who came into the foreſt on their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and had no aſſiſtance at all from their old maſter, nor any thing to help
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030051_0102_0FE4167E1FE07DF0"/>
themſelves with, but their four limbs and five ſenſes, proved to be the moſt induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and thriving, and after a while told up a good eſtate. They all ſeemed to have an affection for Mr. Bull, and it was generally believed to be ſincere. His houſe was uſually ſpoken of by them as their <hi>home.</hi> His ware-houſe was the centre of their traffic; and he had the addreſs to engroſs the profits of their labour, and draw their earnings into his own fob. To ſome of them he would now and then make a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to others he would lend a pack of his hounds, when he was out of the humour of hunting; but they were generally uſeleſs to them for the purpoſe of ſcouring the woods; thoſe who could afford it, kept dogs of their own, who were better trained to the game, and could better ſcent the foreſt, being native curs, and not ſo ſpruce and delicate a breed as Bull's grey-hounds.</p>
               <p>IT has been before obſerved, that each end of the foreſt was occupied by Bull's rivals. His old neighbour Lewis had got
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030051_0103_0FE41681DE6353D0"/>
the north end, and Lord Strut the ſouth. Bull's tenants had ſeated themſelves chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on or near the ſhore of the lake, and had not extended very far back, becauſe of the beaſts of prey; but Lewis, like a cunning old fox, had formed a ſcheme to get footing in the interior parts of the country, and prevent theſe planters from penetrating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the limits which he intended to aſſign them. His emiſſaries had been ſent ſlily into the diſtant parts of the foreſt, under pretence of taming theſe beaſts of prey; but in fact they had halved the matter with them, and had themſelves become as ſavage as the beaſts had become tame. They would run, leap and climb with them, and crawl into their dens, imparting to them a lick of <hi>molaſſes</hi> out of their calabaſh, and teaching them to ſcratch with their paws the ſign of a croſs. They had built ſeveral hunting lodges on the moſt convenient paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the brooks and ponds, and though thus ſcattered in the wood, were all united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one overſeer, called ONONTIO, who
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030051_0104_0FE416838C67CBE8"/>
lived in the manſion-houſe of St. Lewis's Hall.</p>
               <p>IT was matter of wonder among Bull's tenants, for ſome time, what could be the reaſon that the wild beaſts had grown more ſurly and ſnappiſh of late than formerly; but after a while, ſome hunters made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the new lodges, which the emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of Onontio had erected, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of them being apparent, a general alarm was raiſed in the plantations. On the firſt news, Walter Pipeweed ſent his grandſon <hi>George,</hi> a ſmart, active, lively youth, acroſs the hills, with his compliments to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders, deſiring them to move off, and threatening them with a writ, in caſe of non-compliance.<note n="*" place="bottom">1753.</note> This modeſt warning being ineffectual, it was thought that if an <hi>Union</hi> could be formed among the tenants, they might make a ſtand againſt theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments. A meeting was held at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ange Hall,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Albany, 1754.</note> but no efficient plan could be hit on, without a previous application to
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030051_0105_0FE416858488CFF8"/>
their landlord, who hearing of this meeting, conceived a jealouſy with regard to this <hi>union</hi> which ſeemed to be their object, and thought it was better to retain the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the matter in his own hands, and keep them divided among themſelves, but united in their dependence on him. He therefore ſent them word that "he had a very great affection for them, and would take care of <hi>their</hi> intereſt, which was alſo <hi>his own</hi>; that he would not ſuffer Lewis to ſet his half tamed wild beaſts upon them, nor eject them from their poſſeſſions, but that he would immediately take advice of his council, learned in the law, conjuring them by the affection which they profeſſed to bear towards him, to be aiding and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in all ways in their power, towards bringing the controverſy to an iſſue.</p>
               <p>AT this time, the ſteward, to whom Mr. Bull entruſted the care of his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſineſs, was not a perſon of that diſcernment and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which the exigency of affairs requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. He had committed divers blunders in
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030051_0106_0FE416872BE0D578"/>
his accounts, and it was ſuſpected that he was a defaulter in more reſpects than one. It cannot, therefore, be expected, that in conducting a controverſy of this magnitude, he ſhould exactly hit on the right methods, nor employ the beſt council which could be had. The firſt ſtep taken was to ſend <hi>Broadoak</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Braddock, 1755.</note> the bailiff, with a writ of intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he was ordered to ſerve <hi>volens nolens,</hi> upon one of the meſſuages or hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſeats of Lewis. This bailiff, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raſhly and againſt the beſt advice into the foreſt, not a ſtep of which he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, found his progreſs impeded in a way wholly unexpected. For Onontio had taken care to place a number of his half tamed wild-cats and wolverenes on the boughs of trees, which hung over the path, and as ſoon as the bailiff came within reach, having firſt wetted their tails with their own urine, they whiſked it into his eyes till they blinded him. This manoeuvre put a ſtop to the proceſs for that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:030051_0107_0FE3F19E69CF2FA0"/>SEVERAL other attempts of the like kind were made without ſucceſs, and Lewis at one time had almoſt got poſſeſſion of <hi>Orange Hall</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1757.</note> Not only the foreſters themſelves, but even Bull's own domeſtics, complained bitterly of theſe ineffectual meaſures, and their clamors at laſt prevailed to make him diſcharge his old ſteward, and put another into his place. The new officer<note n="†" place="bottom">Pitt's adminiſtration.</note> ſoon changed the face of affairs; he employed no attorneys, nor bailiffs, but thoſe of tried and approved abilities, men of enterpriſe and reſolution, by whom the ſuit was proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in good earneſt. In every action Bull recovered judgment, and got poſſeſſion. When Lord Strut came in to the aid of Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, Bull caſt him alſo, and took away his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Auguſtine, which, with the whole tract of land, where Onontio preſided, was annexed to his eſtate. The agents who had been employed in this arduous ſervice, were not only well paid for doing their duty, but, with the ſteward who employed them, were honoured according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030051_0108_0FE4168CF54150E8"/>
but whimſical cuſtom of Bull's fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, by having their effigies pourtrayed on ſign-boards, pocket handkerchiefs, ſnuff-boxes, and punch-bowls; ſo that while the fit laſted, you could not walk the ſtreets, nor blow your noſe, nor take a pinch of ſnuff, nor a draught of punch, but you were obliged to <hi>ſalute</hi> them.</p>
               <p>WHENEVER Bull's ſteward called upon the foreſters for their quotas of aid towards carrying on this heavy law-ſuit, they always readily afforded it; and ſome of them were really almoſt exhauſted by the efforts which they made, to do <hi>more</hi> than their ſhare. The ſteward was ſo ſenſible of their merit, that on due conſultation with Mr. Bull's wife, and her taking him in the right mood, he was prevailed upon to reimburſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra expenſe to them, and mutual compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency reigned between the landlord and tenants all the time this ſteward remained in office. But theſe times were too good to laſt long; there were ſome who envied the ſteward his reputation, and raiſed ſtories
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030051_0109_0FE4168EEBAEA5D0"/>
to his diſadvantage, which highly affronted him. At this time Mr. Bull was ſo much off his guard, as to give heed to theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and take a raſh ſtep in a hurry, which he had occaſion to repent of at his leiſure. He accepted the reſignation of this truſty ſervant, and put one of his<note n="*" place="bottom">Bute's adminiſtration, 1761.</note> ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Peg's caſt off footmen into his place; whereby he laid a foundation for his own diſgrace, and the diſmemberment of his eſtate, of which I ſhall give you a particular account hereafter.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>TO trace with preciſion all the cauſes, great and ſmall, which operated to the diſmemberment of John Bull's eſtate, would be no eaſy taſk; ſome of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, were <hi>ſecret,</hi> but of ſuch as were open to obſervation, we ſhall endeavour to ſketch out the principal.</p>
               <p>IT is well known that he was of a chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eric habit, and that thoſe who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his humor and paſſions, could manage and impoſe upon him at their pleaſure. Had he been let alone to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030051_0111_0FE4169473320C70"/>
purſue his own buſineſs <hi>himſelf,</hi> his plain, natural good ſenſe, and generoſity of mind, would have kept him clear of many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; but he had his adviſers, his hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers-on, his levee-hunters, his toad-eaters, and ſycophants, forever about him, who, like a parcel of blood-ſuckers, could never have enough to glut their voracity.</p>
               <p>WHEN the foreſt was firſt occupied by the tenants, Bull had a wife who minded her own domeſtic buſineſs, and did not concern herſelf with his landed intereſt. The leaſes and grants were made out in <hi>his</hi> name, and he was ſuppoſed to be the owner or proprietor; but the lady whom he had married after his ſecond ſickneſs, was very aſſuming, and inſiſted on having <hi>her</hi> hand in the management of <hi>all</hi> his affairs. She viſited the compting-houſe, and made the clerks ſhew her their books; ſhe overhauled the ſteward's accounts, and inſpected his correſpondence; ſhe not only looked after the rents and incomes of the foreſt, but even intruded into the houſehold
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030051_0112_0FE416961F939A58"/>
concerns of the tenants, and affected to call herſelf <hi>their mother,</hi> becauſe ſhe had taken ſome care of one or two of them in their firſt ſetting out, although moſt of them ſcarcely ever had ſeen her face, or had any acquaintance with her, but by hearſay.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be obſerved, alſo, that this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had engaged Mr. Bull in ſome expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive law-ſuits and ſpeculations, which had got him deeply into <hi>debt,</hi> and he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to hire money of uſurers to carry her ſchemes into execution. Had ſhe, at the ſame time, introduced that frugality and economy into the family, which her duty ought to have prompted her to, this debt might have been kept down; but the ſwarm of harpies which were continually about her, and the courſe of gambling which was carried on under her conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and direction, ſwallowed up all the profits of the trade, and incomes of the land; while the luxury and diſſipation of the family increaſed, in proportion as the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030051_0113_0FE41698183D46C8"/>
means of diſcharging the debt decreaſed. In ſhort, Mr. Bull was reduced to that humiliating condition, which, by whatever faſhionable name it may now go, was formerly called <hi>petticoat government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DURING the law-ſuit with Lewis and Lord Strut,<note n="*" place="bottom">War of 1756.</note> concerning the foreſt, there had been a great intercourſe with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. Many of Bull's ſervants and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who were employed as bailiffs and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornies, and their deputies, had been very converſant with them, and were entertained at their houſes, where they always found wholeſome victuals, jolly fire ſides, and warm beds. They took much notice of every thing that paſſed, aſked many queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and made many remarks on the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the land, the pleaſant ſituation of the houſes, the clean and thriving condition of the children, who were always ready to wait on them, to clean their boots, hold their ſtirrups, open and ſhut the gates for them, and the like little neceſſary ſervices,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030051_0114_0FE4169A11E281A8"/>
as well bred children in the country are wont. The remarks which theſe perſons made, when they got home, favored rather of envy, than of gratitude or affection. Some of them would ſay: "Thoſe fellows live too well in the foreſt; they thrive too faſt; the place is too good for them; they ought to know who is their maſter; they can afford to pay more rent; they ought to pay for the help they have had; if it had not been for Maſter Bull, and the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which he has lent them, they would have been turned out of doors; and now they are to reap the benefit of his exertions, while he, poor man, is to pay the coſt."</p>
               <p>THERE were not wanting ſome, in the families of the Foreſters themſelves, who had the meanneſs to crouch to theſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and ſupplicate their favour and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt with Mr. Bull, to recommend them to ſome poſts of profit, as under-ſtewards, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors of rent, clerks of receipts, and the like petty offices. Theſe beggarly curs would repeat the ſame language, and hold
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030051_0115_0FE4169E02C2D538"/>
correſpondence with the bailiffs, attornies, &amp;c. after they had got home. Whenever any trifling quarrel happened in the families of the tenants, they would magnify it, and fill their letters with complaints of the licentiouſneſs of the people, and plead for a tighter hand to be held over them.</p>
               <p>SUGH ſpeeches as theſe were frequently made, and ſuch letters read, in the hearing of Mr. Bull's wife and ſteward. Their language grew by degrees to be the current language of the family, and Bull himſelf liſtened to it. His choler roſe upon the occaſion, and when his hangers-on obſerved it, they plied him with ſtronger doſes, till his jealouſy and hatred were excited, and a complete revolution in his temper, with regard to his tenants, took place, agreeably to the moſt ſanguine and malevolent wiſhes of his and their enemies.</p>
               <p>THE firſt effect of this change was, that his clerks were ordered to charge not only the prices of the goods, which the tenants
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030051_0116_0FE4169FABACEC68"/>
ſhould purchaſe, but to make them pay for the <hi>paper</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Stamp act, 1765.</note> on which their bills of parcels and notes of hand were written, and that at a very exorbitant rate. This was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable an abuſe, and withal ſo mean, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iful and beggarly an expedient to pick their pockets, that they held a meeting among themſelves, and reſolved not to buy any more of his goods, as long as this impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laſted; and by way of contempt, they hanged and burned the effigies of the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and other perſons who were ſuſpected of having adviſed to theſe new meaſures.</p>
               <p>THE reſentment ſhewn by the tenants on this occaſion was quite unexpected. The ſecret favourers, and real authors of the miſchief, began to be afraid that they had gone too far for the firſt attempt. Bull's journeymen were in an uproar about it, leſt, by the failure of his trade, they ſhould be out of bread; and to ſhorten the ſtory, he was obliged to give up the point of making them pay for the paper; though
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030051_0117_0FE416A1A6093E60"/>
                  <hi>Madam</hi> had the ſingular modeſty to make a declaration, that it was a mere matter of <hi>expediency,</hi> and that ſhe had power and right "to bind them in all caſes whatſoever," notwithſtanding Mr. Bull's <hi>moſt gracious</hi> conceſſion at that time.<note n="*" place="bottom">Repeal of the ſtamp act, and declaratory act, 1766.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THIS was conſidered by the tenants as a moſt impudent and barefaced aſſumption; for whatever rights Mr. Bull might pretend to have as their old maſter and landlord, yet they never had any idea of a <hi>miſtreſs</hi> over them; and though they very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſantly returned him their thanks for his preſent goodneſs, yet as they ſuſpected that there was more miſchief hatching, they began to inquire more narrowly than ever into his right and title to the land on which they lived. They looked over old parchments and memorandums, conſulted council learned in the law, and after due deliberation, they were fully convinced, that <hi>their own</hi> title was at leaſt as good as <hi>his,</hi> and that they had a right to refuſe him any
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030051_0118_0FE416A3525972E0"/>
rent or acknowledgment, if it were prudent for them to exerciſe it.</p>
               <p>MR. Bull's jealouſy was now increaſed with regard to their intentions, and his ſcribbling retainers frequently accuſed them of ingratitude and diſobedience, and a long premeditated deſign to ſet up for <hi>independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> a thing which they had not yet thought of, and probably never would, if this abuſive treatment had not put it into their heads.</p>
               <p>BUT though by thoſe means they were led into an inquiry, and a train of thinking, which were quite new to them; yet as old habits are not eaſily broken, and their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their maſter was very ſtrong, they endeavoured, with a candour which did them honour, to tranſfer the blame from him to his wife and ſteward, to whoſe machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they knew he was a dupe. Theſe bad counſellors ſoon renewed their attempts in another ſhape, by raiſing the rent, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an advanced price upon the goods; and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030051_0119_0FE416A7818CDDA8"/>
by means of additional clerks, packers, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, watchmen, draymen, &amp;c. who were continually in waiting, and to all of whom fees were to be paid, the trade laboured under great embarraſſments, and ſome of the foreſters were quite diſcouraged, others were vexed and impatient, while ſome of the better tempered of them, endeavoured to perſuade the reſt to keep up the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication as long as they could. They were loth to quarrel with their old maſter, and yet could not pocket the affronts and abuſes to which they were daily expoſed.</p>
               <p>DURING this ſullen interval, many letters paſſed, many books and precedents were examined, and much ink was ſhed, in a controverſy, which, however incapable of a <hi>deciſion</hi> in this way, might have been <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſed,</hi> if Mr. Bull's firſt thoughts had been as good as his ſecond; but he was ſo completely under management, as not to ſee his true intereſt. It was a common ſaying among his neighbours, "John Bull's wit comes afterward;" and in fact it did
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030051_0120_0FE416A93297EB68"/>
not come, in this caſe, till too late, for when a cauſe once gets into the law, there are ſo many quirks, evaſions, demurs, and procraſtinations, that it is impoſſible to make a retreat, till one or both of the parties have ſeverely ſmarted for their temerity.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I SUPPOSE you are by this time impatient for the ſtory of the law-ſuit; how it began, and how it was carried on and ended. I will give it to you as briefly as ſo long and intricate a matter will bear to be told; and I am apprehenſive you will think that Mr. Bull was ſo ill a politician, or ſo badly adviſed, as actually to pick a quarrel with his beſt cuſtomers. But facts will ſpeak for themſelves. Know then, that by the advice of his dear wife, and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030051_0122_0FE416AD273B7CD0"/>
her gambling junto, Mr. Bull was prevailed upon to ſend a dozen pounds of tea to each of his tenants, <hi>as a preſent,</hi> in token of his extreme good will to them, and becauſe he knew that they loved it; and at the ſame time to order his clerks to charge <hi>three pence</hi> for the paper and pack-thread in which each pound of this exhilerating weed was wrapped. This trifling ſum he expected would be paid on demand, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of their good will to him as their kind and generous landlord, who had protected and defended them againſt all oppoſers, and would ſtill continue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend them as his beloved chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and obedient humble ſervants.</p>
               <p>THE knowledge of his intention hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to come to them ſooner than the preſent, and they began to argue thus among themſelves—"Ha! how comes this? What is freer than a gift? If Mr. Bull really intends the tea as a preſent, why does he exact three pence? Had he offered it to us as an article of merchandiſe,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030051_0123_0FE416B10C038FC0"/>
as uſual, we might have taken it if we had liked the price, or left it if we had not; but this is a new way of trading to which we have not been accuſtomed. There is a deſign in this. If we receive this preſent and pay the trifling acknowledgment of three pence, by and by we ſhall have a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with ſix pence annexed, and another with a ſhilling, and ſo on. If we once eſtabliſh a precedent, there is no knowing where to ſtop, and by theſe preſents we may be gulled out of all our looſe corns, and afterwards our real eſtates may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded! No, it is better to prevent an evil than to cure it. We will have none of your preſents, Mr. Bull, if this is to be the conſequence. We have paid our debts well—you have had the <hi>excluſive</hi> benefit of our trade, and have become rich by it, and now in your old age you are grown trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. It is time for us to be on our guard and keep a ſharp look out; for if a man does not take care of himſelf, who can he expect will take care of him?" Fortified with theſe arguments, they waited for the
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030051_0124_0FE416B2B3D954A8"/>
approach of the meſſengers, who were on the road with the preſents.</p>
               <p>ONE of them came to Charles Indigo's houſe, and with Mr. Bull's compliments begged his acceptance of a package of tea. "Throw it into that cellar, ſaid Charles, and let it lie there till I have conſidered of the matter."</p>
               <p>ANOTHER came to William Broadbrim —but as the way to William's manſion was through a long, crooked, miry lane, he had ordered the porter to ſtop him, and give him liberty to return without deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his meſſage.</p>
               <p>PETER BULLFROG did the ſame; but ſome part of the tea being ſmuggled into the houſe, as ſoon as Peter knew it, he threw it into the gutter.</p>
               <p>JOHN CODLINE had the greateſt difficulty about Mr. Bull's preſent. He would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſent back the meſſenger, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030051_0125_0FE416B4AB6FF6F0"/>
for him, the gate which led to his houſe was held faſt by Bull's <hi>Under Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> who conſtantly watched and attended there, to obſerve who went in and out, which ſervice he was more particularly fond of, becauſe he expected a douceur for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhutting the gate. Having admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the meſſenger and received his <hi>penny,</hi> he ſtiffly refuſed to let him out again without having delivered the preſent. The <hi>fee</hi> was tendered, but this could not prevail; the family were uneaſy, they were loth to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front Mr. Bull, and yet determined not to receive his preſent. They could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the conduct of the under ſteward on any other principle than this, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to get a ſhare of the <hi>three pence,</hi> and of all other profits ariſing from future preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; and was afraid he ſhould loſe it if he let the meſſenger return. The family was called together in the chapel, where they held a long conſultation, ſent ſeveral meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the under ſteward, who held faſt the gate, and finally refuſed to open it. They were driven at length to an extremity, and
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030051_0126_0FE416B6A1FF8590"/>
threw the tea into the vault, where it periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the ſame time proteſting that the whole blame ought to be charged on the under ſteward, as they had no intention of injuring Mr. Bull if they could have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as this was known in Mr. Bull's family, his wife fell into a violent hyſteric fit, and in her raving phrenzy denounced all the vengeance which it was in her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to execute, on theſe refractory, ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tenants, who would not accept a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent when it was ſo freely offered to them. But when ſhe came a little to herſelf, ſhe was perſuaded by her gambling companions not to attempt any thing againſt the whole body of the tenants, leſt they ſhould be driven by neceſſity to form an union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, which might defeat the plan; ſhe therefore <hi>propoſed</hi> to Mr. Bull to ſingle out <hi>one</hi> of the moſt refractory of them, and ſhew his reſentment in a partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular manner to <hi>him,</hi> hoping that the others would be intimidated and let him ſuffer
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030051_0127_0FE416BAA9FD4098"/>
alone, and be glad to get off ſo well them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The perſon ſingled out for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of reſentment was John Codline, and the mode of reſentment was as ridiculous as it was malicious, for it was nothing more nor leſs than to ſend a bailiff, with a pack of blood-hounds, to ſtand before the great gate that led to the <hi>front</hi> of his houſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Boſton Port Act, 1774.</note> This, it was thought, would ſtrengthen the authority of the under ſteward who had the key of the gate, and would reduce the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily to this dilemma, either to receive no company and carry on no buſineſs, or elſe to ſubmit to Mr. Bull's new mode of trading.</p>
               <p>THE reaſon aſſigned for this particular mode of revenge was, that Mr. Bull, as lord of the manor, claimed a kind of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign right to the high way. He had for a long time exacted an acknowledgment from all paſſengers; whenever they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to meet any of his horſes or carriages on the road, whether he was there himſelf or not, they were obliged to <hi>douſe</hi> the hat,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030051_0128_0FE4174835B16C20"/>
or they might be ſure of receiving a ſtroke of the whip, if not of being run down by his ſervants, who had ſpecial orders not to let any omiſſion of this nature paſs unpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed.</p>
               <p>IN conſequence of this manoeuvre on the part of Mr. Bull, every perſon who had any buſineſs to do with John Codline was ſtopped in the road, and ordered to go back, or paſs by, like the Prieſt and Levite, on the other ſide. However, thoſe who had a mind to ſee him, found means to climb over the fence, or to go up a narrow lane, which, by the help of a ſtile and a foot path, led them to Codline's back door.</p>
               <p>THIS ſpecies of puniſhment expoſed Mr. Bull to the ridicule of all his neighbours. It alſo proved quite ineffectual to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which he deſigned it. Inſtead of hindering company from coming to Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line's houſe, it brought more; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many letters from thoſe who could not come in perſon. But, what was of
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030051_0129_0FE416BC5501EA18"/>
more ſervice to him than letters or viſits was this, that many who were indebted to him came and made payment, and thoſe who had at various times received favours from him when they were in diſtreſs, ſent him preſents, and encouraged him to keep up a good heart, promiſing to ſtand by him to the laſt extremity, if he ſhould be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it.</p>
               <p>IT has been obſerved, that one advantage which Mrs. Bull expected would ariſe from this ſpecimen of her <hi>refined</hi> policy was, that it would diſunite the tenants, and frighten ſome or perhaps all the others into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the new mode of traffic. This expectation was grounded on one of the fables of Eſop, which relates, that a fox who had been caught in a trap, and diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf by the loſs of his tail, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he appeared among the foxes, was the object of their ridicule; upon which, he endeavoured to perſuade them that he had been travelling to learn faſhions, and that the neweſt faſhion was for foxes to cut off
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030051_0130_0FE416BE4C9D7E00"/>
their tails as a uſeleſs and burdenſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage, and boaſted how much more light and nimble he had become ſince he had parted with that incumbrance; to which an old fox replied, that if he would do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to his argument, he ought to produce the <hi>ſhears</hi> with which he had cut off his tail, for the conviction of his brethren.</p>
               <p>THIS fable, and the moral couched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, raiſed a great deal of vain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and triumph in the family of Mr. Bull; but the foreſters had another of their own making, which was a match for it. A man meeting a ſerpent in the field, ſtruck at him with a ſtick, and there being but one in his view he thought to kill him immediately; but the ſnake ſet up ſuch a hiſs as brought a dozen more out of their holes, who attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the proud murderer in front, rear, and flank, and obliged him to take to his heels for ſafety. This fable was ſo much admired among the foreſters at that time, that they had an engraving made on all their meſſage cards, of a wounded ſerpent, with this motto, <hi>Join or die.</hi>

               </argument>
               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE inſult which the foreſters ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be put on them by the obſtruction of the road, as mentioned in my laſt, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſerious alarm, and induced them to call a meeting of the heads of the ſeveral families to conſult for their own ſafety. The reſult of this meeting was to endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, by all peaceable means in their power, to effect an accommodation; but if that ſhould fail, to prepare, in the beſt manner they could, to aſſert and maintain their rights, poſſeſſions and properties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:030051_0132_0FE416C436042BB8"/>IN proſecution of the former part of their plan, they wrote letters to Mr. Bull, and to ſeveral members of his family; and with reſpect to the latter part, they came to a reſolution to buy nothing more of him till he ſhould change his mode of conduct, and treat them as he had formerly done.</p>
               <p>IN the letters which they wrote on this occaſion, though they profeſſed a great deal of reſpect and affection for the old gentleman himſelf; they <hi>omitted</hi> to ſend their compliments to his wife. This was more than Madam could bear. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after conſulting with her gambling companions, determined upon the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing points; firſt, that no anſwer at all ſhould be given to the letter; and ſecondly, that an action at law ſhould be entered, and the tenants ejected from their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. She would not however have come to this latter determination, if ſhe had not been aſſured by perſons who pretended thoroughly to underſtand their family ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, that the foreſters <hi>would not dare to
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030051_0133_0FE416C5E5242208"/>
defend their title in law</hi>; but on the firſt appearance of a legal proceſs, would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to any terms of accommodation which her ladyſhip might think proper to impoſe. Full of this idea, ſhe roundly ſwore that ſhe would ſee them <hi>proſtrate at her feet,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe would make up the matter with them on any terms whatever.</p>
               <p>INFLUENCED by her paſſions, Mr. Bull's choler roſe to the higheſt pitch. As lord of the manor, he placed bailiffs and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds in the high way, and denied all paſſage to any perſons without his licenſe. He then called upon all the counſellors and attornies to whom he had given a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining fee, and who were very numerous, to exert all their learning and eloquence in maintaining his cauſe, promiſing them not only a regular payment of their fees, but a generous allowance for diſburſements and incidental charges, to be paid at ſight by a draught on his banker; and when the cauſe ſhould be gained, that each one
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030051_0134_0FE416C7E04C0D18"/>
ſhould be entitled to a plantation in the foreſt.</p>
               <p>THESE ſagacious gentlemen, (many of whom were of Madam's own junto) find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they had a fat client, contrived to <hi>huſband the job,</hi> and ſpin out the cauſe <hi>ſecundum artem.</hi> They were old profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in the ſcience, and knew very well how to take double receipts of their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, bailiffs, meſſengers, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers, <hi>i. e.</hi> one receipt for the exact ſum paid, and another for <hi>double</hi> the ſame ſum; theſe latter were always produced as vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the ſettlement of accounts, and in the glorious uncertainty of the law were admitted under the name of <hi>duplicates.</hi> It would divert you to ſee the numberleſs <hi>items</hi> which they crowded into their bills of coſt, and the various pleas and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences which were formed for demurring and continuing the cauſe from one ſeſſion to another; while they were feeding their client with the hope that in every <hi>next</hi> ſeſſion it would be decided.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:030051_0135_0FE416C98CC83B68"/>ON the other hand, the foreſters finding that Mr. Bull had retained ſo many learned counſellors, ſerjeants and barriſters in his ſervice, and that he had by far the longeſt purſe, were obliged to uſe the greateſt economy in conducting their defence. On looking round to ſee who was the moſt prudent, the moſt deliberate, and the moſt determined among them, and to whom they might with ſafety commit their cauſe, they unanimouſly pitched upon <hi>Walter Pipeweed</hi>'s grandſon <hi>George</hi>; who, being elected their chief attorney, modeſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the office on this generous condition, that they ſhould not inſiſt on his receiving any fee or reward, becauſe he conceived that in ſerving them he was doing no more than his duty. This inſtance of magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity was interpreted by them as a ſure omen of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>GEORGE was a man of good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and true ſpunk; he had made conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable progreſs in the ſtudy of the law for his own amuſement, and had practiſed at
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030051_0136_0FE416CD8B50E190"/>
the bar in the defence of his own family claims againſt the encroachments of Lewis. His abilities were of ſuch a nature as to riſe and ſhine with the opportunities which called them into action. This was alſo the caſe with divers other perſons in the families of the foreſters; who would, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, never have thought of engaging in the ſtudy of the law, had not this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy been agitated; but would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the ſtate which is thus elegantly deſcribed by the poet.</p>
               <l>"Full many a gem of pureſt ray ſerene,</l>
               <l>The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;</l>
               <l>Full many a flower is born to bluſh unſeen,</l>
               <l>And waſte its ſweetneſs on the deſart air."</l>
               <p>THIS circumſtance was predicted in the hearing of Mr. Bull's wife, by a very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and honeſt gentleman, who would have diſſuaded her from giving her huſband ſuch bad advice as to plunge himſelf into that deep ditch, the law, out of which there is no coming till the laſt farthing be paid.

"If there are any ſeeds of genius," ſaid this faithful adviſer, "they are drawn into action by public ferments and troubles; but might have remained in time of tranquillity forever uſeleſs and unknown, perhaps at the plough, under a ſhed, or among the loweſt claſs of mechanics."<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Debates in Parliament, March 16, 1775.</note> This ſage hint was totally diſregarded, becauſe, as I before obſerved, too much confidence was placed in a ſet of adviſers, who pretended to know all the family ſecrets of the foreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But the prediction was fully verified when this law-ſuit brought to the bar one from his farm, and another from his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, one from his ſhed, and another from his ſhop,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>This circumſtance gave occaſion to the following <hi>bagatelle,</hi> written, as is ſuppoſed, by ſome diſaffected or perhaps diſappointed wag, in one of the families.</p>

                        <l>While bubbles dance amidſt the foam.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </note> till in fact they became a
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030051_0138_0FE416D173665728"/>
match, in point of numbers at leaſt, for the whole hoſt of Mr. Bull's attornies.</p>
               <p>THE firſt action was brought againſt John Codline, who was deemed the moſt ſurly and refractory of the whole number. It was thought if he could be caſt, the others would of courſe ſubmit. In this way of proceeding, Mr. Bull acted like that ſpecies of dog which bears his name, and which is known to attack his enemy by the head.</p>
               <p>THE cauſe was learnedly argued at the Court of <hi>Bunker hall,</hi> and the arguments in favour of the foreſters made a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030051_0139_0FE416D32075DC38"/>
and very deep impreſſion on the managers for Mr. Bull. They found it a much more ſerious affair than they had imagined, and thought it beſt to ſtop ſhort and have the caſe <hi>hung up,</hi> that they might conſult their books over again, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves by better authorities and allegations at the next hearing. After a long time they contrived to <hi>ſhift their ground,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">March, 1776.</note> and let John alone. They adviſed Mr. Bull to ſend for ſome lawyers out of Germany, who had been more uſed to this kind of pleading, and to lay an attachment on the eſtate of Peter Bullfrog<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the farm called Caeſarea; where they expected to gain ſome greater advantage, partly becauſe the tenancy was different, being founded on courteſy and not on leaſe, and partly becauſe of the diſſentions which they heard were ſubſiſting in theſe families. In this interval alſo Madam Bull's reſentment was raiſed ſo high, that ſhe ſwore point blank that not one of theſe refractory ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels ſhould enter her huſband's doors, nor
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030051_0140_0FE416D70D211198"/>
have the leaſt connexion with him, but that ſhe would drive them off from the land, and re-people the foreſt with another ſet of men.</p>
               <p>WHEN they had heard of this reſolution, the heads of all the families in one of their conſultations, came to a determination to publiſh an advertiſement, ſetting forth the various abuſes and grievances which they had ſuffered from Mr. Bull, his wife, and her junto; and declaring that they looked upon the country as <hi>their own,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free from any obligations to him, and at liberty to look out for other markets, and invite other merchants to form connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions with them. This tranſaction was ſo important an era in the controverſy, that the <hi>fourth of July,</hi> the day on which the advertiſement was dated, has ever ſince been celebrated as a day of feſtivity. The morning of that anniverſary is uſhered in with a firing of guns and fluttering of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons. At noon you may hear ſome young lad ſpouting a declamation in favour of free
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030051_0141_0FE416D8B5CC6A48"/>
trade; which is generally followed by a bowl of punch and a rump of beef, and the day is concluded with a ſong and a dance.</p>
               <p>IN the progreſs of the action, ſeveral points of law were argued at different times with much ſkill and learning. On one of theſe occaſions George was reduced to a dilemma, and his opponents thought him abſolutely ſilenced; but ſuddenly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollecting himſelf, he roſe ſuperior to them,<note n="*" place="bottom">Trenton, 1776.</note> and compelled them again to move for a continuance. Thus the cauſe was kept ſuſpended till the <hi>third year</hi> was almoſt cloſed. At length a vaunting braggadocio of a barriſter on Mr. Bull's ſide, who thought to carry all before him, was ſo completely anſwered and confuted in an obſtinate argument, that a verdict was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at <hi>Saratoga hall</hi> in favour of thoſe plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which had been ſued for in the northern part of the manor. This verdict relieved the foreſters in ſome degree, and it
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030051_0142_0FE416DAAC679590"/>
was hoped would prove a good precedent for the deciſion of the other ſuits which were meditating againſt their brethren in the ſouthern part.</p>
               <p>THE unfortunate barriſter was ſeverely reflected on by Mr. Bull's wife, for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duty; and he was obliged to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify himſelf by producing his inſtructions, and by telling a number of ſerious truths reſpecting the foreſt and the foreſters, which Mrs. Bull had often heard before but would not believe. The relation of theſe truths was ſo very offenſive that ſhe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced her huſband never more to employ him; and as he could get no other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the law, he afterward employed himſelf in writing plays and romances, in which he was more ſucceſsful.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU may well ſuppoſe that a three years law-ſuit was a very expenſive undertaking on both ſides; and you will wonder how the foreſters, circumſtanced as they were, could ſtruggle with ſuch an antagoniſt; eſpecially when the high way was ſo obſtructed that they could not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their proviſions to market to procure them caſh. The truth is, that though they were
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030051_0144_0FE416E0D25CAB18"/>
ſerved <hi>gratis</hi> by their prime counſellor, yet they were obliged to give promiſſory notes to the attornies, ſcriveners, bailiffs, and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, whom they employed under him; but as the proſpect of payment was diſtant, the notes paſſed at a diſcount, and the only remedy in their power was to iſſue <hi>more,</hi> which inſtead of leſſening increaſed the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</p>
               <p>THEY had early foreſeen this difficulty, and applied privately to Mr. Lewis, Mr. Frog, and Lord Strut, to borrow money on intereſt. Theſe old curmudgeons, though each of them looked with an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eye on Mr. Bull, and ſecretly wiſhed he might loſe the cauſe, yet were induced by various conſiderations to evade the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion propoſed to them by the foreſters. "We muſt, ſaid they, keep up appearances with our old neighbour; we have accounts open with him, as well as claims upon ſome portions of land, to which our title is no better than his; we may draw ourſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſcrape, and ſet our own tenants a bad
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030051_0145_0FE416E27B11E320"/>
example, for who knows but the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments may avail with them to refuſe their rents to us? Beſides, how do we know whether theſe fellows will ever be able to pay? They offer to mortgage the manor to us, but the title is yet in diſpute, and how do we know whether it be their's or Mr. Bull's?" Theſe were the ſecret reaſons which induced them to evade a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect anſwer to the meſſengers; and, like true courtiers, "To ſqueeze their hands, and beg them come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow."</p>
               <p>BUT as ſoon as the verdict was given at <hi>Saratoga hall,</hi> they began to change their mind, and wiſhed not only to make them debtors, but even to enter into contracts to a large amount.</p>
               <p>MR. Lewis was the firſt to make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and meeting the meſſengers one day on 'change, he accoſted them thus: "Your ſervant, gentlemen—I congratulate you on your ſucceſs; you are welcome to my houſe,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:030051_0146_0FE416E4759FE3D8"/>
and ware-houſe, and table. I will lend you a few livres to help you to finiſh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy; and if Mr. Frog will advance a few ſtivers, I will give him my bond for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Beſides, I will conſent that my own counſellors, barriſters, and attornies, whom I have retained, ſhall aſſiſt you at the next ſeſſion, and I will ſee if I cannot open the high way, that you may bring your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to market. When you ſee Lord Strut, give my compliments to him, and tell him what I have promiſed, and I dare ſay he will, out of friendſhip to <hi>me,</hi> and for the ſake of our old <hi>family compact,</hi> give you ſome aſſiſtance; for look ye, gentlemen, I will be honeſt with you, I mean to promote <hi>my own</hi> intereſt by ſerving you, and I am ſure he has the ſame meaning.</p>
               <p>THIS change in the ſentiments and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Mr. Lewis, was immediately made known to Mr. Bull, by means of ſome run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning footmen, who frequently carried news from one houſe to the other. Conſternation ſeized the whole family, and Mrs. Bull her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030051_0147_0FE416E66E2B9868"/>
began to think it a very ſerious matter, and that it was neceſſary to do ſomething immediately to prevent worſe conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. She therefore held a <hi>curtain</hi> confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with Mr. Bull on the ſubject, thus—</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, my dear, what do you think of the conduct of your neighbour Lewis?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. B.</speaker>
                  <p>Why I think he is a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dog, and means to ruin me. If theſe fellows get him for their friend, he will draw in Lord Strut and Nic Frog, and I ſhall have them all to contend with at once; and therefore I think we had better compromiſe the matter with the tenants, and let them take the land, if they will, and go to the D-v-l; why ſhould I keep on throwing away good money after bad; I am over head and ears in debt now, and I wiſh to ſtop where I am, without getting any deeper into the law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
                  <p>I agree with you, my dear, that he is a deceitful dog, and I wiſh the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030051_0148_0FE416EA32DA2488"/>
tenants could know his true character: if they did, I am perſuaded they would not put any confidence in him. There is a number of very ſenſible perſons among them, and by the diſcourſe which I have had with ſome who know their ſecrets, I believe that means might yet be found to <hi>divide</hi> them, and to <hi>detach</hi> them from the intereſt of Lewis; and if you will let me manage the matter, I have no doubt that I ſhall be able to accompliſh it.</p>
                  <p>POOR John fetched a deep ſigh, and ſaid <hi>inwardly</hi>—Ah, I have let you manage my matters ſo long, that you have almoſt brought me to ruin! Then raiſing his voice and wiping his eyes, he replied, Well, my dear, I have told you <hi>my</hi> mind plainly, but if you think you can do any thing to ſave me, pray be ſpeedy; I would gladly keep the tenants attached to me for the benefit of their trade, which is a matter of more conſequence than their rent, and if I ſhould finally loſe the land, I wiſh to be again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with them in buſineſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="150" facs="unknown:030051_0149_0FE416EBDF1CB0F0"/>
                  <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
                  <p>Never fear, I do not doubt but we ſhall find means to keep the land and have the trade too. I know how to ſweeten them and bring them to good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour again.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>AS ſoon as this conference was ended, ſhe wrote a billet in a very complaiſant ſtyle, but in a hand ſcarcely legible,<note n="*" place="bottom">1778.</note> and was in ſuch a hurry to ſend it, that ſhe could not wait for one of the clerks to copy it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Mr. and Mrs. Bull's compliments to the gentlemen tenants, informing them that it was not intended to trouble them any farther for the payment of paper and pack-thread, which had been the occaſion of the controverſy; but to ſettle all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by a reference, and that ſuitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould ſoon be deputed to confer with them, or any of them on the premiſes. This billet was hurried away by an expreſs, and actually arrived before the foreſters had heard of Mr. Lewis's intended kindneſs to them. But they received it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030051_0150_0FE416EDD7CEDD28"/>
and gave no other anſwer to it than this, "Let Mr. Bull withdraw his action and clear the road, and we will talk with <hi>him;</hi> but as to <hi>his wife,</hi> we will have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do with <hi>her.</hi>"</p>
               <p>AFTER they had given this anſwer, word was brought them of the good will of Mr. Lewis, which was received with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joy imaginable. He was accounted the fineſt gentleman in the whole country, and all the ſtories which they had heard of him, through the medium of Bull's family, were ſet down as lies. He was regarded as the protector of the injured, the helper of the diſtreſſed, and the friend of the rights of mankind.</p>
               <p>WHILE the praiſes of Lewis were thus echoed from houſe to houſe, the deputies of Madam Bull arrived. They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by her ladyſhip to enter into free converſation with the foreſters, or any of them, publickly or privately; to tell them that they were greatly deceived if they took
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030051_0151_0FE416EF85CF4A18"/>
Mr. Lewis for their friend; that he was an arch, ſly, deceitful fellow, and that no truſt ought to be put in him; that Mr. and Mrs. Bull were very amicably diſpoſed toward them, and willing to forget and forgive all that was paſt, to renew the former intercourſe, to take off all the charges and burdens which had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of; to help them to pay the debt which they had incurred by the law-ſuit; and as the greateſt proof imaginable of Mrs. Bull's particular favour to them, ſhe would admit any of them to viſit her in her own drawing-room, and give them a ſeat at her card-table. As a token of her ſincerity in theſe profeſſions, ſhe ſent ſeveral preſents to their wives and daughters, and gave the deputies a large purſe of money, to be diſtributed <hi>privately</hi> among the moſt influential perſons in the ſeveral families.</p>
               <p>THE deputies had ſcarcely alighted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſent their footman to the door of the houſe where the heads of the families were aſſembled, with a meſſage of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030051_0152_0FE416F3623FF1C0"/>
to announce their arrival, and aſk permiſſion to make a friendly viſit. The porter refuſed entrance to the footman, and he returned, without having delivered his meſſage. The deputies then wrote the purport of their errand, and ſent it to the porter, who delivered it, and the following anſwer was returned—

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>NOTHING could exceed the rage into which Mrs. Bull was thrown by this diſappointment. "O theſe curſed, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, ungrateful, diſobedient wretches, to refuſe all my invitations, and ſpurn at my offers of friendſhip and reconciliation!
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030051_0155_0FE416F739FE5FE0"/>
What, not admit my deputies into their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes! Did ever any woman ſuffer ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace? Well, faith, I will be revenged, and they ſhall feel the power of my vengeance. I will proſecute them, to the utmoſt extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the law; ay, and beyond law too, for I will ſet their houſes on fire over their heads, and drive them off the land! And as to that deceitful dog of a Lewis, I will raiſe ſuch a hornet's neſt about his ears, that he ſhall repent his bargain! If Lord Strut attempts to help him, I'll lay an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment upon his richeſt farms. And as for Nic Frog, if he lends them money, I will break up his ware-houſe, and fell all his goods by auction. I will ſatiate my vengeance on the whole pack of them, and if I fall myſelf among the general wreck, I ſhall have the glory of dying like Samſon in the ruin of my enemies."</p>
               <p>THE rage which Mrs. Bull indulged on this occaſion, and the noiſe which ſhe made in her raving fits, raiſed a great alarm in the family, and as hyſterics are ſaid to be
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030051_0156_0FE416F9365A1000"/>
catching, ſo the diſtemper ſpread into the two next families, viz. into thoſe of ſiſter Peg and brother Patrick. The former imagined that it was Mr. Bull's intention to call in Lord Peter to his aid, becauſe he had been of late ſomewhat complaiſant to thoſe of his natural children, who reſided in the family; and the latter expected that he ſhould be treated in the ſame manner as the foreſters, becauſe he had complained of ſome reſtraints and impoſitions from his brother John Bull, in reſpect to his trade and buſineſs, which was that of a linen-draper. Old jealouſies and grudges were revived on this occaſion, and the whole neighbourhood was in confuſion. The dogs in Peg's family kept a conſtant howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and barking, and were anſwered by thoſe of Mr. Bull. Several of them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ran mad,<note n="*" place="bottom">Proteſtant aſſociation, 1779 and 1780.</note> and Bull was obliged to place guards at his doors and gates, who attacked the curs with clubs, and killed ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral on the ſpot. In the midſt of this hurly burly, his houſe was ſet on fire, and was
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030051_0157_0FE416FCD34891B8"/>
actually ſeen blazing in thirty-ſix places at once;<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord G. Gordon's mob.</note> the fire even penetrated Madam's drawing-room, and her card party were obliged to hand buckets and pump the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and it was not without the greateſt exertions that the whole manſion was ſaved from utter deſtruction.</p>
               <p>A DIFFICULTY alſo aroſe from another quarter, where it was little expected. The meaſure which Mr. Bull had adopted of ſtopping the high way, and ſearching all carriages, provoked all the neighbours, who thought it a great infringement of their common rights; but as he was a perſon of ſo much wealth and power, they were afraid openly to conteſt that point with him. At length an elderly widow lady, of large property, with whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lived on friendly terms, and who gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally went by the name of Madam <hi>Kate,</hi> took the liberty to tell him, that ſhe could no longer ſuffer her neighbours and herſelf to be ſo impoſed upon; that the high way
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:030051_0158_0FE416FE79E41D38"/>
was common to all; that he had no right to ſtop paſſengers and examine them, but that every body ought to go about their lawful buſineſs without let or hindrance, and that ſhe was determined to form a combination<note n="*" place="bottom">Armed neutrality formed by the Empreſs of Ruſſia, &amp;c.</note> with Mr. Frog, Mr. Lewis, Lord Strut, and all the other neighbours, to remove the incumbrances which Mr. Bull had thrown in the way, and clear the paſſage.</p>
               <p>THIS combination extended to other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, beſides clearing the high way. They were all diſpoſed to help the foreſters againſt Mr. Bull, though in different ways. Lewis had already lent them money and feed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers to plead for them. Lord Strut, though rich in landed intereſt, yet generally antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated his revenues, (or as the vulgar phraſe is, ate the calf in the cow's belly) he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had no money to ſpare; but to oblige his friend Lewis, he laid an attachment on a ſoutherly corner of the foreſt, which for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030051_0159_0FE41700728D0658"/>
belonged to him, and which from the numerous flowers with which it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, had got the name of <hi>Terra Florida.</hi> At the ſame time he attached one of Mr. Bull's favourite hunting-ſeats,<note n="*" place="bottom">Gibraltar.</note> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an extenſive proſpect, and was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate extremely convenient for hunting, fowling, and fiſhing. It had formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Strut, but he had fooliſhly loſt it by ſtaking it in a game of <hi>whilſt,</hi> which he played with Mr. Bull. It was a doubt in law whether real eſtate could be held by ſuch tenure, but Bull had <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> and that you know is eleven points of the law. At any rate, it would oblige Bull to defend; and that would coſt him money, and divert ſome at leaſt of his lawyers from the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the foreſt.</p>
               <p>A SECRET correſpondence had for ſome time been carried on between the foreſters and Mr. Frog, for a loan of caſh, and a mercantile contract. Bull had ſuſpected it, but could not prove it, till one night,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:030051_0160_0FE41702208F9628"/>
his myrmidons caught a meſſenger from the foreſt and ſearched his pockets,<note n="*" place="bottom">Capture of Mr. Laurens.</note> in which were found certain letters and other papers, which were ſuppoſed to amount to full evidence.</p>
               <p>UPON this occaſion an advertiſement was publiſhed, according to faſhion, juſtifying the meaſures about to be taken, and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the evils which were connected with them. However ſmall a ſhare of credit theſe publications obtain, it is generally as much as they deſerve.</p>
               <p>TO make ſhort work with Frog, Mr. Bull got a ſearch-warrant, and ſent a bailiff to his richeſt ware-houſe,<note n="†" place="bottom">St. Euſtatius.</note> who entered it, <hi>per fas aut nefas,</hi> tumbled over the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, under pretence of ſearching for ſtolen goods; and having taken away as many as he pleaſed, by a writ of <hi>venditioni exponas,</hi> he put them up at auction, and it is ſaid, made a fortune by this job. Mr.
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030051_0161_0FE41706594613D8"/>
Lewis was ſo exaſperated at the outrage thus committed on his friend Frog, that by a writ of <hi>ſcire facias,</hi> he laid claim to the ware-houſe and its contents, and brought in Bull for damages.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Mr. Bull now found himſelf ſouſed over head and ears in that deep ditch, the law. Like Iſhmael of old, his hand was againſt every man, and every man's hand againſt him. Look which way ſoever he would, he found enemies, and his own family were continually buzzing in his ears, that he would bring his affairs to ruin.</p>
               <p>BY the aſſiſtance derived from the loans which they had negociated with Lewis and Frog, and the additional counſellors and attornies which Lewis employed for them, the foreſters purſued the controverſy with as much vigour as the forms, delays and uncertainty of the law would permit. No leſs than four years longer were conſumed in this expenſive quarrel, and Mr. Bull's
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:030051_0162_0FE41708062D7778"/>
numerous retinue of lawyers were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in the various chicanery and tergiverſations of their profeſſion, all the while fattening on the profits of the ſuit; whilſt his debt was growing at ſuch a rate, that he was at his wit's end to keep the intereſt from accumulating as well as the principal. At length, by a capital manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre of Pipeweed's grandſon George, aided by the counſellors of Lewis, the cauſe was brought to a hearing at <hi>York</hi> court, and the arguments were of ſuch efficacy, that a <hi>ſecond verdict</hi> was given in favour of the foreſters, with large damages. This ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict came ſo near to a final deciſion, that all Mr. Bull's friends were convinced he could no longer maintain an action againſt the foreſters; and ſome truſty old ſervants ventured to whiſper in Madam's ear that it was high time to end the controverſy, for that it could not poſſibly be carried any farther, without bringing the family and the trade to total ruin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="unknown:030051_0163_0FE4170A0082C878"/>"LOOK ye, Madam, (ſaid they) how all the ſchemes which you have laid, have been uniformly defeated; you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to know the family <hi>ſecrets</hi> of theſe foreſters; but thoſe fellows who pretended to give you this information have deceived you. In fact, they have no ſuch ſecrets as your ladyſhip imagines. What has been <hi>openly</hi> told you all along, is the truth, and you ought long ago to have believed it. Now the conviction has forced itſelf upon you, and you can no longer withſtand it. The foreſters have been defending their title in the law, and they have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo plainly, that no jury in the world will ever give a verdict againſt them. All who are acquainted with new lands, know that the labour attending the improvement of them, is worth ten times more than the land; and in fact gives the beſt title to it. If our maſter will now end the matter by a compromiſe, he may yet ſave ſome part of the manor at the northward, where is the beſt of hunting and fiſhing; but if he
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:030051_0164_0FE4170BA8AA6298"/>
purſues the matter any farther, he will loſe it all."</p>
               <p>THESE faithful remonſtrances, enforced by the neceſſity of the caſe, began to have ſome effect on the turbulent mind of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. She ſaw that it was in vain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt the opinions of all mankind, and therefore in her next curtain lecture ſhe held a ſhort dialogue with Mr. Bull, thus—</p>

               <p>WHEN Mr. Bull had taken the matter into conſideration, he thought it beſt to wait the iſſue of the ſuit with Lord Strut about the hunting-ſeat, for he was loth to loſe that; and happily for him, when that cauſe came to trial, it was argued ſo forcibly by his lawyers, that Strut was obliged to give it up. As ſoon as Bull heard of that, he cried out, "Now is the moment of victory —now is the time for peace." So calling one of his clerks, "Here, ſays he, go and ſettle the matter with the foreſters, or their deputies, on the beſt terms that you can."
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:030051_0167_0FE4171346F697C0"/>
The deputies and the clerk ſoon came to an agreement, and a quit-claim deed was drawn, deſcribing the butts and bounds of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and diſtinguiſhing what he gave up to them from what he retained. This quit-claim being properly engroſſed, he with a trembling hand and aching heart ſubſcribed it, while Madam, ſtanding behind him, could not help ſhedding a tear at the ſight of a tranſaction to which ſhe would never have conſented but from dire neceſſity.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I WAS loth to break the thread of my narration in my former letters, and you know that we prattling folks love to tell our ſtories in our own way, which we are under great advantage to do when we are writing letters. But I will now go back to tell you ſomething of the manner in which the foreſters managed their domeſtic affairs during the controverſy with Mr. Bull, and for ſome time after it was cloſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="unknown:030051_0169_0FE41719A52B55C8"/>WHEN they had broken their connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with him, it was uncertain what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions they might form abroad, but it was judged expedient for them to be united a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, that no one family ſhould connect itſelf in trade with any merchant or factor, without the conſent of the others. In ſhort, it became neceſſary for them to enter into a partnerſhip for their mutual intereſt and convenience. To do this was a nice point, and required much delicacy. It was to them a new ſubject, and they had an untrodden path before them. After much conſultation and inquiry, their inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity ſuggeſted to them the idea of an original ſocial compact. "Why ſhould we (ſaid they) look abroad for precedents, when we have enough among ourſelves? See the <hi>beavers</hi> in our own brooks and meadows, how they work in complete partnerſhip, each family has its own cell, and a number of cells are placed in one pond. They carry on their operations with peace and unanimity, without even the appearance of a <hi>maſter.</hi> Here is a perfect republic, a
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:030051_0170_0FE4171B615274E0"/>
complete equality, a ſtriking example of order without ſubordination, of liberty without jealouſy, of induſtry without coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, of economy without parſimony, of ſagacity without overbearing influence. Every one knows his own buſineſs and does it, their labour goes on with regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and decency; their united efforts ſerve the common cauſe, and the intereſt of every one is involved in that of the whole. Let us go and do likewiſe." The hint took, and a plan of CONFEDERATION, as it was called, was drawn up on principles of the pureſt equality; each family retaining the entire control of its own domeſtic concerns, without any interference of the others, and agreeing to contribute <hi>voluntarily</hi> its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of labour and money to ſupport the common intereſt.</p>
               <p>THIS was, in theory, a very pretty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, exactly ſuited to a ſet of people who thought themſelves completely virtuous. But as it often happens that great ingenuity exiſts without much judgment or policy,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:030051_0171_0FE4171D5DB37460"/>
ſo it proved here. Theſe foreſters did not conſider that their intellects were not, like thoſe of the beavers, confined to a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular objects; that they were not, like the beavers, void of paſſions and prejudices, void of ambition, jealouſy, avarice and ſelf-intereſt. With all the infirmities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, they were expecting to eſtabliſh a community on a plan ſimilar to that in which no ſuch deformities can poſſibly find admittance.</p>
               <p>THOUGH for a while, and during the period of the law-ſuit, when common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger impelled them to keep themſelves cloſe together, this plan anſwered the end better than none; yet <hi>in fact</hi> the notion of <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence</hi> had ſo intoxicated their minds, that having caſt off their dependence on Mr. Bull, they thought themſelves inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of all the world beſide. When they had got entirely clear of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with him, they were in the condition of a young heir juſt come of age, who feels proud of his freedom, and thinks he
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:030051_0172_0FE4171F073E4F20"/>
has a right to act without control. Each family felt its own importance, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a degree of reſpect from the others, in proportion to its numbers, its property, its exertions, its <hi>antiquity,</hi> and other trifling conſiderations, which ought never to have had any place in a partnerſhip of complete equality; and in conſequence of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicating idea of independence, each fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily claimed the right of giving or withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its conſent to what was propoſed by any or all of the others.</p>
               <p>IN the club room, among a number of ingenious devices, there was a clock, of a moſt curious and intricate conſtruction, by which all the common concerns of the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip were to be regulated. It had <hi>one</hi> bell, on which <hi>thirteen</hi> diſtinct hammers ſtruck the hours. Each hammer was moved by independent wheels and weights, each ſet of wheels and weights was incloſed in a ſeparate caſe, the key of which was kept, not as it ought to have been, by the perſon who repreſented the family at club, but in
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030051_0173_0FE41722CEB434B8"/>
each manſion houſe; and every family claimed a right either to keep the key at home or ſend it to club, when and by whom they pleaſed. Now as this clock, like all other automatons, needed frequently to be wound up, to be oiled and cleaned, a very nice and particular adjuſtment of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances was neceſſary to preſerve the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of its motions, and make the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers perform their functions with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Sometimes one or two of the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers would be out of order, and when it came to the turn of one to ſtrike it would be ſilent; then there muſt be a running or ſending home for the key, and the houſes being at a conſiderable diſtance, much time was ſpent in waiting. Sometimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the meſſenger arrived at an unſeaſonable hour, when the family was aſleep, or abroad in the fields, and it would take up a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time to collect them, and lay the caſe before them, that they might deliberate and determine whether the key ſhould be ſent or not; and before this could be done, the clock would get more out of order.
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:030051_0174_0FE417248B4DE008"/>
By this means, the club was frequently perplexed; they knew neither the hour of the day, nor the day of the month; they could not date their letters, nor adjuſt their books, nor do buſineſs with any regularity.</p>
               <p>BESIDES this, there was another inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. For though they had a ſtrong-box, yet it was filled with nothing but bills of parcels, and accounts preſented for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contracts of loans, and indentures for ſervices. No money could be had from any of the families, but by their own vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary conſent; and to gain this conſent there was great difficulty. Some had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced what they ſuppoſed to be more than their proportion; others had paid leſs. The former would give no more, till the latter had made up their quotas, and there was no authority which could call any one to account, or make him do his duty. Their whole eſtates were mortgaged for the money which they had borrowed of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Frog; and yet they could carry on no buſineſs in partnerſhip.
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030051_0175_0FE4172688A82FC0"/>
In fact they had formed ſuch an unheard of kind of partnerſhip, that though they could run themſelves in debt, yet they could not oblige one another to raiſe any money to diſcharge their debts.</p>
               <p>EACH family, however, carried on a ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arate trade, and they contrived to underſell each other, both at home and at market. Each family alſo had a ſeparate debt, which ſome were providing means to diſcharge, and others neglected. In one or two of the families they went to loggerheads among themſelves. John Codline's family was, for ſeveral days, a ſcene of confuſion and diſorder; nothing was ſeen or heard, but curſing and calling names, kicking ſhins and pulling noſes. John at firſt tried to ſilence them by gentle means, but finding theſe ineffectual, he at length drew his hanger, and ſwore he would cut off the ears of the firſt that ſhould dare to make any more noiſe. This threatening drove two or three turbulent fellows out of doors, after which the houſe was tolerably quiet.
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:030051_0176_0FE4172831FB9BC8"/>
Something of the ſame kind happened in Robert Lumber's family, but he made ſo good a uſe of his fiſt as quelled the diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at once.</p>
               <p>IN the family of Roger Carrier there ſeemed to be a predominant lurch for knavery, for he publickly advertiſed that he was ready to pay his debts by notes of hand, ſubject to a diſcount, the amount of which was indefinite, becauſe continually increaſing; and that whoever did not take his pay, when thus offered, might go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. The other families were alarmed at his conduct; but had no power to oblige him to deal honeſtly, and he carried his roguery ſo far, as to bid them all defiance.</p>
               <p>IN this ſtate of debility and diſtraction, it became neceſſary to conſult on ſome meaſures for a better plan of union. They began to be convinced that they were not <hi>beavers,</hi> nor capable of ſubſiſting in ſuch a ſtate of ſociety as had been adopted from them. Something more energetic was
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:030051_0177_0FE4172C1A85EEA8"/>
wanted to compel the lazy, to check the knaviſh, to direct the induſtrious, and to keep the honeſt from being impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It had been often in contemplation to amend the mode of partnerſhip; but now the diſorders in ſome of the families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo alarming, that though they had been quelled for the preſent, it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether they would not break out again, eſpecially as one whole family ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed determined openly to patronize roguery. Theſe conſiderations ſerved to haſten the change which had been contemplated. It was accordingly moved in the club, that each family ſhould appoint one or more perſons to meet together, and conſult upon ſome alterations and improvements in the partnerſhip. This meeting was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held, and the reſult of it ſhall be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my next letter.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is not in my power to give you a particular detail of the whole proceedings of the meeting, which was held to reform the plan of partnerſhip, in the manner of your parliamentary journaliſts, who make ſpeeches for the members, perhaps better than ſome of them make for themſelves; but I will endeavour to give you a ſummary
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:030051_0179_0FE4172FBA57D250"/>
of the principles on which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>THE profeſſed deſign of the meeting was to reform and amend the plan; but in fact when they came to examine it, they found themſelves obliged to paſs the ſame ſentence on it that was once delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the famous poet Alexander Pope, whoſe uſual ejaculation was <hi>God mend me!</hi> "Mend you," ſaid a hackney coachman, (looking with contempt on his dwarfiſh form and hump back) "it would not be half ſo much trouble to make a new one."</p>
               <p>A NEW one was accordingly entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the fundamental principle of it was, not to ſuppoſe men as good as they ought to be, but to take them as they are. "It is true" ſaid they, "that all men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally free and equal; it is a very good idea, and ought to be underſtood in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and partnerſhip which can be formed; it may ſerve as a check upon ambition and other human paſſions, and put people in mind that they may ſome time or other be
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030051_0180_0FE4173164F37518"/>
called to account by their equals. But it is as true that this equality is deſtroyed by a thouſand cauſes which exiſt in nature and in ſociety. It is true that all beaſts, birds, and fiſhes are naturally free and equal in ſome reſpects, but yet we find them unequal in other reſpects, and one becomes the prey of another. There is, and always will be, a ſuperiority and an inferiority, in ſpite of all the ſyſtems of metaphyſics that ever exiſted. How can you prevent one man from being ſtronger, or wiſer, or richer than another? and will not the ſtrong overcome the weak? will not the cunning circumvent the fooliſh? and will not the borrower become ſervant to the lender? Is not this noble, free and independent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture man, neceſſarily ſubject to lords of his own ſpecies in every ſtage of his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? When a child, is he not under the command of his parents? Send him to ſchool, place him out as an apprentice, put him on board a ſhip, enrol him in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of militia, muſt he not be ſubject to a maſter? Place him in any kind of ſociety
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030051_0181_0FE417357155AB50"/>
whatever, and he has wants to be ſupplied, and paſſions to be ſubdued; his active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers need to be directed, and his extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be controlled, and if he will not do it himſelf, ſomebody muſt do it for him. Self government is indeed the moſt perfect form of government in the world; but if men will not govern themſelves, they muſt have ſome governors appointed over them, who will keep them in order, and make them do their duty. Now if there is in fact ſuch an inequality exiſting among us, why ſhould we act as if no ſuch thing exiſted? We have tried the <hi>beaver</hi> ſcheme of partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip long enough, and find it will not do. Let us then adopt the practice of another kind of induſtrious animals which we have among us—Let us imitate the <hi>bees,</hi> who are governed by one ſupreme head, and, under that direction, conduct their whole econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with perfect order and regularity."</p>
               <p>ON this principle they drew up an entire new plan, in which there was one chief ſteward, who was to manage their united
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030051_0182_0FE417371E1DCB08"/>
intereſt, and be reſponſible to the whole for his conduct. He was to have a kind of council to adviſe and direct him, and ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral inferior officers to aſſiſt him, as there might be occaſion; and a certain contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to be levied on the trade, or on the eſtates of the whole, which was to make a common ſtock for the ſupport of the common intereſt; and they were to erect a tribunal among themſelves, which ſhould decide and determine all differences. If nine of the families ſhould agree to this plan, it was to take place; and the others might or might not adopt it; but if any one ſhould finally refuſe, or if any ſhould adopt it and afterward fall from it, he was to be looked upon as an outcaſt, and no perſon was to have any connexion with him.</p>
               <p>THE meeting having continued a long time, every body became extremely anxious to know what they were about; the doors were kept ſhut, and no perſon whatever was let into the ſecret till the whole was
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:030051_0183_0FE41738CCCDF828"/>
completed. A copy was then ſent to each family, for them to conſider at their leiſure.</p>
               <p>THOUGH curioſity was now gratified, yet anxiety was not relaxed. The new plan of partnerſhip went by the name of <hi>the fiddle;</hi> thoſe who were in favour of it call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves <hi>fiddlers,</hi> and thoſe who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it were ſtyled <hi>antifiddlers.</hi> The former ſaid it was the beſt plan that human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had ever contrived. The latter imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined it "pregnant with miſchief." The former compared it to a ſtrong fence about a rich field of wheat. The latter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it to the whale that ſwallowed up Jonah.</p>
               <p>IN each family a conſultation was held on the queſtion, Whether it ſhould be adopted or not? and liberty was given for every one to ſpeak his mind with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt freedom. The objections, anſwers, replies, rejoinders, and rebutters, which were produced on this occaſion, would make a curious collection, and form an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:030051_0184_0FE4173AC66ADA50"/>
page in the hiſtory of man. The <hi>fiddlers</hi> were extremely fond of having it examined, becauſe they ſaid it was like a rich piece of plate, which the more it be rubbed ſhines the brighter. The <hi>antifiddlers</hi> ſaid it was like a worm-eaten bottom of a ſhip, the defects of which would more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, the more it was ripped to pieces; they were therefore for rejecting it at once, without any examination at all.</p>
               <p>WHEN they were urged to point out its defects, they would ſay, "It is dangerous to put ſo much power into the hands of any man, or ſet of men, leſt they ſhould abuſe it. Our liberty and property will be ſafe whilſt we keep them ourſelves, but when we have once parted with them, we may never be able to get them back again."</p>
               <p>IF the plan was compared to a <hi>houſe,</hi> then the objection would be made againſt build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too high, leſt the wind ſhould blow it down. How ſhall we guard it againſt fire? how ſhall we ſecure it againſt rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030051_0185_0FE4173EF29C7B60"/>
and how ſhall we keep out rats and mice?</p>
               <p>IF it was likened to a <hi>ſhip,</hi> then it would be aſked, how ſhall we guard it againſt leak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? how ſhall we prevent it from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on the rocks and quickſands?</p>
               <p>SOMETIMES it would be compared to a <hi>clock,</hi> then the queſtion was, how ſhall we ſecure the pendulum, the wheels and the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from ruſt? who ſhall keep the key, and who ſhall we truſt to wind it up?</p>
               <p>SOMETIMES it was repreſented by a <hi>purſe,</hi> and then it was ſaid to be dangerous to let any one hold the ſtrings. Money is a tempting object, and the beſt men are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be corrupted.</p>
               <p>IN ſhort, the whole of the arguments againſt it might be ſummed up in one word —JEALOUSY; which is well known to be the higheſt degree of republican virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:030051_0186_0FE41740A10EA580"/>TO ſhew the futility of theſe arguments, it was obſerved by the oppoſite party, that it was impoſſible to put it into any man's power to do you good, without at the ſame time putting it into his power to do you hurt. If you truſt a barber to ſhave your beard, you put it into his power to cut your throat. If you truſt a baker to make your bread, or a cook to dreſs your meat, you put it into the power of each to poiſon you; nay, if you venture to lie in the ſame bed with your wife, you put it into her power to choak you when you are aſleep. Shall we therefore let our beards grow till they are long enough to put into our pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, becauſe we are afraid of the barber? ſhall we ſtarve ourſelves becauſe the baker and the cook <hi>may</hi> poiſon us? and ſhall we be afraid to go to bed with our wives? Fie, fie, gentlemen, do not indulge ſuch whims: Be careful in the choice of your barbers, your bakers, your cooks, and your wives; pay them well, and treat them well, and make it their <hi>intereſt</hi> to treat you well, and you need not fear them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="unknown:030051_0187_0FE41742A7806188"/>AFTER much debate and diſcuſſion, ſome of the families adopted it without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in others, the oppoſition was ſo ſtrong that it could not be made to paſs, but by the help of certain <hi>amendments,</hi> which were propoſed; and of theſe amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments every family which thought proper to make any, made as many as they pleaſed. The new plan with its appendage of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cut ſuch a groteſque figure, that a certain wag in one of the families, like Jotham the ſon of Gideon, ridiculed it in the following fable.</p>
               <p>"A CERTAIN man hired a taylor to make him a pair of <hi>ſmall clothes;</hi> the taylor meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured him and made the garment. When he had brought it home, the man turned and twiſted and viewed it on all ſides; it is too ſmall here, ſaid he, and wants to be let out; it is too big here, and wants to be taken in; I am afraid there will be a hole here, and you muſt put on a patch; this button is not ſtrong enough, you muſt ſet on another. He was going on in this
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030051_0188_0FE417445522CFF8"/>
manner, when his wife overhearing him, ſaid, have you put on the ſmall clothes, my dear? No, ſaid he. How then, replied ſhe, can you poſſibly tell whether they will fit you or not? If I had made ſuch objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a gown or a pair of ſtays before I had put them on, how would you have laughed at my <hi>female</hi> wiſdom? The man took his wife's advice, and ſaved the taylor a deal of trouble."</p>
               <p>IN like manner, the new plan of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip was <hi>tried on,</hi> and was found to fit very well. The amendments were thrown by, for future conſideration; ſome of them have been ſince adopted, but they are ſo few and ſo trifling, as to make no eſſential difference.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as a ſufficient number of the families had adopted the plan, they began to ſet it in operation; and unanimouſly choſe for their High Steward and manager, GEORGE, the grandſon of Walter Pipeweed. He had ſerved them ſo faithfully and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030051_0189_0FE4176E2E782DE0"/>
in conducting the law-ſuit againſt Mr. Bull, that no perſon was higher in their confidence. As he would take no reward for his former ſervices; ſo he began this new buſineſs with a declaration of the ſame kind, and a proteſtation that nothing could have induced him to quit the ſweets of retirement for the toils of public buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but a diſpoſition to oblige his numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friends who had united their ſuffrages in his favour. Every one who knows him is fully convinced of the ſincerity of his declarations, and he has perhaps as large a ſhare of the eſteem and affection of the people in theſe families, as any perſon ever could expect from a courſe of faithful and friendly offices.</p>
               <p>BESIDES him there is an under ſteward, a council of advice, a chief clerk, a caſhier, and a maſter of the hounds. The under ſteward is a perſon of a grave deportment, much reading and ſtrict integrity; he has written a large and valuable treatiſe on family government, and was largely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030051_0190_0FE4176C36C64EF0"/>
in effecting the compromiſe with Mr. Bull. The council of advice are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from the ſeveral families, and conſiſt of perſons of the beſt education, abilities, and popularity. The chief clerk has the care of the moſt important papers, and the caſhier keeps the key of the ſtrong-box, which <hi>now</hi> has ſomething in it beſides pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. By his advice the debts of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany are put into a fair way of being paid, though ſome grumbling ſtill ſubſiſts among thoſe who were obliged to ſell their notes at a diſcount. The maſter of the hounds is an officer, who it was at firſt thought would have very little buſineſs; but as the wild beaſts of the foreſt have of late grown very troubleſome, it is ſuppoſed that he will have his hands full. There is too much of a lurch for hunting among many of the foreſters; and ſome have not been aſhamed to expreſs their wiſhes that the whole race of wild creatures was exterminated from the face of the earth. There are others who ſtill continue of the mind, that theſe animals are a degenerated part of the <hi>human</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:030051_0191_0FE41773093FB0E8"/>
ſpecies, and might yet be recovered if prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per methods were uſed to tame them; but it is greatly feared, that while the rage for hunting continues, all ſuch benevolent projects will fail in the execution.</p>
               <p>IN ſome late hunting matches, theſe wild animals diſcovered ſo much art and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that ſeveral of the hunters were laid to ſleep in the bed of honour; and the reſt were obliged to take to their heels, that they might "live to hunt another day." Some perſons are of the mind that it is not beſt to ſeek theſe beaſts in their dens, but rather to guard the fields and take care of the poultry at home. Others are for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing them to the thickeſt ſhades of the foreſt, and this ſeems at preſent to be the prevailing opinion. What the ſucceſs of it will be, time muſt determine.</p>
               <p>SINCE the new partnerſhip has been eſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tabliſhed, huſbandry and trade have been carried on briſkly; the houſes are full of good things, and the children are well clad
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:030051_0192_0FE41774B4200E20"/>
and healthy; but there is one inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which uſually attends a full houſe, and that is, that <hi>rats</hi> are very numerous, and a <hi>new ſpecies</hi> of them have lately found their way thither. Some of them are very fat and ſleek, and are not afraid to appear in open day light; though it is ſuppoſed they burrow under ground, and have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous communications from houſe to houſe. This is an inconvenience againſt which no remedy has yet been found; though ſome people, from their apparent <hi>voracity,</hi> are of the mind that they will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prey upon one another, or elſe eat till they burſt.</p>
               <p>I HAD almoſt forgot to tell you that two new families have lately been added to the number of partners. One is that of <hi>Ethan Greenwood,</hi> a ſtout, luſty fellow, born in the family of Robert Lumber, but married in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of Peter Bullfrog, from whom, after a long diſpute, he has got a good tract of land, which originally belonged to his own father, but was ſurreptitiouſly taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030051_0193_0FE41776643610B8"/>
of by his father-in-law. The other is <hi>Hunter Longknife</hi>; he was bred in the family of Walter Pipeweed, and has a large ſhare of his ſpirit of adventure. Having taken up his reſidence in the outſkirts of the foreſt, he has had many a ſcuffle with the wild beaſts, who are extremely fond of his green corn and young chickens, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they can get a taſte of them.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AFTER giving you ſuch a long detail of the affairs of theſe foreſters, I will cloſe my correſpondence, for the preſent, with a brief account of the ſituation of the principal perſons with whom they are or have been connected, and whom I have had occaſion to mention in my other letters.</p>
               <p>TO begin with Mr. Bull. Though he has given a quit-claim of that part of the foreſt where his old ſervants and beſt cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers have poſſeſſion, yet he retains the
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030051_0195_0FE4177CB7107368"/>
northern part, together with ſome hunting-ſeats which he <hi>promiſed</hi> to give up to the foreſters. The chief produce of this north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern territory is the furs, which are brought to his ware-houſe and wrought up by his tradeſmen. Notwithſtanding the loſs of his title to the lands of the foreſters, they have not wholly forſaken him as a trader. He keeps his fulling-mills at work, and ſupplies them with cloths of various kinds, but they feel themſelves at liberty either to purchaſe of him or his neighbours, or to manufacture for themſelves. He is rather more complaiſant to them in his own ſhop, than his factors are in ſome of his diſtant ware-houſes, where they are not allowed to carry their produce to market, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive coffee, cotton, and ſugar, as formerly. However, they have found out other places where they can buy theſe commodities without aſking his permiſſion. And as for that capital article TEA, which was the occaſion of beginning the controverſy, they now fetch it directly from the original ware-houſe of old <hi>Cang-hi,</hi> where it is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactured.
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:030051_0196_0FE4177E63156260"/>
They purchaſe their ſilks and muſlins of the firſt makers and dealers, and get their wines directly from the vineyards.</p>
               <p>I HAVE before told you that Mr. Bull formerly uſed to ſend the <hi>ordure</hi> made in his family to enrich the plantations of the foreſters; but ſince his quarrel with them, he has been ſomewhat at a loſs how to diſpoſe of it. At firſt he threw it into the gutter<note n="*" place="bottom">Convicts employed in lighters on the Thames.</note> before his door. But there was ſuch a large quantity of it, and the ſtench which it cauſed was ſo offenſive, that this expedient would not anſwer the end. He then thought of ſending it to a place where ſome of his family had been employed in <hi>botanizing,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Botany Bay, in New Holland.</note> in hope that by adding to the fertility of the ſoil, they would find more encouragement to proſecute their inquiries, and that he ſhould in time receive ſome rent or recompenſe. This ſcheme, like ſome others, the product of his fruitful brain, has been hitherto attended with more coſt
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:030051_0197_0FE3F1A522945B20"/>
than profit; yet it is ſtill perſiſted in, and great expectations are ſtill indulged.</p>
               <p>AS to his domeſtic affairs, his <hi>wife</hi> ſtill rules him according to her uſual maxims, and keeps up her gaming club, where ſhe wins and loſes alternately; but between the ſhop and the drawing-room, there is enough gained to pay the intereſt of his debt, though it is not imagined he will ever be able to pay the principal. This, like a millſtone about his neck, muſt finally ſink him.</p>
               <p>YOU may poſſibly be curious to know what is become of his <hi>mother,</hi> whom I have formerly mentioned to you as having had ſome ſway in his family. The truth is, that ſince he married his preſent wife, the old lady found her influence decreaſing and retired to her chamber, where ſhe has been for many years confined, and is now whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bed-rid. Mr. and Mrs. Bull, indeed treat the old lady with much decency, and ſuffer none to intrude upon her, but ſuch
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030051_0198_0FE417820C2BDC28"/>
company as ſhe is fond of. Old Madam has all the infirmities of age about her. She will not ſuffer herſelf to be touched nor turned in her bed; nor the room to be aired, nor her linen ſhifted. She keeps her window-ſhutters cloſed, and will not admit the leaſt ray of light in her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but what proceeds from her own candle, which having been once dipped in conſecrated water, is ſuppoſed to poſſeſs all the virtues of an everlaſting taper.</p>
               <p>NOW I have ſpoken of Madam's taper, perhaps you will be amuſed with ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. It is a wax candle of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſize, ſet in an old-faſhioned ſilver can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick richly emboſſed and gilt; but the ruſt and duſt of it are ſo ſacred, that it is never permitted to be ſcoured. The tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that this candleſtick formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to St. Peter, and the candle firſt placed in it, is ſuppoſed to have been light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the SUN, and by a myſterious kind of <hi>uninterrupted ſucceſſion,</hi> has been kept burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever ſince. By the light of this taper,
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030051_0199_0FE417869B3725D8"/>
old Madam reads her bible and books of devotion, which always lie on a table by her bed-ſide.</p>
               <p>SOME perſons of an incredulous turn of mind, have pretended to call in queſtion this myſtery; but it is ſtill held ſacred by the old lady, and by moſt of Mr. Bull's own family. There are ſome even among the foreſters of the ſame opinion; and ſuch is the liberality in theſe families, that no one is moleſted in the indulgence of any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent whim, which does not affect the peace of the families, nor the intereſt of the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip. It was not long after the re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of harmony between them and Mr. Bull, that theſe perſons ſent two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in one lantern, and one in another, to be lighted at this venerable taper, and dipt in the conſecrated water. Two of them were actually lighted in old Madam Bull's preſence, and to her great ſatisfaction. The third was lighted at a taper ſuppoſed to be derived from the ſame original, but "hid under a buſhel" in one of ſiſter Peg's out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:030051_0200_0FE417884DB06500"/>
it not being permitted to burn pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in her family, where the only candles allowed, are of the manufacture of Geneva.</p>
               <p>THERE has been as long a controverſy between different opinioniſts on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as between the ſectaries in Liliput, about breaking the egg at the big or little end. But it is eaſy enough to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the matter by granting that St. Peter's candle, as well as thoſe from Geneva, were originally lighted at the SUN; that the ſame ſource of light is open to all; and that it is of no conſequence of what materials tapers are made, nor in what kind of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks they are placed, nor by whoſe hands they are lighted, provided they <hi>give ſo clear a light as to anſwer the purpoſes of viſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT remains only that I give you ſome account of Mr. Lewis. The adventures in his family have been very ſingular. I formerly told you that he feed lawyers to plead the cauſe of the foreſters. Theſe
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:030051_0201_0FE41789F5C70B48"/>
ſubtile practitioners ſoon found that the ſame arguments which they were obliged to uſe in favour of the foreſters, would apply with equal propriety to the caſe of Mr. Lewis's own family. He had long been a widower, and the family was gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned by a ſucceſſion of kept miſtreſſes, who <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> only their pleaſures and the enriching of their own relations and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. The tenants were abuſed, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion houſe was dirty and out of repair, and though the rents were paid into the hands of the ſteward, yet much oppreſſion and embezzlement, and little economy, were the conſtant topics of complaint.</p>
               <p>AFTER the alteration, produced by the aſſiſtance of Lewis's lawyers in the foreſt, they began to think it was high time to do ſomething of the ſame kind at home. The only peaceable remedy which they could imagine, was to perſuade Mr. Lewis to marry a reputable woman, who would be agreeable to the family. After much argument he was at length brought to ſee
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:030051_0202_0FE4178C045B14F0"/>
the neceſſity of the caſe; and, to prevent a law-ſuit, with which they threatened him, he conſented to take the wife which they recommended. She is a lady of good ſenſe and polite manners, and treats him with the greateſt deference and propriety. She has had the manſion thoroughly repaired, the floors and windows cleaned, and the walls whitewaſhed, and is not afraid to let her inmoſt apartments be viſited by the ſun and air. The building is now commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, wholeſome and pleaſant, and the dirty dog-kennel,<note n="*" place="bottom">Baſtile, 1789.</note> which ſtood near the door, is demoliſhed.</p>
               <p>IT is ſuſpected by ſome that Lewis ſtill has a hankering after his old connexions, but he profeſſes love to his new wife in the ſtrongeſt terms imaginable. His caſt off miſtreſs has had the audacity to inſult the newly married lady, and tell her that ſhe has no buſineſs to occupy <hi>her</hi> apartments; that all Mr. Lewis's profeſſions are inſincere, and that <hi>ſhe</hi> ſtill poſſeſſes his heart. If
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:030051_0203_0FE4178FAFC7DB78"/>
theſe ladies ſhould go to pulling caps, Mr. Lewis will be in a critical ſituation, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every man is when two women are contending for him. It is ſaid that ſome of the neighbouring gentlemen, who prefer concubinage to matrimony, have taken the part of the late miſtreſs, and inſiſt on her reſtoration to bed and board; but how this matter will terminate, can be decided only by futurity.</p>
               <p>HE has alſo been very unfortunate in ſome of his diſtant plantations and facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. His black cattle have caught the horn diſtemper; ſome of his farm houſes have been burnt, and it is thought that ſeveral years will intervene before his affairs will be ſet to rights.</p>
               <p>THUS, my friend, I have endeavoured to fulfil my promiſe by giving you ſuch an account as I have been able to procure of the foreſters and their connexions. I aſſure you I am extremely delighted with the country and its improvements, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:030051_0204_0FE41791AFECC0C8"/>
by far the expectations of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who travels this way, and has formed what he may think a juſt idea of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by ſtaying at home and hearing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of others. There is no poſſibility of conceiving what a fine country it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out actually ſeeing it; I therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you a journey hither, for a two-fold purpoſe, viz. to cure you of the ſpleen, and to convince you how much human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and ingenuity can perform in a ſhort time, when nature has already done her part toward making a good country and a happy people.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>BEING aſſured that my former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have afforded ſome entertainment to you and your friends, I ſhall with pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure reſume my pen agreeable to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and continue my account of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſters and their connexions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="unknown:030051_0206_0FE41795A478E618"/>MY laſt gave you the lateſt information which could then be had, relative to the families of Mr. Bull and Mr. Lewis; and it is proper for me to begin where I left off, becauſe the circumſtances of thoſe two eternal rivals have had ſome influence, and I fear will always have too much on the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and tranſactions of my favourite foreſters. For, notwithſtanding all that dignity and independence of character which really exiſt among them, and which ought to prevail over every inferior princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet there are perſons in all theſe fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies, who, from local and commercial at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, or from natural and political connexions, are ſtrongly inclined to imitate the manners and adopt the principles of one or the other of thoſe ancient rivals.</p>
               <p>I HAVE told you, that there was a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of a hankering which Lewis indulged toward his caſt off miſtreſs; and that the neighbouring gentlemen favoured the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue. This ſuſpicion has been ſadly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified, and a long and bitter controverſy has
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:030051_0207_0FE417989042E720"/>
enſued between Lewis and the new wife who had been impoſed on him. Her jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy was raiſed to a monſtrous pitch, and the proofs of his infidelity became ſo fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, that nothing would ſatisfy her but a divorce, not barely <hi>à menſa et thoro</hi> but <hi>à vìnculo matrimonii.</hi> After a long and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn hearing, the ſentence was pronounced in due form, and approved by the major part of the family; who, in conſequence, turned him out of doors. The minor part, who adhered to him, were ſo roughly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the majority, that ſuch of them as could, were glad to eſcape, leaving the reſt maimed and wounded on the floors; which were ſo ſtained with blood, that they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if the famous Doctor Sangrado<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Adventures of Gil Blas.</note>, and all his imps had been fully employed in their favourite operation.</p>
               <p>SUCH was the noiſe and uproar on this occaſion, that all the neighbours, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe who favoured Lewis's intrigue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were alarmed. Mr. Bull, whoſe choler
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:030051_0208_0FE4179A8D8A04C8"/>
you know is very eaſily raiſed, took this opportunity to ſwear the peace againſt the whole family of which Lewis was lately at the head. Not content with this, which might have paſſed merely for a defenſive meaſure, he entered a complaint to the grand jury, and had a bill found againſt them "for riotous, routous and diſorderly behaviour," and determined to proſecute them with the utmoſt rigour of the law. For, ſaid he, within himſelf, "If theſe fellows are ſuffered to go on at this rate, they will ſet a fine example to their neighbours, and turn every thing upſide down. If the conduct of maſters does not happen to hit the humours of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we ſhall all be turned out of doors as well as Lewis. Poor devil! I once hated him as heartily as any body; but now he is in diſtreſs, I pity him, and can ſay as Ahab did to Benhadad, <hi>he is my brother.</hi> If ſuch principles and conduct ſhould paſs unpuniſhed, no maſter can be ſure of his property, or power; all family govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is at an end, and a ſtrong-box is no
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030051_0209_0FE4179C86464AF0"/>
ſecurity. It is evidently my duty to beſtir myſelf; and beſides, what a fine oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is now preſented to revenge the conduct of this officious family, who meddled in my controverſy with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſters! Now I will pay them double and round."</p>
               <p>TO carry this reſolve into execution, he entered into articles of agreement with Lord Strut and Nicholas Frog to ſtand by him; and gave large fees to the moſt able pleaders, particularly to <hi>Ferdinand, Frederic</hi> and <hi>Leopold,</hi> who profeſſed to have an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of their own in ſupporting his cauſe. Theſe crafty brethren of the long robe, after making a formal parade of their elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence at the bar, contrived by various pretences and ſtratagems, well known in their profeſſion, to ſpin out the cauſe, and require additional ſums of money; which Mr. Bull generouſly, and even profuſely advanced. For it is a ſettled maxim with him, never to ſpoil any piece of work for fear of expenſe. This being well known
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:030051_0210_0FE4179E2DAE0BC8"/>
to thoſe whom he employs, they are never in a hurry to finiſh a job; and why ſhould they, when they have ſo able and ready a pay-maſter.</p>
               <p>WHAT became of Mr. Lewis after his divorce and expulſion, is uncertain. A let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="*" place="bottom">Manifeſto of Louis XVIII.</note> has appeared, pretending to have been written by him, which ſpeaks in ſtrong terms of the ill treatment he has received, and contains a ſtrange compound of ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and lenity toward the family. Some are ſtill of opinion that he may be reſtored; but it is generally thought that he will not be able very ſoon to ſhow his <hi>head</hi> again among his old neighbours.</p>
               <p>THE changes which took place in the family after his expulſion, were numerous and rapid. The new wife did not long preſerve her dignity, but was frequently touſled and tumbled by the rude hand of every frolickſome fellow in the houſe. The name of Lewis was expunged from
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:030051_0211_0FE417A2AB6D0120"/>
the ſign-board, and in its place was ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the name of ſome remote anceſtors of the family who were called <hi>The Franks,</hi> and by this firm the houſe is now known. Various devices were propoſed for a new coat of arms; one was a wheel within a wheel, with the word <hi>Jacobina</hi> for a motto. Another was a bloody <hi>robe</hi> mounted on a <hi>ſpear,</hi> with the motto, <hi>in terrorem.</hi> But it ſeems to be at length determined, that <hi>three</hi> plain ſtripes of white, red and blue, ſhall be the device, with the motto <hi>une et indiviſible.</hi> Had there been but one colour, the motto would have been more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all their inteſtine diviſions, and their daily and nightly broils among themſelves; yet the Franks have had the addreſs to ſhow a bold face to their adverſaries, and to defend their cauſe in the law with a reſolution truly honourable. Their reſources are ſuppoſed to be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable. Thoſe who quitted the family were not permitted to carry off their clothes and
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:030051_0212_0FE417A4577DF638"/>
trunks, ſome of which contained a valuable booty. The old family plate and jewels, and the ornaments of the devotional cloſet, have been ſold at auction. The real eſtate is in effect mortgaged, by promiſſory notes, iſſued on its credit, which, though they have greatly depreciated in the market, by reaſon of forgeries carried on in Mr. Bull's family, and by his connivance, yet will probably be redeemed at ſome rate of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at preſent unknown.</p>
               <p>THE Franks have alſo found means to ſilence Mr. Bull's moſt powerful pleaders, notwithſtanding the large fees they received from him. They have even detached Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Frog from his connexions with Bull, and taken him into partnerſhip with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; though it is whiſpered that Nicholas is not over and above pleaſed with the new mode of <hi>fraternization,</hi> as it hath brought him into a law-ſuit with Bull, who at once laid attachments on all his ſilks and ſpices. Lord Strut has alſo diſengaged himſelf from the concern; Bull grins hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:030051_0213_0FE417A64CDAC968"/>
at him for his inſincerity, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to ſieze all his plate and bullion, (of which he has an immenſe quantity) to make good the damage.</p>
               <p>HAVING introduced the word <hi>fraterniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I muſt tell you that this is one ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and there are many others, of that liberty which the Franks have aſſumed, of coining words. It has been the practice of the family for a long time, and they have been flattered by the frequent adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uſe of their new words in oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er families, who always regarded them as the moſt polite and plauſible, if not the moſt deeply learned in the whole neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. When words have a real and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite meaning, it is of no conſequence who is the original coiner of them, nor by whom they are brought into uſe; but every one is fond of the productions of his own brain, and every one has a right to claim and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the honour (if there is any) belonging to ſuch productions. Never was a word better adapted to any particular purpoſe
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:030051_0214_0FE417A7F47F58A8"/>
than this. To <hi>fraternize,</hi> in the ſenſe of the Franks, is to <hi>make brethren;</hi> to coax, or bribe, or compel, or uſe means of any kind whatever with other people to <hi>make</hi> them brethren.</p>
               <p>AFTER the divorce and expulſion of Mr. Lewis, the majority, who aſſumed to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern the family, were ſo intoxicated with the idea of the liberty which they enjoyed in being free from their maſter, in touſling and handling their miſtreſs, in picking the locks and ſearching the trunks of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters, and breaking up the old family hordes, that they began to think this was a kind of liberty which all families had a right to enjoy as well as themſelves. They came therefore to a reſolution, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as far as in them lay, to extend the bleſſings of this liberty to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, beginning with the neareſt. They made offers of ſervice, either ſecretly or openly, to bring on revolutions among them, or as they metaphorically expreſſed it, "to plant the tree of liberty in their
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030051_0215_0FE417AC6691E6C0"/>
gardens." This was what they meant by <hi>fraternization.</hi> All who favoured their ideas in other men's families were called <hi>democrats,</hi> and thoſe who were not fond of the fraternizing plan were termed <hi>ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats,</hi> words alſo of their own coining. To ſhow their contempt of all titular diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they diſuſed the appellations of Sir, Monſieur, your Honor, and the like, and ſubſtituted the name of <hi>citizen,</hi> which was ſuppoſed to be equally applicable to all. But to expreſs their own moſt <hi>modeſt</hi> opinion of themſelves, in the loweſt of all poſſible terms, they affected the name of <hi>Sans-culotte,</hi> which in plain Engliſh ſignifies <hi>bare</hi>-****; a word, before this time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied only to thoſe moſt contemptible of the ſpecies who were too lazy to earn enough to buy a pair of ſmall-clothes. To ſuch ridiculous lengths will people go, when they ſuffer their enthuſiaſtic imagination to get the better of their judgment! But the wiſeſt have their foibles; and, who is there that cannot recollect, in the courſe of his life, ſome inſtances of indiſcretion?</p>

               <p>I WILL only further obſerve, at this time, that there has appeared in the family of the Franks, a ſtrange kind of zeal on the ſubject of <hi>religion.</hi> Before theſe changes took place, Mr. Lewis, and the family in general, entertained a decent, though partial reſpect for Lord Peter, and were fond of buying thoſe devotional books and trinkets, in which you know he is a large dealer; but ſince the expulſion of Lewis, no notice has been taken of the old gentleman, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to inſult him, by burning all thoſe books and trinkets which they could find in the family, and thus turning his whole trade into ridicule and contempt.

received opinions, both true and falſe, they have contrived a new almanack, from which all the old red-letter days are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged, and even the dominical letter is omitted.

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE already given you ſome idea of the fraternizing ſcheme of the Franks; I ſhall now inform you of the means by which they attempted to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it among the foreſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="unknown:030051_0220_0FE417B71A5EB798"/>MANY of the Franks had been in the foreſt, and had viſited the plantations and families there, not only during the law-ſuit with Bull, but after the diſpute had been terminated. They had kept journals and made remarks on manners, economy, huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, manufactures, literature, and other things worthy of notice. After they had effected the expulſion of their maſter, theſe travellers were very fond of introducing the ſame family economy which they had obſerved among the Foreſters, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the bleſſings of fraternity to them, by drawing them into the controverſy in which they were engaged. "Why ſhould not theſe foreſters (ſaid they) bear a part of our burden, as we did of their's. We involved ourſelves in their quarrel with Bull, and helped them to terminate it in their favour. One good turn deſerves another; and it is now time for them to enter into our controverſy, and help us in the ſame way."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="unknown:030051_0221_0FE417B8C52F7BF0"/>TO execute this plan, they diſpatched a plauſible, prattling, inſinuating petit-maitre, by the name of TENEG, who had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in fraternizing the family of CAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINO, a famous diſtiller of gin,<note n="*" place="bottom">Gin is an abbreviation of Geneva</note> and had there been very ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>ARTIFICES of the ſame kind will not ſucceed on all ſorts of perſons; but a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation muſt be obſerved, according to the variety of humours, intereſts and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The foreſters were well known to be a wary and diſcerning, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious kind of people, and fond of novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. To hit their ruling paſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by influence or deceive their judgment, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neg was furniſhed with a baſket of birds' eggs, of a new ſpecies, which had recently appeared in the gardens of the Franks. Of theſe birds, I cannot give you the name and deſcription, nor do I know whether they are included in any of the claſſes found by naturaliſts; but to ſpeak in the vulgar phraſe they are known, in ſome places, by
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:030051_0222_0FE417BABB40A7C8"/>
the name of <hi>war-hawks</hi>; rather improperly, I think, becauſe the hawk though a fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is yet a ſilent bird; whereas theſe are ſo very noiſy that they ſeem to belong to the pettrel tribe, and have been not improp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly called <hi>Mother Carey's Chickens,</hi> from their reſemblance to a bird of that name, which is well known to chirp and whiſtle at the approach and during the height of a ſtorm.</p>
               <p>THESE birds have ſome peculiarities, which muſt be conſidered as characteriſtic of the ſpecies. One is, that they vary their note according to the inſtruction of their keepers; in this reſpect they reſemble the magpye and the mock-bird. Their uſual ſound, when not under any particular direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a dull monotony, an eternal repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>jaco, jaco, jaco;</hi> but they have been taught to ſound other words which terminate with a vowel, or a liquid conſonant; ſuch as, <hi>war, war, war;—whiſky, whiſky, whiſky, —ja, ja, ja,</hi> &amp;c. If they chance to hear the whetting of a knife, or the ſnapping of a
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030051_0223_0FE417BEF7145398"/>
trigger, or any noiſe which ſeems to be a preparation for miſchief, they will readily imitate it, and the ſound will catch from one to another like a feu-de-joye. It is ſurpriſing to ſee how eaſily they can be trained and diſciplined. Teneg, with a bird-call, which he carried in his mouth, could bring them by dozens to light on his head and ſhoulders, and even dive into his pocket, to pick the grains which he carried there to feed them. He could make them flutter about him in all directions, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate any noiſe which he was pleaſed to make. It is ſaid, that he has imparted this ſecret to ſome choice ſpirits, his aſſociates.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER peculiarity of theſe birds is, that they ſeem to have an averſion to ſome particular days, and a predilection for oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. On the twenty-ſecond of February they are ſcarcely ever ſeen on the wing, and are remarkably ſilent; but on the tenth of Auguſt, and the twenty-ſecond of September, they appear in great numbers, and are heard to whiſtle through the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:030051_0224_0FE417C0A39F79F0"/>
whole day. The cauſe of this peculiarity is one of the ſecrets of nature, which, it is hoped, the learned will in time be able to penetrate. The vulgar ſuppoſition is, that their hilarity in the months of Auguſt and September is owing to the great quantity of the ſeeds of water-melons, which are then to be found, and of which they are ſaid to be remarkably fond. But this is altogether a vague conjecture, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a philoſophic mind.</p>
               <p>YOU will now be ready to aſk, how were theſe eggs to be hatched? and what uſe could be made of the birds if they ſhould be hatched? To the firſt, I anſwer—Teneg was well informed that there were certain <hi>old hens</hi> in the foreſt, who would readily perform the office of incubation. To the ſecond—By a due management of the birds, and principally by the force of their notes, it was expected that they would excite in the foreſters, and their children, the ſame diſpoſition to miſchief, with which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:030051_0225_0FE417C29A4042B8"/>
were poſſeſſed, and thus prepare the way for a complete <hi>fraternization.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TENEG arrived firſt in the plantation of Charles Indigo; where he placed ſome of his eggs under an old hen, and ſcattered the ſeeds of a particular ſpecies of grain, on which the chickens were to ſubſiſt till they could pick for themſelves. So prolif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic was the brooding warmth of the old hen, that the eggs were ſoon hatched, and the chicks began their natural cry, <hi>jaco, jaco, jaco;</hi> but were ſoon taught the note <hi>war, war, war.</hi> The effect was ſo ſurprizing, that ſeveral of Mr. Indigo's domeſtics im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately roared out the war-whoop, equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped themſelves in the habit of highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and took to the road, with a view to rob any of Mr. Bull's family, or plunder any of his waggons, which they might chance to meet in an unguarded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs ſtate.</p>
               <p>TENEG was ſo ſluſhed with this ſucceſs, that he haſted to the other plantations, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:030051_0226_0FE417C445FA8868"/>
the eggs with his own hands, or ſending them by truſty meſſengers, who were well acquainted with the neſts of the old hens. A brood was ſoon hatched in each of the plantations, who began their cackling as ſoon as they were out of the ſhell. The effect was not ſo great in all parts, as it was in Indigo's plantation; for though the muſic excited ſeveral perſons to kick up a war-dance, and become knights of the highway; yet the number was far greater who ſaw through the artifice, and combined to defeat it. Still, however, the noiſe of the chickens was continued, and the highwaymen became ſo impudent, that when Mr. Bull heard what was doing, he began to ſwell with choler againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſters. "Curſe theſe fellows, (ſaid he) do they intend to aid the Franks againſt me? I'll begin with them betimes. The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way is mine; I'll ſeize their waggons, and ruin their <hi>carrying trade;</hi> and if they have a mind for another law-ſuit, I am their match." Accordingly, as lord of the manor, he ſent out his huntſmen
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:030051_0227_0FE417C8A3B6FD78"/>
and hounds, ſeized ſeveral of their wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons and drove them into incloſures, where they might be ſecured till a court-manor could be holden for <hi>adjudication</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>THE moſt conſiderate among the foreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were greatly incenſed, on account of the plots thus formed againſt them. Though they reſpected the family of the Franks, and rejoiced at their emancipation from the old abſurd ſyſtem of family govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under which they had long groaned; though they made no ſcruple publickly to own them as friends and brethren; yet they could not approve all the whims and innovations, which had crept into the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily; nor did they reliſh the plan of frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization, as the Franks intended to carry it on. They hated the cackling of the chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, and wiſhed they had periſhed in the ſhell: but they were loth to quarrel with the whole family for the folly and vanity of their ſervant; eſpecially as thoſe who had the principal hand in ſending him were in diſgrace, and another ſet had got the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:030051_0228_0FE4180D9FB7BC58"/>
of the houſe. They had at the ſame time a high reſentment againſt Bull for ſeizing their waggons, but thought the beſt way of getting them back again was by remonſtrance and perſuaſion. In theſe circumſtances, a conſultation was held by the council of advice, at which preſided their truſty High Steward, GEORGE, the grandſon of Walter Pipeweed, than whom there is not, perhaps, a man who carries more wiſdom in his head, more goodneſs in his heart, or more vigour in his nerves. George has had enough of law-ſuits; and though he will ſuffer no man to wrong him with impunity, yet he had rather compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe difficulties than inflame them by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The reſult of the conſultation was, that a letter be written to the Franks, in a very friendly ſtyle, complaining of Teneg, and requeſting that a better man might be ſent in his place; that a ſpecial meſſenger be ſent to Bull, to demand ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the damage they had ſuſtained from his huntſmen; at the ſame time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the conduct of the highwaymen;
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:030051_0229_0FE417CA5046BB98"/>
and declaring that they did not intend to meddle with the quarrel between Mr. Bull and the Franks; but to be in friendſhip with both, and trade with both as uſual.</p>
               <p>NO ſooner was this determination known, than thoſe who had the direction of the chickens, ſet them on raiſing a terrible cry, of <hi>war, war, war—ja, ja, ja.</hi> This was very troubleſome and provoking; but it was thought moſt prudent to bear with their impertinent vociferation for a while, in hope that they would ſoon quit the plantations. For as they had come in all at once, it was not known but that they were birds of paſſage, and might diſappear at the ſeaſon of migration; but even if they ſhould continue, there was an expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that means might be found to tame and ſilence them, and perhaps render them in ſome degree uſeful.</p>
               <p>AN experiment of this kind was actually made. A flock of theſe chickens, under the direction of a miſchievous old hen,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030051_0230_0FE417CC4B96BC60"/>
once got into a field of William Broadbrim, on the weſtern ſide of his plantation, and ſet up a cry of <hi>whiſky, whiſky, whiſky.</hi> The noiſe was ſo very loud, and their number was ſo large, that it was feared they would devour the crop, then almoſt ripe for the ſickle. A company of archers was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent out, with orders to try the effect of ſome particular ſounds, before they ſhould diſcharge their arrows. They crept along, making ſeveral kinds of noiſe, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, till they had got very near, when they ſet up a loud cry of <hi>Waſh, Waſh, Waſh,</hi> which entirely drowned the noiſe of <hi>whiſky,</hi> and was ſo formidable to the chickens, that they ſlew away with precipitation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came remarkably ſilent. They have not only made no more diſturbance in that quarter, but ſome of them have ſince been obſerved hovering about the barn-yards, and mixing with the common poultry.</p>
               <p>THE letter ſent to the Franks was well received, and produced the deſired effect. Teneg was diſqualified and ſuperſeded;
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:030051_0231_0FE417CDF40BEDC8"/>
but he did not think it proper to return, leſt he ſhould loſe his ears. He has ſince married a girl of the family of Peter Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frog, and taken up his abode in the foreſt; and, ſuch is the good-natured policy of theſe people, that he is permitted to reſide among them, and to enjoy what he has earned, without any inquiry how he came by it; provided that he pays his taxes and lives peaceably.</p>
               <p>THE meſſenger who went to Mr. Bull, was a long time in conſultation with his clerk, before all matters could be adjuſted to mutual ſatisfaction. The reſult, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was a tolerable compromiſe; in which Bull engaged to give up the hunting-ſeats which he had ſo long withheld, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the <hi>whole</hi> body of the foreſters ſhould become bound to pay the balance of an old account, due to him from the <hi>ſouthern</hi> planters. He alſo promiſed to let the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted limits be adjuſted by a committee; to expedite the manor-courts, in which the treſpaſſes ſhould be fairly tried; and to
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030051_0232_0FE417D1A15468E0"/>
pay damages if awarded. Other matters which had been in diſpute were adjuſted; but one clauſe was inſerted, which prohib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited them from trading at his ſugar ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, unleſs they ſhould carry their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in waggons of no larger ſize than a wheelbarrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This article was ſo ſingular and ridiculous, that the council of foreſters rejected it. The other parts of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment met the approbation of twenty out of thirty, which made the inſtrument valid, and it was ſigned, ſealed, publiſhed and declared in due form.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as this tranſaction was known, and even before the inſtrument was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thoſe choice ſpirits whom Teneg had inſtructed, as aforeſaid, in the uſe of the bird-call, ſet all the chickens a crying <hi>ja, ja, ja—treaty, treaty, treaty.</hi> The ſound rang through the foreſt, and was reverber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from houſe to houſe, and from tree to tree, in ſuch a ſurprizing manner, that no other noiſe could, for a while, be heard. Some very ſober people were actually deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened;
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:030051_0233_0FE417D3A0C21FA8"/>
others were vexed with the clamour. But conſidering from what cauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, they determined to let the chickens cry till they were weary; and then calmly and coolly to examine the reaſons which influenced their keepers thus to ſet them a cackling. This examination has been done in a very maſterly manner; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general are pretty well ſatisfied with the compromiſe. They ſee, that though it is not altogether to their wiſhes, yet it is the beſt bargain that could be made. They ſee that it has prevented a long law-ſuit, the iſſue of which muſt have been uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and they had rather enjoy the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of cultivation and of ſending their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to market, than ſpend their money in paying council, attornies, ſolicitors, ſcriven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and bailiffs; of which kind of drudgery they have already done enough to make the preſent generation ſick of ſuch buſineſs.</p>
               <p>THERE remained one effort more, which the diſciples of Teneg were determined to
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:030051_0234_0FE417D59B2416F0"/>
make, to prevent the agreement from being carried into effect. It was neceſſary that a ſum of money ſhould be allowed for travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charges, clerks' fees, and other incident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al expenſes. When this matter came to be debated in the council of advice, a flock of the chickens, who had been trained for the purpoſe, flew into the hall, perched on the table and chairs, and began to cackle with a new note in addition to their former vociferations. <hi>Papers, papers, papers.</hi> Two of them had the impudence to alight on the ſhoulders of the High Steward, as he ſat muſing in his elbow-chair, and, putting their bills into his ears to ſquall this harſh note. GEORGE bore it a while calmly, and continued his contemplations; till, at length, with his deep-grum voice, and with a determined air and manner, he pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the monoſyllable <hi>No,</hi> ſo forcibly, that the cackling ceaſed, and the chickens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to their managers, for farther inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their invention was ready, and ſome pains were taken to teach them the ſame monoſyllable <hi>No,</hi> with the addition of the
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:030051_0235_0FE417D7486A3878"/>
word <hi>ſupply.</hi> This was the moſt difficult taſk which had yet been attempted; and it took them ſo long to learn it, that the neighbours, who obſerved what was going on, had time to <hi>blow the horn,</hi> to call the people together, and put an end to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of this noiſy brood. At the ſound of the horn, the chickens were frightened; ſome to ſave their necks from being wrung, flew off in various directions; others hid themſelves and remained ſilent; till the council had finiſhed their deliberation, and voted the money. The only ill conſequence of this diſturbance, was a little delay in the execution of the agreement, which all good men had the candour to impute to the true cauſe.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all the appearance of good will on the part of Mr. Bull, there are many who think he ſtill looks with an envious eye on the Foreſters, and is jealous of their enterprizing ſpirit, and of their extenſive and growing commerce. Their agents and factors are ſeen in all
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:030051_0236_0FE417DB50B7C130"/>
thoſe ware-houſes, from which he had been uſed to fetch commodities by wholeſale, and diſpoſe of them by retail at very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced prices. There is no place to which they cannot find as ready acceſs as himſelf, and where they cannot trade on equal terms. It is not long ſince he ſent a very pompous meſſenger to old Cang-hi, the tea manufacturer, with his compliments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting that he might have ſome <hi>excluſive</hi> advantages in trade, at his ware-houſe; and to ingratiate himſelf the better, this meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger carried a number of valuable preſents, which, it was thought would be highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. The old gentleman received the meſſenger, and ſome of the preſents, with his uſual politeneſs; but obſerving the ſupercilious air of the meſſenger, he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſmiſſed him with this ſententious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. "My anceſtors have taught wiſdom to their deſcendants. Their pictures and their maxims are delineated in this book, which I preſent to thy maſter. Tell him there is no friendſhip in trade. My doors are open to all cuſtomers, and every man is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come for his money."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="unknown:030051_0237_0FE417DCF915F3E0"/>WHEN the Foreſters heard of this ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reply, they could not help laughing in their ſleeves, at the mortification which old Bull muſt have received from it.</p>
               <p>YOU will wiſh to know on what terms theſe people are with the wild beaſts on their weſtern border. Since I wrote to you concerning them, a ſtrong hunting party has been ſent out, who have driven them from their old haunts, and have erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lodges in the moſt convenient places, where future huntſmen may reſide. But as the creatures appear to be leſs formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and their ferocity is evidently in the <hi>wane,</hi> it has been thought beſt to entice them to peace, and admit them to familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. The old practice is revived of ſetting molaſſes for them to lick, and furniſhing them with collars and noſe-jewels. But above all, a line has been drawn, beyond which no perſon is permitted to make any plantation. This precaution is one of the beſt which could be invented, and it is hoped will have ſo good an effect, as to keep the neighbours out of fear of being devoured.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="unknown:030051_0238_0FE417DEF1F2DD80"/>BESIDES the compromiſe with Bull, the Foreſters have concluded an agreement with two of the Arabian rovers, Muley<note n="*" place="bottom">Morocco.</note> and Haſſan,<note n="†" place="bottom">Algiers.</note> which ſtipulates that they may go about their buſineſs without moleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, on the payment of a certain ſum down, and an annual acknowledgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. This is a cheaper way of dealing with ſuch old rogues, than to let them rob and plunder at their own pleaſure.

               <p>AN advantageous agreement has alſo been made between the Foreſters and Lord Strut, adjuſting the limits of his foreſt and theirs, and opening a road between them, which is to be free to both parties. Mr. Bull has quietly and honourably given up the hunting-ſeats, according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Foreſters are in peaceable poſſeſſion of them. This will enable them to extend their plantations and cultivate

their country to the greateſt advantage. They are continually making improvements by bridges and canals; and if they ſhould continue at peace among themſelves, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the quarrels, and untainted by the diſſipation and folly of their neighbours, they will be as happy a ſet of people as any on the globe.</p>

               <p>IN one of my former Letters I told you of a new ſpecies of <hi>rats,</hi> which had appeared in the foreſt. I am ſorry to ſay that they not only remain, but are very numerous and miſchievous. They are ſo ſly and evaſive, that they elude all the arts of common rat-catchers; and at the ſame time are ſo bold and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to make their appearance in open day-light, in the houſes, roads and fields. Not long ſince, a large number of them were ſeen in the dining-room of <hi>George Truſty;</hi> firſt ſitting under the table, and catching eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry crumb which fell; then leaping on the table, whilſt the family were at dinner, and ſnatching the meat out of their plates. George profeſſed great indignation at this degree of impudence, and ſwore that he would permit no ſuch thing in his houſe; but ſome people are ſo uncharitable as to ſuppoſe this to be only a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that he ſecretly favours them, for ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult purpoſes. Should this imagination prove to be well founded, it is thought that his name will be changed; and that inſtead of being called <hi>Truſty,</hi> he will have a name as long as thoſe uſed in Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's time; <hi>Better known than truſted.</hi>
