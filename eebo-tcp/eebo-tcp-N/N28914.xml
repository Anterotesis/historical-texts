            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>TIME, though a reality with which in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent exiſtence we are deeply converſant, is the moſt difficult to explain; and ſome have thought its nature ſo extremely intricate that it is incapable of admitting any clear and explicit definition. It
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:038552_0003_10122A85180A7AE0"/>
is, therefore, with diffidence we enter upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and offer our obſervations upon it, not as uſurping over the reaſon or the religion of our readers, but with a devout wiſh for their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by that Almighty Being who is the firſt cauſe, the great and laſt end of all things.</p>
                     <p>Time is the limited or given period for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and duration of things in natural life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wiſe counſel and ſovereign pleaſure of God. The diurnal and annual revolutions of the ſun, as having been, from the beginning of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſtant, regular, and univerſally obſervable by mankind, and ſuppoſed equal to one another, have been, with reaſon, made uſe of for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſuch natural and animal exiſtence: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, we find that time has been divided into centuries, years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, ſeconds, &amp;c. and by theſe the larger and leſs intervals of time are eſtimated and meaſured. Whatever is without time has no ſucceſſion; and whatever is in time, is ſubject to changes. Time, therefore, conſiſts of three parts—the <hi>preſent,</hi> which enjoys exiſtence; the <hi>paſt,</hi> which has loſt it; the <hi>future,</hi> which is to obtain it. The light of nature, I preſume, may teach us, that time is a <hi>creature;</hi> or, in other words, is given out and deſigned by the Supreme Majeſty; becauſe it is in a perpetual
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:038552_0004_10122A86A49E8AD0"/>
flux, produces the will of him who reigns above all, and is itſelf periſhing in its own ruins, dragging with it the fate of kingdoms in ſpite of human op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Some, therefore, have called time a drop taken out of the vaſt ocean of eternity, and which ſhall return into its own boſom; that it is an intermediate ſpace, a prelude to an infinite expanſion, boundleſs and never ending. Mr. Locke ſays, "the general idea we have of time, is by conſidering any part of infinite duration, as ſet out by periodical meaſures." The being or exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of time is obvious to all; and although a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical ſearch after its origin, nature, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, be commendable in the penetrating genius, yet its improvement for our moral happineſs muſt certainly meet the higheſt commendation, and be more intereſting to all; and, from this conviction, numberleſs volumes have been written upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>However uncertain the ſentiments of philoſophy upon the ſubject of time, let us now take up our BIBLE and ſee if we cannot tread upon more ſolid ground, and derive more pleaſure in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.</p>
                     <p>I. This ineſtimable volume, the bible, directs our inquiries to Jehovah, as the ANCIENT OF DAYS, Daniel vii. that is, the author of <hi>time,</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:038552_0005_1012582362797C38"/>
and the parent of <hi>eternity;</hi> who was before all things, by whom and for whom all things were made; and which, in the new teſtament, is applied to Jeſus Chriſt in his divinity, who is God over all, bleſſed forever, the firſt and the laſt. Rev. i. 8.</p>
                     <p>Time, though now grown old, bears not its own date; neither informs us of its deſigned period; but the ſcriptures inſtruct us of the formation of the univerſe, when time, with human beings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced; the diviſions of time by day and night, and what we call its weekly round; likewiſe of the period when the angel ſhall ſtand upon the earth and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſea, lift up his hand to heaven, and ſwear by him that liveth forever and ever, that there ſhould be time no longer. Rev. x. 5, 6. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in point of antiquity, the bible claims our devout eſteem. This volume alſo gives us the completeſt hiſtory of the ſucceſſion of time, as to the being and the viciſſitudes of a vaſt number of the inhabitants of the earth, as formed into families, cities, and empires; the greater part of which were the ſubject of previous prophecy; and which, in their time, were fulfilled, not one failed; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of which gives us a ſolid evidence of the authenticity of the ſcripture. Thoſe who have been moſt converſant with the bible, have obſerved that the duration of time is marked with ſeven pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038552_0006_10125825DBA2B500"/>
or thouſand years; two from the creation to the flood, two to the birth of Chriſt, two for the goſpel aera, now in being, making ſix thouſand years; to which is added, one thouſand for the perſonal reign of Chriſt, called the Millennium: in the whole, ſeven thouſand years; correſponding with the ſix firſt days of creation, and the ſabbath, or ſeventh, the day of reſt; for <hi>a thouſand years are with the Lord as one day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>II. Let us now contemplate time as the limited ſpace of man's natural exiſtence. To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven; a time to be born, and a time to die. Eccl. iii. 1, 2. Man cometh not into being by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental circumſtances, or by what ſome call chance, but according to the fore-knowledge and infinite pleaſure of God, who declareth the end from the beginning, and who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will. David, in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage moſt ſublime, acknowledges God the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his exiſtence:—<hi>Thine eyes did ſee my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were faſhioned, when as yet there was none of them.</hi> Pſm. cxxxix. 16. And in contemplation on the human ſtructure, we may unite with Dr. Lowth—
<q>
                           <pb n="6" facs="unknown:038552_0007_1012582856109AF8"/>
                           <l>With awful joy I view this frame of mine,</l>
                           <l>Stupendous monument of power divine!</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our clime, parents, birth, parts, paſſions, time, place, and circumſtances of our introduction to natural life, infancy, youth, manhood, old age, death, with all their variety of appendages and events, in their ſucceſſive periods, are ordered by that God <hi>in whom we live, move, and have our being.</hi> Acts xvii. 28. Or, as Cowper admirably deſcribes it—
<q>
                           <l>—God gives to every man</l>
                           <l>The virtue, temper, understanding, taste,</l>
                           <l>That lifts him into life, and lets him fall</l>
                           <l>Just in the niche he was ordained to fill.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are not long introduced to life before we learn that time, like a vaſt confluence of waters, takes its riſe from eternity; rapidly returns to the unbounded ſource from whence it came, bearing on its boſom the myriads of the human race. We learn too, that none can ſtem the current, nor for a moment divide its ſtream; it is, indeed, viſible to all as we paſs along, we date its riſe with us, but <hi>none knoweth what a day may bring forth,</hi> nor aſcertain when the ſolemn period of our time ſhall be turned by the hand of death. In youth we are prone to view our future time as a vaſt expanſe;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038552_0008_10125829EE6D3548"/>
in manhood, by more confirmed worldly habits, we call our moments our own; though frequently they elude our touch, and either cut ſhort the thread of life, or imperceptibly bring us to old age. May we not ſay with David, <hi>Lord remember how ſhort my time is!</hi> Pſm. lxxxix. 47. <hi>Our days on earth are as a ſhadow, and there is none abiding;</hi> 1 Chron. xxix. 15. a <hi>vapor,</hi> that in an inſtant is no more ſeen! James iv. 14. The longeſt life, in the review, is but as yeſterday; and its various occurrences are as a tale that is told: Yet, every fleeting moment and revolving year are graduated by the hand of Almighty God, upon the ſcale of human being, and each ſhall anſwer his intended end.</p>
                     <p>III. The tranſactions of human beings ſurvive the wreck of time, and paſs into eternity; a thought, this, which ſhould fall with ſolemn weight upon every breaſt. God's univerſal government, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments in this life, the ſoul's conſciouſneſs of virtue and of vice, the egreſs of the mind towards a future ſtate, man's departure out of time by death againſt his own will; theſe, with many other inconteſtable truths, form the foundation of our confidence, that the tranſactions of mankind, in time, are amenable to a future ſtate of retribution; and, in which,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038552_0009_1012582C63F3CFC8"/>
the honours of God, in his law and juſtice, ſhall be revealed in preſence of men and angels. On theſe moſt ſolemn and intereſting ſubjects the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give us the higheſt inſtruction; they make a conſiderable part of their ample page. Verily there is a God that judgeth the earth. Pſm. lviii. 11. We muſt all appear before the judgment ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>at of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Cor. v. 10. The Lord look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down from heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God. They are all gone aſide, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Pſm. xiv. Every idle word that man ſhall ſpeak, he ſhall give account thereof in the day of judgment. Matt. xxxvi. The dead, ſmall and great, ſhall ſtand before God; the ſea, death and hell, ſhall deliver up their dead to be judged, every man according to his works. Rev. xx This deſcription of the ſtate of man, and of future retribution, is conſonant to ſound reaſon; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of which muſt exiſt in every conſcious breaſt. How dreary then the proſpect of human nature! On the rapid ſtream of time, eſteeming the precious moments of exiſtence as the moſt trifling commodity though more valuable than
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038552_0010_1012582FB3F55C70"/>

It is therefore with the higheſt pleaſure we reflect on time as the ſpace in which the purpoſes of God are unfolded in Jeſus Chriſt, as willing and mighty to redeem loſt ſinners as they were low ſunk in wretchedneſs and ruin. This moſt bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was promiſed immediately after the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of our firſt parents in Paradiſe, and revealed as the ſeed of the woman who was to bruiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's head.

Daniel uſhered in the preciſe time in which the Meſſiah was to appear. Chap. ix. Paul, well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with the Hebrew prophecies, informs, that <hi>when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law; that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> Gal, iv. 4, 5. Jeſus, Meſſiah, the Son of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, ſpent thirty years in private life, according to the Hebrew law, and began his public miniſtry: this being accompliſhed, he goes up to Jeruſalem voluntarily, to ſuffer and to die. In view of the croſs he cries, "<hi>Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son that thy Son may alſo glorify thee.</hi>" John xvii. 1. The memorable point of time is arrived, in which all the ſeries of prophecy and ſacrifice are accompliſhed. He finiſhes the tranſgreſſion, makes an end of ſins, makes reconciliation for iniquity, brings in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and ſeals up the viſion and prophecy. Daniel ix. 24. The paſchal Lamb is now ſlain; the law is magnified and made honourable both in precept and in penalty; the powers of darkneſs are overcome and bound in more than adamantine chains; death is diſarmed of his dreadful ſting, and the gates of immortal life wide unfolded to every pious mind! Then, my ſoul, admire this bleſſed goſpel day—

                     <head>THE MISER.</head>
                     <p>MR. OSTERVALD, a well known banker, died in France, 1790. This man, originally of Neuſchatel, felt the violence of the diſeaſe of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice ſo ſtrongly, that within a few days of his death, no importunities could induce him to buy a few pounds of meat for the purpoſe of making him a little ſoup. "'Tis true," ſaid he, "I ſhould not diſlike the ſoup, but I have no appetite for the meat, what then is to become of that?" At the time he refuſed this nouriſhment, for fear of being obliged to give away two or three pounds of meat, there was tied round his neck a ſilken bag, which contained eight hundred affignats of one thouſand livres each. At his outſet in life, he drank a pint of beer, which ſerved him for ſupper, at a houſe much frequented, from which he carried home all the bottle-corks he could come at. Of theſe, in the courſe of eight years, he had collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as many as ſold for twelve louis-d'ors, a ſum that laid the foundation of his future fortune, the ſuperſtructure of which was rapidly raiſed by his uncommon ſucceſs of ſtock-jobbing. He died poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of three millions of livres; that is, one hundred and twenty-five thouſand pounds ſterling!</p>
                     <p>How pernicious is avarice! while it denies a

friendly hand to wipe away the tear of grief that falls from a fellow mortal's eye: it is as a vulture upon the miſer's own breaſt; and however ſuch may plead the chriſtian <hi>name,</hi> he proves himſelf a ſtranger to its benevolent <hi>nature.</hi> A ſpirit of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice is ſo inhuman, ſo contrary to the well-being of ſociety, and ſo deſpicable in itſelf, that no chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian virtue can dwell in that breaſt in which it reigns. It expreſſes the higheſt ingratitude to God for the vouchſafement of his favours, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws from that love of our neighbour which ſhould characterize our ſpecies; ſo that the miſer may be ſaid to diſdain all obligation both to God and man; and I may add, he is unworthy of both. That benevolence yields its own moſt pleaſurable reward, no man will diſpute; that avarice, too, is frequently the miſer's executioner, abundant teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies occur; among which, I ſhall, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entertainment of our readers, recite the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing authenticated narrative.</p>
                     <p>Monſieur Foſcue, one of the farmers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the province of Languedoc, in France, who had amaſſed conſiderable wealth by grinding the faces of the poor within his province, and every other mean, however low, baſe, or cruel, by which he rendered himſelf univerſally hated, was one day ordered by the government to raiſe a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038552_0016_1012583DCB193790"/>
conſiderable ſum, upon which, as an excuſe for not complying with the demand, he pleaded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty; but fearing leaſt ſome of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Languedoc ſhould give information to the contrary, and his houſe ſhould be ſearched, he reſolved on hiding his treaſure in ſuch a manner as to eſcape the moſt ſtrict examination. He dug a cave in his wine-cellar, which he made ſo large and deep that he uſed to go down to it with a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: at the entrance was a door with a ſpring-lock upon it, which, on ſhutting, would faſten of itſelf. Very lately Monſieur Foſcue was miſſing; dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch was made after him in every place; the ponds were drawn, and every method which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man imagination could ſuggeſt, was taken for finding him, but in vain. In a ſhort time after, his houſe was ſold, and the purchaſer beginning either to rebuild it or to make ſome alteration in it, the workmen diſcovered a door in the cellar, with a key in the lock, which being opened, and on going down, they found Monſieur Foſcue lying dead upon the ground, with a candleſtick near him, but no candle in it, which he had eaten; and on ſearching farther, they found the vaſt wealth which he had amaſſed. It it ſuppoſed that when Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Foſcue went into his cave, the door by ſome accident ſhut after him; and being out of the call
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038552_0017_1012584049C66D18"/>
of any perſon, he periſhed for want of food. He had gnawed the fleſh of both his arms. Thus awfully did this miſer die amidſt his treaſures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his wealth for the benefit of ſociety; he was conſtrained to make his laſt meal upon his own body!—Few miſers but what, ſome how or other, <hi>trap</hi> themſelves.</p>

THE DOG.</head>
                     <p>THIS claſs of animals may be principally diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their claws, which have no ſheath, like thoſe of the cat kind; by their having ſix cutting-teeth, and two canine in each jaw: alſo by their having five toes before, and four behind. But,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038552_0018_10125843E8D8C1B0"/>
though this is invariable in the wild ſpecies, ſuch as the wolf, &amp;c. the common dogs have frequently five toes on each foot. The tail of thoſe of the dog kind bends towards the left, a character com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the whole ſpecies, and firſt diſcovered by Linnaeus.</p>
                     <p>Of all animals the dog is the moſt ſuſceptible of change in its form, its varieties being almoſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs: each will mix with the other, and produce varieties ſtill more unlike the original ſtock. The climate, the food, and the education, make ſtrong impreſſions upon this animal, and produce altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in its ſhape, colour, hair, and ſize; and in every thing but its nature. All dogs are evidently of one kind; but which of them is the original, from whence ſuch a variety of deſcendants have ſprung, is not eaſily to be determined. Mr. Buffon makes the chien de berger, the ſhepherd's dog, to be the original, it being naturally the moſt ſenſible; and becomes, without diſcipline, almoſt inſtantly the guardian of the flocks, and keeps them within bounds.</p>
                     <p>The dog is the moſt intelligent of all known quadrupeds, and the acknowledged friend of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. At night the guard of the houſe is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his care, and he ſeems proud of the charge; he continues a watchful centinel, goes his rounds,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038552_0019_101258465F36C0D0"/>
ſcents ſtrangers at a diſtance, and warns them of his being upon duty. His voice is more readily obeyed by the flock and the herd, than even that of the ſhepherd or the huſbandman. The dog is formed for the chaſe, and affords equal aſſiſtance to the ſportſman: his ſcent is more exquiſite than that of other animals in the purſuit of game, and can diſtinguiſh his maſter from among a thouſand.</p>
                     <p>Some of the varieties of the dog, are, the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's dog, the hound, the ſpaniel, the grey-hound, the maſtiff, the bull-dog, the terrier, the blood-hound, the tumbler, the lap-dog, lion-dog, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The heathen conſecrated the dog to Mercury, as the moſt vigilant and crafty of the gods; becauſe watchfulneſs and ſagacity are the properties of that animal. The Japaneſe give the following names to the twelve ſigns of the Zodiac, and the twelve hours of the day. The firſt they call the rat, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the cow, third the tyger, fourth the hare, fifth the dragon, ſixth the ſerpent, ſeventh the horſe, eighth the ſheep, ninth the ape, tenth the cock, eleventh the dog, and twelfth the boar. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror who was upon the throne when Kaempfer was in Japan, was born under the eleventh ſign, or the <hi>dog;</hi> conſequently he had a great fondneſs for that animal. According to an edict publiſhed by that prince, all the dogs that died within his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038552_0020_10125847F85EC558"/>
were to be carried to the top of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, there to be buried with great pomp. A poor man, who was carrying his dog to the appointed ſpot, finding the dead carcaſe heavy, and the way long, began to murmur againſt the orders of his ſovereign, upon which a neighbour, who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him, obſerved with much propriety, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of complaining, he ought, on the contrary, to thank the gods, who, in their wiſdom, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the emperor ſhould not be born under the ſign of the <hi>horſe;</hi> "for," ſaid he, "a horſe would have been a much more diſagreeable burden than a <hi>dog.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>I will here take leave to introduce to our readers the practice of the Guebres of Perſia, to thoſe who are in the act of expiring in death; the attendants raiſe the poor man, and a near relation preſents a dog to his mouth, on a ſuppoſition that the breath, or ſoul, will be communicated to that animal, and be happy. No leſs extraordinary is the practice of this people towards the body after death. This is laid decently upon the ground, under the walls of the intended ſepulchre, while one of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions goes round the village to try if he can allure a dog to follow him. He does all he can to bring the animal as near as poſſible to the corpſe, for they imagine that the nearer the dog comes, the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038552_0021_1012584A77376428"/>
nearer the departed ſoul is to everlaſting happineſs. But if the dog cannot be tempted to approach it, then it is conſidered as a bad omen, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſpair of his felicity. When the dog has performed the taſk aſſigned him, two prieſts, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about ten yards diſtant from the body, repeat a form of prayer half an hour in length. During the whole of this ceremony, the corpſe has a piece of paper fixed to each ear, and hangs over the face about three inches below the chin. As ſoon as the prayers are over, the corpſe is carried to the place allotted for its reception, and all the company fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, two and two, with their hands devoutly cloſed. They are enjoined not to ſpeak a word, becauſe they believe their ſepulchre is a place of ſilence and repoſe.</p>
                     <p>While we lament the general ignorance of the Guebres, we perceive that they had a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that the ſoul ſurvived the death of the body; and that, in its ſeparate ſtate, it was capable of happineſs or miſery. How inexcuſable, therefore, are thoſe of our clime who pretend to greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of rationality and refinement, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, at leaſt to profeſs, that the ſoul either ſleeps with the body in the grave, or is entirely annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated? Thankful ought we to be for the volume of revelation which deſcribes the nature, qualities, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038552_0022_1012584E03E44EB0"/>
immortality of the ſoul, and opens to us, in the moſt rational, ſublime, and God-honouring ſcenes, what awaits us beyond the vale of death; and points us, at the ſame time, to an all-ſufficient Saviour, who is <hi>the way, the truth, and the life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſcripture, for the purpoſe of conveying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to our minds, and of deſignating ſome particular characters, has named the <hi>dog,</hi> the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal now under conſideration.</p>
                     <p>A dog, a dead dog, a dog's head, were frequently named to expreſs an inſignificant and vile perſon. Eliſha, the prophet, being inſpired by God to foreſee the future evil conduct of Hazael, thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him—<hi>I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Iſrael: their ſtrong holds wilt thou ſet on fire, and their young men wilt thou ſlay with the ſword, and wilt daſh their children, and rip up their women with child.</hi> Hazael replied—<hi>What, is thy fervent a</hi> DOG, <hi>that he ſhould do this great thing?</hi> 2 Kings viii. 12, 13. But however this wicked man profeſſed an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence to ſuch atrocious actions, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the wretched <hi>dog did cut Iſrael ſhort, and ſmote them in all their coaſt.</hi> x. 32.</p>
                     <p>As in the days of Iſaiah, ſo in every age, there are falſe teachers, wicked perſons, not called of God, that intrude themſelves upon the people,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038552_0023_101258507B1AEF88"/>
who are juſtly ſaid to be <hi>blind, ignorant, dumb dogs, that cannot bark;</hi> therefore, not fit to give an alarm in time of danger, nor give faithful inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to others;—they are <hi>ſleeping dogs, lying down, loving to ſlumber;</hi> and ſo quite unfit to watch the gates of Zion;—<hi>greedy dogs; that can never have enough,</hi> they love the fleece better than the flock, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly preying upon rich and poor without filling their own belly. Iſa. lvi. 10, 11. Such perſons, let them be found among whatever religious denominations they may, muſt prove a curſe inſtead of a bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Satan, the devil, is called a <hi>dog;</hi> a fierce blood-hound, ſeeking the deſtruction of the ſouls of men; and who combatted Chriſt in the wilderneſs, and upon the croſs, but foiled and made priſoner in chains. Pſm. xxii, 20. I may now call Satan the ſhepherd's dog: Chriſt, the chief ſhepherd of Iſrael, making uſe of him as a ſhepherd doth his dog, to keep his flock together, and making all his howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and barkings, his vile efforts, ſubſervient to his pleaſure, and the higheſt intereſt of his choſen flock.</p>
                     <p>To gratify our young readers, in particular, I ſhall cloſe this piece of natural hiſtory, by reciting ſome well authenticated anecdotes of the ſagacity and faithfulneſs of the dog.</p>
                     <p>Of the following incident Plutarch affirms that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038552_0024_1012585219061CD8"/>
he, himſelf, was an eye-witneſs. Being once on ſhip-board, he obſerved a jar which was about half filled with oil. A dog was very deſirous of paying his addreſſes to the contents, but the oil was too low in the containing veſſel for him to get at it. The ſeamen were all engaged different ways; and the dog, willing to make the moſt of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity, took up, ſucceſſively, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſtones which were ſtowed in that part of the ſhip, and dropping them, one by one, into the jar, the oil at laſt roſe within his reach, and he lapped as much of it as he pleaſed. "<hi>I was aſtoniſhed,</hi>" ſays Plutarch, "<hi>by what means the dog could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaciouſly know, that the immiſſion of heavier ſubſtances would cauſe the lighter ſubſtance to aſcend.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>A ſervant of Sir Henry Lee had formed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of aſſaſſinating his maſter, and robbing the houſe. That very night, a maſtiff dog, which had never been much noticed by Sir Henry, for the firſt time followed him up ſtairs, got under the bed, and could not be got from thence, by either maſter or man. In the dead of night the ſame ſervant entered the room to execute his horrid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but was inſtantly ſeized by the dog; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured, confeſſed his intention. In memory of this preſervation, Sir Henry Lee engaged John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,

                     <p>The dead body of a Roman ſoldier, who had been killed in a domeſtic tumult, was carefully watched and guarded by his dog; who would not permit any perſon to touch the remains of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted maſter. PYRRHUS, the king, paſſing by that way, took notice of ſo ſtriking a ſpectacle, and inquired into the circumſtances of the caſe. On being informed that the man had been ſlain three days before, and that the dog, in all that time, had neither ſtirred from the body, nor taken any food, the king ordered the body to be buried, and the dog to be brought to him. The creature ſoon grew fond of Pyrrhus, who, ſhortly after, ordering his forces to muſter, the ſoldiers paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in review. During this ceremony, the dog, for ſome time, lay quiet at his feet; till ſeeing thoſe ſoldiers march by who had murdered his late maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſprung at them with ſuch rage and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and turned himſelf to Pyrrhus with ſuch meaning in his looks and geſtures, that the men were ſent to priſon, on ſuſpicion of having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038552_0026_101258566BBA07E0"/>
the crime with which the dog ſeemed to charge them. Being ſtrictly examined, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves guilty, and were accordingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted.</p>

                     <p>AMONG the phaenomena of winter, no one is more worthy of diſcuſſion than that of SNOW, which is confeſſedly one of the moſt curious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of nature; and, from the remoteſt ages of antiquity, has excited the admiration of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and poets. We ſhall, therefore, offer our readers a few philoſophical remarks upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and then advert to the ſcriptures, which not only corroborate the dictate of ſound philoſophy, but, under the emblem of ſnow, afford us leſſons of ſpiritual inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Snow is formed by the freezing of the vapours in the atmoſphere. It differs from hail and hoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froſt in being, as it were, cryſtallized, which they are not. This appears, on examination of a flake of ſnow by a magnifying glaſs; when the whole of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038552_0027_1012585AA616CF08"/>
it will appear to be compoſed of fine ſhining ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula, diverging like rays from a centre. As the flakes fall down through the atmoſphere, they are continually joined by more of theſe radiated ſpicula, and thus increaſe in bulk, like the drops of rain or hail-ſtones. Dr. Grew obſerves, that many parts of ſnow are of a regular figure, for the moſt part ſo many little rowels, or ſtars of ſix points, and are as perfect and tranſparent ice as any we ſee on a pond. Upon each of theſe points are other colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral points, ſet at the ſame angles as the main points themſelves; among which there are divers other irregular, which are chiefly broken points, and fragments of the regular ones. Others alſo, by various winds, ſeem to have been thawed, and froze again into irregular cluſters, ſo that it ſeems as if the whole body of ſnow were an infinite maſs of icicles irregularly figured; that is, a cloud of vapours being gathered into drops, the ſaid drops forthwith deſcend; upon which deſcent, meeting with a freezing air as they paſs through a colder region, each drop is immediately frozen into an icicle, ſhooting itſelf forth into ſeveral points; but theſe ſtill continuing their deſcent, and meeting with ſome intermitting gales of warmer air, or in their continual waſtage to and fro touching upon each other; ſome of them are a little thawed, blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038552_0028_1012585D1E258B68"/>
and again froze into cluſters, or entangled ſo as to fall down in what we call flakes. The lightneſs of ſnow, although it is firm ice, is owing to the exceſs of its ſurface in compariſon of the matter contained in it; as gold itſelf may be extended in ſurface till it will ride upon the leaſt breath of air. From ſome late experiments on the quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yielded by ſnow, it appears that the latter gives only about one tenth of its bulk. The peculiar agency of ſnow as a fertilizer in preference to rain, may, without recurring to nitrous ſalts ſuppoſed to be contained in it, be rationally aſcribed to its fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing a covering for the roots of vegetables, by which they are guarded from the influence of the atmoſpherical cold, and the internal heat of the earth is prevented from eſcaping. Whatever dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference may ariſe upon this ſubject, every true phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher will pronounce the phaenomena of ſnow to be the production of the ALMIGHTY, under whoſe ſupreme controul every element is ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his infinite pleaſure, and produces infinite benefits to mankind.</p>

                     <p>This ſubject is charmingly illucidated in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to which we will now repair. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the works of God, the writer of the book of Job declares—<hi>God thundereth marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with his voice: great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend: for he ſaith to the ſnow, be thou on the earth.</hi> Job xxxvii. 6. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, in his expoſtulation with Job, inquires, <hi>Haſt thou entered into the treaſures of the ſnow; or haſt thou ſeen the treaſures of the hail?</hi> xxxviii. 22. <hi>He giveth,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>ſnow like wool: he ſcattereth the hoar-froſt like aſhes. He caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth his ice like morſels: who can ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his cold?</hi> Pſm. cxlvii. 16, 17. "At his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he maketh the ſnow to fall apace. As birds flying he ſcattereth the ſnow, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting of graſs-hoppers. The eye marveleth at the beauty of the whiteneſs thereof, and the heart is aſtoniſhed at the raining of it."</p>
                     <p>It is obvious that the productions of nature are employed by the Almighty, through the medium of the ſcripture, to inſtruct us in the unſearchable
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038552_0030_1012585EB85F2ED0"/>
riches of Jeſus Chriſt, which are for the benefit of the ſubjects of his grace; who, I may ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a ſpiritual world in animal life. It is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of remark, that all natural productions named in the ſcriptures, are ſuch with which men are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally converſant, and of which the moſt feeble mind can form ſome agreeable ideas. The bleſſings of grace, however rich and abundant, are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible by the eye of depraved reaſon:—<hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned.</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 14. Therefore, that mind which is illuminated by the rays of the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, not only ſees God in every animal, vegetable, and foſſile production of nature, but graſps the whole as wonderfully deſigned by a wiſe and condeſcending God, to inſtruct us in the more ſublime, ſatiating riches of his grace. Here, then, we may find a ſolution of the query which Broom, in terms ſo delicate, has propoſed—
<q>
                           <l>Why hover snows and wanton in the air,</l>
                           <l>Fall by degrees, and clothe the hoary year?</l>

Does the ſnow fertilize the earth and promote the vegetation of plants?

                     <p>THE Rev. Caleb Evans, D. D. preſident of the ſeminary at Briſtol for the education of young miniſters, was called to viſit a family that belonged to his congregation, and ſaw a young lady ſetting in an eaſy chair, who came to the <hi>hot wells</hi> for the benefit of her health, and boarded with them. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving her unuſually penſive, the Doctor took the liberty to inquire the reaſon. She anſwered—"Sir, I will think no more of it, it is only a dream; and I will not be ſo childiſh as to be alarmed at a dream: but Sir," ſaid ſhe, "I will tell you my dream, and then I will think no more of it." She then repeated as follows:—</p>
                     <p>"Laſt night I dreamed I was at the ball where I intend to go to night: ſoon after I was in the room, I was taken very ill, and they gave me a ſmelling bottle; and then I was brought home into
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038552_0035_1012586C63AF21C0"/>
this room, and I was put into <hi>that</hi> chair, (pointing to an elbow chair) fainted, and died. I then thought I was carried to a place where were angels and holy people ſinging hymns and praiſes to God; that I found myſelf very unhappy, and deſired to go from them. My conductor ſaid, if I did, I ſhould <hi>never</hi> come there again: with that, he vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently whirled me <hi>out,</hi> and I fell down! down! down! through darkneſs, and thunderings, and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, into flames; and when the flames began to ſcorch me, I was alarmed with hideous cries, <hi>and awaked.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Dr. Evans made ſome ſerious remarks on the dream, and deſired the young lady not to go to the ball that night. She ſaid ſhe would, for ſhe was more of a woman than to mind dreams. She went to the ball—was taken ill—a ſmelling-bottle was given her, according to her dream—ſhe was brought home, put into the chair above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—fainted—died!</p>
                     <p>The well known reſpectability of Dr. Evans, and his diſpoſition in not receiving the ſallies of fancy for realities, much leſs giving credit to the many imaginary ſtories which float about the world under the denomination of religious: theſe were ſufficient inducements to the EDITOR to give the above narrative a place in this publication as truly

                     <p>IT is generally obſerved that the greateſt uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men is confined to the meridian of their life; but this will by no means apply to the Son of God while on our earth: for, although his whole life was ſpent in teaching the ignorant, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the moſt aſtoniſhing miracles for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of mankind, yet, his greateſt acts of mercy, and his moſt valuable miracles, were reſerved for the laſt.

                           <l>Lo! Peter bows to cruel fate,</l>
                           <l>And, gall'd with fetters, meets his doom:</l>
                           <l>Remorseless Herod gave the word,</l>
                           <l>And soldiers grasp the vengeful sword</l>

                     <p>ON the 26th of September, 1795, died, in the 32d year of his age, of the malignant fever which then prevailed in New-York, the Rev. JACOB BRUSH, one of the Elders of the Methodiſt Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Church. Mr. Bruſh attended Mr. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, at whoſe houſe he boarded, and who died of the fever; and on the next Lord's-day he preached a ſermon on the occaſion, from Matt. xxv. 23. in the new church. Mr. Bruſh, immediately on his return home, was taken ill, languiſhed five days and died, and on the Sabbath following the Rev. Mr. Kingſton preached a ſermon, from Rev. xiv. 13. in the ſame pulpit, on the death of Mr. Bruſh.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:038552_0048_1012588CA451C290"/>
Shall not this event make a ſolemn impreſſion upon ſurviving Miniſters, that they may ſo faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their office as to be ready to go from the pulpit to the tribunal of Jehovah? What is yet remarkable, Mr. Bruſh, in a few days, was to have been married to Miſs E. M.—How ſoon may our moſt pleaſing proſpects be over-caſt, and we torn from the embraces of our friends, and lodged in the chambers of corruption!</p>
                     <p>Mr. Bruſh, at an early period of life, became ſeriouſly affected with divine things. After deep diſtreſs for ſin, he obtained faith in Chriſt as his Saviour. He then thought it his duty to preach the Goſpel of that Chriſt who had done ſo much for his ſoul, and in 1785 he was admitted as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner into the Conferrence of Methodiſt Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In 1788 he was ordained a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and in 1790 he entered the <hi>Elderſhip.</hi> As a miniſter, he was zealous, wiſe, bold and ſucceſsful; as a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, devout and circumſpect; and as a friend, ſympathetic, kind and conſtant. In his laſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he appeared ſolemnly happy; and, a few hours before his death, he was aſked "Whether he felt happy in God, and had an aſſurance of the divine favour?" To which (by ſigns) he anſwered in the affirmative. The laſt Lord's-day that he preached he appeared to be ſo reſigned to the will
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:038552_0049_1012588E426C29B8"/>
of God, that ſome of the hearers obſerved, "they never heard him preach with ſo much power before, and that he ſeemed to preach as though it were his laſt."</p>
                     <p>Thus was cut off, in the prime of life, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing and uſeful Miniſter of Chriſt, and as highly beloved among the people of his connection.</p>

                     <head>An ESSAY on the POWER of CHRIST.</head>
                     <byline>By the Rev. GEORGE STREBECK.</byline>
                     <p>WHO would conclude, that the babe of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, the tender plant which ſhot forth from the ſtem of Jeſſe, ſhould ever be the great and mighty Potentate of the univerſe! That HE, who ſuffered death on the croſs, ſhould ever travail in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſtrength! Yet ſo it was. JESUS burſt the bands of death, triumphed over the grave, and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:038552_0052_1012589695D278B8"/>
declared that "<hi>all power in heaven and in earth was given unto him.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>I will not detain you to inquire in what reſpects his power is, that of <hi>authority</hi> or <hi>ability,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take notice of its <hi>extent,</hi> and inquire how it was a <hi>gift</hi> unto him.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He exerciſes his power <hi>in heaven.</hi> O! how different the view of Jeſus in the ſtate of his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and that glorious ſtate of exaltation which he enjoys at the right-hand of the Father! Thoſe temples which once were crowned with thorns, wear now the crown of glory and majeſty! Thoſe hands which once were nailed to the croſs, now hold the ſceptre of his kingdom! It is a ſtriking evidence of the power which Chriſt exerciſes in heaven, that angels, with the ſuperior authorities of the celeſtial abode, are ſubject to his authority and control. It was ſaid of Jacob, that like a prince he had power with GOD and prevailed; but in how much more conſpicuous light does the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful interceſſion of JESUS appear in heaven? His <hi>blood</hi> is a powerful advocate for penitent ſinners before the throne above! It ſpeaks better things than the blood of the moſt dear and coſtly ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices! 'Tis that which opens a new and living way to the throne and affections of our heavenly
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:038552_0053_101258982F4A3768"/>
Father, and procures that for us which the riches a <hi>Croeſus</hi> could never obtain.</p>
                     <p>It is a further evidence of the power which Chriſt has given him in heaven, that <hi>heaven</hi> itſelf is at his diſpoſal. This is currently acknowledged in the ſacred pages. PAUL declares his expectation of receiving a crown of righteouſneſs, as <hi>the gift</hi> of his righteous judge. And JESUS himſelf promiſes a crown of life, and a participation of his glory, to thoſe who overcome, by his blood, and remain faithful unto death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. On <hi>earth</hi> alſo Chriſt has all power given unto him. The natural and moral world are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him. At his command the wheels of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture roll;—the ſun goeth forth from his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and as a giant rejoiceth to run his race;—the ſilver queen gilds the night, and the twinkling flames ſhine in their ſeveral orbits. But let us more particularly contemplate the power which he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes with regard to the <hi>rational</hi> creation. He has power given him over the heart of man, to change and make it new; to enlighten the dark under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; to incline the ſtubborn and refractory diſpoſition of the will; to beſtow repentance unto life; and to raiſe the ſinner, who is dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, to a new life of righteouſneſs! In the days of his humiliation, he poſſeſſed the power
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:038552_0054_1012589AB21A9578"/>
of forgiving ſin. On the croſs this power was evinced in the pardon of the penitent thief; and now he is exalted at the right-hand of the Majeſty on high: the apoſtle inſtructs us, that through him is preached unto us the forgiveneſs of ſins. His power on earth is further evidenced in the ſupport and protection of his church. How oft would ſhe have periſhed in the waters of affliction, or been conſumed in the flames of perſecution, had ſhe not been protected by his powerful arm! Although ſhe is repreſented as fleeing into the wilderneſs from the face of the dragon, we behold her coming up again leaning on her beloved. Moſt gladly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may ſhe endure and rejoice in her various af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon her: and, although many of the human race ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not the authority of Chriſt, nor bow to the ſceptre of his grace, yet theſe alſo are ſubject to his power. The power of Satan itſelf is limited by the power of Jeſus: nor can any of the powers of this world, in all their combinations, elude the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol of HIM who doth all his ſovereign will among the kingdoms of men; who, ſitting in the heavens, holds all their malicious machinations in deriſion, will break them as with a rod of iron, and daſh them in pieces like a potter's veſſel.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This power Chriſt himſelf declares to be
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:038552_0055_1012589C5F808788"/>
                        <hi>given</hi> to him. But let not the ſons of infidelity be premature in their triumphs on that account. As GOD, it is <hi>not</hi> given to him. The <hi>fulneſs</hi> of the GODHEAD dwelt bodily in him. He conſequently, as ſuch, poſſeſſed every divine perfection in the ampleſt and moſt independent manner. But as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> between GOD and man, we can eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how Jeſus poſſeſſed this power as the gift of the Father. In <hi>this</hi> character he very frequently acknowledges the ſuperiority of the Father: "My Father is <hi>greater</hi> than I." In this character, he confeſſes the inſtructions and commandments which he had received from his father relative to his office, and in this character alſo he expreſſly aſſerts the power he poſſeſſed. To his diſciples who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with him in his temptation, he declared thus: "I <hi>appoint</hi> unto you a kingdom, <hi>as</hi> my Father hath appointed unto me." This is an inſtance of the power which Chriſt exerciſes in heaven. Now, the Father appointed his reward unto him as <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> by covenant agreement, conſequently his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a kingdom to his followers, <hi>as</hi> the Father appointed unto him muſt ſignify, that he made that appointment in the exerciſe of his mediatorial office. Another example of his exerciſing his power on earth as Mediator is recorded in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Pſalm. Solemnly inaugurated and proclaimed king of Zion,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:038552_0056_101258A08DF5F1B0"/>
his reward for the diſcharge of his office, for which he is authorized to aſk, is the heathen for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion. And, at the ſame time, is veſted with power to deſtroy thoſe who ſubmit not to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority! v. 8. The power, therefore, which he exerciſes in heaven and earth was <hi>given</hi> him, not as he was GOD, but as he was Mediator between GOD and man.</p>
                     <p>And, 4. In that character it was given him as the <hi>reward</hi> of his obedience and ſufferings. Thus we are clearly inſtructed in ſeveral paſſages of the holy ſcriptures. ISAIAH declares, chap. liii. that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his ſoul ſhould be made an offering for ſin, his days ſhould be prolonged, and that he ſhould be ſatisfied in ſeeing the travail of his ſoul. And PAUL more expreſſly declares, that on account of his voluntary humiliation, GOD hath highly exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and given him a name above every name that is named, at which every knee ſhould bow, in token of ſubmiſſion to his mediatorial authority.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A few <hi>reflections</hi> ſhall cloſe this ſhort eſſay. And how <hi>conſolatory</hi> is the idea of the Mediator's power in heaven and earth to the believing mind? Hence they defy, and reſt ſafe and ſecure in the preſence of the ſharpeſt ſpite and rage of Satan and all his legions. God is for, who, therefore, can
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:038552_0057_101258A2274F85B8"/>
be <hi>againſt</hi> them? The power of Chriſt is their defence from all danger; and will be their ſecurity and their ſafeguard amidſt all the ſurrounding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and ſtorms of life. But how <hi>alarming</hi> is the power of Chriſt to the impenitent! To them he appears in all the ſtrength of his majeſty; not as the Lamb of God, but as the lion of the tribe of Judah. Let us therefore ſeek, by a timely recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with him, to elude the fearfulneſs of his powerful diſpleaſure. Let us "kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and we periſh from the day when his wrath is kindled but a little."</p>

                     <p>THIS king was extremely diſtreſſed on account of the ſinful ſtate of his ſoul, and appeared before his brother exceedingly dejected. His brother, the duke, inſiſted on knowing the reaſon; to whom the king replied, "O brother, I have been a great ſinner againſt God, and I know not how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before his judgment-ſeat." The duke, a man of briſk gallantry, not unlike our modern free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkers, replied, "Theſe are but melancholy thoughts," and made light of them.</p>

The king anſwered nothing at that time; but the cuſtom of that country was, (the king being abſolute) if the executioner ſounded his trumpet at a man's door, he muſt inſtantly prepare for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The king ſent the executioner at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and cauſed him to ſound a trumpet before the duke's door; who, hearing and ſeeing the meſſenger of death, ran, trembling, and fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knees before the king, beſeeching him to declare wherein he had offended him? "O, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," ſaid the king, "you never offended me, but loved me; but is the ſight of an earthly executioner ſo terrible to thee, and ſhall not I, who am ſo great a ſinner, fear much more to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgment-ſeat of an angry God?"</p>

                     <p>I. Mark, the Evangeliſt, by this very remarkable ſcene on Calvary, leads us to ſee the literal fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:038552_0059_101258A6688630F8"/>
of prophecy. Iſaiah ſaith, in chap. liii. 12. <hi>He was numbered with the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Mark xv. 28. In this inſtance, how great was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion of Immanuel! and, how ſignificant was it of his office as a ſin-bearer, Iſa. liii. placed on the croſs, between two, who, for their crimes, were hanging between the heavens and the earth, as outcaſts from both? A lively repreſentation of all mankind, who, by their ſins, had robbed God of his honour in his law, and their own ſouls of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal bliſs, in themſelves ſuſpended, by the brittle thread of life, between heaven and hell! And if Jeſus ſaves his people from their ſins, he muſt be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with them, and bear the awful curſe in their ſtead. He did ſo. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us: for it is written, Curſed is every one that hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on a tree, that the bleſſing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Gal. iii. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>II. In the converſion of the crucified thief we have a noble inſtance of Chriſt's free grace and power to ſave the chief of ſinners, in the greateſt ſorrows, and at the lateſt period of their lives.</p>
                     <p>No man can attentively review this ſcene, but muſt believe the ſovereignty of Chriſt's grace, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever prepoſſeſſed in favour of human merit. Here
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:038552_0060_101258AA9FABD190"/>
are two men, both thieves; both condemned; both revilers of Chriſt; both ſuffering death upon the croſs; both deſerving God's wrath, and haſtening to receive the juſt rewards of their deeds in awful eternity; yet, the one is taken, the other left. One ſoul is plucked as a brand from the burning, the other left to conſume! Rich the mercy that reached the one: juſt the judgment that left the other. Will a profeſſed Chriſtian call this conduct of Chriſt in queſtion? Surely he took one ſoul as a proof, that he came to ſave ſome; he left the other as a teſtimony that he ſhould not ſave all. Therefore, let ſinners in their ſins tremble; and let thoſe who have hope in their Saviour be cloathed with humility. One man dies wretched in his ſins, in the very ſight of Chriſt's blood-ſhedding; the other dies in peace, by virtue of the ſame blood, and looks for an endleſs Paradiſe! From this, as well as many other inſtances recorded in the ſcripture, we muſt be convinced, that man's ſuppoſed merit weighs nothing in the ſcale of ſalvation, though proud, fallen nature, would lift her head, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an everlaſting crown as her own reward.</p>
                     <p>As a farther proof of the total depravity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and its diſdain of a complete ſalvation, in a crucified Chriſt, as exemplified in the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thief, I ſhall add, that, if he had poſſeſſed the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:038552_0061_101258AC39422C30"/>
leaſt degree of natural or moral ability to have ſaved himſelf, there were circumſtances every way calculated to have drawn them forth. His ſtate was equal with his fellow ſufferers; he was nailed to the croſs at the ſame time; his condemnation, by the law, the ſame; he equally felt the powers of approaching death; he ſaw the Saviour in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and heard his addreſſes; he hung the ſame time as did the other, upon the croſs; they both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived Chriſt, and both witneſſed his laſt words; both ſaw the ſupernatural eclipſe, and both felt the earth quake and tremble. All theſe things, which may amount to what ſome name calls opportunities, incitements to repentance, &amp;c. &amp;c. made no ſort of impreſſion upon the heart of the hardened thief, and left him the very ſame man that they found him.</p>
                     <p>It is evident, that the pardoned thief poſſeſſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal advantages ſuperior to the other man; he was pointedly reproved by his fellow; he ſaw and heard the amazing moral change in his companion; he heard his pathetic prayer to the Saviour, for a remembrance in his kingdom; and he heard the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's promiſe of acceptance for future bliſs;—all theſe paſſed under his eye, and penetrated his ear; yet the poor man, with all theſe advantages, remained hardened in his crimes; he addreſſed not
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:038552_0062_101258AEC3F2A2A8"/>
the Redeemer unleſs to revile him; he wiſhed not to be honoured with his remembrance; no, nor go into a Paradiſe, if he muſt be indebted to a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Chriſt for the favour. He lived, he ſuffered, he died in his ſins! Let us not boaſt of human ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, but be cloathed with humility. May we learn leſſons of the deceit, the power, the ſtupefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, and look to Chriſt for a free ſalvation! In the poor, hardened, wretched thief, ſee human nature in the perfection of its depravity: in the other, behold the free triumphant grace of Chriſt in its meridian glory!</p>
                     <p>I think I may venture to ſay, that this ſcene of Chriſt's grace on Calvary has its frequent likeneſs among mankind, in every age, and in every place where the goſpel is preached. How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are there, who, for many years, ſet under the ſound of the hiſtory and the truth of the goſpel, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, as crucified among them.</hi> Gal. iii. 1. Yet, like the impenitent thief, they diſdain and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their ſins; while others, equally guilty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, who feel the virtues of the croſs, are brought nigh to God, live an honour to his name, and die triumphant, with heaven beaming upon their ſouls. Thus, the miniſtry of the goſpel is a favour of life to ſome, and of death to others. 2 Cor. ii. 15—17.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:038552_0063_101258B05F52A570"/>
The difference of ſucceſs is reſolved into the grace of Chriſt whom we ſerve:—<hi>By the grace of God, I am what I am!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>III. Let me aſk my READERS if they feel the importance of theſe reflections, and are convinced of their need of Chriſt to ſave them? Remember, you need the ſame grace, mercy, power, and love, to ſave <hi>you</hi> as did the thief upon the croſs. Proud nature will not ſubmit to this. To be ſaved, wholly by the blood, the unmerited grace of Jeſus, which reached the vile malefactor's heart that died upon Calvary, is not what you will ſubmit to, until you have a juſt ſight and an humbling ſenſe of your depravity and guilt before an holy God! Then will you bow before the croſs, while, with a believing eye, you behold the fountain of blood flowing from the Saviour's heart, to cleanſe from fouleſt ſtains; yes, with <hi>Cowper</hi> you will ſay—
<q>
                           <l>"The dying thief rejoic'd to see</l>
                           <l>That fountain in his day;</l>
                           <l>O may I there, though vile as he,</l>
                           <l>Wash all my sins away!"</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>IV. To review this ſcene upon Calvary, as conſtituting a part of the TRIUMPHS of CHRIST, ſhall conclude our reflections. Our Lord entered upon the field of time, met ſin, death, and hell, as
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:038552_0064_101258B493D59F18"/>
the foes of men, and, in order to conquer, he muſt die the death of the croſs; there on, <hi>blotting out the hand writing of ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, took it out of the way, nailing it to his croſs: and having ſpoiled prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, and powers, he made a ſhow of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</hi> Col. ii. 14, 15. He aſcended up on high, led captivity captive, ſat down on the Father's right-hand, and gave gifts unto men, that the Lord God might dwell among them. While on the croſs, though reeking in his gore, behold! he plucks the thief from the jaws of deſtruction, embraces him in his boſom, and bears him to Paradiſe, as a trophy of his grace, and to ſhow all heaven the virtue of his blood! Safe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the vale of death, united with the ſaints in glory, we congratulate the ſaved thief; who, in inceſſant ſtrains, unites with patriarchs, prophets, apoſtles, and the numberleſs redeemed—<hi>Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that ſetteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever!</hi>

                     <head>REPLY to Y. Z. in our laſt Number—"<hi>When will Faith and Hope ceaſe?</hi>" 1 Cor. xiii. 13.</head>
                     <p>PAUL concludes his beautiful deſcription of Charity in theſe words, <hi>Now abideth faith, hope, charity, theſe three: but the greateſt of theſe is charity.</hi> 1 Cor. xiii. 13. There is manifeſtly a preference given to charity above faith and hope, chiefly becauſe faith and hope ſhall have an end, but charity abideth for ever. Charity, or love, is the eſſence of religion and moral virtue. This, in a very conſiderable degree, forms the happineſs of the chriſtian in this, and in a future ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. It, therefore, ſtands foremoſt in the liſt of chriſtian virtues. Faith and hope, though eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the chriſtian character, muſt, I conceive, have an end: To illuſtrate this, let me take St. Paul's deſcription of faith, in Heb. xi. 1. <hi>Now, faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen.</hi> When, therefore, thoſe <hi>things not ſeen</hi> become viſible, and thoſe <hi>things hoped for</hi> arrive, there can then be no further room for <hi>faith</hi> to exerciſe itſelf; it muſt, therefore, ceaſe. The happineſs of heaven appears to me to be what the apoſtle alludes to as <hi>hoped for.</hi> By the eye of faith, the chriſtian ſees a glorious ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

wrought out, and ſecured for him in Chriſt Jeſus;—he believes, that after he ſhall have done ſerving his maſter in this lower world, in which <hi>he ſees through a glaſs darkly,</hi> and where <hi>he knows but in part,</hi> he ſhall be admitted to the bright regions above, where dwelleth <hi>that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> and <hi>that which is in part ſhall be done away; where he will ſee face to face, and know, even as alſo he is known.</hi> When this period arrives, <hi>faith,</hi> agreeably to the above definition, muſt ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>Another definition of faith, differing in words, though amounting to the ſame thing, is a firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on the atonement and righteouſneſs of the Redeemer for ſalvation and eternal glory. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>faith</hi> in this ſenſe, when does it ceaſe? In my opinion it is when the ſoul is put in the actual poſſeſſion of that ſtate of felicity beyond the grave. But when ſhall <hi>hope</hi> be done away? Certainly when thoſe things arrive to our enjoyment for which we are induced to hope; <hi>for what a man ſeeth, why doth he yet hope for.</hi> Rom. viii. 8. My opinion, in brief, therefore is, that <hi>faith</hi> ſhall ceaſe in <hi>viſion;</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> which is our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things future, ſhall be ſwallowed up in <hi>fruition.</hi> In the heavenly world there can be no room for the exerciſe of faith and hope; but <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> alone abideth for ever.</p>

THE HORSE.</head>
                     <p>THE horſe is a genus of quadrupeds, belonging to the order of belluae, in the claſs mammalia. The genus comprehends the horſe, the aſs, and tho zebra; they have ſix erect and parallel fore-teeth in the upper jaw, and ſix, ſomewhat prominent ones, in the under jaw; the dog teeth are ſolitary, and at a conſiderable diſtance from the reſt; and the feet conſiſt of an undivided hoof. The horſe has not only a grandeur in his general appearance, but there is the greateſt ſymmetry and proportion in the different parts of his body. The regularity and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:038552_0070_101258C2E7058850"/>
proportion of the different parts of the head, give him an air of lightneſs, which is well ſupported by the ſtrength and beauty of his cheſt. He erects his head as if willing to exalt himſelf above the condition of other quadrupeds: his eyes are open and lively; his ears are handſome and of a proper height; his mane adorns his neck, and gives him the appearance of ſtrength and boldneſs.</p>
                     <p>To view this majeſtic animal we muſt look for him as nature has formed him, and placed him as an inhabitant of the extenſive deſerts of Africa, in Arabia; and in thoſe vaſt countries that ſeparate Tartary from the more ſouthern nations. Large aſſemblies of theſe animals are ſeen among the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars. Arabia produces a breed of horſes, the moſt beautiful, generous, ſwift, and perſevering. Their colour is brown, their mane and tail very ſhort, their hair black and tufted: their ſwiftneſs is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. The method of taking them is by traps concealed in the ſand, which entangling their feet, the hunter approaches them, and either kills or takes them alive.</p>
                     <p>The horſe, with us, is a domeſtic animal, and is trained up for the purpoſe of huſbandry, the pleaſure of the chace, and the ſervice of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior; and, in each department, he proves himſelf a uſeful and magnanimous creature: admitting, at the

ſame time, ſuch a variety of ſtages, qualities, and circumſtances, that the lower, as well as the higher orders of mankind, may avail themſelves of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and the pleaſures he is calculated to afford. To theſe obſervations let me add, that the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Creator hath ſo ordered, that the animal now under reflection ſhould not only be capable of rendering the higheſt ſervices to man while living, but that, after death, he ſhould contribute to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. His skin is uſed for traces, collars, and other parts of harneſs. Thus, even after death, he preſerves ſome analogy to his ſtate of ſervitude when alive.</p>
                     <p>The eaſtern heathens, the Perſians, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the ſun, imagine that he rode along the ſky in a chariot drawn with fleet horſes, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his light and warmth to mankind; they conſecrated to him the fineſt ſteeds, with which, in chariots, they rode to the eaſtern gates of their cities, as the ſun roſe, to pay their adoration, and to offer their ſacrifices. Other heathens offered the horſe to Mars, as the god of battles. Tacitus is ſaid to have ſupported white horſes in the ſacred woods, at the public charge, from which they drew omens: no one was even permitted to touch them; the prince and prieſt alone faſten them to a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated chariot accompanied them, and obſerved their neighings and tremblings.</p>

Leaving the ſuperſtitions and idolatry of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, let us glance at the ſublime deſcription of this noble animal, contained in the ſacred writings. God, to humble the haughtineſs of Job, and to bring him to a more ſolemn conſciouſneſs of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom and power in creation, thus addreſſeth him: <hi>Haſt thou given the horſe ſtrength? Haſt thou cloathed his neck with thunder? Canſt thou make him afraid as a graſs-hopper? The glory of his noſtrils is terrible. He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his ſtrength: he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear, and is affrighted; neither turneth he back from the ſword. The quiver rattleth againſt him, the glittering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He ſaith among the trumpets, ha, ha, and he ſmelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the ſhoutings.</hi> Job xxxix. 19—25.</p>
                     <p>The callous, impenitent heart of the Jews, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the evil and the conſequences of ſin, are ſaid to be as <hi>the horſe that ruſheth into the battle.</hi> Jer. viii. 6. Equally as thoughtleſs are thoſe who precipitately ruſh before God in prayer, without realizing the infinite majeſty of Jehovah; feeling the wretchedneſs of their depraved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="71" facs="unknown:038552_0073_101258CA77D1BBE0"/>
in a Mediator for acceptance. And, although the real chriſtian may ſentimentally accord in the juſtneſs of theſe obſervations, in too many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as it relates to his walk with God, his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concerns in the world, and in his public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the goſpel, he may too often find himſelf guilty, and lament his precipitance.</p>
                     <p>It is not improper, in this place, to introduce the tranſlation of Elijah to heaven in a <hi>chariot of fire,</hi> and by <hi>horſes of fire.</hi> 2 Kings ii. 11. This ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial vehicle might be a conflux of exhalations or clouds, formed in this likeneſs by a ſupernatural power; and, by the ſolar rays ſtriking on them, might appear fiery and red; much in the ſame manner as our Lord himſelf was taken up in a cloud. Acts i. 9. This idea on the chariot and horſes of fire is conſiderably ſupported by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clauſe of the verſe: <hi>and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</hi>—The mode of Elijah's conveyance to heaven has, however, been more generally conſidered to have been by the miniſtry of Angels, whom <hi>God maketh a flame of fire.</hi> Pſm. civ. 4. <hi>The chariots of God are twenty thouſand, even thouſands of Angels.</hi> Pſm. lxviii. 17. Mr. Henry's remarks upon the ſubject are ſo pleaſing I cannot forbear tranſcribing them. "Elijah muſt remove to the world of Angels; and,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:038552_0074_101258CD31607120"/>
therefore, to ſhow how deſirous they were of his company, they would come and fetch him. The chariot and horſes appeared like fire, not for burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but brightneſs; not to torture and conſume, but to render his aſcenſion conſpicuous and illuſtrious in the eyes of thoſe who ſtood afar off to view it. Elijah had burned with holy zeal for God and his honour; and now, with a heavenly fire, he was refined and tranſlated."</p>
                     <p>The ſpouſe, the church of Chriſt, are compared to a <hi>company of horſes in Pharoah's chariot;</hi> Sol. Song i. 9. not as ranging in the woods, nor prancing in battle, but paired, harnaſſed, drawing with unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſteadfaſtneſs and allegiance, diſplaying the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and magnificence of their Lord. It is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the credit and the comfort of religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend very much upon a ſteady profeſſion; <hi>if ye love me, keep my commandments.</hi> The preſent age of chriſtianity is attended with too great an indifference to the poſitive precepts of the goſpel, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which Chriſt hath graciouſly appointed in his church; and I cannot but conſider that, among the many baneful conſequences of ſuch unſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs, is the triumph of infidelity. Let us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering; for God is faithful, who hath promiſed, and he will never leave nor forſake us.</p>

We ſhall conclude our reflections on this part of natural hiſtory, by adverting to the book of Revelations, in which the HORSE is repeatedly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. <hi>The white horſe,</hi> ſays Dr. Gill, on which the crowned conqueror rode, expreſſed the pure and uncorrupted goſpel, which, with ſpeed, was to be carried unto all nations, for the important purpoſes of converting ſinners, increaſing the viſible empire of Chriſt, and diffuſing the moſt ſublime happineſs. <hi>The red horſe</hi> denoted the perſecutions, wars, and bloodſhed, which the publication of the goſpel of peace, which is contrary to the depraved appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of mortals, and to worldly empire, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly procure againſt the ſaints and ſervants of the Lord. <hi>The black horſe,</hi> the errors which ſhould make rapid progreſs againſt the truth of Chriſt. <hi>The pale horſe,</hi> on which ſat Death, denoted the gradual deſtruction of ſin, ſuperſtition, and every enemy that ſhould war againſt the Lord and his church; eſpecially deſcribing the preſent ſickly ſtate of the Romiſh church, and its ſecular powers.</p>
                     <p>How bleſſed will that period be, when, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the prediction of Zachariah, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD <hi>ſhall be written upon the bells of the horſes.</hi> xiv. 20.

                     <head>Mr. ROMAINE'S Advice, how to become a better Scholar in the School of Chriſt.</head>
                     <p>READ and pray for more <hi>ſelf-knowledge.</hi> God's word and ſpirit will teach you nothing about yourſelf, but what will humble you to the duſt, and keep you there. Read and pray for more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the perſon of Jeſus, God-man; his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation work infinitely and everlaſtingly perfect; he is yours, now he is received, and all he has, and all he is, as Jeſus, yours in title, and, ſo far as you believe, yours now in poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Read and pray for more <hi>faith,</hi> that what you have a title to you may take poſſeſſion of, and ſo make conſtant uſe of it. Your eſtate is great, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely great. Uſe it and live up to it: as you do in temporals, ſo do in ſpirituals. Your money, your land, your air, your light, your meet and drink, and houſe and cloathing, theſe you uſe: but you have them not <hi>in</hi> you; only being yours, they are uſed <hi>by</hi> you. So do with Chriſt. When the ſpirit would glorify Jeſus, he humbles you. When he would glorify his fulneſs, he makes you feel your emptineſs. When he would bring you to rely on his ſtrength, he convinces you of your weakneſs. When he would magnify the comforts
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:038552_0079_101258D9A91401A8"/>
of Jeſus, he makes you ſenſible of your miſery. When he would fix your heart on his heaven, he makes you feel your deſerved hell. When he would exalt his righteouſneſs, you find you are a poor miſerable ſinner.</p>
                     <p>Can you, my friend, practiſe this? Let nothing keep you from Jeſus. Whatever you need, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you feel wrong, may it bring you to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's fulneſs! O that all things may help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your acquaintance with him! I except no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither ſin nor ſorrow: I would carry all to him, as one great lump of ſin, and receive all good from him, as the only ſtore-houſe of good for wretched ſinners. In this communion I deſire to grow; for this I deſire to live. O that you and I may learn it more, and get every day nearer fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with our ſweet Jeſus, growing up unto him in all things!</p>
                     <p>On our learning this leſſon depends our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable walk heavenwards. Every moment we muſt live upon Chriſt's fulneſs, and be every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment receiving out of it grace for grace. A beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in myſelf, but rich with unſearchable, eternal riches in Jeſus. Ignorant ſtill in myſelf, but led and taught by his unerring wiſdom. A ſinner ſtill, but believing in his blood and righteouſneſs. Weak and helpleſs ſtill, but kept by his Almighty love,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:038552_0080_101258DD0A167948"/>
Nothing but ſorrow in myſelf; nothing but joy in him. Oh! this is a bleſſed life. No tongue can tell what a heaven it is, thus to live by faith on the Son of God. Thanks be to him that I know a little of it, and I cannot but heartily pray that you may know more of it than ever you did. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings forever on the Lamb!</p>

                     <head>An original Letter addreſſed to the late Mr. JOHN YOUNG, while under Sentence of Death for the Murder of RICHARD BARWICK.</head>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>UNDER your afflictive ſtate, give me leave to addreſs you a few lines: not to inſult your miſery, but to aid your neceſſary reflection. If reflection becomes a rational mind; if it be, indeed, neceſſary for any man, it muſt be ſo to you, in your near approach to diſſolution. I ſaid, I did not mean to inſult your miſery; no, I am conſcious of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal depravity of man: the ſeeds of iniquity lie deep in all, and, if any are preſerved from open, groſs offences, it is by ſuperior aid than man's. With you, though you are now found a public ſinner, I would drop a tear, and offer my warm
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038552_0081_101258DEA173CFF0"/>
advice, to promote your deep reflection and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>Were I a DEIST, and with ſuch believed, that "human crimes are only injurious to our ſpecies," from this I would attempt to excite your keen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. You have, in a ſudden, violent and public manner, deprived a fellow mortal of his natural exiſtence; whoſe life muſt have been to him as deſirable, ſweet, and important as your own; and life is indeed a bleſſing highly prized, and ſacred to us all. By this unhappy deed you muſt have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured your own peace, intereſt, reputation, and happineſs. You have at once deprived a wife of an huſband, and <hi>nine</hi> children of a father. With violent hands you have taken from the community a member, a citizen, and an officer in the very act of diſcharging his duty. And, I need not add, you have been found guilty of violating the moſt important, and the higheſt law of nature, and of the country, at the vaſt expence of your own life, in the moſt ignominious manner. And are not theſe human offences of the higheſt magnitude? Have not all civilized nations marked them with the higheſt degree of puniſhment? And do they not appear flagrant in your own eyes? Let others entertain what opinion they may of you, I am willing to hope, the wound given to another gapes
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:038552_0082_101229F802612568"/>
wide in your own breaſt. To be guilty of ſuch crimes, and to be within ſight of a ſhameful death, and not to feel conſcious guilt, cannot be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act the <hi>part of man.</hi> Let me, therefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to exerciſe rationality, and review the ſable train of complicated evils which follow your offence. O that you may keenly feel the guilt that covers you, and repent in deepeſt ſorrow! Remember your crimes are ſuch as admit not the ſhadow of reparation; you cannot reſtore the <hi>life</hi> you have taken; you cannot place the <hi>huſband</hi> in the <hi>widow'</hi>s arms; give to the numerous <hi>children</hi> their loſt <hi>father,</hi> nor bring back the <hi>citizen</hi> to <hi>ſociety.</hi> No; neither can you offer reſtitution to the law of nature, and the law of man, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked murder, which peremptorily demands BLOOD FOR BLOOD!! How ſerious, how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing is your caſe! Were there no God; were there no divine law to bind you to the authority of HIM who made you; were there no futurity, no puniſhment beyond the vale of death, your ſtate demands ſerious reflection, and conſcious grief.</p>
                     <p>But, my fellow mortal, ten thouſand evidences pronounce the exiſtence of an independent, holy, righteous BEING; the firſt cauſe, and the laſt end of all things; and to whom <hi>you</hi> and <hi>I</hi> are equally amenable. This throws a ſtill more ſolemn ſhade
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:038552_0083_101258E56C5D6048"/>
upon you. The providence of this unerring God now ſurrounds you, as with a net of iron, and binds you over unto death. The hand of this God is upon you: O that you may feel it, producing conviction and repentance. Attempt not to ſtifle conviction of your accountability to God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member one conviction of conſcience; the leaſt ſtruggle againſt the powers of death not only indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates eternity to man, but pronounces, in loud ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, the certainty of a judgment to come, and to which you are now haſtening. The ſins you have committed are not againſt your own ſpecies <hi>only,</hi> but againſt the God who made you. Dare you ſay the man whom you murdered was not a creature of the Almighty, brought into exiſtence, nouriſhed, ſupported by HIM? If ſo, was it not an high offence againſt that God, intentionally and violently to deprive his creature of life; thereby defacing the divine workmanſhip, and attempting to overturn the government of your God? Was not this taking the right of government into your own hand, and as much as to ſay, the life of the man was at your diſpoſal? That God againſt whom you have ſinned, has declared, <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed; for in the image of God made he man.</hi> Gen. ix. 6. And, you know, Sir, this precept has
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:038552_0084_101258E7090A7FB8"/>
been ſolemnly obeyed by all civilized nations for ſome thouſand years. You cannot be diſpoſed to controvert another ſentence ſelected from the ſame ancient records, <hi>That no murderer hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life abiding in him.</hi> 1 John iii. 15. For, had you poſſeſſed the fear of the Lord, you durſt not have committed the foul offence. No, you follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cultivated, wicked propenſities of your own heart, and cheriſhed the temptations of the devil, therefore you awfully fell. May God ſolemnize your breaſt, and make you feel and lament your caſe! Condemned by the laws of God and man, death with horror awaiting you; the doors of eternity unfolding to receive you; and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable ſolemn tribunal of Jehovah prepared for your final appearance! The ſentence, O how ſhall I tranſcribe it! <hi>Murderers ſhall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> Rev. xxi. 8.</p>
                     <p>My dear Sir, conſtrue not this faithful eſtimate of your caſe as intended to inſult your wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Far from it; I feel for you, and wiſh you to feel for yourſelf. Great ſins need great convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and great repentance. Think ſeriouſly of your ſtate. The hardened, the abandoned alone would ſtifle reflection at ſuch a time as yours. I have read of a felon who laughed at the fate of
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:038552_0085_101258E8A1A78E08"/>
the gallows; but, when the officer advanced to meaſure him for a <hi>coffin,</hi> he trembled, turned pale, and wept.</p>
                     <p>But ſhall I aid your reflection, to realize your guilt, and not tell you of a pardon? Shall I open the ghaſtly wound in your breaſt, and not point to you an adequate balm? True, the law of your country cannot ſave you; the law of nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns you; no mortal can pluck you from the jaws of deſtruction: yet, there is an hand able and mighty to ſave; there is a pardon adequate to your offence; there is a balm ſufficient to heal—JESUS, the Son of God, died for men—for ſinners—for his very <hi>murderers;</hi> and, as recorded in Acts ii. three thouſand Jews, acceſſary to the death of Chriſt, were brought to conviction, repentance, and ſalvation, through the very blood which they had ſhed! Surprizing mercy! rich grace! To that Saviour I direct you; he of whom you have had little thought, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not deſpiſed; that Saviour alone can pardon, heal, and ſave you. <hi>His blood cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from all ſin.</hi> 1 John. i. 7. Theſe are the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting accents of his lips, <hi>Come, unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Mat. xi. 28. <hi>Him that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> John. vi. 37. Thus may you find that mercy in Chriſt which you
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:038552_0086_101258EA593B2310"/>
cannot receive from man! May your death, though awful in itſelf, be accompanied with acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to man, and a pardon ſealed upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by your Lord and Judge! With him I leave you, and ſhall follow this addreſs with my private and public prayers, that you may prove <hi>a brand plucked from the burning.</hi>

                     <p>ON Lord's-day evening, October 29, 1797, died the Rev. CHRISTOPHER GODFEY PETER, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter of the Moravian Church, in New-York.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Peter was born <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Greſlow, Lower Siliſia, in the dominions of the king of Pruſſia. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a phyſician; and Mr. Peter enjoyed the affectionate care of his parents until the ſeventh year of his age; at which time he loſt his mother by death. His father's ſecond marriage proved to Mr. Peter a ſource of diſquietude, as his ſtep-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to him ſo inattentive as to induce his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to place him at a diſtant ſeminary, for his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; where he abode with excellent moral repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation till his ſixteenth year, when he underwent the affliction of his father's death. Mr. Peter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the univerſity of Konigſberg, where he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his ſtudies until his nineteenth year, and then was admitted a preacher in the Lutheran church. After preaching ſome time among this denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he, with ſeveral other young miniſters, were brought under very ſevere exerciſes of mind, leaſt they ſhould profeſſedly have preached to others; while their own ſouls were deſtitute of <hi>the one
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:038552_0096_10125900F07BB670"/>
thing needful.</hi> While in this ſtate of painful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, they heard of the Rev. Auguſtus Gottlieb Spangenberg, a very aged, venerable miniſter of the United Brethren, or Moravian Church: to him they repaired, and from his lips they were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "that if ever their burthens were removed, and their ſouls made happy, it muſt be by a believing ſight of a dear, crucified Redeemer, and who muſt be to them their <hi>all, and in all.</hi>" Relief was conveyed to their hearts: they found happineſs by believing in Chriſt; and, through their connection with this venerable miniſter, they gave the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Moravian Church an inveſtigation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as members, and, in due time, were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1786 Mr. Peter received a call to England, and took up his reſidence at Fulneck, in Yorkſhire, as a miniſter, and a teacher of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. Auguſt 12, 1791, he entered into mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Miſs Sarah Bailey, his preſent mourning relict, by whom he had two children, now living. In the ſame year he came to America, and was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Rev. Andrew Huebner, Biſhop of the Moravian Church, and then reſided for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time at Hebron, exerciſing his miniſterial office. October, 1793, he was ſtationed with the Moravian Church in this city; where, with the approbation
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:038552_0097_101259036C748228"/>
and joy of his church, he affectionately diſcharged the duties of his miniſtry, until the Lord removed him by death.</p>
                     <p>The manner, and the ſucceſs attending the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Mr. Peter, I leave to the more competent deciſion of the people of his charge. As my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with him, as a friend, commenced ſoon after his ſettlement in New-York, and, though of a different religious denomination to myſelf, having enjoyed in him, to the moment of his death, the ſweets of friendſhip, this OBITUARY is compoſed by the EDITOR, as a ſmall teſtimony of his eſteem for Mr. Peter.</p>
                     <p>Never, perhaps, did a man ſuſtain a literary, or miniſterial character, with greater undiſſembl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d humanity. His bowels yearned over the miſeries of the poor; and in one inſtance, known to myſelf, he could give himſelf no reſt until he procured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for a neceſſitous family. Great was his deſire for the ſpread of the goſpel throughout the world, and often he would expreſs his wiſh, if the Lord pleaſed, to preach to the unenlightened heathen. Every good man, of every religious denomination, found a place in his heart. This city is indebted to Mr. Peter, as a uſeful man. He was one of the firſt who meditated the plan, and was zealouſly engaged in eſtabliſhing the preſent exiſting ſociety,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:038552_0098_10125905EEFAB3F0"/>
entitled, "The New-York Society for Promoting Chriſtian Knowledge and Piety among the Poor, by the Gift of Bibles and other Religious Books."</p>
                     <p>But the moſt uſeful life muſt have an end. On the cloſe of the laſt year, he ſeemed to have ſome forebodings, that he ſhould ſoon drop his clay. Nature gradually appeared to break away; but, it was viſible to thoſe around him, that he was often indulged in ſweet communion with his Lord. His pillow appearing wet, it was ſoon diſcovered to be with his own tears. On being aſked the cauſe of his grief, he replied, "No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing grieved him; he was only enjoying nearneſs to his dear Saviour; that he could lay himſelf, his wife, his children, and the church upon his dear Redeemer's heart." At laſt, upon that heart he died, in ſerene ſubmiſſion, and expreſſive hope, that his ſoul ſhould meet his Lord in realms of endleſs bliſs!</p>
                     <p>Mr. Peter was cut down in the prime of his days, being only in the thirty-ſeventh year and fourth month of his age. Mrs. Peter, with her two infants, retired to Bethlehem, where the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the United Brethren have provided a houſe and every agreeable accommodation, for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their miniſters' widows and children. An expreſſion this of chriſtian love, highly worthy the imitation of every religious denomination.</p>

iv. 19. Ignorance and danger attend the evil path of man; nor is the boaſted lamp of reaſon ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to direct the ſoul to peace, and future bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs beyond the grave. <hi>There is a way that ſeemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is death.</hi> Prov. xiv. 12. A new light—a light that ſhall overcome, and chaſe away, the groſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the mind, now becomes abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and ſuch a light the goſpel announces to proceed from Chriſt, the Son of God: <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men; the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> John i. 4, 9. Jeſus ſaid, <hi>I am come a light unto the world, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in me ſhould not abide in darkneſs.</hi> John xii. 46.</p>
                     <p>While, in this eſſay, we attempt, in ſome hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, to explain the excellence of that light which flows from a life-giving Saviour, may its ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial rays ſhine upon the writer and upon the reader, to conduct their feet in paths of bliſs!</p>
                     <p>I. It is pure, celeſtial light—a light from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Not a ſpark of our own creating, or that blazed forth from under the duſt and aſhes of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len nature; but <hi>cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variableneſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhadow of turning.</hi> James i. 17. <hi>That God
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:038552_0101_1012590BA5619480"/>
which cauſed the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 6. Saul of Tarſus felt the force of this light upon his ſoul, on his journey to Damaſcus. <hi>I ſaw, in the way, a light from heaven, above the brightneſs of the ſun, ſhining round about me.</hi> Acts xxvi. 13. Many years had he philoſophically contemplated the majeſty and glory of the ſun in the firmament, and its light ſhone upon his natural path: but here is a light falling round him of a different, more brilliant, penetrating nature—a ſupernatural, celeſtial light, unknown to him before—the riſing of Jeſus, <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs, with healing in his beams,</hi> to create a new day of mercy upon his ſoul. This event, Paul informs us, took place <hi>at mid-day.</hi> How tranſcendently great muſt have been the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Jeſus, to caſt the meridian ſun into a ſhade! Little did Saul think, when, in the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive madneſs of his zeal, riſing early with the ſun, to go to Damaſcus, to perſecute and to deſtroy the chriſtian flock, that Jeſus, the <hi>Chief Shepherd,</hi> would ſo miraculouſly meet him on the road, change the purpoſes of his heart, and give him a commiſſion to feed the very ſouls he was purſuing unto blood! What a change is here! The light
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:038552_0102_1012590FE67D3DB0"/>
ſhining on the dark chaos of nature, to produce the beauties and riches of creation, but faintly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the ſuperior light of grace, falling upon the dark, depraved ſoul of Saul of Tarſus, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the beauties of virtue and true holineſs! In this light he ſaw himſelf, his Saviour and his God; and, from this light upon his mind, he afterwards wrote and preached to others. Not Paul alone, but all who ſet in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, need to receive this light, to guide them to everlaſting peace. This heavenly light diſcovers to us the evil of our corrupt natures: we ſee the tranſgreſſions of our paſt lives in a new and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing manner: the law of God, in its ſpirituality, extent, demands, and inflexibility, appears in its auguſt glory! and in this heavenly light we behold, through the written word, the torments of hell! Happy for the ſinner, that this light never falls upon his heart, to ſhow him his danger, and then to leave him to periſh. No: it guides him into the way of ſalvation in Chriſt, as worthy of God, as it is ſuited to his own ſoul. <hi>I am the way, the truth and the life,</hi> ſaith the Lord: <hi>no man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi> John xiv. 6. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened mind now perceives the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween knowing Chriſt as <hi>a</hi> Saviour, and embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as <hi>his</hi> Saviour—<hi>profeſſing</hi> the goſpel, and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:038552_0103_1012591183858510"/>
of <hi>poſſeſſing</hi> its celeſtial virtues! What delight to a believing ſoul, to call to remembrance the days of illumination—the happy reſurrection morn to his ſoul, when Jeſus, the Sun of Righteouſneſs, aroſe and ſhone upon him! It was, indeed, <hi>as the light of the morning when the ſun riſeth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender graſs, ſpringing out of the earth by clear ſhining, after rain.</hi> 2 Sam. xxiii. 4. Glory be to GOD MOST HIGH, for ſending forth this heavenly light to fall upon any ſinner's heart! and glory be the riches of God's grace, if the writer and the reader can ſay, <hi>He hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, into the kingdom of his dear Son!</hi> Col. i. 13.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The light of Chriſt is attractive. <hi>I am the light of the world: he that followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life.</hi> John viii. 12. <hi>They looked unto him, and were lightened; and their faces were not aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Pſa. xxxiv. 5. <hi>In thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi> Pſa. xxxvi. 9. As the flowers of the garden, after being cloſed through the darkneſs and the tempeſt of the night, expand their leaves on the riſing ſun, follow his courſe by turning to his beams, and emit their fragrance—ſo the believing ſoul, through the darkneſs of affliction and the ſtorm of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:038552_0104_101259131D62EB30"/>
equally opens to receive the genial, animating rays of THE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, and moſt cheerfully follows him in all his holy ways. Nothing will ſpiritually engage the heart of man, but the ſhining of the light of Chriſt! Miniſters, with their various gifts, may pleaſe, and engage the attention of the hearers; but, after all, they are but as the branches of a ſpreading tree, through which the light of life muſt ſhine, to quicken and attract the ſouls beneath. The poor cottager, though clothed in rags, yet enriched with grace, may receive the attraction of Chriſt's light, as the moſt diſtinguiſhed monarch upon earth, with a ſtar upon his breaſt. So free are the rays of Chriſt's love and grace to his people! Generally we find more ſenſibility and happineſs, in Chriſt, beneath the poor man's tent, than in the rich man's palace.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The light of life, in Chriſt, is real. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly called <hi>the true light,</hi> John i. 9. in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the falſe lights of depraved reaſon—the doctrines of carnal men—to the morality of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then—and to vain ſuperſtition: eſpecially as being the reverſe to our native falſe light, by which we were guided into erroneous notions of God, Chriſt, ſin, grace, heaven, and hell. It is no phantom or airy imagination—no heated enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm—
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:038552_0105_101259168CC034B8"/>
but ſincere, ſolid, heavenly, and divine; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſting ſhort of communion with God, as the centre of joy in the ſoul! Its truth is evident from its own purity; leading the ſubject of it from the practice of ſin to the love of holineſs. It never did, nor can, deceive the ſoul on which it ſhines. It as clearly diſcovers to a man's ſoul the nature and permanency of his intereſt in Chriſt—his right to the rich treaſure of grace—and to a bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful immortality—as the light of the natural ſun diſcovers the objects around us, of which we have no doubt nor heſitation. From this certain hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly light ſhining upon the heart, Paul could only ſay, <hi>I know in whom I have believed.</hi> 2 Tim. i. 12. <hi>I am perſuaded that neither death nor life</hi> (with all their attendant ſufferings) <hi>ſhall never ſeparate me from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Rom. viii. 38, 39. Since, therefore, this illumination is ſo great a privilege, and ſo rich a bleſſing, never let us reſt until the <hi>Lord lift up upon us the light of his countenance, and be gracious unto us!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. We may, therefore, add, in the language of the preacher, <hi>Truly light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes to behold the ſun.</hi> Ecc. xi. 7. The young man born blind, cured by Chriſt, and poor Bartimeus, healed through the ſame means,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:038552_0106_10125919EA9AF798"/>
could well atteſt the truth of this remark. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch a cure naturally is a great bleſſing; but to have the eyes of the ſoul opened is infinitely greater! No words can convey a ſatisfactory idea of light to a blind man: but when the eyes are opened, there needs no words to deſcribe; it bears its own evidence. We may talk of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent properties of the light of Chriſt to carnal minds, but they cannot underſtand: <hi>they love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil:</hi> but no ſooner are the eyes of a ſinner opened, than the light of Chriſt, bringing ſalvation to his heart, makes it both <hi>ſweet and pleaſant.</hi> To contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the perſon, office, and glory of Chriſt, in the light of life—to feel this heavenly light ſo beaming upon the heart as to draw forth heavenly deſires, hopes and affections—what can make us ſo happy while on earth?</p>
                     <p>To conclude this eſſay, let us examine if this light has ever viſited our hearts. Night and day are not greater oppoſites in the natural world, than a ſtate of unregeneracy and grace are in the moral world. If ever you have been made <hi>light in the Lord,</hi> you muſt certainly remember, that <hi>you were ſome time darkneſs.</hi> Eph. v. 8. Should you be ſenſible of your blindneſs, and, like Bartimeus, ſet by the high-way ſide, begging—<hi>Lord that I may
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:038552_0107_1012591B884D7530"/>
receive my ſight,</hi> you may take encouragement; for none that ever cried to Jeſus were unanſwered; none that ever came to him were caſt out. Or, ſhould the reader, after many years enjoyment of the light of Chriſt, have loſt the comfort of it, and, like Job, <hi>go mourning without the ſun,</hi> Job xxx. 28. remember that ſome intervening cloud, from the corruption of your heart or the errors of your life, has deprived you of your privilege. <hi>In God is no darkneſs at all.</hi> 1 John i. 5. It comes from yourſelf. Try to ſearch your hearts, and mourn over the cauſe. Remember, <hi>Darkneſs may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> That grace which God hath planted in your heart will nor let you reſt as you are, nor let go your hope in Chriſt as the light of your ſoul. With the amiable Mrs. Rowe, you can ſay,
<q>
                           <l>He is my Sun, though he refuſe to ſhine;</l>

                        <hi>Why then art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him for the help of his countenance.</hi> Pſa. xlii. 5.</p>
                     <p>If the light of life from Chriſt be ſo ſweet to the

heart, and ſo pleaſant to the eyes, in this earthly ſtate, where we have ſo many intervening clouds, ſuch dark and dreary days, and ſuch ſtorms and tempeſts to fill our ſkies;—what joy and bleſſedneſs may we not cheerfully hope to enjoy when tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to immortality! where every tint of iniquity is done away; where no ſorrow enters; and where GOD and the LAMB become the eternal LIGHT of the bleſſed! In anticipation of this ſtate, let every believing heart and tongue cry, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly! Amen.</hi>

                     <p>A MERCHANT of Antwerp, named JOHN DEANS, having lent ſome millions of money to the Emperor Charles the fifth, begged him to do him the honour of coming to dine with him. The Emperor, loth to refuſe on account of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under which he was, accepted the offer, and went to his houſe at the time appointed. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſpared nothing to gratify his royal gueſt; and, animated with a generoſity rarely to be met with, cauſed fire to be ſet to a pile of cinnamon; and, taking the bond which his majeſty had given him as a ſecurity for his money, threw it into the flames, ſaying, SIRE, YOU ARE NOW OUT OF
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:038552_0109_1012592088F810F8"/>
MY DEBT. Could the Emperor ever have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuch an unexpected, unprecedented act of friendſhip? Impoſſible!</p>
                     <p>Much leſs poſſible is it for that man who truly knows the LORD JESUS CHRIST, to forget his unparalleled kindneſs and unſearchable grace! Vaſt the debt we have contracted—infinite in number and malignity, by tranſgreſſing the good law of our ALMIGHTY CREATOR. Yet ſuch was the condeſcenſion and aſtoniſhing love of JESUS, that he willingly offered his own body and ſoul, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more precious than all the ſpices of the eaſt to the fire of Divine anger, to obliterate the bond of our obligation unto God! Or, as the apoſtle charmingly expreſſes this amazing tranſaction—<hi>Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his croſs; and having ſpoiled principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</hi> Col. ii. 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>With what aſtoniſhment muſt the Emperor have beheld the aſhes of his conſumed obligation! How free the royal breaſt from this vaſt debt! Who now, therefor, can make a ſecond claim? Yet, ſtill greater amazement, and more ſolid peace, may poſſeſs our ſouls, while beholding Jeſus cancelling

our obligatory bond to God, by his own bloody ſacrifice! The debt paid—ſalvation complete—juſtice ſatisfied—heaven ſmiles! Only the <hi>aſhes</hi>—the aſhes of our corrupt, fallen, diſabled nature, remains; and this purpoſely to remind us, in time, of what our Saviour hath done; ſo that, <hi>in thoſe days, and in that time, ſaith the Lord, the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reſerve.</hi> Jer. 1. 20.</p>
                     <p>Let, therefore, the Emperor Charles forget the act of the merchant at Antwerp; and let his royal lips withhold the praiſes of his generous creditor; but let us inceſſantly publiſh the honour due to IMMANUEL, who not only hath paid our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe debt in his own blood, but freely conferreth upon us thoſe <hi>durable, unſearchable riches,</hi> which conſtitute our preſent and eternal felicity!</p>

                     <head>Anſwer to the Query propoſed in our laſt Number, page 84, by D. H. "Whether Adam, in his Primitive State, poſſeſſed the Grace of Faith." We offer the following Obſervations.</head>
                     <p>IF by "the grace of faith," that <hi>faith</hi> be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which the goſpel defines—<hi>the fruit of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>

Gal. v. 22. <hi>which is obtained through the righteouſneſs of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt</hi>—2 Pet. i. 1. is connected with, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative of, the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of the ſoul, as the free, unconditional, gracious gift of God—Eph. ii. 8. if this <hi>faith</hi> is intended, then we are of opinion that Adam, in his primitive ſtate, had it not. Adam then was in a ſtate of moral purity; he had not ſinned; nor does it appear that he had the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of his fall by tranſgreſſion; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he ſtood in no need of that faith which embraces a ſaviour, nor the experience of goſpel grace which is revealed to the ſenſibly guilty and condemned; however, it might have been in ſecret counſel with God, prepared for him.</p>
                     <p>If by the "grace of faith," is only meant Adam's confidence in God's promiſe for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and ſupply, we muſt accord generally with that opinion. Such ſort of faith, or truſt, we conſider as a conſtituent part in the moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our firſt parents; and by which they walked with God, and enjoyed the moſt delightful ſatisfaction in the productions of Eden. Without this faith, we cannot believe infinite wiſdom would have pronounced his workmanſhip of humanity, <hi>very good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We cannot, however, but conſider it injudicious
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:038552_0112_1012592835819DD8"/>
to call Adam's faith, the "grace of faith;" the term being unſcriptural, and tending to confound the two great and glorious diſpenſations of nature and of grace. While Adam was in Paradiſe, he knew God only as God of univerſal nature, and enjoyed him in that relation. That which our correſpondent D. H. denominates "the grace of faith," is certainly a bleſſing which flows from a new conſtitution of things, founded upon the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and forms a material part of the <hi>new creature in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> by which the ſaved ſinner enjoys God as his everlaſting father in Chriſt, the fruit of adopting grace and love.</p>
                     <p>After Adam's recovery, we believe that he had pure goſpel faith in Chriſt, the promiſed Meſſiah; the ſeed of the woman, who ſhould bruiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's head. Gen. iii. And, that his ſubſequent walk with God, his worſhip by ſacrifice, his general obedience, was as fully centered in Chriſt's future atonement and ſatisfaction, as did the faith of Paul, Peter, John, or any ſubject of converting grace, in any period of the goſpel diſpenſation.</p>
                     <p>The difference, therefore, of theſe two ſorts of faith, cannot be too accurately marked; the one of nature, the other of grace; one pertaining to a pure, ſinleſs creature, the other to ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by regenerating, converting, perſevering
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:038552_0113_10125929F56BF6E0"/>
grace. We hope, therefore, that theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be inſtructive to our readers, and to D. H. in particular.</p>

THE STAG,</head>
                     <p>OR dear, <hi>Cervus,</hi> in tetrapodology, is the name of a genus of animals, the characters of which are like thoſe of the goat kind; they chew the cud; but they differ in this, that they ſhed their horns, which are internally ſolid, every year. If we
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:038552_0114_1012592E2FB086D0"/>
conſider their ſtructure, and compare them with the goat or the ox, we ſhall find, what will at firſt appear ſtrange, that they more reſemble the latter than the former. The ox and the ſtag differ rather in their groſſneſs and ſlenderneſs, than in any other anatomical diſtinction: the ſkeleton of either is nearly alike; the internal conformation is nearly the ſame; except that the deer kind want the gall-bladder; their kidneys are alſo formed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently; and their ſpleen is proportionably larger. Such are the ſlight internal diſcriminations between two animals, one of which is among the ſwifteſt, and the other among the heavieſt of the brute cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The ſtag is one of thoſe innocent animals which nature has made to embelliſh the park, and animate the ſolitude of the grove. Its colour is, generally, of a reddiſh brown; but differs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the climate he inhabits. The ſtag has the moſt beautiful eye; and his ſenſes of ſmelling and hearing, are in no leſs perfection. Should a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at ſome diſtance, whiſtle, or call aloud, the ſtag ſtops ſhort immediately in his ſlow pace, and gazes on the intruder; and if he perceives neither dogs nor any inſtrument of deſtruction levelled at him, he then proceeds forward without any emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fear. Man, indeed, is not the enemy he is moſt afraid of; on the contrary, the ſound of the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:038552_0115_1012592FCEB916B8"/>
ſhepherd's pipe ſeems to inſpire him with delight; and the hunters ſometimes make uſe of that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to allure the poor animal to his deſtruction. This creature's voice is ſtronger, louder, and more tremulous, in proportion as he advances in age. At ſome particular ſeaſons, the ſtag is extremely wild and furious. Some years ago, William duke of Cumberland cauſed a tyger and a ſtag to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in the ſame <hi>area,</hi> and the ſtag made ſo bold a defence, that the tyger was compelled to ſubmit. The ſtag ſeldom drinks in the winter, and ſtill leſs in the ſpring, while the plants are tender and covered with dew. It is in the heat of ſummer that he is ſeen frequenting the ſides of rivers and lakes to quench his thirſt. He ſwims with great eaſe and ſtrength, and beſt at thoſe times when he is fatteſt, his fat keeping him buoyant, like oil upon the ſurface of the water. As the ſtag is about five years coming to perfection, he lives above forty years; and it is a general rule that every animal lives about ſeven or eight times he number of years which it continues to grow. The horns of the ſtag are greatly in uſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known by the name of hartſhorn. It is calcined for ſome uſes, and made into a jelly for others. The marrow of the ſtag is preferred to
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:038552_0116_1012593297A00110"/>
that of any other animal to eaſe pain, and to ſupple callous parts.</p>
                     <p>It is well known that this animal is devoted to the chaſe in almoſt every country; and generally forms a conſiderable part of the ſport and paſtime of the noble and the great. The deſertion of the chaſe has formed animated matter for the pens of the moſt celebrated poets; and Mr. Hervey, the author of Theron and Aſpaſio, has ſo pleaſingly deſcribed the ſcene, that we are diſpoſed to recite it particularly for the pleaſure of our young readers:</p>
                     <p>"The ſtag, rouſed from his lare, ſhakes his dappled ſides; toſſes his beamy head; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of ſuperior agility, ſeems to defy the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtorm. Firſt he has recourſe to ſtratagem and evaſive ſhifts; he plunges into the copſe; darts acroſs the glade; and wheels about in doubling mazes, as though he would purſue even the foe he avoids. The full-mouthed hounds unravel all his windings, and drive him from his wily arts. Now he betakes himſelf to flight, and confides in his ſpeed. He burſts through the woods; bounds over the lawns; and leaves the lagging beagles far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. The beagles ſlow, but ſure, trace his ſteps through woods, through lawns, through half the extended foreſt. Unwearied, ſtill unwearied, they
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:038552_0117_10125935167A5D30"/>
urge their ardent way, and gain upon the alarmed object of their purſuit. Again he flies; flies with redoubled ſwiftneſs; ſhoots down the ſteep; ſtrains up the hill; and takes ſhelter in the inmoſt receſs of ſome ſequeſtered grove. The ſagacious hounds hang with greedy noſtrils on the ſcent: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, by indefatigable aſſiduity, the ground they had loſt. Up they come a third time; and, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a general peal of vengeance, hurry the affrighted animal from his ſhort concealment. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and in the utmoſt diſtreſs, he ſeeks the numerous herd. He would loſe himſelf, and elude his purſuers, amidſt the multitude of his fellows. But they, unconcerned for a brother's woe, ſhun the miſerable creature, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>xpel him from the ſelfiſh circle. Abandoned by his aſſociates, and haunted with apprehenſions of approaching ruin, he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at every leaf that ſhakes. He ſtarts, he ſprings, and, wild and ſwift as the wind, flies he knows not where, yet pours out all his ſoul in flight. Vain, vain are his efforts! The horrid cry, lately leſſened, thickens upon the gale, and thunders in his ear. Now the poor, breathleſs victim is full in view. His ſprightlineſs forſakes him. His agility is ſpent. See! how he toils in yonder val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, with faltering limbs and a hobbling gait. The ſight of their game quickens the pace, and
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:038552_0118_101259386ED59FC0"/>
whets the ardour of the impetuous hounds. What can he do, ſurrounded as he is with inſulting tongues and ravenous jaws? Deſpair is capable of inſpiring even the timorous breaſt. Having nothing to hope, he forgets to fear. He faces about and makes a reſolute ſtand. The trunk of a ſturdy tree covers his rear, and his own branching horns defend him in front. He ruſhes upon his adverſaries; goars ſome; lays others grovelling on the turf; and makes the whole coward pack give way. Encouraged by this unexpected ſucceſs, his hopes revive. He rallies once again his drooping ſpirits; exerts the little remainder of his ſtrength; and ſprings through the midſt of the retiring route. It is his laſt, laſt chance. He ſtretches every nerve; once more loſes ſight of the rabble from the kennel; and, finding no ſecurity on the land, takes to the water. He throws his burning ſides into the river; ſails down the cooling ſtream; and ſlinks away to the verge of ſome little ſhelving iſland; there, finding a reſting-place for his feet, he ſkulks cloſe to the ſhady margin. All immerſed in the waves, excepting only his noſtrils, he baffles, for a while, the prying eye of man, and the keener ſmell of brute. Diſcovered at length, and forced to quit this unavailing refuge, he climbs the ſlippery bank. Unable to fly any longer, he ſtands at bay

againſt an aged willow. Stands, all faint with toil, and ſobbing with anguiſh. The crowds that gather round him, with mercileſs and outrageous tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, triumph in his miſery. A multitude of blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty throats, joined with the ſonorous horn, ring his funeral knell. The tears, till this fatal inſtant unknown, guſh from his languiſhing eyes, and roll down his reeking cheeks. He caſts one more look on the woods, the lawns, the pleaſing ſcenes of his former delights; and, determined to die, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to ſell his life as dear as poſſible. At this moſt critical juncture, the <hi>royal</hi> ſportſman comes up. He ſees the diſtreſſed creature, and, as ſoon as he ſees, he pities. He iſſues his high command. The prohibitary ſignal is given. The pack, though raving for blood, are checked in a moment, and called off from the prey. Diſappointed and growl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they retire, and leave the intended victim of their fury to enjoy his liberty, his ſafety, and his eaſe."</p>

He is, indeed, according to the Hebrew title of the 22d pſalm, <hi>the hind of the morning,</hi> early appointed to viſit the <hi>Bether</hi> mountains of <hi>diviſion</hi> between God and man; to deſtroy the works of the old ſerpent, the devil; and, although like a ſtag upon the foreſt, he ſhould be hunted by men as a pack of the moſt voracious hounds, (accurately deſcribed in this very 22d chapter) he ſhould thereby be able to ſuſtain the ſouls of his people with his crucified fleſh! Nor improperly is he called <hi>the hind of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> looking lovely and beautiful as the morning; ſwift and cheerful as the hind when it riſes from its reſt and runs its courſe; ſpeedily haſtening, as the beloved of our ſouls, to relieve and to comfort us under the ſorrows of our life. And on the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

morning he ſhall come, with inconceivable ſwiftneſs, to receive and to embrace the ſouls of his redeemed, tranſmitting them to yonder ſtate of bleſſedneſs for ever!</p>
                     <p>To deſcribe the benefits of Chriſt, and the virtue of his grace upon the ſoul of man, who, by nature, has neither will nor power to walk with God, and to diſcharge thoſe duties which are connected with our peace, holineſs, and happineſs, God hath ſaid, by the prophet Iſaiah, that <hi>the lame man ſhall leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing.</hi> xxxv. 6. So great a change does this grace make in healing and animating the ſoul in all holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, that the man who feels it acknowledges, with Habakkuk, the favour to come alone from God. iii. 19. <hi>The Lord God is my ſtrength, and he will make my feet like hind's feet, and he will make me to walk upon my high places.</hi> And how juſtly does this animal of the chaſe deſcribe the intenſe exerciſes of the chriſtian's heart and life? Like the over-driven hart, the believer finds himſelf purſued, and ſometimes is ſurrounded with a pack of vile, enraged foes! Yet, God is his never failing refuge; he has waters to which he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to animate his ſoul; and frequently he unites with perſecuted David, <hi>as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee,

O God.</hi> Pſm. xlii. I. And as the cooling ſtream of the brook refreſhes the panting, hunted hart, to urge on his way in ſpite of every purſuer, ſo the love and favour of God repleniſh the parched ſoul of man until he ſhall croſs the black ſea of death, and gain the ſhore of infinite bleſſedneſs, where neither tears, ſins, nor foes invade; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, undiſturbed repoſe for ever reigns.</p>

                     <p>TO me, no ſocial duty appears more gratifying to the finer feelings of the ſoul, nor more ſtrongly recommended in the ſcripture, than to viſit the needy and the diſtreſſed. I therefore reſolved to call upon a chriſtian neighbour, whom I heard was immerſed in affliction.</p>
                     <p>On entering his chamber, I found him reclined upon his bed, ſo full of grief and dejection as ſcarce able to direct his eyes to his viſitor. I took a ſeat at his ſide, and addreſſed him with all that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs my heart could dictate. Silence ſat upon his lips—he bowed—he mourned within his ſoul! Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his ſpirit full charged with ſorrow, and that under his preſent oppreſſion, converſation might be ineffectual, I propoſed to addreſs the MOST HIGH in prayer on his behalf. Acquieſcing by an expreſſive change of countenance, I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to pour out my heart in ſupplication. On riſing, with an intention to depart, I preſented him my hand: while embracing it, the melting tear fell from his eyes. Preſuming his breaſt might now find a degree of vent, I reſumed my chair, and thus addreſſed him:—</p>

Job, under fore diſeaſe of body, the loſs of full-grown offſpring, and the ſevere reflections, both of wife and friends, had alſo the double calamity of an abſent God. <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaid JOB, <hi>that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his ſeat!

This is a ſubject duly and ſeriouſly to be weighed by all; and eſpecially by thoſe in affliction, that they might know the nature of the Divine conduct to them: that it is not in vindictive wrath an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute puniſhment for ſin is evident; for, <hi>Chriſt hath once ſuffered for ſin;</hi> and God cannot require double ſatisfaction. Beſides, what we are capable of feeling in this life, is but a faint <hi>ſenſe</hi> of ſin; whereas the wicked in hell muſt have both <hi>ſenſe and puniſhment.</hi> Theſe chaſtiſements, which fall upon a man of grace, are fruits of God's paternal love, and ſooner or later will not fail to humble the heart, and return the prodigal to his father's arms. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth.</hi> Heb. xii.

                     <p>—LAST Sabbath, a young man, newly brought to enjoy a Saviour's love, called upon me. Such a ſerious cheerfulneſs and child-like ſimplicity appeared in him as won my heart, and made me recollect what I once felt, but feel not now. How ſoon we ſtep out of petticoats into breeches, and outgrow the charming child-like ſimplicity of the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:038552_0134_1012595E8EE09418"/>
new-birth! Either we become wiſe by knowledge, vain through our gifts, or important by our ſtation. Self-ſufficiency creepeth upon us inſenſibly, like the ſhades of the evening, till we are quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by it; and the bloom of ſimplicity, like the bloom of a plumb when wiped off, is not to be recovered, at leaſt in its primitive bluſh. Many years have I been praying for a child-like ſpirit; but did not know I was praying, or did not intend praying for a furnace of affliction to produce it! Well! I have been in the fire of tribulation ſix years, and have ſcarcely recovered a grain of chriſtian ſimplicity yet;—ſome little bloom appears upon the plumb, at times, but ſeems more like the painter's ſtroke than the tint of nature. I preach againſt ſelf-ſufficiency, and renounce it ſtiffly in my creed, but treaſure it up ſecretly in my boſom. What a cheat and a rogue is a man to himſelf! O for pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats again, to look, and talk, and walk, like a child!</p>

ancient prophets, no wonder ſo many impoſtors ſhould have ariſen, and laid claim to the office. Of this Jeſus Chriſt forewarned his diſciples:—<hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe chriſts, and falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and wonders; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before.</hi> Mat. xxiv. 24, 25. The event has verified his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and, to gratify our readers, we ſhall, from the beſt authority, enumerate the chief of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors that have claimed the public attention!</p>
                     <p>SIMON, the ſorcerer, ſet himſelf forth, in the apoſtlic age, and by multitude, both of ſmall and great, was acknowledged <hi>the great power of God;</hi> yet he ſoon proved himſelf to be <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity.</hi> Acts viii. In the following age, BARCHOCHEBAS, by his impoſtures, drew the moſt terrible perſecutions imaginable on the Jews: his name denotes <hi>Son of the Star,</hi> applying to himſelf the prophecy of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam. Numb. xxiv. 17. The number of Jews who periſhed on account of this impoſtor is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible!—In the fifth century, about the year 434, in the iſle of Candy, or Crete, appeared a falſe Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, called MOSES, pretending to be the ancient le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator of the Jews, come down from heaven to procure them a paſſage through the ſea to Judea.
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:038552_0136_10125962A41D25D0"/>
Great numbers jumped into the ſea, expecting it would open and give them paſſage. In this attempt many were drowned; after which the impoſtor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared. <hi>Socrat. Hiſt. Eccles.</hi>—In the following age, in the year 530, a falſe Meſſiah, called JULIAN, appeared in Paleſtine: under him the Jews took up arms, but the emperor Juſtinian ſending ſome troops againſt them, Julian was taken and executed, and his party diſperſed. In 714, a Jew, called Serenus, pretended to the Spaniſh Jews, that he would conduct them to Paleſtine; but they ſoon found him to be an impoſtor. <hi>Marca Hiſt. de Bearn.</hi>—The twelfth century was very fruitful in impoſtors of this kind, there appearing no leſs than ſeven or eight in France, Spain, Perſia, &amp;c. The laſt century produced a very famous inſtance: about the year 1666, one ZABATI TZEVI, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Aleppo, or Smyrna, ſet up for a Meſſiah. He was ſummoned before the heads of the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue at Smyrna, and being convicted, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death; but none could be found to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſentence; he was therefore baniſhed; and, paſſing through Greece, came to Alexandria, from thence to Gaza, where he found a Jew, named Nathan Levi, whom he perſuaded to act the part of the prophet Elias. Many of the Jews were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. He afterwards came to Conſtantinople,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:038552_0137_1012596520584DD0"/>
where he was apprehended, and ordered to be run through with a ſword; to avoid which, he turned Muſſulman. <hi>Baſnage's Hiſt. de Juiſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some of our readers, probably, expect, in this enumeration, we ſhould have named Mahomet, the pretended prophet of Arabia, who made his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the year 622, but he lay no claim to the Meſſiahſhip, to the performance of miracles, nor to be a ſubject of the prophecies. He approved the prophetic character of JESUS CHRIST, as being extraordinary, and in his paradiſaical viſion is ſaid to homage the SAVIOUR, though all other beings bowed to him. It is well known that Mahomet built his fabric upon the ſuppoſed nullity of the law of Moſes, and the abuſe of the chriſtian religion by its profeſſors; in conſequence of which, he ſaid, <q>God had ſent him into the world, and appointed him his prophet.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>May not believers on the Lord Chriſt, the Son of God, in every age exclaim, with the primitive diſciples, <hi>We have found the Meſſiah, which is, being interpreted, the Chriſt.</hi> John i. 41. With the Bible in our hand, we may clearly perceive, that every feature predicted in the character of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah—the fulneſs of time in which he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear—the miracles by which he ſhould atteſt his miſſion—his grand deſign in making an offering for
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:038552_0138_101259672CA0C248"/>
ſin—his province to build the houſe of the Lord, and to bear its glory—his ability to ſecure, in his own perſon, a triumphant reſurrection from the dead, with every bleſſing, ſpiritual and eternal, that can form the moral happineſs of man. Theſe great and glorious things are found in Jeſus; none of which have been poſſeſſed by any before—none ſince his appearing. He is full of grace and truth, a ſuitable Saviour for loſt man; the experience of whoſe bleſſing attunes the heart, and lays a ſolid baſis for preſent peace and future glory!</p>

                     <head>AN ESSAY On the LAW and the GOSPEL. By the Reverend SAMUEL JONES, D. D. Pennſylvania.</head>
                     <p>BETWEEN the Law and the Gospel there is both a connection and a material difference. The blending of theſe together, or treating them in an indiſtinct manner, has ever been a ſource of error. It is, therefore, the more neceſſary to keep each of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:038552_0148_10125981780C4058"/>
them in its proper place, eſpecially as a legal ſpirit is ſo natural to man, and ſo difficult to be guarded againſt.</p>
                     <p>The difference between the Law and the Goſpel is very obvious. The Law denounces wrath—the Goſpel publiſhes peace. The Law convinces of guilt—the Goſpel brings an acquittance. The Law pronounces ſentence—the Goſpel preſents a pardon. The Law requires ſatisfaction to the laſt mite—the Goſpel announces ſatisfaction made by Chriſt in full. The Law knows nothing of mercy—the Goſpel knows nothing elſe. In the Law righteouſneſs, juſtice, and truth, ſhine gloriouſly—in the Goſpel, love, grace, mercy, condeſcenſion, and compaſſion, ſhine with much more reſplendent glory! In the Goſpel we find free grace, free mercy, free pardon, faith and repentance are freely given; and with them a new heart, a new nature, new life—all is new—all is free. The Goſpel, as the word ſignifies, is <hi>good meſſage, good news, glad tidings.</hi> The language of the Angels, at the birth of Chriſt, was, <hi>Behold! we bring you glad tidings of great joy.</hi> Luke ii. 10. The evangelic Prophet Iſaiah, in that memorable paſſage, applied by our bleſſed Lord to himſelf and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel day, Luke iv. 18, 19. breaks out in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing goſpel ſtrain: <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:038552_0149_10125984D8EB70B8"/>
God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he hath ſent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon doors to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for aſhes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs.</hi> Iſaiah lxi. 1—6.</p>
                     <p>The Goſpel is ſometimes called <hi>the Goſpel of the grace of God,</hi> Acts xx. 24. becauſe it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes the rich grace and mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus. It is alſo called <hi>the Goſpel of ſalvation,</hi> Eph. i. 13. Acts xiii. 26. becauſe it brings to light the way of life and ſalvation, provided of God for loſt, periſhing ſinners. Likewiſe, <hi>the Goſpel of peace,</hi> proclaiming peace, made by the peace-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood of Chriſt; diffuſing peace and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into depreſſed minds; producing a peaceable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, conducting the feet in the paths of peace, and nurturing the ſoul for the realms of peace and bleſſedneſs in an eternal ſtate!</p>
                     <p>The Goſpel brings glad tidings of good things,—good things done for us; atonement being made for us, our debt of ſin fully paid, a righteouſneſs wrought out, pardon and acceptance procured;
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:038552_0150_10125987987CE008"/>
good things wrought in us, regeneration, faith, hope; love, obedience, every grace habitually to prepare us for heaven; all the good things of Providence and grace that are neceſſary for our preſent uſe, during our paſſage through life, and, in their final iſſue, the good things of heaven, the beatific ſtate! The goſpel, therefore, is a diſcovery of all good things for time, and for eternity; ſuch infinite bleſſedneſs which is beyond what the tongues of angels and of men can expreſs, or the powers of the human mind conceive!</p>
                     <p>We add, the Goſpel is a matter of pure revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, entirely unknown and imperceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the light of nature. The revelation of this Goſpel has been progreſſive in every age. The firſt dawning of the Goſpel, conſequently the firſt ſolid ground of hope, appeared to Adam, in the promiſe that was made of <hi>the ſeed of the woman who was to bruiſe the ſerpent's head.</hi> Gen. iii. 15. Here the eternal counſels of the grace of God began to unfold! In the promiſe made to Abraham, which was afterwards renewed to Iſaac and to Jacob, the ſame goſpel grace breaks forth with clearer light. What had before been ſpoken, in more general terms, of the ſeed of <hi>the woman,</hi> is now ſaid, in a more particular manner, of <hi>the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> Gen. xxii. 18. To Jacob, the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038552_0151_10125989324ECCA8"/>
very time of accompliſhing the promiſe was pointed out. Gen. xlix. 10. Moſes renders the promiſe ſtill more manifeſt, while he points out a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and likeneſs. Deut. xvii. 15. In the prophets, who were much further advanced in the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſes, approaching to the fulneſs of time, haſtening to the coming of the Meſſiah, you have his virgin mother, Iſaiah vii. 5. place of birth, Micah v. 2. and other circumſtances pointed out. Thus we obſerve the order and progreſs of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine promiſes, gathering light and ſtrength as they advance. When the firſt intimation of a Saviour was given, he was to be ſought for among all the human race; afterwards we are directed to the particular ſeed of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob; of Jacob's numerous ſons the tribe of Judah is taken; of the tribe of Judah the family of Jeſſe; and of Jeſſe's ſons the houſe of David: thus reducing, as it were, to a point, what had at firſt been delivered but in very general terms.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are ſome of the leading and principal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries that were made to the world of our bleſſed Saviour before his incarnation. Thus did the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and the propheſies become brighter and brighter, until at laſt they ſhone more clear in their full accompliſhments, when the ſun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs roſe, diſpelling darkneſs, and ſpreading the light of goſpel-day.</p>

                        <pb n="150" facs="unknown:038552_0152_1012598BAF540EF0"/>
The revelation of this Goſpel has been made known to ſuch nations, and the application of it made to ſuch individuals of thoſe nations, as it ſeemed good to the will and pleaſure of God. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> Rom. ix. 16.</p>
                     <p>The application of the goſpel, under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the SPIRIT OF GOD, in the work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and converſion, is abſolutely neceſſary, in order to our receiving <hi>ſenſible</hi> benefit from it. In this precious work of grace on the heart, the law, and the goſpel, <hi>as means,</hi> go hand in hand, and are often mentioned in the ſame verſe. By the one is the knowledge of ſin, by the other the diſcovery of deliverance. The one worketh deſpair, the other faith and hope.</p>
                     <p>Thus, the glorious Goſpel, in every point of view, is the work of the rich and ſovereign grace and mercy of God, that the plan of redemption was concerted, publiſhed, and applied to the elect, with all its ſaving benefits. O the glorious and bleſſed Goſpel! O the ſovereign grace and mercy of God, in and through a precious Redeemer! to HIM be glory for ever and for ever—and let all the redeemed on earth and in heaven ſay, <hi>amen!</hi>

                     <head>ANECDOTE OF PRESIDENT EDWARDS.</head>
                     <p>PRESIDENT Edwards tells of himſelf the following anecdote.—I once told a boy of about thirteen years of age, that a piece of any matter of two inches ſquare was eight times as big as a piece of one inch ſquare. He ſeemed, at firſt, not to think me in earneſt; but when I had taken pains to convince him that I knew what I ſaid to be true, he appeared aſtoniſhed I was ſo poſitive; and would argue, how is it poſſible for two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be one inch. It ſeemed to him to be as evident a contradiction as that that which was twice ſo long, and twice ſo broad, and twice ſo thick, ſhould be eight times as large, or that twice one ſhould make eight, or any other abſurdity whatever.</p>
                     <p>When I afterwards ſhewed him the truth of it, by cutting out two cubes, one an inch, the other two inches ſquare, and then cut the two inch cube into eight equal parts, he counted them over and over, and ſeemed as aſtoniſhed as though there had been ſome witchcraft in the caſe; he could hardly believe it, for he was a ſtranger to the reaſon.</p>
                     <p>

"I believe," adds that great man, "it was a much more difficult myſtery to him than the Trinity ordinarily is to men, and ſeemed more palpably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, than any doctrine of our religion to the Socinian and Deiſt. And why ſhould we not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that there may be ſome things that are true that may be as much above our underſtanding, and as difficult to them, as the truth reſpecting the cubes was to this boy? Doubtleſs there is a far greater difference between our underſtanding and God's, than between this boy's and the greateſt phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher's or mathematician's."</p>

                     <p>THEN, after the ſufferings, crucifixion, death and burial of the Lord Jeſus; when his diſciples were depreſſed by unbelief, and harraſſed by their countrymen the Jews, being met together, the doors being ſhut, Jeſus came and ſtood in the midſt, and pronounced peace upon their waiting ſouls. May

the ſame adored Saviour meet with us, who now deſire to meet with him at his own table! May he graciouſly pronounce peace to every heart, and bid us go from ſtrength to ſtrength, till we ſee his face in brighteſt viſion in everlaſting bliſs!</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This was a ſupernatural, miraculous viſit. <hi>Jeſus came, the doors being ſhut;</hi> the account of which has given occaſion to ſome to object to this part of ſcripture hiſtory; becauſe it is a philoſophical maxim, that one material body cannot penetrate another; conſequently the material body of Jeſus could not paſs through the material door unopened, and ſo appear to his diſciples. To this we reply, The body of Jeſus, by death, was ſown a natural body, but was raiſed a ſpiritual body; conſequently materiality is abſorbed in ſpirit. And, as a proof of his poſſeſſing this ſpirituality, he eluded the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace of Mary, ſaying, <hi>Touch me not yet, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father and your Father.</hi> Therefore we believe his ſpiritual body capable of ſuch an extraordinary viſit to his diſciples.—The DIVINITY OF CHRIST gives us another ground to object to this deiſtical ſentiment. <hi>Where two or three are met together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> ſaid Jeſus, as a proof of his omnipreſence. This Saviour converſed with Abraham; with Moſes in the burning buſh; with
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:038552_0156_10125995B8D29D98"/>
the three worthies in the fiery furnace; and could as eaſily converſe with his diſciples, as met together in ſecret for fear of the Jews. The reality of this viſit is firmly and ſolemnly believed by all whoſe heart, like <hi>Lydia'</hi>s, the Lord hath opened. Admit that one material body cannot penetrate another—we apply this to the human heart, that no man, miniſter or friend, can open the heart, and convey bleſſings to another; yet Chriſt can, and doth; for he that made us can alone ſave us, and turn our hearts unto himſelf. A proof of this I preſume to believe is found in the breaſts of many of my readers; carrying with it the cleareſt conviction of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power and Godhead of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This viſit of Chriſt to his diſciples was highly ſeaſonable. They were perſecuted by their brethren the Jews, and therefore ſhut the doors, for fear, upon themſelves: and at this time they were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed with doubts and fears, "if Jeſus was indeed the Chriſt." Full of deſpondency, they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, no doubt, to inquire into the reality of the reſurrection of Jeſus, and of his being the Meſſiah that ſhould redeem Iſrael. Thomas, in an eſpecial manner, diſputed the caſe, and would receive no ſatisfaction. As it was with theſe primitive diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſo it is frequently with the church and people of God in every age. Perſecution, temptations,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:038552_0157_1012599891A29A48"/>
doubts, fears, and a thouſand other evils, compaſs them about; and, if I may ſo ſay, the door of hope appears to them ſhut and barred. At ſuch a time as this, ſudden and unexpected, for Jeſus to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf to them, pronounce the charming words of peace, and make the place of his feet glorious: what an aſtoniſhing alteration does it make in the feelings, views, language, and pleaſures of the happy company!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This viſit was particularly intended for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. They had doubted—they had queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—if the crucified Jeſus was indeed the Saviour, long foretold, and neceſſary to be enjoyed. Thomas, one of the twelve, abſent at a former meeting with the diſciples when Jeſus came, would not believe, and ſaid, "<hi>Except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of his nails, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not believe.</hi>" The dear Saviour, knowing this deſpondent ſpirit to poſſeſs his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, not waiting for the teſtimony or inquiries of Thomas, thus unexpectedly addreſſed him:—"<hi>Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand and thruſt it into my ſide, and be not faithleſs, but believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>" Indeſcribable muſt be the feelings of Thomas at this addreſs! Self-abaſed, convinced, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:038552_0158_1012599C2B73F660"/>
he now exclaims, "<hi>My Lord and my God!</hi>" Juſt ſo the Lord often ſpeaks to us at his table, bids us be familiar with his wounds, his blood, and his heart; then, O then we are aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at our neglect and unbelief, prove his love and grace each day more healing, and aſcribe ſalvation to his moſt bleſſed name!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Although Thomas, by reaſon of his extreme doubts, was particularly addreſſed, yet, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the viſit was general—to one—to all. Jeſus ſaid unto them, <hi>Peace be unto you.</hi> They all had this addreſs before Thomas was ſelected and brought to acknowledgment; conſequently, let their fears, hopes, duties, trials, diſtreſſes, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and unbelief, be what they may, all heard the Saviour's voice, all received the peaceful bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. In the ſame manner he meets his people now, and let their circumſtances be what they may, his loving heart, his watchful eye, his gracious hand, are ſtill the ſame, and upon all; rich and poor, young and old, lambs and ſheep, all find a place beneath his ſacred ſmiles!</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The viſit was in a meaſure permanent; it was not a paſſing by, but a ſtanding ſtill. He <hi>ſtood</hi> in the midſt, ſo every eye might ſee him, and all enjoy his gracious viſit. And here, methinks, was no queſtioning one another, no calling Peter
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:038552_0159_1012599DC98C4A48"/>
to account for the denial of his Lord, no reproving John for his precipitance in calling down fire from heaven upon thoſe who followed not Jeſus, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to Thomas for his negligence and unbelief; but, every eye, every heart was engaged towards Chriſt, who was not only the centre of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but the centre of their joy! Juſt ſo it is where Chriſt makes his viſits and commands his love: all animoſities vaniſh; human frailties are forgotten; of one heart and of one ſoul, they all embrace the precious Chriſt, who is the fountain of their mutual joy! This never fails to be the caſe where a revival of religion is enjoyed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This viſit was attended with benefits: Jeſus pronounced peace unto them, and peace flowed into every heart! Peace is a term that comprehends every bleſſing we can enjoy, and is peculiarly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to us, who by nature are enemies to God, and need his pardon. Jeſus obtained peace by the blood of his croſs: having ſatisfied for ſin, he now has a right to ſpeak peace to the ſinner's heart. O that each of us may hear and feel the bliſsful found!—There were no ſuperfluous, unneceſſary acts in the life of Chriſt; his feet went about doing good; his eyes were fixed with compaſſion upon the wretched, and his hands conſtantly adminiſtered relief: even when his bleſſed hands were nailed
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:038552_0160_101259A0426B04C0"/>
open to the croſs, they were filled with his own blood, which conveys the greateſt bleſſedneſs to guilty men.</p>
                     <p>The privilege of theſe diſciples, in the enjoyment of ſuch a viſit from Chriſt, was certainly very great: they ſaw the Lord, and their hearts were filled with joy: but, ſays the ſame divine Lord,—<hi>becauſe thou haſt ſeen me thou haſt believed: bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi> V. 29. <hi>And theſe things are written, that we might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that believing we might have life through his name.</hi> V. 31. Our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges are greater than thoſe of the diſciples: Jeſus is now aſcended, and ſet down at the Father's right hand, as a ſure pledge of our glorification in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.—Now the promiſed Spirit is to us ſent down, and, under his influence, we know, love, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Lord! May we live in the experience of theſe ineſtimable bleſſings; and may the repeated viſits of Chriſt to us in his church below, be the delightful prelude to an eternal communion with him in the church triumphant above!</p>

                     <p>OUR correſpondent, perhaps, is aware of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain difficulties attending this remarkable paſſage. Some have taken the liberty of rendering the words, <hi>What ſhall they do who are baptized</hi> OVER <hi>the dead?</hi> "it being cuſtomary among the primitive chriſtians, to baptize converts over the graves of believing dead; eſpecially over the tombs of the martyrs." But the New Teſtament informs us of no ſuch ſort of baptiſms. If any had exiſted, and intended for example, we ſhould have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this ſingular rite being performed, by preference, over the tomb of Stephen, the firſt chriſtian martyr. Inſtead of graves and tombs we find the river <hi>Jordan</hi> choſen, and the river <hi>AEnon, near Salim, becauſe there was much water there.</hi> John iii. 23.—On this paſſage we ſhall offer a few plain thoughts; and ſhould our correſpondent, or any other of our readers, poſſeſs better, they are at liberty to maintain them.</p>

It is the obvious deſign of the Apoſtle, in the whole of this chapter, by many different arguments, to prove the nature and certainty of the reſurrection of the dead. The argument in the text is drawn from the uſe and practice of the ordinance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: each one, obſerving that rite, is ſaid to be <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized for the dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The dead</hi> here intended, inſtead of being Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, or any other believing, or martyred, buried ſaint, we believe, is none other than our LORD JESUS CHRIST himſelf, <hi>who was dead, and is alive for evermore.</hi> Rev. i. 18. By the example and authority of this Saviour, and into his name and death, the primitive ſaints were baptized—<hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death?</hi> Rom. vi. 3. Of his death and reſurrection bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is a moſt ſtriking emblem; and all who are believingly and truly baptized do thereby profeſs that their ſouls are waſhed from guilt in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's bloody death; and, as ſure as Jeſus roſe out of the waters of baptiſm in Jordan, and out of the grave on the third day, ſo, aſſuredly, ſhall the dead bodies of his ſaints ariſe in the ſolemn day of judgment unto everlaſting life. Now (as if the Apoſtle had ſaid) if Jeſus be not riſen—if there be no future reſurrection of human bodies from the
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:038552_0163_101259A8BA28F638"/>
grave—then there is no meaning in baptiſm; a profeſſion thereby is totally vain; and thoſe who are baptized have moſt certainly deluded themſelves The queſtion the Apoſtle propoſes upon ſuch a ſuppoſition may therefore be readily anſwered—<hi>What ſhall they do which are baptized for the dead,</hi> if neither Jeſus nor men ariſe again?—<hi>Ans.</hi> Let them renounce their baptiſm; let them proteſt againſt ſuch deluſions; let them caſt contempt on the inſtitutor; let them return again to their former ſtate. For, as Paul ſaith, <hi>they are ſound falſe witneſſes againſt God.</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 15. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion now is evident, and which the Apoſtle hath drawn with his own pen, verſes 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>If the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed: for if Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your ſins. Then they alſo which are fallen aſleep in Chriſt, are periſhed.</hi> If in this <hi>life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> But, it is our happineſs to declare that, we have not believed a cunningly deviſed fable. <hi>Chriſt is riſen indeed.</hi> Abundant evidences prove the event; and the ſpiritual efficacy of Chriſt's reſurrection is felt by every believer, raiſing his ſoul from a death of ſin to newneſs of life. Eph. i. 19, 20. Therefore, this will we DO <hi>who are baptized for the dead;</hi> we will contend
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:038552_0164_101259AA58E90F58"/>
earneſtly for the faith of the goſpel; we will reſt our ſouls, with all their guilt and cares, upon Jeſus, <hi>who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed again for our juſtification.</hi> Rom. iv. 25. Firmly believing, that <hi>if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection;</hi> which was to aſcend on high, and to be <hi>crowned with glory and honour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſhall only add, that from hence it appears that the due adminiſtration of baptiſm perpetuates the hiſtory of the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; and that every one ſo baptized has the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional pleaſure of handing down to poſterity, by their example, this moſt intereſting ſubject.</p>

                     <p>So eſſentially important are its communications to the earth and her ſiſter planets, that the adorable SAVIOUR of ſinners is, in ſcripture, figuratively <hi>ſhadowed</hi> forth to our conceptions, by an idea taken from this <hi>brighteſt</hi> of viſible objects. <hi>The Lord God is a</hi> SUN <hi>and ſhield: He will give</hi> to his choſen people the light and warmth of <hi>grace,</hi> below, <hi>and</hi> crown that grace with perfection of <hi>glory</hi> in the heaven of heavens above (Pſa. lxxxiv. 11.)

                     <p n="5">5. Modern aſtronomers have diſcovered what are commonly called <hi>maculae ſolares:</hi> i. e. certain <hi>ſpots</hi> which hover near the ſurface of the Sun. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a conſiderable number of theſe are viſible at once; and, very often, none at all. Philoſophers are greatly divided as to the nature and cauſe of theſe ſolar ſpots: though it is generally agreed that they are <hi>not adherent</hi> to the Sun's diſk, but ſuſpended at ſome diſtance from it; and there is reaſonable ground to believe, that, after a temporary ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they fall into the body of that grand luminary, and are inſtantaneouſly tranſmuted into one ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did maſs with itſelf.—Whether thoſe reputed ſpots be really <hi>in</hi> the Sun or not, thus much is infallibly

certain, that GOD <hi>is light, and in</hi> HIM <hi>is no darkneſs at all;</hi> no error, no impurity, no defect. The afflictive diſtributions of his providence, and the limited communications of his grace, may, to the benighted eye of unregenerated reaſon, appear like the tranſitory <hi>ſpots</hi> which ſometimes ſeem to disfigure the beauty, and to impair the luſtre, of the Sun.

would take up, in its progreſs from the Sun to us, above thirty-two years at the rate of the <hi>firſt,</hi> and above ſeventeen years at the rate of the <hi>latter</hi> motion; the inconveniences of which would be, (1.) its energy and vigour would be greatly cooled and abated: (2.) its rays would be leſs penetrant: and (3.) darkneſs would with greater difficulty and tardineſs be diſſipated, eſpecially by the fainter lights of our ſublunary luminous bodies.</p>
                     <p>"But, paſſing with ſuch prodigious velocity, with nearly the inſtantaneous ſwiftneſs of almoſt <hi>two hundred thouſand</hi> miles in one <hi>ſecond</hi> of time, or (which is the ſame thing) being but about <hi>ſeven</hi> or <hi>eight minutes</hi> of an hour in coming from the Sun to us; therefore it is, that, with all ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſpeed, we receive the kindly effects and influences of that noble and uſeful creature of God.

Acts ii. 41. What inſtantaneous and irreſiſtible lightning iſſued from the eye of JESUS when he looked his revolted apoſtle into repentance unto life! And, to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate no more inſtances, how great was <hi>the glory of</hi> THAT <hi>light,</hi> which (in a moment, or in leſs time, if leſs can be) ſtruck the bloody phariſee of Tharſus to the ground; transformed the furious lion into a paſſive lamb, and compelled a blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecutor to groan, from the inmoſt of his heart, <hi>Lord, what wouldſt thou have me to do!</hi> Nor is leſs power, from on high, exerted in the ſoul of any man who is effectually turned to God.

                     <p>Do we wonder at the account which philoſophy gives concerning the ſpeedy tranſmiſſion of this lovely element, from its created fountain to the

earth? Let us, rather, value and admire that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely tranſcendent and more important bleſſing, which the following golden paſſage ſo charmingly deſcribes: <hi>God, who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath</hi> SHINED IN OUR HEARTS; <hi>to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 6.</p>
                     <p>Once more. Light does not travel from the Sun, ſo ſwiftly as the quickened bodies of the ſaints ſhall riſe into glory, honour, and immortality, when the SAVIOUR of men ſhall appear, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel's trumpet ſound. <hi>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the dead ſhall be raiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and we ſhall be changed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Sun may, in ſome ſenſe, be juſtly ſtiled <hi>anima mundi,</hi> or the ſoul of our revolving world.

In a greater or leſs degree it permeates the whole region of air, penetrates the inmoſt receſſes of the earth, and diſtributes a competent portion of its beams through the vaſt expanſe of waters. Hence, in and on our planet, there is no ſuch thing as abſolute darkneſs, truly and ſtrictly ſo called.

Nothing is exempted from its notice: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is excepted from its controul. Chance, like abſolute darkneſs, has no real exiſtence.

                     <p>IN this double interrogation are deſcribed the two paſſages through which all mankind, the wicked and the righteous, paſs from time to eternity;—paſſages theſe, infinitely more different in their nature and conſequences, than the terrifying gates which conduct a priſoner to a tremendous dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and the beautiful doors which admit us to a magnificent palace.</p>
                     <p>THE GATES OF DEATH is the paſſage of man from this to an unſeen ſtate, and, figuratively, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns that truly affecting period when the powers of human nature break up;—the cutting of the cord of life;—the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body. This diſſolution, as a pair of maſſy gates, forms the diviſion between time and eternity. As theſe gates unfold, <hi>Eternity</hi> appears, and its events ruſh, with ſolemn awe, upon the mind:—as they
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:038552_0177_101259CB79182278"/>
cloſe with the preſent ſtate, its unbounded enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vaniſh; and the creature, ſtripped of all, bids the world an everlaſting farewell! Theſe gates to ſome, through lingering diſeaſe, may long appear in view; while opening, they may grate upon the ear like harſh thunder; but, the paſſage through them is inſtantaneous, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. At this proſpect, our nature recoils. The expectation of our paſſage through theſe gates embitters the cup of life, and bows our ſpirits to the duſt.</p>
                     <p>But whence this dreadful paſſage to futurity? Can that wiſe and holy BEING, who hath enriched us with ſuch noble powers, ſtrowed in our path ſuch a variety of earthly pleaſures, appoint us ſuch an end? Is this worthy his attributes, or conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his benevolence? Surely not. God cannot take pleaſure in the deſtruction of the work of his own hand. Sin, ſin procured mankind this terrifying exit from time to eternity. The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die. The wages of ſin is death. By ſin came death. Duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return. How mortifying this to our carnal pride; and how alarming to our fears? It was our tranſgreſſions againſt the good law of our Creator that compelled the hand of his juſtice to raiſe thoſe gates of death; the wretchedneſs of
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:038552_0178_101259CF2B3EFFC8"/>
man's death is but the fruit of his own diſobedient life.</p>
                     <p>Let us aſk, to whence theſe <hi>gates of death</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct mankind? To determine and explore a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate, philoſophers, in every age, have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their greateſt powers; and although Nature herſelf dictates the exiſtence of ſuch a ſtate, it is Revelation alone that informs us what ſtate it is. Here we learn, that <hi>as it is appointed to men once to die, ſo after this the judgment.</hi> Heb. ix. 27. That <hi>God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs, by Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ordained.</hi> Acts xvii. 31. Solemn period! big with pleaſure or with pain! Jeſus; ſurrounded with myriads of angels, ſhall rend the heavens, raiſe the dead, bring forth the impriſoned nations of the univerſe, and <hi>reward every man according to his works!</hi> Mat. xvi. 27. What reward can a guilty ſinner expect from the hand of that God whoſe law he hath tranſgreſſed, whoſe unnumbered mercies he has abuſed, and whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience condemns him of every evil that merits the ſevereſt frowns from incenſed juſtice? What, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, can be expected but the ſevere penalty of DEATH annexed to that law which binds us to the authority of Jehovah! Men of cool reflection muſt acknowledge that nature, reaſon, conſcience,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:038552_0179_101259D0C97B71C8"/>
and revelation, harmonize in pointing to this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn period that ſhall terminate our ſtate. It muſt be ſo. The thouſands who laugh at the bugbear death, have their ſecret remorſe and dread of a future ſtate, though pride and boaſting infidelity prevent confeſſion. It is folly in the fool to ſay he hath not thought, nor ſhuddered at the opening gates of death which lead a fellow mortal to that judgment-feat from whence there is no appeal. Who then but muſt drop a tear over the miſeries of human nature: ſo miſerable a life; ſo wretched an end! Is there no balm to heal our woe? Can we diſcover no other paſſage from time to eternity, which, at leaſt, may mitigate the pangs of diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, and give us ſome degree of hope? Yes, there is a way, worthy the God who hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and, at once, delightful and ſecure for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. There are—</p>
                     <p>THE DOORS OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH. Theſe were erected by Jeſus, the friend of ſinners, the Son of the Moſt High God; whoſe eye beheld our wretched ſtate, and whoſe heart engaged him to redeem from the jaws of death and hell. For this he aſſumed our nature, became incarnate, took our iniquities, with all their heinouſneſs and guilt, upon himſelf, that by the merit of his life, and the virtue of his death, he might ſave us
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:038552_0180_101229FF6AE68F28"/>
with a complete and everlaſting ſalvation. This is the ſublime, the rapturous theme of the goſpel! <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> He bore our ſins in his own body on the accurſed tree;—put an end of ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf;—became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto the death of the croſs;—and aroſe from the tomb in teſtimony of his conqueſt, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate our juſtification in him. Thus Jeſus entered the <hi>gates of death,</hi> and, in the dominions of the dead, diſarmed the <hi>King of Terrors</hi> of his ſting; bound him in chains; made himſelf maſter of <hi>the keys of death;</hi> tore down the awful gates, and, upon their ruins, erected the DOORS OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, as the paſſage through which his redeemed people ſhould walk, to inherit the manſions of glory. Here is our happy relief! <hi>Our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light through the goſpel.</hi> Death and the grave are now at the command of Jeſus: and in him we may triumphantly exclaim, "O Death! where is now thy ſting? O Grave! where is now thy vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory?"</p>
                     <p>Theſe doors, erected by the Son of God, differ as much from the gates of death as the ſhadow from its ſubſtance. As a ſhadow is created by the

rays of light falling upon an opake body, ſo Jeſus, the glorious Sun of Righteouſneſs, who is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and life of his people, reflects his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial light upon death as a conquered foe, and thus his mortal ſhadow is produced. As the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the greateſt enemy can do no one an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo believers will paſs the ſhadow of death in perfect ſafety. Behold! how different the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect! Not the terrible gates of an eternal dungeon, but the magnificent doors of a delightful city; or, as the conſecrated doors of the temple of Solomon, which introduced the pardoned worſhipper to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with JEHOVAH, in the Holy of Holies!</p>
                     <p>As the doors of the ſhadow of death differ from the gates of death, ſo does the avenue that conducts mankind to them. Jeſus is the way, the truth and the life to the Father. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt Jeſus, he is a new creature.</hi> By a ſpiritual, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving union with Chriſt, the ſoul experiences new light, life, hopes and pleaſures: Truth, love, meekneſs, benevolence, patience, every virtue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the law, or reſplendent in the goſpel, are more or leſs attendant on this chriſtian's path, and renders him honourable to God, beneficial to ſociety, and happy in himſelf. To him, to live is Chriſt, and, therefore, to die muſt be his gain. David was a man enriched with ſuch grace, and
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:038552_0182_101259D85CD48610"/>
viewed his paſſage to eternity with the utmoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure. <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy ſtaff, they comfort me.</hi> Pſa. xxiii. This valley lies between God's two holy hills of the church militant and the church triumphant. It was but the ſhadow, the faint image, the ſweet ſleep of death, he was to paſs. Every fear ſhould vaniſh as the vapour, and the preſence of his Lord and Shepherd ſhould ſuſtain him with the rod of his power, and comfort him with the ſweets of his love.</p>
                     <p>This paſſage through the doors of the ſhadow of death, does not ſimply mitigate the pangs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving nature, but it bears the ſoul triumphantly from time to eternity, in proſpect of a final acquittal at the judgment-ſeat, and an introduction to the bliſsful preſence of the Lord of glory. As the chriſtian draws near the cloſe of life, the doors of the ſhadow of death gradually unfold. It is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to this man's hope to know at which paſſage he is to make his exit. He knows Jeſus has been his fore-runner, and has, in great grace, appointed him the <hi>delightful doors,</hi> and not the <hi>doleful gates.</hi> As theſe doors open, the everlaſting hills appear in view; Angels ſurround the paſſage to welcome the dying chriſtian to immortality; Jeſus, his well-known,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:038552_0183_101259DBBA521590"/>
tried friend, that ſticketh cloſer than a brother, ſtands ready to own and ſupport him in his laſt conflict, and introduce him to pleaſures that never, never decline. Here, at laſt, we muſt ſtop. Were we to collect the greateſt aſſemblage of earthly honours, riches, and delights, they would infinitely fail in aſſiſting our ideas to eſtimate the bliſs, the glory of heaven!</p>
                     <p>Let me now prevail upon the attentive reader to take a glance of theſe two paſſages to eternity. This becomes his duty, from a conſciouſneſs that through ONE of theſe he muſt ſhortly paſs, to return no more. One is beyond degree terrible, leading the thoughtleſs, the prophane, the unbelieving, the ſelf-deceived ſinner to the judgment of the great day, and to miſeries beyond deſcription awful! the other to the manſions of undiſturbed repoſe, and happineſs coeval with eternity! The former is the neceſſary conſequence of ſin; the latter is the fruit of God's everlaſting love, and the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign grace of the Lord Jeſus. To which are we haſtening? Let us, as ſinners, fly to the Saviour's arms, to be pardoned in his blood, juſtified in his righteouſneſs, and made holy by his grace; then we ſhall anticipate the doors of the ſhadow of death with cheerfulneſs, and know for ourſelves,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:038552_0184_101259DD56F3E678"/>

                     <head type="sub">Mr. JOHN COBBY.</head>
                     <p>WHILE the heroes of the field, the votaries of diſſipation, and the profeſſors of art, each claim a place in the page of hiſtory, to perpetuate their names and their actions to poſterity, it ſhall be our ambition to allot a few leaves, in this publication, to the memory of thoſe whoſe better hearts and lives proclaim the richeſt grace of God. Thus, while <hi>the memory of the juſt is bleſſed,</hi> we ſet their example before our eyes, to ſtimulate us to walk in the paths of Jeſus, and await, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and joy, the period of our own departure to an eternal ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The perſon to be recorded in this obituary is Deacon JOHN COBBY. He was a native of Great-Britain, born at Brighthelmſtone. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

may have been the temper and conduct of his juvenile years, whether moral or vicious, we learn that God was pleaſed to call him, by grace, at an early period; and which ſtimulated his heart, through the ſucceſſive ſtages of his life, to pray for, and ardently deſire, the converſion of youth. In the firſt exerciſes of his mind he was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lively, and frequented public worſhip, among chriſtians of different religious denominations.—When the blaze of his zeal began to fall, and the more ſolid influence of grace to operate upon his heart, he was convinced that the Lord who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed him was King in Zion, that he was called <hi>to have reſpect unto all his commandments,</hi> for public worſhip as well as for private life; and that it was his duty to gain more ſatisfaction on the will of the Saviour than hitherto he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. He was conſtant in prayer, and diligent in ſearching the ſcripture, as the only rule for his faith and practice. At this period his judgment was greatly informed, by a diſcourſe he heard from Numb. x. 29. <hi>We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord ſaid, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the Lord hath ſpoken good concerning Iſrael.</hi> From clear conviction of duty, and with that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn reverence, the ſavor of which ever abode
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:038552_0186_101259E3644BEA78"/>
with him, he publicly owned his Redeemer in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, by immerſion, on confeſſion of his faith; then was received into chriſtian fellowſhip by the church at Woolwich, under the care of the Rev. Mr. M'Gregor, and walked with that people in honour for ſome years. For good and ſufficient reaſons, unneceſſary to be mentioned here, he united with a new-gathered church in the ſame town, under the miniſtry of Mr. Adam Freeman.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Cobby, although he held a place in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's dock-yard at Woolwich, was, in political ſentiment, a republican; which, united with a warm attachment to America, induced him, with his family, to quit his native ſhore, and form a ſettlement in New-York. Perfectly ſatisfied with this favoured land, Mr. Cobby obtained an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and affectionate diſmiſſion from the church at Woolwich, and united himſelf with the church in Fair-ſtreet, where, after due trial, he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a deacon, which office he ſuſtained until his death.</p>
                     <p>He was a perſon of very great diffidence of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, poſſeſſing an abiding ſenſe of the evils of his heart, and his utter unworthineſs, both in the ſight of God and man; frequently adoring the riches of God's abounding grace in the ſalvation of him as the chief of ſinners, and the vileſt of the vile. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:038552_0187_10125AC3981B3BF0"/>
Providence had denied Mr. Cobby the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of education—nor had he ever poſſeſſed a dictionary—yet he was enriched with a moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poetic talent, ſpecimens of which have repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly been introduced into the <hi>Chriſtian's Pocket Library.</hi> He publiſhed a poetic eſſay on the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Glory of Chriſt, and of the Holy Spirit; which met with good reception from many intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, pious readers. He has left behind him a conſiderable number of hymns, and other poetical pieces, which, was due encouragement given to his widow, their publication might be of real bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. His memory was remarkably ſtrong and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, particularly ſo in the knowledge of the ſacred ſcripture, repeating texts verbatim, with ſolemn emphaſis. It always gave him extreme pain to hear any one, eſpecially a miniſter in the pulpit, torture a text by falſe reading, or repeating. And, I cannot but recommend an accurate reading of the ſacred text to my young readers in particular; and, whatever paſſage they may commit to memory, that it be done perfectly. If it is of no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, it certainly diſcovers an attentive and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heart towards the will of God. But, what was ſtill more commendable in Mr. Cobby, was his uniformity and ſteadfaſtneſs in ſentiment, and profeſſion of the goſpel, in his family, and in the
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:038552_0188_10122A0FA0135D60"/>
houſe of God. Through the influence of God's bleſſed ſpirit upon his heart, <hi>he was planted in the houſe of the Lord, and flouriſhed in the courts of our God. He ſtill brought forth fruit,</hi> even <hi>to old age.</hi> Pſa. xcii. 13, 14. So far from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of Solomon refering to him—<hi>meddle not with them that are given to change,</hi> Prov. xxiv. 21. like ancient Judah, <hi>he ruled with God, and was faithful to the ſaints.</hi> Hoſea xi. 12. None could attend to the voice of this good man's prayer, whether in his family or in the ſocial circle of his friends, without a conviction that, in that ſolemn exerciſe, he really <hi>drew near to God.</hi> Although, in private converſation, and when in the diſcharge of his duty as a deacon, his words were few, and his lips <hi>ſlow of ſpeech,</hi> yet in prayer they were abundant, copious, lively, and truly ſolemn; every by-ſtander feeling their weight upon the mind. Latterly, it was evident to myſelf and others, that his communion with God was ſo great, that he was ripening, as the ſtanding corn, for the ſickle of death, and for the heavenly garner.</p>
                     <p>When peſtilence raged in our ſtreets, and ſwept away thouſands, young and old, Mr. Cobby was therewith arreſted, and laid upon his dying pillow. The proceſs of the dire diſeaſe, with him, was very ſhort. He inſtantly felt the arrows of death,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:038552_0189_10122A34E7145948"/>
and wiſhed <hi>to depart, to be with Chriſt,</hi> whom, unſeen, he ardently loved. The nature of the malady prevented him from ſaying much; but he evidently felt richly the preſence of that Saviour whom he then commended to all around him as <hi>the Friend that ſticketh cloſer than a brother.</hi> Prov. xviii. 24. He repeated frequently the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth and the hundred and third Pſalm (Dr. Watts') with infinite ſatisfaction. Perceiving his end to draw near, he called his family around him, and, in a faithful, affecting manner, addreſſed his wife and his children. A ſtranger, who came to attend him, was aſtoniſhed at the ſcene; to whom Mr. Cobby ſaid, "My friend, I do not know you, or whether you know the Lord, but I can now tell you, Chriſt is worth living for, and dying for; and he is now precious to my ſoul" He then ſent his chriſtian love to his miniſter, and to the members of his church, with others, mentioned by name. This done, he piouſly committed himſelf to God; then reſigned himſelf to the laſt efforts of death. And, as though the peſtilence was ordered by heaven to withhold its fury until the good man had performed his laſt work of faith and love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it now ruſhed upon him; poured in its ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt arrows; diſtorted his body; ſilenced his ſpeech; produced the moſt diſtreſſing groans; and, in one

hour, cloſed his eyes in death! aged 55 years. A diſcourſe was delivered on his death from theſe words: <hi>God took him.</hi> Gen. v. 24. Let us, therefore, fly for refuge to a Saviour's bleeding heart, and walk beneath his ſhadow; for <hi>precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his ſaints,</hi> whether it be in youth or in old age, at ſea or on land, by ſlow diſeaſe, or by the nauſeous peſtilence!</p>

                     <p>TO contemplate the fulneſs of Chriſt, muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the moſt ſublime ſatisfaction to a believing ſoul; not only as it leads to a diſcovery of the glory of the Redeemer's perſon; but, as it is oppoſed to all the guilt, the wretchedneſs, and the ruin of man;
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:038552_0196_101259F535B82E98"/>
and is the only ſource from whence reſtoration, peace, holineſs, happineſs, and glory can poſſibly flow.—A fulneſs that, at once, ſupplies the moral wants of the ſinner in this life, and conſtitutes his bleſſedneſs in the next! It is, nevertheleſs, confeſſed, that the ſubject is infinite; and its publication better ſuits a glorified ſpirit before the throne of heaven, than a frail creature here below. However, the bleſſed Jeſus hath put his treaſure into earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and hath commiſſioned men, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his preſence, to teach and preach his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Our attempt, therefore, in this Eſſay, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the fulneſs of Jeſus, we hope, will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a bleſſing, and make known a ray of the glory of Chriſt, who is our <hi>all and in all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>FULNESS is a term uſed by the New Teſtament writers to expreſs the glory of the GODHEAD, the purity of the MANHOOD; the MEDIATO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIAL SUFFICIENCY of the LORD MESSIAH, and the perfection of his BRIDE THE CHURCH.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In Jeſus Chriſt we ſee reſplendent the fulneſs of all thoſe attributes, honours and productions that ever were, or ever can be aſcribed to the ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent and eternal JEHOVAH. He is <hi>the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and the end—the Almighty.</hi> Iſa. xli. 4. Rev. i. 11, 17. <hi>The God of the whole earth.</hi> Iſa. liv. 5. <hi>God and none elſe.</hi> Iſa. xlv.
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:038552_0197_101259F7B41FEAF8"/>
22. <hi>Over all, God bleſſed for ever.</hi> Rom. ix. 5. <hi>The mighty God.</hi> Iſa. ix. 5. <hi>Our God.</hi> Iſa. xl. 3. <hi>My Lord and my God!</hi> John xx. 28. Creation and Providence, which are the immediate and excluſive works of JEHOVAH, are aſcribed to Jeſus; for, <hi>he was before all things, and by him all things conſiſt.</hi> Col. i. 17. The ſeas obeyed his voice; devils trembled at his preſence; angels worſhip at his footſtool; and thoſe who were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered among the polluted dead, aroſe at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand! <hi>The whole earth is full of his glory.</hi> Iſa. vi. 3. <hi>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of ſaints!</hi> Theſe are ſcripture teſtimonies of MESSIAH; acknowledged, as ſuch, by all chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian writers; and are demonſtrative of his eternal power and Godhead.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The term <hi>fulneſs</hi> aſſiſts our contemplation on that HUMANITY which, in the higheſt poſſible degree of perfection, was poſſeſſed by Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth. His body, paſſions, ſenſes, emotions, life, all were the complete meaſure and ſcale of human beings. As ſuch, <hi>he was made under the law,</hi> Gal. iv. 4. and poſſeſſed a moral capacity to obey all its ſpiritual precepts. Truth, love, benevolence, holineſs, magnanimity, conſtituting the fulneſs of human excellence, in its higheſt luſtre, ſo ſhone
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:038552_0198_101259FA338FEBB0"/>
through all his private and public character, as confounded his adverſaries, and compelled Satan to retire, without a poſſibility of finding any evil in him; while it demonſtrated the ſcripture teſtimony concerning him, that <hi>he was holy, harmleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and ſeparate from ſinners.</hi> Heb. vii. 26. Without this human excellence, he, by no means, could have been competent to have anſwered for us, whether by precept or by penalty. But, as the <hi>juſt One,</hi> the Meſſiah, he was repreſented by all the perfect animals appointed for ancient ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and by the pure bodily qualifications neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to conſtitute the High Prieſt under the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic law. Thus, according to the prediction of Iſaiah, we ſee in Jeſus, <hi>the man more precious than gold, even the golden wedge of Ophir.</hi> Iſa. xiii. 12.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But the particular intention of the inſpired writers in the uſe of the term <hi>fulneſs,</hi> is to deſcribe the completeneſs, ability, and richneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, as the BRIDEGROOM, MEDIATOR, and REDEEMER of his Church. This ariſes from the union between the human and divine natures in one perſon; the recital of which forms a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing feature both in the Old and New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments. <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſt in the fleſh!</hi> 1 Tim. iii. 16. <hi>Immanuel,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:038552_0199_101259FBD1258E90"/>
God with us.</hi> Mat. i. 23. <hi>In him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi> Col. ii. 9 This is the <hi>man,</hi> the <hi>ſhepherd,</hi> who bears the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful appellation of Jehovah's <hi>fellow;</hi> Zech. xiii. 7.—who could confidently affirm, <hi>I and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are one.</hi> John x. 30. <hi>All things that the Father hath, are mine.</hi> John xvi. 15. And this is he whom Paul celebrates as <hi>the brightneſs of his Father's glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon.</hi> Heb. i. 3. In him we behold that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed perſonage, long predicted by Iſaiah, THE MIGHTY GOD, in his divinity; THE CHILD BORN in his humanity; THE SON GIVEN in union of both natures, able and mighty to redeem. Iſa. ix. 5. Stand, my ſoul, and, with ſolemn reverence, behold the glory of the Lord Chriſt! poſſeſſed of all the fulneſs of underived, ſelf-exiſtent Godhead, and all the fulneſs of immaculate manhood; each nature admirably diſtinct, with their attendant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; yet ſo wonderfully united as neither of them are confounded; operating in the grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of grace in the oneneſs of a glorious Saviour!</p>
                     <p>By this union, both natures were active to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem; the natural body, and rational ſoul of Jeſus, were conſtituted, or accounted GUILT, as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the one offering for ſin; while the INFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY of the GODHEAD, communicated to the
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:038552_0200_101259FD6B7B06F8"/>
acts of the humanity, rendered them meritorious to the important purpoſes of our juſtification, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſanctification, and eternal glory! To which we add, that the human nature of Chriſt, being <hi>fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone,</hi> the Church, as his BRIDE, was found in him, as Eve in the perſon of Adam, which conjugal union gave him a regal right to take all her contractions, debts, evils, &amp;c. &amp;c. upon himſelf, become reſponſible, and to ſuffer and die in her ſtead.</p>
                     <p>The ſame humanity of Jeſus, the Bridegroom, forms the all-ſufficient glorious channel, through which very ſpiritual bleſſing or grace flows to the objects of his love. <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one: for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Heb. ii. 11. It hath pleaſed the Father, that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwell; and out of his fulneſs have we all received grace for grace.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We are, laſtly, to conſider the term <hi>fulneſs,</hi> as expreſſive of the perfection of the Church of Chriſt. Paul aſſerts this in his epiſtle to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians i. 22, 23. <hi>The head over all things to his church, which is his body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> The <hi>head</hi> forms no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete <hi>body</hi>—the members muſt be united to it;—neither, if the members be incomplete, a hand, an
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:038552_0201_10125A01B9EF1DA0"/>
eye, or foot wanting, the body is not in fulneſs: Therefore, the church, every elect, ſpiritual mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, exiſting in every age and clime, united to Chriſt the life-giving head, by covenant, and by grace, makes the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of the Redeemer's body. The ſame charming truth is expreſſed from the nature of man, as created to enjoy conjugal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—<hi>neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, even ſo is the man alſo by the woman; but all things are of God.</hi> 1 Cor. xi. 11, 12. Chriſt is the huſband of his church; his character, as ſuch, muſt fail, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his bride; ſhe is, therefore, his fulneſs. All his love, power, grace, every part of his mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial riches are given to her. The church, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or collective, or his ſpiritual members, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually, are the fulneſs of Chriſt; their life, peace, comfort, happineſs, they derive from him; they have nothing they can claim as their own but what is freely beſtowed by marriage-contract. No in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace; no outward privilege, but bears the ſtamp of Jeſus;—his miniſters are given <hi>for the perfecting of the ſaints; for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:038552_0202_10125A035679E800"/>
of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> Eph. iv. 11—13. And when the Bride, the Lamb's wife, ſhall have made herſelf ready, it ſhall be granted unto her, that ſhe ſhall be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white; for the white linen is the righteouſneſs of the ſaints. And bleſſed are they that ſhall be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the marriage-ſupper of the Lamb. Rev. xix. 8, 9.</p>
                     <p>It is of infinite moment we learn, from the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that the manner in which the fulneſs of Jeſus is communicated to his people is by the HOLY GHOST. <hi>He ſhall glorify me: for he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore ſaid I, that he ſhall take of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> John xvi. 14, 15. This bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the bond of the ſoul's union to Chriſt. He firſt regenerates and converts the ſoul; creates that faith which enables the heart to embrace Jeſus in all the glory of his fulneſs, and then maintains the ſoul, day by day, in the reception of it, to anſwer all the purpoſes of obedience, ſanctification, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, perſeverance unto death. <hi>Thus, as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſons of God.</hi> And if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his. Rom. viii. 9, 14.</p>
                     <p>Accurately to eſtimate the value, variety, and
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:038552_0203_10125A05D68C3B68"/>
debt of the fulneſs of Jeſus, is abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by men or angels. Exalted on his throne as King in Zion, he hath a fulneſs of light to illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Jew and Gentile from pole to pole. In the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of his church, he hath been her dwelling place in all generations; ſtored with unſearchable riches for her conſolation. Not a <hi>promiſe</hi> in the Bible, not an <hi>office</hi> or <hi>relation</hi> which the Son of God ſuſtains, nor an <hi>ordinance</hi> which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, but proclaim the inconceivable excellence and glory of his fulneſs! Who knoweth the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of immortal ſouls which, in every age, of every tongue, and of every clime, for near ſix thouſand years, have derived virtue from the Redeemer's fulneſs, and were made whole and happy? What bleſſedneſs is now enjoyed by the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect in Heaven? <hi>A number that no man can number.</hi> And, what glories ſhall the Bride re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>who is his body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all!</hi> Eph. i. 23. ZION, BEHOLD YOUR KING! this is he of whom the prophets wrote, and this is he on whom we believe, for preſent peace and everlaſting life. While, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we ſojourn here below, in hope of endleſs bliſs, let every tongue exclaim.—HALLELUJAH, FOR THE LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT REIGN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETH!</p>

                     <p>THE moral law of God, which is the ſtandard of human purity and obedience, and which binds us to God's authoritative juſtice, cannot, in its own nature, make any allowance for human infirmity, or admit any abatement of the perfect conformity which it demands. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> Luke x. 27. <hi>Curſed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.</hi> Gal. iii. 10. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> Ezk. xviii. 4.

breach of the law renders us guilty of the <hi>whole.</hi> James ii. 10.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing a perſon was to break the law <hi>once</hi> in twenty-four hours, to how many would his ſins amount, in a life of ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, ſixty, ſeventy, or eighty years?—At <hi>ten</hi> years of age, it would amount to 3,650—at <hi>twenty</hi> years end the catalogue would riſe to 7,300—at <hi>thirty,</hi> to 10,950—at <hi>forty,</hi> to 14,600—at <hi>fifty,</hi> to 18,250—at <hi>ſixty,</hi> to 21,900—at <hi>ſeventy,</hi> to 25,550—at <hi>eighty,</hi> to 29,200.</p>
                     <p>What, if a perſon's ſins are ſuppoſed to bear a double proportion to the foregoing eſtimate; in that caſe his ſins, at the age of <hi>ten</hi> years, will be multiplied to 7,300—at <hi>twenty,</hi> to 14,600—at <hi>thirty,</hi> to 21,900—at <hi>forty,</hi> to 29,200—at <hi>fifty,</hi> to 36,500—at <hi>ſixty,</hi> to 43,800—at <hi>ſeventy,</hi> to 51,100—at <hi>eighty,</hi> to 58,400.</p>
                     <p>We muſt go farther ſtill. What if a man's ſins keep exact pace with every <hi>hour</hi> of his life? i. e. ſuppoſing him to ſin <hi>twenty-four</hi> times a day, his ſins will then amount, in a life of <hi>ten</hi> years, to 87,600—at <hi>twenty</hi> years of age, they will accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate to 175,200—at <hi>thirty,</hi> to 262,800—at <hi>forty,</hi> to 350,400—at <hi>fifty,</hi> to 438,000—at <hi>ſixty,</hi> to 525,600—at <hi>ſeventy,</hi> to 613,200—at <hi>eighty,</hi> to 700,800.</p>

There is none; but, immediately on conviction, pours down the penalty of judgment, nor once preſumes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of compenſation. How then can fallen man, indebted and undone, and naught to pay, offer reſtoration for his ſoul? <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow myſelf before the Moſt High God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of rams, or with ten thouſands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firſt-born for my tranſgreſſion, the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?</hi> Micah vi. 6, 7. Theſe cannot be accepted; the law demands <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, human,</hi> ſatisfaction; commenſurate to its requirements and its penalties. How truly wretched is the ſtate of guilty man loſt in himſelf! No man can redeem his brother, or give to God a ranſom

for him! An angel's arm cannot pluck him from the gulph of woe!</p>
                     <p>But, ſing O heavens, and rejoice O earth! God's own arm brought ſalvation, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſuſtained him! <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> Gal. iii. 13. His merit, as GOD-MAN, conſtituted by his Father, the ſecond Adam, head and bridegroom of the Church, anſwered every precept of the law by his life, and every penalty by his death, for, and in the ſtead of his people. This is the grand theme of the goſpel; this it is that renders Chriſt worthy of all acceptation. In HIM, pardoned, juſtified, accepted; and to him that has thus redeemed us to God, by his blood, be all the glory!</p>
                     <p>Let now the true believer in Chriſt attempt, from the foregoing eſtimate of the number of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man crimes, to view the vaſt guilt of his immortal ſoul; then, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſin of the world!</hi> John i. 29. What peace, gratitude, and joy muſt flow into ſuch an heart!</p>

But Jeſus ſuffered not for ONE ſoul only, but for a people whom no man can number.

                     <p>TO contemplate the aſcenſion of Jeſus, while we are in certain proſpect of death and the grave, muſt be deemed a neceſſary and an animating em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy. A few thoughts, therefore, ſhall now be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon it; not as it may be diſcuſſed in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive latitude, but as more immediately reſtricted to the double aſcenſion of Jeſus; <hi>once</hi> at death, and <hi>then</hi> forty days after.</p>
                     <p>To the thief upon the croſs our Lord ſaid, <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe</hi>—the heavenly ſtate of bliſs aſſigned for the reception of his departed ſoul. The body of Jeſus died; was taken from the croſs; was embalmed with ſpices; and then laid in Joſeph's new tomb.</p>
                     <p>On the third day the ſoul of Jeſus returned from the celeſtial paradiſe, claimed its entomed body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated it by union, burſt the bars of death, and came forward, performing many of the functions
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:038552_0211_10125A1A1B2B8930"/>
of natural life, as it had done previous to its cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion.</p>
                     <p>After converſe with his diſciples forty days, and appearing <hi>to five hundred brethren at once,</hi>—to convince them of the reſurrection of the very ſame identical body, he went with many of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as far as Bethamy, and there, in the very act of bleſſing them, was viſibly parted from them, and a cloud received him out of their ſight. Luke xxi. 50, 51. Eſcorted by myriads of angels, he was then <hi>ſet down at the right hand of the Majeſty on High,</hi> as a proof of the glory of his perſon, the completeneſs of his works, and as having <hi>become the firſt fruit of them that ſlept.</hi> From thence, according to his own infallible prediction, he will come again to judge the world, and to receive his people unto himſelf, to be partakers of his eternal glory.</p>
                     <p>This twofold aſcent of the human ſoul of Chriſt, firſt without the body, then with the body and ſoul united, is the ſame with the privilege of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed people. Their bodies firſt return to the duſt from whence they were taken; and, inſtantly, their ſouls, their immortal ſpirits, aſcend to God who gave them. Eccl. xii. 7. <hi>Abſent from the body, preſent with the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, on that glorious morning, when the <hi>trump of God ſhall ſound,</hi> and the dead in Chriſt ariſe from their graves, whether in earth, or in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:038552_0212_10125A1BD91D8CD8"/>
of the ſeas, then ſhall their ſouls alſo, as did the holy ſoul of their Lord and Head, each claim their own proper body, now, by the power of God, made like unto the glorious body of the Son of God. <hi>Every man</hi> ſhall be raiſed <hi>in his own order: Chriſt the firſt fruits; afterward they that are Chriſt's at his coming.</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 23.</p>
                     <p>Bleſſed and holy are they that have part in this firſt reſurrection: on ſuch, the ſecond death hath no power; but they ſhall be prieſts of God and of Chriſt, and ſhall reign with him a thouſand years. Rev. xx. 6. Then, after Satan ſhall be loſed for a little ſeaſon, <hi>Gog and Magog,</hi> the combined armies of ſin and Satan, filling up the meaſure of their iniquity, ſhall be prepared for the final judgment; the Redeemer ſhall welcome his ſaints to ultimate final glory! <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from before the foundation of the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How delightful the proſpect! How worthy the riſen Head of the ranſomed Church! How cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our hope, and how nouriſhing to our faith! Well may we ſay with Paul, <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perſuaded that he is able</hi> (by virtue of his divine power, and the merit of his reſurrection) <hi>to keep that which I have committed unto him,</hi> body and ſoul, <hi>againſt that day.</hi> 2 Tim. i. 12.</p>

                     <head>HOW TO LIVE AS A CHRISTIAN, AND TO GLORIFY GOD.</head>
                     <head>An original Letter from the late Rev. William Romaine.</head>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>WITH much pleaſure I anſwer your inquiry: may God make it uſeful to you and to yours!—You wiſh to live as a chriſtian, and to glorify God. A chriſtian is one who lives in Chriſt, and lives upon Chriſt. He is quickened by the ſpirit of life, and made one with Chriſt; and he lives and performs all the acts of ſpiritual life by the ſame way that he was made alive. He who lives moſt in this manner is the beſt chriſtian, and will bring moſt glory to God. This being laid down as your great principle and leading truth, it ſhould be very well eſtabliſhed that you are a believer.</p>
                     <p>HAVE I FAITH?—DO I LIVE BY IT?—AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WAYS?—AND FOR ALL THINGS?</p>
                     <p>Your whole life will be only the uſe and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe few queſtions; but be ſure you get ſcripture evidence of the firſt, left, when you have need of <hi>the ſword of the Spirit,</hi> you ſhould queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as many do, whether it is theirs or not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="212" facs="unknown:038552_0214_10125A2293BFDCC8"/>
As to the ſecond, a main point is to know your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtill a ſon of the firſt Adam, although a ſon of the ſecond Adam, who is <hi>the Lord from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> If you leave out this truth, you will be puzzled at every ſtep; becauſe you will always find ſomething in you acting againſt faith. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, then, the animal man lives an animal life, the ſpiritual man lives a ſpiritual life; and you have both theſe in you. The ſpring of all the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal man's actions is <hi>ſenſe,</hi> the ſpring of all the ſpiritual man's actions is <hi>faith.</hi> To this <hi>faith</hi> he was quickened when <hi>the ſpirit of life,</hi> which is in Chriſt Jeſus, enabled him to believe the record of God concerning his Son.</p>
                     <p>In every real chriſtian there are theſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He lives <hi>in</hi> the fleſh, although he lives <hi>by</hi> the Spirit. The old Adam is continually inclining him to live an animal life; and the new man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually inclining him to live a ſpiritual life, and enabling him too, if he be then living by the faith of the Son of God. So it is written, "The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh." Gal. v. 17. The great employment of every believer is to be found uſing the means of God's appointment to deaden the life of ſenſe, or the luſtings of the fleſh, and to ſtrengthen the life of faith by the aids of the Holy Spirit. Hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:038552_0215_10125A242CED01D0"/>
the neceſſity of the word of God, both to evidence what you are in Chriſt, and what you are to expect from Chriſt, in fighting the good fight of faith: for the promiſes in the word are to teach you what God has freely given to you, and has warranted you to come and to take out of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Son, and to uſe it for your own. His deed of gift is as good a title as you can poſſibly have to any thing in the world; for all the promiſes were made to Chriſt; all the promiſes have been made good to Chriſt; and Chriſt has all power, in heaven and earth, to make them good to you. It is his office and his glory to give you whatever God has promiſed, and you call upon him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow even all things that belong to life and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Your dependence on his faithfulneſs engages him to beſtow every needful grace. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is the life and ſoul of the true chriſtian, and runs through all his experience. Not only prayer and praiſe, reading, hearing, meditating on the word, but alſo the common things of this life, ſhould be carried on in this dependence, both as to our union with Chriſt our head, and as to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him as his members.</p>
                     <p>Here, then, comes in our laſt inquiry—If you live by faith, <hi>is it always? is it for all things?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The command is, <hi>Truſt in him</hi> at all times.—
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:038552_0216_10125A26AD5AF640"/>
Truſt him night and day—ſummer and winter. Truſt him when things go wrong—in ſickneſs and in adverſity. That is the time to truſt him for moſt grace, when you want moſt. Truſt and you ſhall have it; for the word cannot be broken. <hi>According to your faith, ſo ſhall it be done unto you.</hi> Little matters call for his direction, and call for his aſſiſtance, as well as great; becauſe, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him you can do nothing.</hi> By leaving Chriſt out, believers oftener miſcarry in little things than in great. He leaves them to themſelves, and then they blunder, as it is fit they ſhould, who neglect ſuch a guide. He offers himſelf to you, to be your wiſdom, and he would give you his counſel in all your matters. You cannot think till you try, and by conſtant trial improve it, what a happineſs it is thus to live upon Chriſt as your teacher. He would keep you from ten thouſand ſcrapes, guide you through difficulties, bleſs you under troubles; yea, he would give you a ſpiritual uſe of temporal things. Reſolve upon ſomething of this, and wait the event. In your family, in your field, in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling, conſult Chriſt about all. Improve this hint: eat and drink, and lie down and riſe up; do all, eyeing him, and then all will proſper.</p>

                     <p>IN preſerving memoirs of thoſe whom God hath diſtinguiſhed by his goodneſs, whether in private or in public life, is one mean by which, <hi>in the ages to come, God ſets forth the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us, by Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and never fails to ſtimulate the followers of the Lamb in faith and love, to purſue the path with greater ardour that leadeth to everlaſting life. It is with theſe views we attempt to draw the outlines of the life and character of the truly venerable Mr. Hart.</p>
                     <p>For the encouragement of our young readers, it affords us pleaſure that we have it in our power to ſay, Mr. Hart was enriched with the grace of Chriſt in his youth; and, from a ſenſe of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's love, devoted himſelf to God, by baptiſm, and was received a member of the church at South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, April 3, 1741, being ſeventeen years and nine months old. How unſpeakably happy this youth! while many others of his age purſued the paths of corruption, that unavoidably prepare them
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:038552_0218_10125A2BE9565620"/>
for deepeſt ſorrows in old age, Mr. Hart had a long and happy race before him, to promote the intereſt of his fellow mortals, enjoy the ſweets of virtuous life, and honour his God and Saviour. Thus planted in the houſe of the Lord, and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt Jeſus, Mr. Hart flouriſhed in gifts and grace ſo eminently, that the church beheld him as one evidently deſigned of the Lord to bear the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the goſpel. Accordingly, after due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, on Dec. 20, 1746, they ſent him forth, with teſtimonial letters, accompanied with fervent prayers for his proſperity in the cauſe of Chriſt. Three years after he received ordination, and accepted a call from the church at Charleſton, South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina; the paſtoral care of which he honourably and ſucceſsfully maintained for thirty years. On the approach of the Britiſh fleet and army, Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 16, 1780, determining to preſerve his political liberty, he retired to the northern ſtates. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the church at Hopewell, New-Jerſey, was ſoon directed to Mr. Hart, and on December 16, in the ſame year, he became their Paſtor, ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with fidelity and ſucceſs, until his removal by death, December 31, 1795, aged 72 years, 5 months and 26 days.</p>
                     <p>As a teſtimony of reſpect to this good man, an excellent ſermon was delivered in Charleſton, South-Carolina,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:038552_0219_10125A2E6A0AD528"/>
by the Rev. Richard Furman, M. A. February 7, 1796; and, on April 4, an animated diſcourſe was delivered on the ſame occaſion at Hopewell, New-Jerſey, by the Rev. William Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, D. D. From thoſe valuable publications, and from ſome manuſcript materials communicated by Mrs. Hart to the Editor of the Chriſtian's Pocket Library, we will attempt to draw ſome general outlines of this pious man's private and public cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, not only as a memorial of the diſtinguiſhing grace of God upon him, but to ſtimulate our own ſouls to copy after the pattern of ſo excellent a life, that was crowned with ſo glorious an end.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As a chriſtian he was, indeed, one with Chriſt, "To him, to live was Chriſt." Phil. i. 21. The PERSON of Chriſt was the object of his affections; the BLOOD of Chriſt was the fountain of his pardon; the RIGHTEOUSNESS of Chriſt was the ground of his juſtification and communion with Jehovah; and the GLORY of Chriſt was the determinate end of all his actions. His whole dependence, living and dying, was upon Chriſt; for being near his end, a perſon ſitting by, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great bodily diſtreſs, ſaid, "how happy for Mr. Hart that he has but one work to do;" (dying was meant) to which Mr. Hart immediately replied, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:038552_0220_10125A31CC6B13C0"/>
to every one that believeth.</hi> The TRUTH, as it is in Chriſt, was deeply engraven upon the breaſt of Mr. Hart; ſo deeply, that it was, indeed, to him, ineſtimably precious; and the TEMPER of Jeſus, in a moſt eminent degree, ſhone in all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, by which he was univerſally reſpected and beloved. He was a man of prayer; great was his communion with God, and by this he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and ſupported under all the ills of life. This is evinced by the following lines, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in a time of diſtreſs:

2. In domeſtic life, the huſband, father, friend and maſter, in their ſacred principles, and their moſt endearing ties, were highly eminent in Mr. Oliver Hart. He was not a <hi>ſaint</hi> abroad and a <hi>devil</hi> at home, but ſtedfaſt and invariable in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and in public; never ſo happy as when tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſteps of his Lord and Saviour, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering every one happy that reſided beneath his roof. Mr. Hart was twice married. His firſt wife was Miſs Sarah Brees, by whom he had eight children, <hi>two</hi> only of whom are now living. His ſecond wife, his preſent relict, was Mrs. Ann Grimball, by whom he had two ſons: the firſt died young—the other is ſtill living, paſſing through his ſtudies, under the Rev. Mr. Stoughton; and, it is devoutly wiſhed, that the youth may form the amiable character of his father, and be a ſolace to the declining days of his pious mother! Perhaps the domeſtic life of Mr. Hart cannot be more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pourtrayed than as drawn by the pen of his wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, in a letter to the editor of this publication.—"My loſs is great, although my dear huſband's gain. I mourn not as thoſe who have no hope: no! yet I have cauſe to mourn. I miſs him day by day. No more I hear his harmonious voice ſounding from the ſacred deſk <hi>the everlaſting goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> No more the morning and evening ſacrifice
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:038552_0222_10125A370DBC1D00"/>
of praiſe. No more his preſence gladdens my ſight. My protector, guide, head, beſt earthly friend—gone! Yes—the pious father of my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſon—left without a guide, example, precept, in his giddy ſtate. Circumſtances aggravate my loſs—yet I would not murmur, but be humble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God's mighty hand! He hath cut off the <hi>ſtream</hi>—HIMSELF is yet the everlaſting <hi>fountain,</hi> and can conſolation ſend through redeeming grace and dying love!" It is often ſaid, "He is a bad father that is not miſſed:" but what female eye can forbear the tear over a widow who laments the loſs of ſo kind an huſband! and what man's breaſt but muſt glow with ardour to leave ſo noble a teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony behind him as huſband, father, friend!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Charmed with this good man's character at home and abroad, let us glance at him in his more public ſtation, as a miniſter of the goſpel of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He that firſt makes not good his claim to a <hi>chriſtian,</hi> illy pretends the chriſtian <hi>teacher!</hi> The waters of ſpiritual life, in copious ſtreams, flowed ſenſibly through the ſoul of Mr. Hart, and from this ſource his mouth ſpake the glories of the Lamb—the completeneſs of ſalvation—the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the ſaints—the beauties of Zion—the vaſt, the inconceivable ſolemnities of the eternal world! The churches at Southampton, at Charleſton, and
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:038552_0223_10125A38A644A568"/>
at Hopewell, have his praiſes in their gates; which, probably, can be exceeded only by thoſe individuals, in the different parts of the continent, to whom God bleſſed his miniſtry for the converſion of their ſouls. With what ſenſibility would he viſit the houſe of woe, and tenderly wipe away the tear of grief by goſpel conſolation!—The private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic duties of the paſtoral office he diſcharged with ſuch fidelity, heavenly-mindedneſs, and amiable fortitude, that every deſcription of characters, among the flocks of his care, loved and honoured him as <hi>a man of God.</hi> With admirable juſtneſs has Dr. Rogers aſſerted, in his ſermon—"In our aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he has ſcarcely left his <hi>equal:</hi> in the United States, with diffidence be it ſpoken, viewing him in the whole of his character, he has not left his <hi>ſuperior.</hi>" And, while we thus ſpeak his praiſe, we diſdain the flatterer's art. His life, his actions, were the fruit of grace, and ſtand on record, to inſpire our ſouls to tread the paths of Zion, with equal honour and with equal ſucceſs. Had COW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER heard him preach, and beheld him ſtanding, with his wonted ſolemn air, between the living and the dead, his pen would not be charged with being dipt in ſoul flattery, while drawing his portrait:

Although we have nearly extended the limits uſually allotted to the ſeveral pieces introduced into this publication, yet we muſt add, that the literary character of Mr. Hart was worthy of eſteem.—Notwithſtanding he had not the advantages of a collegiate education, his own induſtry was ſo great, that he made very conſiderable advancement in claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical learning. The college at Rhode-Iſland was not inattentive to his worth; for, in the year 1769, they conferred on him the degree of <hi>Maſter in the Arts.</hi> What is moſt worthy of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is, that every acquiſition in ſcience he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſo far valuable as to promote his ſpirituality, and his greater uſefulneſs as a miniſter of Jeſus. Several of his valuable diſcourſes, and other pieces, have been publiſhed, and univerſally received.

Other excellent manuſcripts are in the hand of his widow, which, with extracts from his diary, would prove highly advantageous, was ſuitable encouragement offered for their publication.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. From theſe general traits, happily evident in the character of Mr. Hart, as a chriſtian and as a miniſter, maintained with ſuch uniformity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, with ſuch ſolemnity and deep humility, for ſo many years, amidſt ſo many changes and variety of duties, we are anxious to mark the laſt ſcenes of his life. In this we are charmed, and by this we have hope.</p>

From a ſenſe of his emaciated animal nature, he would frequently lift up his hands, and exclaim, <hi>Poor mortal man!</hi> to which a friend once replied, <hi>This mortal ſhall put on immortality:</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Yes, yes!</hi> He would often ſay, <hi>I want, I want!</hi> Being aſked what he wanted, he replied, <hi>I want the will of the Lord to be done.</hi> He called for

THE DOVE.</head>
                     <p>DOVE is the Engliſh name of a bird of the pigeon kind, belonging to the order of Columbine. From the ſtock-dove, it is ſaid, the tame-pigeon, with all its variety, derives its origin. The charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the dove are, that the tongue is whole and
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:038552_0227_10125A42A54B7C40"/>
even, without any diviſion: the beak is of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated and conic figure: the noſtrils are oblong, ſkinny, and partly covered: it has no gall: its eggs are very clear and beautiful. Linnaeus enumerates forty ſpecies of the dove. Beſides the variety of the pigeon kind, this bird is denominated the ring-dove and the turtle-dove.</p>
                     <p>The RING-DOVE is of a larger ſize, and makes its neſt, of a few dry ſticks, in the boughs of trees. The ſize of this bird is eighteen inches long, thirty in breadth, and weighs about twenty ounces. The head, back, and coverts of the wings, are of a bluiſh aſh-colour. The lower part of the neck and breaſt is purple, inclining to red, and daſhed with aſh-colour. On the hind-part of the head is a ſemi-circular line of white; above and below which the feathers are gloſſy, and of changeable colours, as oppoſed to the light. The belly is of a yellowiſh white: the greater quill feathers are duſky, and the reſt are aſh-coloured.</p>
                     <p>The TURTLE-DOVE is much ſhyer than any of the other kind. It may readily be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt by the iris of the eye, which is of a fine yellow, and a beautiful crimſon circle which encompaſſes the eye-lids. The forehead is whitiſh: the top of the head aſh-coloured, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with olive-brown, ſpotted with black; the
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:038552_0228_10125A45229B5060"/>
quill feathers are of a duſky brown; the breaſt of a light purpliſh red, the verge of each feather being yellow; the belly is white, and the ſides and inner coverts of the wings bluiſh. The tail, which is three inches and an half long, has two feathers in the middle of a duſky brown, the others being black tipt with white. The head, and the exterior ſides of the feathers, are entirely white. The fidelity of the turtle-dove is proverbial. A pair put into a cage, if one dies the other will not long ſurvive its mate. The union between the male and female is preſerved with the higheſt degree of chaſtity; and if any breach happen between them, they are ſoon reconciled, and embrace each other. Of this beautiful bird very frequent mention is made in the holy ſcripture.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As an emblem of the Holy Ghoſt, who, in the form of a dove, deſcended upon Chriſt at the memorable period of his baptiſm, thereby ſhewing the diſtinct perſonality of the Spirit from the Father and the Son. And what bird more fit to deſcribe the ſwiftneſs of the Spirit's deſcent upon the ſoul of man?—the lovelineſs, integrity, purity and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of his heavenly influences, which, like the dove, is indeed without the gall of bitterneſs. In the formation of the material world, <hi>the ſpirit of God moved</hi> (INCUBABAT) <hi>upon the face of the
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:038552_0229_10125A48D0109838"/>
waters,</hi> "to impregnate them (ſays Dr. Gill), as a dove upon her eggs to hatch them"—to ſeparate the parts which were mixed together, and to give them a quickening virtue to produce living creatues in them. This ſenſe is charmingly expreſſed by Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton—
<q>
                           <l>—And, with mighty wings out-ſpread,</l>
                           <l>Dove-like, ſat'ſt brooding on the vaſt abyſs,</l>
                           <l>And mad'ſt it pregnant—</l>
                           <bibl>PAR. LOST, b. I.</bibl>
                        </q>
The targums of Jonathan and Jeruſalem call the Spirit who moved upon the waters "the Spirit of mercies—the Spirit of the Meſſiah." Of Meſſiah it was foretold, "<hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel and might, the ſpirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord.</hi> Iſa. xi. 2. And, at the baptiſm of Jeſus, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was accompliſhed, and abundantly verified, in all the acts of his future life. Thoſe bleſſed heavens, that were ſhut by man's tranſgreſſions, were mercifully opened when Jeſus, the Saviour of man, <hi>fulfilled all righteouſneſs;</hi> the Spirit, in the form of a dove, deſcending and reſting upon him, to demonſtrate his approbation, to qualify him for his prophetic office, in order to preach the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable year of the Lord; while the Father crowns
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:038552_0230_10125A4B4E101900"/>
the ſolemnity with an audible voice: <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Matt. iii. 13, 17. Thus the whole Trinity was diſtinctly revealed on this memorable occaſion, and demands our profoundeſt reverence. As the Spirit before named had his part in producing the material world, ſo alſo in the ſpiritual world of grace—firſt on Chriſt, then upon his members, who are compared to doves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The church, the beloved members of Chriſt's ſpiritual body, are addreſſed by him as doves. <hi>My dove, my undefiled, is but one.</hi> S. Song. vi. 9. <hi>One</hi> in his eye, his heart, his hand; and but <hi>one</hi> in the poſſeſſion of the ſame grace, truth and love, by each individual member, in whatſoever nation, age, clime or denomination, they may be found on earth. Theſe perſons, in their native, corrupted ſtate, by original and actual ſin, are in abject ſlavery to the powers of death, and to the evil bias of their own natures; for a deliverance from which is the inceſſant cry of every one who feels the condition into which they are fallen: <hi>O deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver not the ſoul of thy turtle-dove unto the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the wicked.</hi> Pſa. lxxiv. 18. To which the bleſſed Saviour grants a moſt gracious reply, and promiſe of deliverance: <hi>Though thou haſt lain among the pots, yet ſhall ye be as the wings
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:038552_0231_10125A4CE6A1E098"/>
of a dove covered with ſilver, and her feathers of yellow gold.</hi> Pſa. lxviii. 13. As if he had ſaid, "Though now covered with duſt and aſhes, and reduced to a ſtate of mental wretchedneſs, more ſervile and baſe than Egyptian ſlaves among the ſooty pots and cauldrons of their maſters; yet thou ſhalt ariſe, and, by the merit of my righteouſneſs, and the renewals of my grace, enjoy the glorious liberty of the ſons of God. The fruit of my ſpirit ſhall ſo richly adorn thy ſoul, and the light of my countenance ſhall ſo ſenſibly thine upon thee, that thou ſhalt appear glorious, as the beautiful plumage of an eaſtern dove, gliſtening interchangeably as with ſilver and gold, while ſporting its wings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the beams of the ſun!" <hi>O my dove! that art in the clefts of the rock, in the ſecret places of the ſtairs, let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</hi> S. Song ii. 14.</p>
                     <p>From the peruſal of the ſcripture, and from the analogy of experience of chriſtians, we may further perceive the juſtneſs of their compariſon to doves. In their repentance <hi>they are like doves of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, all of them mourning, every one for his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Ezek. vii. 16. In their converſion they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly fly to Chriſt, and to his houſe, <hi>as doves to their window,</hi> for ſafety and for happineſs. Iſa.
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:038552_0232_10125A4F634D0490"/>
lx. 8. The knowledge of their God, and of his truth, is like <hi>the eyes of a dove,</hi> chaſte and pure. S. Song i. 15. Often purſued and afflicted by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they cry, with David, <hi>O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I fly away, and be at reſt.</hi> Pſa. lv. 6. In the temper of their minds, like the innocent dove, they poſſeſs not the <hi>gall</hi> of malicious revenge, but follow the precept of their Lord, <hi>Be ye wiſe as ſerpents, and harmleſs as doves.</hi> Matt. x. 16. To which may be added, in their ſocial union with the ſaints in the church, they are faithful and affectionate, and, like the dove, on the loſs of its mate, is afflicted and mourns, <hi>though not without hope.</hi> 1 Thes. iv. 13. Their food, like the food of the dove, is clean and pure—the fineſt of the wheat, the truth of Chriſt and of his word, avoiding the carrion of error or vile ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. Pſa. cxix. 140. Of all the winged creation, what bird more amiably and excellently ſets forth its Maker's praiſe than the dove? And, of the redeemed of the Lord it is ſaid, <hi>this</hi> people have I formed for myſelf—they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe! Iſa. xliii. 21.</p>
                     <p>To make any remarks on the dove ſent by Noah out of the ark, or on the dove appointed by the Jewiſh law for ſacrifice, however fruitful of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, muſt now be omitted, as it would una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably exceed the limits of this paper.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Paulinus, when they told him that the Goths had ſacked Nola, and plundered him of all he had, lifted up his eyes to Heaven, ſaid, "<hi>Lord, thou knoweſt where I have laid up my treaſure.</hi>"—Happy the ſuffering chriſtian, who, under loſs of worldly enjoyments, finds durable riches and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in God!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The truths of the Goſpel are to be introduced in public diſcourſes and in private converſation, with diſcretion and propriety. A perſon once ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangued on the ſtrength of Sampſon: "I affirm," ſaid he, "that this ſame Sampſon was the ſtrongeſt man that ever did or ever will live in this world." "I deny it," replied one of the company; "your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf are ſtronger than he." "How do you make out that?" "Becauſe you juſt now lugged him in by head and ſhoulders."</p>

affection, candour, and religious opinion of others, too often reſemble the narrowneſs of a river at its firſt riſe; but as we grow in the knowledge of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and advance ſenſibly nearer to God, the great ocean of all good, the channel widens, and our hearts expand, until death perfectly unites us to the ſource of uncreated love.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If a perſon who has been long in poſſeſſion of a large eſtate, comes, in proceſs of time, to have his <hi>title</hi> diſputed, he rummages every corner of his ſcrutore, and of his ſtrong boxes, to find the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal deeds; which, having found, he appeals to them with confidence, as authentic vouchers.—Thus, paſt experiences of the grace of God, though not our Saviour, may yet be recollected, and improved as the hand-writing of God, by which we know our intereſt in his love, and anſwer the cavils and law-ſuits of the devil.</p>

An Alps, perhaps, or Appenine,</l>
                           <l>And wonder—but the work was thine.</l>
                           <l>By thee my feeble strength sustains</l>
                           <l>The height of hills, and length of plains;</l>
                           <l>By thee I track the mazy wood,</l>
                           <l>And smoothly pass the rapid flood.</l>
                           <l>If now I urge my tedious course,</l>
                           <l>Till toil and day-light pall my force;</l>
                           <l>Thy hand brings on the evening close,</l>
                           <l>And marks the <hi>inn</hi> for my repose.</l>
                           <l>Or, if I start ere morning light,</l>
                           <l>And now bewail the lingering night,</l>
                           <l>Thou bidst the sun his beams display,</l>
                           <l>And look the darkness into day.</l>
                           <l>In wilds, where stroll the savage brood,</l>
                           <l>Or men, more savage, lurk for blood;</l>
                           <l>If those I awe, or these decline,</l>

                           <l>And here I breathe in poison'd air.</l>
                           <l>But don't I every where advance</l>
                           <l>Thro' ambushes of death and chance?</l>
                           <l>Yet all things wait on thy decree,</l>
                           <l>And death and chance are rul'd by thee.</l>
                           <l>Thou'rt still my present help and stay,</l>

                     <p>THE ſtudy of human nature is pleaſing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. As there are comparatively few leſſons on this ſubject to be derived from nature, the God

of Grace hath given us the revelation of truth by his dear Son; in which, by the aid of his Spirit, every thing may be known neceſſary to conſtitute our preſent and future happineſs. Hence, nature and revelation are harmonious; though the latter not only ſupplies the deficiency of the former, but adds ſuch diſcoveries as are ſuited to our fallen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and directs us to ſuch ſources of peace and bleſſedneſs which otherwiſe never could have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ained. In the volume of revelation we are taught the knowledge of ourſelves, by the moſt familiar and expreſſive figures: that of a FLOWER ſhall now engage our meditations.</p>
                     <p>God's ancient ſervant, Job, contemplated his own life under this emblem. <hi>Man cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down.</hi> Job xii. 2. He was a wiſe and a good man. His knowledge of the ſciences and of human nature was great. The brevity of man was juſtly to be compared to a flower; and of this he was the more convinced from his perſonal experience in life. As a flower he came forth, and ſtood an ornament of virtue, grace, and godlineſs, <hi>fearing God above many,</hi> while his family and his country enjoyed him with infinite pleaſure. Health and ſtrength, children and friends, houſe and lands, invaluable riches, were his portion. But, while in his faireſt, fulleſt
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:038552_0245_10122A0BBAC9D9B8"/>
bloom, he was cut down by the hand of affliction, and his beauty and worth apparently loſt: his health is decayed—his children are no more—his vaſt poſſeſſions are carried off by the Sabeans—his body is covered with biles, and his bed is a filthy dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill of the earth; and that hand which was induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly employed in communicating good to others, now graſps the potſherd to cleanſe the ſores of the body. Who but muſt drop a tear on reviewing the afflictive change of ſo excellent a man! Well might he indeed ſay, <hi>Man is of few days, and full of trouble.</hi> In the morning, as a flower full in its bloom; in the evening, cut down and wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! But this is not only true, as it relates to the afflictive diſpenſation of God to his people, but to the ſtate of man, by life and by death. He cometh forth as a flower, and appears in all the ſtages of manhood, and is then cut down by death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the duſt. This is a truth that bears its own evidence, and ſhould make ſolemn impreſſion upon our hearts! We will attempt to enlarge our reflections upon man as a flower, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of uſefulneſs to the different claſſes of our readers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We may begin with its origin. Every flower dictates to us a ſeed or firſt principle, which owes its exiſtence to the Creator of all things, who hath
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:038552_0246_10125A71E43F1D20"/>
                        <hi>given to every ſeed its own body.</hi> 1 Cor. xv.—38. God is the parent of man; <hi>we are his offspring;</hi> and it is <hi>in him that we live, move, and have our being.</hi> The formation of the firſt man, Adam, is recorded, for our inſtruction, in the two firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Geneſis; the antiquity of which record ſhould create a ſuperlative eſteem in our breaſts for the bible, as the oldeſt and the beſt book in the world. Our parents—time, place, and manner of our birth, were appointed by infinite wiſdom; and however we may eſteem our parents as the natural cauſe of our animal production, we muſt direct our eyes to God as the FATHER of all; by whoſe will and power our bodies and ſouls are formed, and whoſe hand ſows the ſeed that produces the flowers of human nature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us mark the variety of the flowery tribe, expreſſive of the different orders of mankind. In thoſe parts of the world where the flowery tribes have been cultivated with every poſſible art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, the floriſt has acknowledged that he could no more eſtimate their variety than to number the ſands on the ſea ſhore. A Linnaeus, a Turnfoot, and a Miller, the moſt eminent in exploring the nature, virtue and beauty of this charming part of creation, have only been able to glance upon the ſubject, in compariſon to its extent. This will
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:038552_0247_10125A74636FE258"/>
aid our reflections on the variety of proportions, ſymmetry and features of mankind. In the natural features of men, there may appear two, perhaps, from family connections, ſo much alike as though caſt into one mould; but, on a minute examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will be found to differ in a very aſtoniſhing degree. While this diverſity of human features evinces the wiſdom of God, it is evidently of the higheſt advantages to public ſociety. The variety of man's natural and acquired abilities is equally aſtoniſhing! In the lower department of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, huſbandry, &amp;c. in which the honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer obtains his bread at the ſweat of his brow, the higher departments of language and of arts each bear ſome reſemblance to the diverſity of flowers. And, as from the variety of flowers many medicinal virtues may be derived for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of mankind, ſo, by the different abilities of men, in the cultivation of ſcience, benefit is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by the whole. The tempers and paſſions of mankind are likewiſe expreſſed by the variety of flowers. I preſume, though there may be ſome analogy in the general diſpoſitions of men, yet as their features, ſo in their minds, there are not two alike, let their name or family be what they may. What an infinite variety is there in the colour, marks, ſize, and conſtruction of flowers! Some
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:038552_0248_10125A7601924090"/>
appear magnificently grand, and fill us with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; while others, leſs adorned, give us leave to paſs without attention. Juſt ſo it is with men. Thoſe whoſe temper and paſſions are eminent in goodneſs and grace, bearing the image of JESUS CHRIST, engage our attention; while others, of a different caſt, make no pleaſing impreſſion upon us, and we paſs by them with indifference. From theſe obſervations it muſt appear obvious to my young readers, that a general acquaintance with mankind is abſolutely neceſſary to their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and uſefulneſs in the world. We meet with ſome perſons exceedingly contracted in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſentiments, and who will ſcarce allow a man to be either honeſt or gracious, becauſe ſuch may differ from them: but it is obvious that theſe very perſons have only viewed a few flowers in their own ſcanty gardens, and are perfect ſtrangers to that rich variety which adorns the univerſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining themſelves to a circle of their own taſte, they can have little pleaſure from the exerciſe of chriſtian candour towards others.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The properties of flowers attracting our <hi>ſenſes</hi> is another obſervation worthy our attention. Some poſſeſs the moſt charming fragrance; others as truly offenſive; while ſome may be denominated <hi>neutral,</hi> having little ſcent at all. It is ſo among mankind.
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:038552_0249_10125A78DBDDC230"/>
Thoſe who are enriched with the grace of God, and, from love to Chriſt, bear the fruits of virtue and true holineſs, laying out themſelves for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of others—theſe are <hi>the excellent of the earth,</hi> and yield more pleaſure to a pious mind, than the moſt valuable collections of carnations can gratify the ſcent. The vicious, the vain, the wretched and profligate, fail not to render themſelves noxious in our eſteem. Others there are who are not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enough to claim the denomination of <hi>wicked,</hi> nor have goodneſs enough to eſteem them <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> therefore, as they are undetermined in their own characters, you find that they paſs through life little thought of, and of as little uſe. Theſe obſervations may apply in our general review of human nature, or in circumſcribed bodies. King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, cities, churches, families, are as ſo many beds of flowers, to be viſited and enjoyed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their nature; while the exhibition of the whole will not fail to enlarge your own breaſt, and lead you to admire the goodneſs, power and glory of that ALMIGHTY BEING <hi>for whom all things were created.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The general diviſion of flowers of the <hi>field,</hi> and flowers of the <hi>garden,</hi> deſerves a few atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thoughts. No doubt, the whole of this flowery tribe was naturally wild; and the choice, culture,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:038552_0250_10125A7C39CCB120"/>
and benefit of any, by which the difference is made, is attributed to the pleaſure and the ſkill of the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt and the botaniſt. As the ſcripture muſt guide us in theſe contemplations, we obſerve the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence made in mankind by the grace and pleaſure of God in Chriſt. By nature we are all wild in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! <hi>By nature children of wrath.</hi> Eph. ii. 1. Chriſt, by his grace, regenerating a ſinner's heart, digs him out from among the common field of the world, and tranſplants him into the garden of his church, where he is watered, dreſſed, trained, bud, bloſſom, bear fruit, even to old age. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man whom thou, O Lord, chooſeth, and cauſeth to approach unto thee! He ſhall be as a plant, planted by the rivers of waters, whoſe leaf faileth not!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ſhortneſs of our paper reminds us to make our laſt obſervation. This muſt be on the period of the flower. <hi>Job tells us, Man cometh up as a flower, and is cut down.</hi> Behold! he ſpeaks of the appearance of the flower, and of its being cut down—not one word of its continuance. This is purpoſely to teach us the brevity of life, and that our age is, comparatively, as nothing—<hi>a vapour that vaniſheth away!</hi> no ſooner come up, than cut down! <hi>Lord, what is man!</hi> how few his days on earth! cut down by the ſcythe of
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:038552_0251_10125A7EB5945AB8"/>
death, at the command of that righteous Being who made us, and to whom we are accountable! At this ſpot our leaves muſt fall, our beauty fade! But is man cut down to be no more? Doth body and ſoul both lie down in the grave, and rot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? How important the queſtion of Job:—<hi>Man giveth up the Ghoſt, and where is he?</hi> Job xiv. 10. May I be permitted, in reverence, to reply—Either in HEAVEN or HELL! Cut down as fuel for the fire—or to be tranſmitted to bloom in paradiſe with God! Let us, therefore, improve theſe reflections for our perſonal benefit; let us examine into the ſtate of our ſouls, and fly to the arms of that moſt bleſſed Saviour, who, to teach his worth, and to yield his grace, is known as <hi>the Roſe of Sharon, and the Lily of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi> Intereſted in him, and fraught with his grace, you need not fear to die. Though cut down by the hand of death, you ſhall be delivered from this evil, tempeſtuous life, and be tranſmitted to bliſs that <hi>fadeth not away!</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. A CHRISTIAN, as to his ſpiritual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not unlike a BAROMETER. As the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, in this inſtrument, riſes when the ſun ſhines,
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:038552_0252_10125A8050835B20"/>
and the weather is fine, but ſinks when the air is heavy, and loaded with damps; ſo the chriſtian's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible comforts riſe when God ſhines upon his ſoul, but ſubſides when left to the workings of his own heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Dr. Groveſnor being at the funeral of Dr. Watts, a gentleman preſent ſaid to him, "Well, Dr. Groveſnor, you have ſeen the end of Dr. Watts, and you will ſoon follow: what think you of death?" "Think of it," replied the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, "when death comes I ſhall ſmile upon death, if Chriſt ſmiles upon me."</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When the rays of the ſun fall on the ſurface of a material object, part of thoſe rays are abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, part of them are reflected back in ſtraight lines, and part of them are refracted in various directions. Thus, when Chriſt, the SUN OF RIGHTEOUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS, ſhines upon a chriſtian's heart, part of the grace he confers is <hi>abſorbed</hi> for the conſolation of the ſoul; part of it is <hi>reflected</hi> back to the Saviour, in acts of faith, love, joy, prayer and praiſe; and part of it is <hi>refracted</hi> every way, in acts of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, gratitude, benevolence, and every ſocial virtue, for the benefit of mankind.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The mariner, when on a boiſterous ſea, finds his compaſs to direct itſelf to its own pole, and guide him in a certain tract, although his compaſs

That heart which hath received a touch from Chriſt, the heavenly magnet, will, in deſires, affections, hopes, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ever direct itſelf to Jeſus, as his all in all, although the box of his mind be toſſed every way, by Satan, unbelief, or affliction.</p>

Louis XIV. of France, ſaid one day to the famous father <hi>Maſillon,</hi> "I have heard many great orators in my chapel, and I have always been well <hi>ſatisfied with them;</hi> but every time I hear you I am DISSATISFIED WITH MYSELF."—Thoſe miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt who are moſt faithful, are, indeed, the moſt uſeful, though often the leaſt popular.

                        <p>From my early youth I have been taught to imbibe prejudices againſt chriſtianity.

I have never applied to a clergyman for aſſiſtance in my inquiries; for as I could not believe their doctrine, I by no means venerated their character.

                        <p>Your firſt blow is well directed; for if they can be impeached, the whole, of courſe, muſt fall. If men fabricated the ſcriptures, we may juſtly aſk, What men were they? Either bad or good. The firſt could not have contrived it, and the latter never would have done it. The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, the precepts, would be the reverſe of their own nature. Would ſuch men write a book to tell all the world that all ſuch men as themſelves would be puniſhed in hell? Good men would never make a book out of their own heads, and then tell you that their lies were the counſels of God. If men did counterfeit God's hand, how has it happened that none has diſcovered the cheat? What! were they all deceivers? Tell me for why? What could be the motive that induced them to ſuch an impoſition, where they ſaw reproach, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, torture, and death, their own rewards? Would no one out of the many repent, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the ſcheme, even when he found the world againſt him, and death before him? Could baſe lyars, wicked men, write a book ſo pure in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and holy in its deſign, and endure all manner of hardſhips in defence of it? Even the character and conduct of <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> furniſhes a ſtrong
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:038552_0258_10125A90B01A06A0"/>
argument for the truth of the goſpel. How came it to paſs that he firſt betrayed his maſter, and was then ſo ſtung with remorſe as to put an end to his own life? How came he thus to own himſelf guilty of the vileſt ſin, when, if Jeſus had been an impoſtor, he knew that he had done an act of juſtice to the world in freeing them from him? Now, if there had been any baſe plot, any bad deſign in the caſe, Judas, who had ſo long lived with Chriſt and his diſciples, with perfect intimacy, and who was intruſted with the bag, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have expoſed it. I wiſh to aſk you if you have thoroughly examined the characters of the different writers of the Old and New Teſtaments? Perhaps not. You would have found that they feared God; they lived a life of prayer to God; they ſeparated themſelves from the practices of the wicked; they preached, they wrote, they wept, to reclaim their fellow mortals; and they cheerfully ſubmitted to every loſs of name, health, friends, and property, to accompliſh ſuch benevolent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, all of which they unanimouſly aimed at the glory of God! Is there any thing here impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Or ought we not to admire their character, and follow their ſteps? Are the ſocial virtues of the oppoſers of chriſtianity more uſeful and brilliant?

Take a ſeat on the loweſt form in Chriſt's ſchool, and then bring forward your difficulties: you will, then, ſoon find them to vaniſh.—I wiſh to inform you, my dear young friend, that the bible contains a RELIGION FOR SINNERS, pardon for the guilty,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:038552_0260_10125A94CE6EABF0"/>
health for the ſick, ſight for the blind, comfort for the diſtreſſed; and, until you feel juſt as the goſpel deſcribes, you will never wiſh to enjoy the bleſſings which the goſpel contains. I will juſt add, that the ſcriptures, however written by different men, of different languages, and diſtant periods, every part of them harmonize in pointing out the moſt auguſt character of Jehovah, the miſerable ſtate of man by ſin, the completeneſs of redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, the power of the Spirit in applying the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of ſalvation to the heart, the privileges of the godly in this life, and their glory in the next. Each of theſe are minutely expreſſed, are eaſily underſtood by an illuminated mind, and afford ground and reaſons for moral and ſocial actions, infinitely plainer and more certain than the variety of axioms in natural and experimental philoſophy. I conclude my anſwer to your queſtion nearly in the words of the celebrated <hi>Dryden:</hi> "Whence but from heaven could men who were generally unſkilled in arts, who were born in different pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of time, and in different parts of the world, weave ſuch agreeing truths?

                        <p>Indeed, good Sir, I feel already ſo guilty and aſhamed, for diſbelieving what I did not know, that I know not how to proceed: however, having your leave, I will treſpaſs upon your patience once more. The impropriety of conduct, in ſome chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, has been an objection to my embracing the ſyſtem.</p>

                        <p>True: we have to lament that ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of chriſtianity have and do act improperly; but ſhould the whole be condemned for the ſake of a few? or ſhould this be laid as an evil to the charge of chriſtianity? Certainly not. If there was no intrinſic value in chriſtianity, there would be no counterfeit: if there were no real chriſtians, there would be no hypocrites. All thoſe torrents of blood, ſhed by what are called chriſtian princes, were not the dictates, nor the fruit of chriſtianity; but the luſt of ambition, revenge, and love of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Probably this objection may alſo ariſe from your perſonal obſervations on profeſſors of the goſpel. In this caſe I will ſay, I alſo have been deeply affected when witneſſing improper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſuch perſons. But, on due reflection on the extreme depravity of the heart, and the many enticements to evil, I have been more aſtoniſhed
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:038552_0262_10125A9B100355B0"/>
that <hi>any</hi> live an honour to God, uſeful to ſociety, and happy in themſelves, than that a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould not. It is not uncommon for thoſe who are unfavourable to the goſpel to uſe <hi>both</hi> eyes to mark the improprieties of its followers, and ſcarce ever glance upon their own conduct. Very different from this is the temper dictated by the bible: for, inſtead of being like the vulture, prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the carrion of others' conduct, they are clothed with humility, under a due ſenſe of their own infirmities. I readily own to you, my young friend, if I have hitherto maintained a life in any meaſure conſiſtent with the office I hold in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, or beneficial to ſociety at large, I wholly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to the kind influence of my God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour upon my heart. Your propoſed objection gives me an opportunity to name two other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments favourable to chriſtianity, and, I think, muſt prove alleviating to you. The very bible has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted thoſe falſe profeſſors of whom you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and marked out both their conduct and their end. Read, as a proof, the parable of the ten virgins. Matt. xxv. 1—13. Another argument is, God has not hidden any of the evils and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of his moſt diſtinguiſhed ſervants; but has lain the blackeſt mark upon them, and ſhown their juſt aggravations for their repentance; and they
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:038552_0263_10125A9D8AB0ADD8"/>
ſtill exiſt on record, that <hi>he who thinketh he ſtandeth may take heed leſt he fall.</hi> 1 Cor. x. 12. Remember, chriſtianity makes no man perſonally ſinleſs, but corrects and ſubdues our evil nature. It muſt be confeſſed, that the oppoſers of chriſtianity are not more brilliant in their moral virtues than others; neither, while they reflect upon our bible, do they poſſeſs wiſdom and benevolence ſufficient to give us a better rule of life, and a ground of hope. A celebrated deiſt once had candour enough to acknowledge to me, in Boſton, "Sir, after all our diſputes with you on the ſubject of chriſtianity, I muſt own that you have <hi>two</hi> chances to our <hi>one.</hi> If we are right, and our ſtanding ſafe on the ground of nature, you muſt be alſo. Should chriſtianity be true, you are ſafe and we are loſt." On this conceſſion, how true is the ſentiment of Moſes: <hi>Their rock is not as our rock, even our enemies themſelves being judges.</hi> Deut. xxxii. 31. [College bell rings.] The bell now rings for my attendance on the ſenior claſs; I ſhall only add, I wiſh you well: think coolly, read the bible for yourſelf, try to read your own heart alſo; above all, if hitherto you may have lived without prayer, go to God, and humble yourſelf before him for your ſins and ignorance, beſeeching him to ſhine upon you in mercy: and, on any proper occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

                     <p>Preparatory to his future dreadful ſufferings, and his conſequent exaltation, Jeſus was transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured upon Mount Tabor: in the very exerciſe of prayer <hi>his face did ſhine as the ſun.</hi> Matt. xvii. 2.

pen to congratulate you on <hi>the day</hi>—a day which, if rightly improved, will inſpire your gratitude to God, who hath thus far conducted you through life; and alſo eſtabliſh your confidence for future ſupplies from the bounties of his hand.</p>
                     <p>When I myſelf review the path of life, ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemplate God's conduct towards me, in the multiplied affections and mercies which, in cloſe ſucceſſion, have followed me, I am filled with humble praiſe. Under ſuch ſerious impreſſions I have felt myſelf happy, have renewed my ſtrength, and looked with pleaſure on the remnant of my days.

cannot fail to impreſs our minds with the high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of ſeeking the friendſhip of Jeſus, as the one thing needful. From a conviction of our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improvements, of which, alas! we have ſo many, we cannot but wiſh to learn wiſdom. To fly from the appearance of evil, thirſt after the invaluable bleſſings of a Saviour, and conſtantly to devote ourſelves to the honour of his name, this, this alone is ſubſtantial wiſdom!</p>
                     <p>Perhaps there are ſome particulars in every man's life, which, on ſuch a day as this, would lead him more ſenſibly to admire the divine forbearance, mercy and goodneſs. Such, I preſume, you have often recorded—Dangers on the ſeas and mercies on the land—yes, and with David you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>My ſoul hath them ſtill in remembrance.</hi> O that on this occaſion, reviewing the protecting care of the Almighty, your ſoul may be clothed with humility and your lips be filled with his praiſe!</p>

Birth-days ſhould be to us, on the journey of life, as mile-ſtones on the road; each informs us how far we have advanced, and brings the period of our race to view.

days and months paſs away. But who, alas! knows his own diſtance? Carefully may a man preſerve the number of years that paſs, and tell another how old he is; but who is able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the number yet to come? This is wiſely hid from mortal ſight, that we may hold ourſelves ready to ſtop in our career whenever God may call. Let us, my friend, on our birth days, ſet down as on the way-ſide, look at the number on the mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, aſk—have we an heavenly home to go to? have we aſſurance of intereſt in our Father's love? are we ready, ſuppoſing the next mile-ſtone brings us to our end? If ſo, what ſerenity of mind and happineſs of ſoul would attend our path! How ſucceſsfully ſhould we improve the ills and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which ſurround us! We truſt the faithful care of that God who hath crowned our lives with tender mercies, and look for every needful future ſupply. Perhaps ſuch ſubmiſſion is better expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the following lines: may they prove, this day, the true language of your heart!</p>

MEMORIAL OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</head>
                     <p>IN righteous judgment heaven hath appointed unto ſinful man <hi>once to die.</hi> The ſhafts of death fly thick around. The beggar and the lonely pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant receive the ſummons, and are conveyed to the duſt in ſilence, and without regret. The prince upon his throne, the noble and the great, receive an equal, deadly blow; and, with ſolemn pomp, are laid within the marble tomb. The mortal part of WASHINGTON is removed to the ſhades of death, and America drops the mourning tear; while her moſt patriotic ſons advance, each as with a
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:038552_0282_10125ACDA6C83900"/>
laurel in his hand to decorate the great man's grave! His birth, his youth, his manhood; his qualities in private life, his valour in the field, and his wiſdom in the ſenate; "firſt in war, firſt in peace, and firſt upon his country's heart!" theſe eminent traits have formed a ſubject for the orator and the pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyriſt ſo new and aſtoniſhing, as ſeldom occurs in the world of letters. While others joined the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, mourning train, and the more eloquent lips publicly pourtrayed his political character, teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the reſpect in which the people of America held their beloved chief, I will gratify myſelf (as more accordant to his laſt will and teſtament) by cloſing this volume of "The Chriſtian's Pocket Library," in raiſing a plain, private MEMORIAL of WASHINGTON, as a diſtinguiſhed SERVANT OF GOD, the MAN whom the Lord hath delighted to honour in eſtabliſhing the <hi>only</hi> government, then exiſting upon earth, where the perfection of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liberty is enjoyed by all, and the church of God ſtands upon its ſpiritual baſis, unconnected with civil power.</p>
                     <p>We will attempt to raiſe this memorial upon the back ground of a review of the chriſtian profeſſion as engrafted in the ſtock of civil government. Our bleſſed Saviour declared, <hi>my kingdom is not of this world.</hi> John xviii. 36. Its nature, ſubjects, laws,
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:038552_0283_10125AD026A91070"/>
government, privileges, treaſures, are wholly ſpiritual and divine; tending to prepare the ſouls of men for a future ſtate of endleſs bliſs. No ſooner did the cauſe of Jeſus begin to increaſe, than civil governments, of different deſcriptions and of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries, planted a <hi>profeſſion</hi> of chriſtianity into the very heart of their political conſtitutions. Immediately the primitive ſimplicity and ſpirit of Chriſt's viſible kingdom vaniſhed; it became a tool of ſtate, and a pretext for committing the moſt daring depredations amongſt mankind; which political bodies were not aſhamed to call them THE WARS OF THE LORD. No wonder that, from ſuch an union of church and ſtate, whether deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated <hi>papal</hi> or <hi>proteſtant,</hi> the ordinances and laws of chriſtianity ſhould be groſsly mutilated, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally to render them ſubſervient to political purpoſes, and that a variety of officers ſhould be introduced whoſe names and functions are unknown in the New Teſtament, to carry on the wheels of ſtate, and to produce the temporal good of the whole. Againſt ſuch an heterogeneous maſs, and under ſuch features, no wonder the ſcattered <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew race</hi> ſhould increaſe in prejudice againſt chriſtianity, and that the <hi>heathen-world</hi> ſhould abominate that ſyſtem whoſe fruit was rapine, cruelty, and bloodſhed! Under ſuch mixed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:038552_0284_10125AD1C3599310"/>
all who preſumed to attach themſelves to the ſpiritual kingdom of Chriſt, diſclaiming all civil authority in matters of conſcience, faith, and religious practice, were held in contempt, excluded from the particular rights of citizens, and frequently <hi>accounted as ſheep for the ſlaughter.</hi> Thus, a profeſſion of the religion of Jeſus, whoſe primitive nature is benevolence and love, was corrupted, and became the fountain of partiality, tyranny, bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, hatred, and wrath, ſeparating the very ſouls it was calculated to unite, and <hi>ſcattering arrows, fire-brands and death</hi> over the world, which it was intended to reclaim.</p>
                     <p>In what part of Chriſtendom was it that this moſt wretched ſpirit did not prevail? In what country has <hi>the kingdom of Chriſt</hi> been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally profeſſed, as entirely diſtinct from the civil powers? In none. Even AMERICA, though emerged from heathen darkneſs, and cultivated by European hands, ſat amidſt the ſame corrupted maſs of civil and eccleſiaſtic powers. But God deſignated her for a better ſtate. Increaſing in her wealth, her years tender, ſhe felt the galling fetters on her hand! At length ſhe ſighed—ſhe groaned—ſhe wept beneath her load. But ah! whoſe eye could pity? What arm ſufficient to relieve a caſe like her's? That ALMIGHTY BEING who taught
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:038552_0285_10125AD35F4D84F0"/>
                        <hi>Columbus</hi> to explore her hidden ſhores, beheld her ſuffering ſtate, and deigned to relieve! He who raiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to deliver the choſen race of Iſrael, and girded the arm of <hi>Cirus</hi> to unfold the maſſy gates of Babylon, will raiſe a deliverer to ſet Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica free. Behold a WASHINGTON ariſe! Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven inſpires his ſoul with wiſdom, fortitude, and love—<hi>teacheth his hands to war, and his fingers to fight.</hi> And, left he ſhould boaſt, <hi>my own arm hath gotten me the victory,</hi> God committeth to his command an handful of raw, undiſciplined men, deſtitute of almoſt every equipment for the field, but ardent thirſt to ſet their country free. Through ſeven long years of horrid war, in hopes and fears, in ſweat and blood, the GENERAL urged his way. At length heaven opens, and lets down upon his ſervant's head the VICTOR'S CROWN. Now the fabric of civil and eccleſiaſtic powers, long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, in one craſh fall, like the walls of antient Jericho. Peace, with her thouſand thouſand ſweets, extends through all the land, and every pious heart exclaims, <hi>Hallelujah! for the Lord God Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent reigneth.</hi> Now, <hi>the Lord judgeth among many people, and rebuketh ſtrong nations afar off.</hi> The ſons of America <hi>beat their ſwords into ploughſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks. Every man ſits under his vine and under his fig-tree,
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:038552_0286_10125AD6E89C7FE8"/>
and none maketh them afraid.</hi> Micah iv. 3. 4. <hi>O ſing unto the Lord a new ſong, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.</hi> Pſa. xcviii. 1. And while ſuch effuſions of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude flow to the Almighty for our deliverance and independence, can we poſſibly forget the MAN whom the Lord hath delighted to honour, in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialling our armies, and obtaining our victory? Impoſſible! Though WASHINGTON be now numbered among the dead, his name ſhall live with millions yet unborn.</p>
                     <p>Thus far we ſpeak but half his praiſe. The people ſaved were yet without ſufficient <hi>law.</hi> The peace obtained muſt be ſecured. The MAN whom heaven bleſſed in the fields of war now takes the preſidential chair, in full CONVENTION, with a circle of worthies, choſen by the free ſuffrage of the people, to frame a CONSTITUTION, by which the rights, the liberties, the wealth and happineſs of all may be preſerved. On this ſtrong baſis every STATE builds a ſuperſtructure of peace and commerce, while diſtant nations give a friend's em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.</p>
                     <p>Civil rights and liberties are ſweet; but ſweeter ſtill the ſacred rights of conſcience. This bleſſing, too, flows to us from God in copious ſtreams,
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:038552_0287_10125ADA4F16BF48"/>
through the Conſtitution of the United States. No teſt-act here; no fines nor chains; no horrid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition nor flaming faggots prepared for thoſe who differ in faith and practice from their fellow mortals for conſcience ſake. Here the ſtandard of the CROSS appears, and the voice of Jeſus ſounds aloud—<hi>My kingdom is not of this world.</hi> Hail, thou firſt ſpot of earth, conſecrated by IMMANUEL'S benediction, to ſhow his arm in reſcuing his church from the civil powers, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>and alone upon the pure unſhaken baſis of his truth and grace! Firſt fruit of the Redeemer's national conqueſt! Go on, moſt bleſſed Lord, in the glory of thy might, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the powers of darkneſs, until thou ſhalt reign king of nations, as thou art king of grace, diffuſing celeſtial knowledge both to Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and ſacred liberty prevails from pole to pole. Thus, while every American's knee ſhall bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and their lips, in pureſt gratitude, praiſe his glorious name for his boundleſs mercies, let the memory of WASHINGTON, through whom theſe bleſſings came, be engraven upon every heart. Not one exempt! Thoſe whoſe judgments may not accord in ſome recent traits of this great man's counſel, muſt unite with me in venerating his name as a diſtinguiſhed ſervant of the Lord, in
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:038552_0288_10122A0E129E9618"/>
procuring thoſe ſtreams of civil and religious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, unknown in other lands.</p>
                     <p>What man, elevated to ſuch an aſtoniſhing height of honour, and ſo ſignally favoured by the victorious arm of God, that ever wore the AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOUR with ſuch diffidence and profound humility? Which, among thoſe numerous conquerors whoſe names adorn the page of ancient and modern hiſtory, have maintained ſuch an aſſemblage of moral VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUES as ſhone through the diverſified ſtages of WASHINGTON's public life? Alas! although the victor's crown was placed on their heads, what ſpots of vice were often ſeen upon their robes, that made their country bluſh! Here let America lift her head, nor dare diſown her General's name, but hail him—A SERVANT WORTHY OF THE LORD!</p>
