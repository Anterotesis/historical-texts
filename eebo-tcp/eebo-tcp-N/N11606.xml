      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <l>Some share of honour, on this hapless day.</l>
                     <l>Let some brave officers, stand on the rear,</l>
                     <l>And with the small sword, and sharp bayonet,</l>
                     <l>Drive on each coward that attempts to lag,</l>

            <head>Written by a GENTLEMAN of the ARMY.</head>
            <stage>Supposed to be spoken, immediately after the Battle; By Lieutenant Colonel WEBB, Aid de camp to General PUTNAM.</stage>
            <l>THE Field is their's, but dearly was it bought,</l>
            <l>Thus long defended and severely fought.</l>
            <l>Now pale-fac'd death sits brooding o'er the strand,</l>
            <l>And views the carnage of his ruthless hand.</l>
            <l>But why my heart this deep unbidden sigh,</l>
            <l>Why steals the tear, soft trickling from the eye?</l>
            <l>Is FREEDOM master'd by our late defeat</l>
            <l>Or HONOUR wounded by a brave retreat?</l>
            <l>'Tis nature dictates; and in pride's despite,</l>
            <l>I mourn my brethren slaughter'd in the fight.</l>
            <l>'Th' insulting foe, now revels o'er the ground,</l>
            <l>Yet flush'd with victory, they feel the wound.</l>
            <l>Embru'd in gore, they bleed from ev'ry part,</l>
            <l>And deep wounds rankle at BRITANNIA'S heart.</l>
            <l>O fatal conquest! Speak thou crimson'd plain,</l>
            <l>Now press'd beneath the weight of hundreds slain?</l>
            <l>There heaps of BRITISH youth promiscuous lie,</l>
            <l>Here, murder'd FREEMEN catch the wand'ring eye.</l>
            <l>Observe yon stripling bath'd in purple gore,</l>
            <l>He bleeds for FREEDOM on his native shore.</l>

His livid eyes in drear convulsions roll,</l>
            <l>While from his wounds escapes the flutt'ring soul,</l>
            <l>Breathless and naked on th' ensanguin'd plain,</l>
            <l>Midst friends and brothers, sons and fathers slain.</l>
            <l>No pitying hand his languid eyes to close,</l>
            <l>He breathes his last amidst insulting foes;</l>
            <l>His body plunder'd, massacred, abus'd;</l>
            <l>By Christians—Christian fun'ral rites refus'd—</l>
            <l>Thrown as a carrion in the public way,</l>
            <l>To <hi>Dogs,</hi> to <hi>Britons,</hi> and to <hi>Birds</hi> a prey.</l>
            <l>Enwrapt in sulph'rous flame and clouds of smoke,</l>
            <l>Brave GARD'NER sinks beneath the deadly stroke,</l>
            <l>And WARREN bleeds to grace the bloody strife</l>
            <l>And for his injur'd country gives his life.</l>
            <l>Yet while his mighty soul ascends the skies,</l>
            <l>On earth his blood for ten-fold vengeance cries.</l>
            <l>Great spirit rest—by Heaven it is decreed,</l>
            <l>Thy murd'ring tyrante by the sword shall bleed.</l>
            <l>E'en racks and gibbets would but consecrate,</l>
            <l>And death repeated be too kind a fate.</l>
            <l>The sword is drawn, in peace no more to rest,</l>
            <l>Till justice bathes it in some tyrants breast.</l>
            <l>Honour my weapon with the glorious task,</l>
            <l>And let me stab, 'tis all the boon I ask.</l>
            <l>Kind pow'rs, beneath your all-protecting shield,</l>
            <l>I now unsheath my sword, and take the field,</l>
            <l>Sure of success, with this sweet comfort giv'n,</l>
            <l>Who fights for FREEDOM,—fights the cause of HEAV'N.</l>
