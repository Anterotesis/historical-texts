            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

said to him, that he had (by that Gospel confession of Faith) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly contradicted what he had contended for in his present Discourse (called Disputation) and that he had also thereby confirmed the first part of the charge against them, namely, That <hi>a Quakers pretended Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour within him, was not the true Christ, but the false Christ.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Quest. 2. <hi>Whether we could be saved by Christ, without the operation of the Spirit in us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answered:</hi> Although it were granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>sc.</hi> That we could not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, without the operations of the Spirit in us: yet, this would be nothing to the business before us: that is, it doth not prove <hi>a Quakers-pretended Saviour within him, to be the true, not the false Christ:</hi> forasmuch as the operations of the Spirit in us, are not Christ, God-man, therefore not our Saviour: again, I told her, let it be granted, that we cannot be saved without the effects and operations of the spirit in us: yet here-hence it will not follow, that we are saved for, or by these effects and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit in us: so that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Questions</hi> were (by the judicious hearers) plainly discerned, to lay aside the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Saviour; and to insinuate a Spirit, and its operations (still the <hi>Idol-light</hi>)

within, to be the true Christ and only Saviour; thereupon, I denied the Spirits operations in us, to be the previous, procuring cause or ground of redemption, justification, and salvation with God; and that it is one thing to affirm that we cannot be saved without the efficacies of the spirit in us, as evidential, and another thing to be saved for, or by these operations in us, as causal; to which she made no return:</p>
            <p>Let me here add, what her last Question hath since brought to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; namely, somewhat (touching this Question) the men of <hi>Rome,</hi> have commonly expressed: the Apostle (say they) excludes from justification, works which we our selves do meaning, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Not by works of righteousness that we have done,</hi> &amp; Rom 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>By the way, in reference to her last question, let two things be serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Carnal Gospellers</hi> do but deceive their own souls, by resting in a bare literal, or historical assent, that <hi>the Man Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the true Christ, and our only Saviour,</hi> while they are in no degree parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the divine nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. i.e. of the effectual graces of Christs spirit, <hi>sc.</hi> a living <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is most necessarily presupposed, that all things were finished by the Man Jesus Christ (as above explained) for satisfaction to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers justice for sin, before we could receive that satisfaction by Faith, or its effects by the spirit within us: Now, its most certain, that before Faith (with its fruits and effects) was wrought in us by the spirit: we were unbelievers, ungodly, unjust, and <hi>enemies to God in our minds by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works,</hi> Col. 1. 21. then according to right reason; if the one had not been first wrought by Jesus Christ without us, it had been altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for the other to have been wrought in us, or received by Faith, and so witnessed unto by us; consider once more, if the Man Jesus Christ had not first given himself a ransome for our sins, we could not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it by Faith, nor could it have been Testified or witnessed unto, by us: Moreover, let it be well observed, that all the righteousness of Sanctification that is in us from Christ, is but a fruit of that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Justification, which Jesus Christ of <hi>Nazareth</hi> wrought out by his own personal obedience and sufferings upon the Crosses yea, all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and operations of the spirit wrought in us, were thereby merited and purchased for us.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Francis,</hi> your being in yourself washed and justified from your sins, in some measure; is, plainly to deny that one <hi>Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> of the one crucified body of the true Man Jesus Christ, which can be no other then a wretched design, to blot out of our hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>

<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000313_0039_0FA4A9FF74102BB8"/>
Argumentations, which defect, constrained me to insist upon the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (herein more fully and distinctly enlarged) of those <hi>Texts</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which (for the most part) were only repeated by the <hi>titular Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,</hi> and that many times after their own most presumptuous mode and manner, adding or diminishing contrary to Gods command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. But I proceed to the <hi>Text</hi> it self:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The place of Scripture above, <hi>sc. Rev.</hi> 1. 8. consists of three parts. <hi>First part, I am Alpha and Omega,</hi> in these words Christs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power is Metaphorically expressed, being the first and last letters in the <hi>Greek Alphabet;</hi> which (by a figurative speech) are applied to any beginning and end; and are here interpreted, by the next words, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Beginning</hi> and the <hi>Ending:</hi> which Phrases, do signifie unto us Christs divine Nature, eternal Power, and Godhead, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. ver. 1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God,</hi> (sc. God the Son) and in <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>All things were created by him</hi> (his dear Son, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.) <hi>and for him</hi> (sc. for his glory, as the ultimate end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36.) this therefore is the meaning of [<hi>I am Alpha and Omega</hi>] that is, Christ is the efficient cause of all things, and the end also, whither all things are referred: that he hath at first created all things, and that for his own glory alone.</p>
            <p>Second part, <hi>Saith the Lord,</hi> which words, denote Christ the faithful promiser, <hi>for all the promises of God are in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. in him, <hi>i.e.</hi> in the man hood of Christs person, <hi>Col.</hi> 2 9. hereunto agrees the title [<hi>Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Christ saith, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the first, and the last,</hi> here <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> are explained by the terms [<hi>Of the first and the last</hi>] that is to say, the Lord Christ is the first, <hi>to wit</hi> subsisting in the beginning with God, and equal with the Father: and the last, having taken the form of a Servant, i.e. <hi>of the meanest man,</hi> and so last in reputation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor are these words (<hi>see thee</hi> and <hi>you</hi>) alwayes in Scripture of distinct significations, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 9. herein, <hi>thee,</hi> (a singular) and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People</hi> (a plural) are of the same signification, so in <hi>Isai.</hi> 26. 20. here <hi>People</hi> and <hi>thou</hi> are of the same import: To these Scriptures (would it not render me tedious to the Reader) I might add many more, to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say this their trifling Assertion: for <hi>you</hi> and <hi>thou</hi> are oft in Scripture and reason convertitable terms, for instance, <hi>thou</hi> in the Decalogue is indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely understood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are ready to affirm, <hi>sc.</hi> To salute a single person, under the notion [<hi>You</hi>] is both improper, and irrational, for it were to confound singular, and plural in point of right reason.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Its neither: for, its not improper nor irrational, to say to a single man, This Youth is <hi>your</hi> Son; for <hi>you</hi> are his Father, which to say, is as proper and rational, as to say, <hi>thou</hi> art his Father, and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (<hi>you</hi> and <hi>your</hi>) are of the same nature: inasmuch as the one is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the other: Now as [<hi>Your</hi>] is applicable to one as to many, so is (<hi>You</hi>) likewise. Again it is both proper and rational to tell a single person, This house is your house, for you have a good Title to it; which is as proper and rational, as to say, <hi>thou</hi> hast a good Title to the house; and consequently it is not only irrational to affirm, that this doth alwayes confound the terms of (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>you.</hi>) Its Diabolical to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. They say for themselves; That holy men (in the Scriptures) did use the words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) not only one to another, but to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is granted; howbeit I pray, can any of you <hi>Quakers</hi> produce me one holy Man (in Scripture expressed) which used these words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) that he might thereby take occasion to deny (as ye wickedly do) all reverential respects to any sort of men of what rank or quality soever: sure I am, ye cannot produce me one such man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this bruitish kind of practice, is contrary to the manifold <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Presidents</hi> also, in the Scriptures of truth, as afterwards shall plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Indeed, we Christians do acknowledge, that holy men (in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) did use the words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) not only one to another, but to God himself, for two eminent Reasons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they might thereby be kept to the unity of the Godhead; for
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000313_0047_0FA4AA0B5843D290"/>
although Jehovah is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, yet he is not three Gods, but one, therefore holy men holding their minds to the unity of the essence; <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> were (and are) most proper and necessary to preserve their minds from a plurality of Gods: But this ground can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pleaded by a <hi>Quaker,</hi> who denieth a Trinity in Unity, and so, he denies the only true God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reas.</hi> Holy men used these words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) to God, and one to another, as occasionally they were by <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> drawn out to either of these words (<hi>sc. thou</hi> or <hi>thee</hi>) for <hi>all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. and in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;</hi> so then, its plain that Holy men (in Scripture) spake these words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>)to God, and one to another; but it was then, when they were moved thereunto by the Holy Ghost: but I pray, do ye <hi>Quakers</hi> never use those words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) but then when ye are occasionally drawn out, or moved by the Holy Ghost to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: if any of you, should be so notoriously vile, as to father the use of those words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) upon the Spirit, would not the Holy Ghost tell thee, that thou art of thy Father <hi>the Devil, who is a lyar from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Although holy men frequently used those words, as above; yet they never thereby took occasion to deny, but ever used reverential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to all sorts of persons, according to their rank and quality: as for instance, <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18. 1, 2, 3. <hi>as he sat in the Tent-door, he lift up his eyes and looked, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th,</hi> and ver. 8. <hi>he communed with them saying, if it be your mind:</hi> And ver. 5. <hi>the children of Heth answered Abraham,</hi> saying, <hi>hear us my Lord: thou art a Prince of God amongst us.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> also. 1 King. 2. 19. arose from his Throne, and bowed himself to his Mother; and <hi>Joseph,</hi> Gen. 28. 12. bowed himself to his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> with his face towards the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Sarah</hi> obeyed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and called him Lord:

unto these <hi>Presidents,</hi> many more might be alledged. Thus we see, though these holy persons often used (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) yet they ever used reverential respects to all sorts of men, and that according to Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press command, as <hi>Lev</hi> 9. 32. <hi>Thou shalt rise up before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

which is thus further argued: what can the Saints (in all places and Countries) be more sensible of, then that the generality of <hi>Quakers,</hi> do purposely use those words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) to deny all reverential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to any sort of men, of what rank and quality soever: that by that means, they may intrude themselves to be equal with any of what rank or sort soever: nay, thereby to advance themselves, above all men, under the notion of a seeming perfection, which is a manifest product of their (God and Man) provoking pride: according to that of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 123. 4. <hi>Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the proud:</hi> and how is the Prophesie fulfilled in you, <hi>Isai.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>The child shall behave himself proudly against the antient, and the base against the Honourable:</hi> and observe ye well the words of the Lord Christ, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 23. <hi>Deceit, Blasphemy, Pride, Foolishness:</hi> of these four links, hath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan made your Chain of darkness; which is most evident, from a due consideration of the foregoing truths: Oh, how suitable is the Prophets Vision to a <hi>Quakers</hi> condition, <hi>Obad.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Behold, I have made thee small, then art greatly despised, the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee,</hi> &amp;c.

               <hi>Answ.</hi> The 23<hi>d.</hi> verse tells us. <hi>All men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father; he that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath sent him,</hi> (meaning, to fulfill all righteousness <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15.) Its then clear, that the Son of God, is the honour intended above; if any ask, who is this Son of God? the good Angel tells us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 3 5. <hi>That holy thing, which shall be born of thee.</hi> (Mary ver 34.) <hi>shall be called the Son of God:</hi> so then the Man Jesus Christ, is the honour that cometh from God only; which honour the <hi>Jews</hi> (like the <hi>Quakers</hi>) received not, as this Son of God told them <hi>ver.</hi> 43. <hi>I am come in my Fathers Name, and ye receive me not</hi> (sc. by Faith,) hence Christ infers, <hi>ver.</hi> 44. above, <hi>How can ye believe, which receive Honour one of another, and seek not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which cometh from God only.</hi>

            <p>Hence, (as I suppose) it is, that <hi>George Fox</hi> (in his Folio Book, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> page 71.) asserts; <hi>That Christs Nature is not humane, which</hi> (saith he) <hi>is earthly, the nature of the first</hi> Adam.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> I would gladly know of this <hi>Fox,</hi> whether [Humane] doth not rather signifie, a <hi>Man kind nature,</hi> consisting of Soul and Body: Its true we read (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7.) <hi>the first Adam was of the earth earthly,</hi> in regard of his body (not his soul) which God form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Earth.

            <p>The second <hi>Adam</hi> (or Man) is the Lord from heaven as above.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because Christs Man kind nature was conceived in <hi>Mary,</hi> by the power of the Highest overshadowing her. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35.</p>

Besides, this Title, (<hi>sc.

            <p>That the pretended Light in them, is their true Christ, Teacher, Rule, and Guid, to be heard, believed in, walked up unto, and obeyed, as the only Saviour, to give remission of sins, and Salvation with God: to which <hi>F.

1. That this their Teaching, doth (as much as in them lies) make the Lords Christ a lyar: for we read <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 35, 36, 37. <hi>Dost thou</hi> (saith Christ to the Man that was born blind) <hi>Believe on the Son of God; he answered and said, who is the Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said unto him, thou hast both seen him, and it is be that talketh with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> If our Lord spoke truth here; then he, whom this man both saw and talked with (with his bodily eyes and tongue) was the <hi>Messias,</hi> the <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Son of God:</hi> and in <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 25, 26. <hi>The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man said unto him, I knew that Messias</hi> (our Saviour) <hi>cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things: Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here observe, the Lord Jesus Christ, as of purpose to rebuke this lying Spirit (of a <hi>Qaukers</hi> Mystical' Invisible Flesh and Blood, their Internal saving Christ) doth testifie of himself, that he, who was both seen and heard, by the bodily eyes and ears of the Woman, with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed, was the <hi>Messias,</hi> the true Christ, and Teacher of all things: And in <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 61, 62. <hi>Again the High Priest asked him, and said unto him, art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? and Jesus said, I am:</hi> here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Lord Jesus testified of himself, that he on whom the High-Priest looked, and to whom he spake) was the Christ, the Son of the blessed.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 13 <hi>to</hi> 18. the Lord Jesus proposeth two questions to his <hi>Disciples.

               </gap>eth him blessed, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly declares, that this confession, is the rock upon which the Church is built: and withal Christ assures his Disciples, that against this <hi>Rock (the joyn confession,</hi> sc. <hi>That Jesus the Son of man, is the Christ the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, the Gates of hell shall never prevail:</hi> O ye <hi>Teaching Quakers,</hi> is not this enough to open the eyes of your blind <hi>Idol</hi> within. Again, how hath our Lord himself, said of himself (even since his being ascended and glorified) <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 8. <hi>I am Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> whereby is plainly affirmed, the now present glorified existence of the Man Jesus Christ of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and hereunto agrees that which he foretold of himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. <hi>And they shall see the Son of Man, coming in the clouds of Heaven, with power

and great glory:</hi> the whole is this, is Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> (whom they wickedly call the out side Christ) be not the true Christ and our only Saviour; then he is (according to a <hi>Quakers</hi> inside Christ) a Lyar in all the words uttered by him above: but let God be true, and his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Liars; such Liars are <hi>Teaching Seancing Quakers;</hi> yea, accursed Liars, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1 8, 9. as above.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this Teaching in their Meetings, doth (as much as in them lies) make the holy Spirit of Christ Lyar: for we read in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. the Prophets, searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

That the Holy Ghost revealed to just and de out <hi>Someon,</hi> that the Child Jesus, which he took up in his arms, and saw with his bodily eyes was the Lords Christ and Salvation, prepared before the face of all people. And <hi>Paul</hi> also (by the inspiration of the Spirit) assures us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>That the Grace of God, and gift by Grace, which by one man Jesus Christ, hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded to many:</hi> this one Man, is no other then Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the man approved of God (not in, but) among the <hi>Jews, who with their wicked hands, did take, and him they crucified and slew,</hi> Act. 2. 22, 23 The sum is this, If the Man Jesus Christ of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> slew, and hanged on a tree, and God raised from the dead the third day, and exalted to be the only Saviour (be a Spiritual inside Christ, a Heavenly Man of Mystical, Invisible flesh and blood) then the holy spirit of Truth must be a Lyar; which to affirm (as <hi>Quakers</hi> in effect do) is horrid Blasphemy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They do in their Meetings and aimes make the Angels of Christ Liars, as it appears by the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> Mat. 1. 20, 21. <hi>Behold the Angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph,</hi> saying, <hi>Fear not to take unto the Mary thy Wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost; and she shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call his Name Jesus,</hi> for <hi>he shall save his people from their sins.</hi> And in <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 30, 31, 32. <hi>And the Angel said unto her, fear not Mary, for thou hast found favour with God, and behold thou shalt conceive is thy womb, and bring forth a Son, and shall call his Name Jesus, and he shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:</hi> and again on his Birth day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 10, 11. <hi>And the Angel said unto them</hi> (the Shepherds) <hi>fear not;</hi> for, <hi>behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people; for to you is born this day, in the City of David, a Saviour which is Christ the Lord,</hi> and ver. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Suddenly there was the Angel a

E.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, saying, I <hi>thought</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that thou hadst meant otherwise:</hi> this Answer was like himself.</p>
            <p>But for as much as some of the <hi>Quakers</hi> have (as I am informed) since affirmed, <hi>sc.</hi> that <hi>F. E.</hi> did me no wrong, in charging me with Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as above: I shall therefore endeavour some further satisfaction in in this matter: As from the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 23,24. <hi>Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off: can any bide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in secret places, that I should not see him? saith the Lord, do not I first Heaven and Earth? saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these <hi>Questions,</hi> are resolved into this one <hi>Position;</hi> namely, that the <hi>Deity</hi> is omnipresent, in all things every where. The <hi>Divine Being</hi> filleth all things and places: for, though he be not circumscribed by any thing that is made, nor limited to any place; yet it is not excluded from any place, creature or thing. <q>This (saith Mr. <hi>Carils</hi> on <hi>ler.</hi> 23. <hi>above</hi>) is a Mystery which indeed we are not able to comprehend by reason, but we must take it down by Faith, which gives credit to the Word of God, and perswades the heart, that the report therein made is a Truth.</q> But if any ask, <hi>how the Deity may be said to be every where, and in every thing, and creature that is made?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, This Mysterious and astonishing Question, with <hi>Augustine, (Epist.</hi> 55. <hi>ad Dard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>) who affirms. <q>That the Deity is wholly every where, and in every thing; for the Godhead cannot be divided or parted:

            <p>There is a Truth in all these Assertions, for the <hi>Deity</hi> is infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible, and therefore wheresoever the <hi>Deity</hi> is, he is all and altogether, filling all places, creatures and thing in heaven, hell, sea, and earth; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 139 7,8 <hi>Job.</hi> 11 8,9. <hi>Isai.</hi> 43.2.

            <p>[Note: though I thus Argued; yet it was not to exclude other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated respects in this Text of Scripture.]</p>
            <p>To which he Replied, saying, <hi>That he had both Baptisme, and the Lords Supper within him:</hi> But I proved the contrary, thus; <hi>Baptisme and the Lords Supper are visible signes, of the invisible efficacy of Christs one Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Body; but the visible signes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (namely <hi>washing with water in</hi> (or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) <hi>the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and the Bread and Wine, broken, and given, and poured forth) are not within thee; therefore the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Baptisme, and the Supper of the Lord are not within thee:</hi> To this he made no Reply.</p>
            <p>By the way, let the <hi>Reader</hi> observe, <hi>to wit,</hi> That the Teaching, Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Quakers</hi> do usually affirm, the true Church Officers, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Worship, are in God; and that the <hi>Deity</hi> is in them: therefore all these are invisibly in them: being (as they prate) immediately made by the Spirit (<hi>still the Idol-light within</hi>) whence they conclude that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the Lords Supper are within them: though their assertions herein, be frequently and most plainly contradicted by themselves: For they maintain and keep up visible Meetings, Officers, Light worship, and Worshippers: and thus by their constant, visible practice they clearly confute themselves, living in contradiction to their own fanciful Principles and being self confuted, they are self-condemned: <hi>How great is this darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, here hence it is, That they acknowledge no other Baptisme, then of the Holy Ghost, and of Fire (which makes many of them (as its supposed) so hot, two <hi>Wives</hi>) calling it their internal warmth, and spiritual refreshment: nor no other Lords Supper, than their daily Feasts of fat things, which (as they dare say) feed them with heavenly joyes, glories, and unspeakable delights: often attended with a dissembled kind of <hi>canting-hummings</hi> within: a new kind of charm to seduce the itching ear, and soft head, with unscriptural novelties: so much for their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and invisible Sacraments. I pass to the second <hi>Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> Was taken from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it self beareth witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>But this holy Spirit doth not bear witness with thy Spirit, that thou art a Child of God:</hi> Therefore, the Spirit of God is not in thee.</p>
            <p>He denied the Assumption; which I proved, <hi>The Holy Spirit Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them only to be Gods Children,</hi> which do believe <hi>Jesus Christ of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> to be the true Christ, and their only Saviour, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26.</p>

               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:000313_0071_0FA4AA22A46EA518"/>
               <hi>But thou dost not believe on Jesus of Nazareth to be the true Christ, and thy only Saviour;</hi> Therefore, <hi>the Holy Spirit doth not bear witness with thy Spirit, that thou art a child of God, and consequently thou hast not the Spirit of God within thee:</hi> To which he made me no Return at all; so that his <hi>staring silence,</hi> gave open consent to the concluded Truth above.</p>
            <p>The 3<hi>d. Argument</hi> was thus formed: sc. <hi>He that maketh God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Lyar, hath not the Spirit of God in him: but thou makest God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Lyar:</hi> This Minor he confidently denied, but I proved it, thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that believeth not the Record, which God gives of his Son, makes him a Lyar,</hi> 1 Joh 5. 10. <hi>But thou believest not the Record, that God gave of his Son.</hi> Therefore, <hi>thou makest God the Father a Lyar:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He denied the Minor Proposition; For (as he said) he believed the Record that God gave of his Son: But I proved the contrary, thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Record that God gives of his Son,</hi> is this, <hi>sc. That Jesus Christ</hi> (as Man) <hi>is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the World,</hi> Joh. 1. 29,30. with 34 <hi>verse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thou dost not believe the Record,</hi> Namely, <hi>That Jesus Christ</hi> (as Man) <hi>is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the World;</hi> Therefore thou didst not believe the Record, that God gave of his Son: consequently, thou makest God a Lyar, and such Blasphemers have not the Spirit of God in them: here again the Lord stopt his Mouth, that he had not a word to say for himself.</p>
            <p>As I was thus Arguing this Truth, (<hi>sc.</hi> That the Spirit of God, was not in this Disputant <hi>W.

               </gap>ie: I do therefore intreat you, to ponder seriously on this weighty matter, concerning Jesus Christ of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary;</hi> that he is now in a present glorified and bodily existence in the third Heaven above, and that he now hath (though denied by <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi>) in the Heavens above, true flesh and blood, the nature and properties of a true mankind body; which Mr. <hi>Doolittle</hi> plainly proves, by propounding (in the <hi>Young-man's Instructor</hi>) four Questions.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Had not Christ a real humane, mankind body, when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose out of the Grave; forasmuch as he shewed the prints of the nailes in his hands and feet to <hi>Thomas,</hi> Joh.20.27, surely, this cannot be denied with any colour of reason.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:000313_0073_0FA4AA242A9DE1B0"/>
2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Did he not ascend with the same body, or had he not the same body when he was parted from his Disciples; forasmuch as they saw the same body, go up, that talked with them, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9,10,11. No man can deny this, with whom the Scriptures of truth, have either Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Credit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Quest.</hi> Can you say, that Christ put off his body, after he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of sight before he came into heaven; or if you should say it, doth any Scripture favour you herein? neither <hi>Socinian, Quaker,</hi> or any other to this day, ever produced (nor can) any such Scripture: For <hi>Stephen</hi> saw Christs humane body since in Heaven above. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.55,56.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Quest.</hi> Or can you tell, that Christ put off his body, since he came to Heaven, and <hi>Stephen saw him there:</hi> I am (said he) most sure, that you can tell no such thing; for the testimony of the holy Angels is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, for they did assure the Disciples, that the same Jesus that they saw ascend, should be so seen to come again, <hi>Act.</hi>1.9,10,11.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And will not these four things, put you out of doubt, <hi>sc.</hi> that Christ hath the same body now, that he had upon the earth: Oh, how great is the ground of a true Christians comfort, that the same person that died for us, is thus sate down at the right hand of God: aad that there we have the same Jesus interc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eding for us in heaven: on the other side is it not matter of dread and terror to the wicked (both in practice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that still continue to oppose an exal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed Christ, and prefer their base Lusts and Errors before this glorious Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>The second part of the charge being fully ended, <hi>W. Wilkinson</hi> called on me, to make Good the third part of the Charge. <abbr>

               <hi>That the Prime Pinciples of a Quaker, are the same which were held and professed by the Beasts, that</hi> Paul <hi>fought with at</hi> Ephesus.</p>
            <p>Which I thus Argued:</p>
            <p>It appears by the manifold Arguments, which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> used towards the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to prove the Resurrection of Christs body from the dead, and the bodies of the Saints by him: now their <hi>Principles</hi> were these <hi>to wit,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the body of Christ was not raised from the dead (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he is not Jesus, a Saviour)</p>
            <p n="2">2. That no Mans body shall be raised from the dead, (and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Christ shall not be the riser of the dead.)</p>
            <p>The first of these the Apostle confutes, <hi>in Chap. above, ver.</hi> 3,4. <hi>For I declared unto you first of all, that which I received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the</hi> Scriptures: <hi>And that he was buried, and that he rose again</hi> the third day, <hi>according to the</hi> Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And the second likewise, in <hi>ver.</hi> 13,14,15. <hi>&amp;c. But if there be no Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:000313_0074_0FA4AA259A24BBD8"/>
of the dead, then is Christ not risen; And if Christ be not risen, we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God, that he raised up Christ, whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here hence <hi>Paul</hi> infers, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. <hi>If after the manner of men, I have fought with Beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not; let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if the Apostle he I said, fit must be with our Bodies, as with Beasts after <hi>Death,</hi> then it would be best for us to <hi>Live</hi> as Beasts in our Time of Life; intimating that there resolves and desires is to live in Brutish lust &amp; pleasures, these are the most predominate motives that perswaded them to deny and oppose the Resurrection of the dead; which opposition I charged upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> then present:  To which,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Wilkinson</hi> replyed, saying <hi>Shew us an express Scripture which saith, That the Beasts which</hi> Paul <hi>fought with at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>denyed the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answered,</hi> 1. It was plainly implyed in that <hi>Text</hi> of Scripture: and it doth evidently concenter therein: Besides, in reason, there is nothing that could be the ground or occasion of this Fight (or violent contention) between <hi>Paul</hi> and these <hi>Brutish</hi> disputants, but the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I gave him the liberty to put his own interpretation upon the words (in <hi>vers.</hi> 32. above) To which he made no reply at all. Let me here add, It is more then probable, that the Beasts <hi>Paul</hi> fought with at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> were the same <hi>persons</hi> (or of the same <hi>beastly</hi> perswasion) which, in other places opposed <hi>Paul'</hi>s Doctrines, of Faith in Jesus, and the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead. As in <hi>Athens,</hi> Act. 17. 18. <hi>Then certain Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of the</hi> Epicurians (whom <hi>Calvin</hi> on the <hi>Text</hi> calls <hi>Beasts) encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him; and some said, What will this babler say; othersome, He seemeth to be setter forth of strange gods, because he preacheth unto them Jesus and the Resurrection; at which some mocked, vers.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>And in the beginning of this 19. <hi>Chap. (vers.</hi> 1,2,3.) We read, that <hi>Paul</hi> went into the Synagogue of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Thessalonia,</hi> and three Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes reasoned with the <hi>Jews</hi> out of the Scripture, <hi>Opening and alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead: And that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ</hi>

            <p>I Replied, 1. That the Words repeated by him, were in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. and withal, the Apostle saith not, that the body shall be raised a Spirit, but Spiritual; as Christs body of flesh and bones, after the Resurrection, was Spiritual, but not a Spirit: for Christ assured his Disciples, that his body was not changed into a Spirit; <hi>Behold and see, for a Spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have,</hi> Luk. 24. 39. <hi>It is the same true and real body which is presented to you,</hi> saying, <hi>It is I my self.</hi> Now, as it was with Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy raised from the dead, so it shall be with our body (as to the substantial sameness) after the Resurrection, inasmuch as the Resurrection of Christs body is made a pledge of our Resurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</hi> Again, <hi>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is raised a Spiritual Body, because then the body shall have no need of natural helps, of which a natural body stands in need of, as sleep, meat, rayment, but a spiritual body needs them not, this is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all orthodox Authors: Christ told the <hi>Sadduces</hi> (who said <hi>there is not Resurrection</hi>) That after the Resurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.39. <hi>They neither Marry nor are given in Marriage, but are as the Angels in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <hi>Francis Eastlack</hi> stood up again, and boldly said, That the Scripture saith, it shall not be the same body at the Resurrection; and forthwith called to me for the Bible which was in my hand, he turned to the 1. <hi>Cor. Chap.</hi> 5. and read the 36,37,38. <hi>verses.</hi>

            <p>As for the similitude of <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Grain,</hi> mentioned in the verses above, I shall answer with Reverend Mr. <hi>Caril:</hi> 
               <q>It is (saith he) very true, that the Corn or Grain which is sowed, doth not arise again in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or after that quality or likeness in which it was cast into the ground: we sow bare Seed, but when it comes up again it comes with a stalk, and an ear, and shoots up in much greeness and beauty: there is a great difference between a grain of wheat in the bushel, and a flourishing stem, or ear of Corn in the field: God gives it another body in the growing up, but yet it is still a body, and there is the same nature in it still, and the same substance of the grain remains still; only there is an addition of beauty and greenness when it is risen and grown up: so the Body that is cast into the Ground, is like a [<hi>bare</hi>] grain: it is cast in a bare (or naked) body, but when it shall be raised again, the body shall have many beautiful and glorious additions: so that in the Resurrection there will be an adding of somewhat to that which was before; the Corn grows up, with somewhat that it bad not, but it doth not lose any thing that it had: tis still a garin of wheat and be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </abbr> it cannot possibly be, or it is impossible to be: as if <hi>Job</hi> had said, do but acknowledge that any one is born ordinarily of a Woman, and we may conclude him to be sinful and unclean, with (or in the sight of) God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If the words should be understood in the <hi>Quakers</hi> sense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove asserted: then the new birth would exclude the being of sin, in all the born of God: for the new birth agrees to them all, to one as well as to another; as the reason given in the same verse doth testifie: <hi>Because his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God:</hi> now the seed remains in all the born of God, as well as in any: well then, it must be meant of all Saints, or none: Now, if the Teaching <hi>Quakers</hi> should be so stark mad, as to affirm all Saints to be free from sin, the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8. will reprove their madness: for, <hi>if we</hi> (who are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Saints, and born of God) <hi>say, that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us:</hi> all men may see, that these words were spoken of and by such Saints, as had, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. fellowship with the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ: and yet they have certified, <hi>sc. if that we say, that we have no sin, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. The phrase [<hi>Fulness</hi>] is to be expounded by a distinction, there being a double fulness; namely, of <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Degrees:</hi> for the first of these, we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 55. <hi>But he</hi> (Stephen) <hi>being full of the Holy Ghost;</hi> this Respects the fulness of parts only, that is, he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The phrase [<hi>Blameless</hi>] (on which the <hi>Quaker</hi> puts his whole stress) may refer to an Unbeliever, yea, to a perfect for of Jesus Christ of <hi>Nazareth, Phil.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Touching the righteousness which is in the Law, Blameless;</hi> even then, when <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>graceless,</hi> he was <hi>blameless:</hi> this I have only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. It will not therefore follow that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was perfect without sin, because there is no mention made of her sin; let it be will observed, that in the 6<hi>th verse</hi> above, <hi>They are both said to be righteous and blameless,</hi> even then when the best or them both, was guilty of actual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the spirit should be divided against it self, it should be spirit of contradiction: for instance; the spirit witnesseth in the Scripture, <hi>That the true Christ and our only Saviour was and is Jesus Christ of Nazareth, a man approved of God; who was taken by the Jews, slain and hanged upon a Tree, whom God raised from the dead the third day, and exalted to be a Prince and Saviour:</hi> Thus the spirit witnesseth in the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 22,23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 30,31,34.</p>
               <p>But a <hi>Quaker</hi> pretends, that the spirit witnesseth in his Conscience, that there is a light within him, which is the true Christ and only Saviour; which is not the Man Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which the <hi>Jew:</hi> never slew, nor hanged upon a tree, nor was ever raised by <hi>G</hi>od from a bodily death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> The spirit witnesseth in the Scripture: <hi>That he is a Righteous man, who walketh in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord,</hi> Luk. 1. 16.</p>
               <p>But a <hi>Quaker</hi> pretends that the spirit witnesseth in his Conscience, that he is a righteous man, who for sakes all the commanded Ordinances of the Lord.</p>

Moreover the Scriptures tells us of divers things long before themselves were written: <hi>to wit,</hi> that (after the Fall) the Word of God was manifested to <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife, and likewise, that God manifested himself to <hi>Cain</hi> (by his word) three times, <hi>Gen:</hi> 3. 8 9. and afterward that the World of God came to <hi>Noah,</hi> and so to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Now (O ye <hi>Teaching, Seducing Quakers</hi>) I would ask you this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: sc. <hi>Could your Light within tell you ought of all this, if the written Scriptures had not told it first?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet, you would fain make us belive; that your Light within is the true Scripture, and Word of God even the everlasting Word: so that this most notorious lie, (the whimsie, called Light within) is the new devised ground of your Faith, and Religious Worship.</p>
               <p>Oh, ye poor Soul deluded, and Soul deluding ones: know assuredly, that this Doctrine of your beloved <hi>Idol light</hi> in your own addle brains) is directly contrary to what the Lord Christ said to his Father, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his, Apostles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 8. <hi>I have given them thy words,</hi> (word ver. 14.) <hi>which thou gavest me, and they have received them, and have known surely, that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note here, that the words which the Father gave to Christ, and Christ to his Apostles, they believed; and (so believing) Preached them to the World: the Substance whereof is in their written <hi>G</hi>ospel, and Epistles: which is to true Christians, the Word of <hi>G</hi>od, and the ground of their Faith, but ye (Soul-deceivers) labour to dissolve this ground of our Christian Faith, because ye would lay a Foundation of your own humane Invention, <hi>sc.</hi> an un bloody Light within, which Idolized Light, hath no more real blood in it, then there is in the Transubstantiated Bread of your Popish Brethren; wherein both ye and they do exactly agree, in one feigned blood less Sacrifice for sin: which is evidently another <hi>Gospel,</hi> which stands under the doubted Curse of <hi>G</hi>od, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8,9. which is further confirmed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Blood is no remission.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The Soul of Man was made after <hi>G</hi>ods Image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>And God said, let</hi> [Us] <hi>make man in our</hi> (<hi>sc.</hi> the Father, through the Son, by the Spirit) <hi>Image, after our likeness,</hi> i.e in our Image, most like to (not the same with) us.

               <p>The second Scripture, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Then shall the dust return to the Earth, as it was, and the Spirit shall return to God who gave it:</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence, they argue, <hi>The Soul of Man is God in part, for God is a Spirit.</hi>
