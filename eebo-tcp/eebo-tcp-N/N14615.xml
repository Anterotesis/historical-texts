            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>NOTES ON THE ESTABLISMENT OF A MONEY UNIT, AND OF A COINAGE FOR THE UNITED STATES.</head>
            <p>IN fixing the Unit of Money, theſe circumſtances are of principal importance.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That it be of <hi>convenient ſize</hi> to be applied as a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the common money tranſactions of life.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That its parts and multiples be in <hi>an eaſy propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to each other, ſo as to facilitate the money arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the unit and its parts or diviſions be <hi>ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the value of ſome of the known coins,</hi> as that they may be of eaſy adoption for the people.</p>
            <p>The Spanish dollar ſeems to fulfil all theſe conditions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Taking into our view all money tranſactions, great and ſmall, I queſtion if a common meaſure of more <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="2"
                      facs="unknown:018541_0002_0FA7B3182E3358C8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſize</hi> than the dollar could be propoſed. The va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lue of 100, 1000, 10,000 dollars is well eſtimated by the mind. So is that of the tenth or the hundredth of a dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Few tranſactions are above or below theſe limits. The expediency of attending to the ſize of the money unit will be evident to any one who will conſider how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient it would be to a manufacturer or merchant, if, inſtead of the yard for meaſuring cloth, either the inch or the mile had been made the unit of meaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The moſt <hi>eaſy ratio</hi> of multiplication and diviſion is that by ten. Every one knows the facility of decimal arithmetic. Every one remembers, that, when learning money-arithmetic, he uſed to be puzzled with adding the farthings, taking out the fours and carrying them on; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the pence, taking out the twelves, and carrying them on; adding the shillings, taking out the twenties and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them on. But when he came to the pounds, where he had only tens to carry forward, it was eaſy and free from error. The bulk of mankind are ſchool boys thro' life. Theſe little perplexities are always great to them. And even mathematical heads feel the relief of an eaſier ſubſtituted for a more difficult proceſs. Foreigners too who trade or travel among us, will find a great facility in underſtanding our coins and accounts from this ratio of ſubdiviſion. Thoſe who have had occaſion to convert the livres, ſols and deniers of the French, the gilders, ſilvers and penings of the Dutch, the pounds, shillings, pence and farthings of theſe ſeveral ſtates into each other, can judge how much they would have been aided had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſeveral ſubdiviſions been in a decimal ratio. Certainly in all caſes where we are free to chuſe between eaſy and difficult modes of operation, it is moſt rational to chuſe the eaſy. The Financier, therefore, in his report, well propoſes that our coins should be in decimal proportions to one another. If we adopt the dollar for our unit, we should ſtrike four coins, one of gold, two of ſilver, and one of copper. viz.
<list>
                  <item>1. A golden piece equal in value to 10 dollars.</item>
                  <item>2. The unit, or dollar, of ſilver.</item>
                  <item>3. The tenth of a dollar, of ſilver alſo.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:018541_0003_0FA7B318F4377A38"/>4. The hundredth of a dollar, of copper.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Compare the arithmetical operations on the ſame ſum of money expreſſed in this form, and expreſſed in the pound ſterling and its diviſions.</p>
            <p>Addition. <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>Subtraction. <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>Multiplication by 8. <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:018541_0004_0FA7B319AE2FB718"/>Diviſion by 8. <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>A bare inſpection of the above operations will evince the labour which is occaſioned by ſubdividing the unit into 20ths, 240ths, and 960ths, as the English do, and as we have done; and the eaſe of ſubdiviſions in a decimal ratio. The ſame difference ariſes in making payment. An Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman, to pay 8l 13s. 11 d. ½ qrs muſt find by calculation what combination of the coins of his country will pay this ſum. But an American, having the ſame ſum to pay, thus expreſſed 38.65 Dollars, will know by inſpection only, that 3 golden pieces, 8 units or dollars, 6 tenths and five coppers pay it preciſely.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The third condition required, is that the unit, its multiples, and ſubdiviſions coincide in value with ſome of the known coins ſo nearly, that the people may, by a quick reference in the mind, eſtimate their value. If this be not attended to, they will be very long in adopting the innovation, if ever they adopt it. Let us examine in this point of view each of the four coins propoſed.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:018541_0005_0FA7B31B215080E0"/>1. The golden piece will be ⅕ more than a half Joe, and 1/15 more than a double guinea. It will be readily eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated then by reference to either of them; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and accurately as equal to 10 dollars.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The unit or dollar is a known coin, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar of all to the minds of the people It is already adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from South to North; has identified our currency, and therefore happily offers itſelf as an unit already introduced. Our public debt, our requiſitions, and their apportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have given it actual and long poſſeſſion of the place of unit. The courſe of our commerce too will bring us more of this than of any other foreign coin, and therefore renders it more worthy of attention. I know of no unit which can be propoſed in competition with the dollar, but the pound. But what is the pound? <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>5<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7 grains of fine ſilver in Georgia; 1289 grains in Virginia, Connecticut, Rhode iſland, Maſſachuſets, and New Hampshire; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>031 ¼ grains in Maryland, Delaware, Pennſylvania, and New Jerſey; 966 ¾ grains in North Carolina and New York. Which of theſe shall we adopt? To which ſtate give that pre-eminence, of which all are ſo jealous? And on which impoſe the difficulties of a new eſtimate for their corn, their ca<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tle, and other commodities? Or shall we hang the pound ſterling, as a common badge, about all their necks? This contains 718 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>/4 grains of pure ſilver. It is difficult to familiarize a new coin to the people. It is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to familiarize them to a new coin with an old name. Happily the dollar is familiar to them all; and is already as much referred to for a meaſure of value as their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective provincial pounds.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Tenth will be preciſely the Spanish bit, or half piſtereen. This is a coin familiar to us all. When we shall make a new coin th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n equal in value to this, it will be of ready eſtimate with the people.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The hundredth, or copper, will differ little from the copper of the four Eaſtern ſtates, which is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of a dollar; ſtill leſs from the penny of New York and North Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina which is 1/<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of a dollar; and ſomewhat more from the penny or copper of Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Delaware and Maryland, which is 1/90 of a dollar. It will then be about
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018541_0006_0FA7B31D08FD21D8"/>
the medium between the old and the new coppers of theſe ſtates, and therefore will ſoon be ſubſtituted for them both. In Virginia coppers have never been in uſe, It will be as eaſy therefore to introduce them there of one value as of another. The copper coin propoſed will be nearly equal to three four hs of their penny, which is the ſame with the penny lawful of the Eaſtern ſtates.</p>
            <p>A great deal of ſmall change is uſeful in a ſtate, and tends to reduce the prices of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mall articles. Perhaps it would not be amiſs to coin 3 ſupplementory pieces of ſilver, one of the value of five tenths, or half a dollar, one of the value of two tenths, which would be equal to the Spanish piſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reen, and one of the value of five coppers, which would be equal to the Spanish half bit. We should then have five ſilver coins, viz.
<list>
                  <item>1. The unit or dollar.</item>
                  <item>2. The half dollar or five tenths.</item>
                  <item>3. The double tenth, equal to .2, or ⅕ of a dollar, or to the piſtereen.</item>
                  <item>4. The tenth, equal to a Spanish bit.</item>
                  <item>5. The five copper piece equal to .05 or 1/20 of a dollar, or to the half bit.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The plan reported by the Financier is worthy of his ſound judgment. It admits however of objection in the ſize of the unit. He propoſes that this shall be the 1440 th part of a dollar: ſo that it will require 1440 of his units to make the one before propoſed. He was led to adopt this by a mathematical a tention to our old currencies all of which this unit will meaſure without leaving a fraction. But as our object is to get rid of theſe currencies, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage derived from this coincidence will ſoon be paſt, whereas the inconveniencies of this unit will for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, if they do not altogether prevent its introduction. It is defective in two of the three requiſites of a money unit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is inconvenient in its application to the ordinary money tranſactions. 10,000 dollars will require 8 figures to expreſs them, to wit, 14,400,000 units. A horſe or bullock, of 80 dollars value, will require a notation of ſix figures, to wit, 115,200 units. As a money of account
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018541_0007_0FA7B31E4548E7C0"/>
this will be laborious, even when facilitated by the aid of decimal arithmetic: as a common meaſure of the value of property, it will be too minute to be comprehended by the people The French are ſubjected to very laborious calculations, the livre being their ordinary money of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and this but between ⅕ and ⅙ of a dollar. But what will be our labours, should our money of account be 1/144<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Financier ſtates the old dollar as containing 376 grains of fine ſilver, and the new 365 grains. If the dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars circulating among us be of every date equally, we should examine the quantity of pure metal in each, and from them form an average for our unit. This is a work proper to be committed to Mathematicians as well as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and which should be decided on actual and accurate experiment.</p>
            <p>The quantum of alloy is alſo to be decided. Some is neceſſary to prevent the coin from wearing too faſt. Too much would fill our pockets with copper inſtead of ſilver. The ſilver coins aſſayed by Sir Iſaac Newton varied from 1 ½ to 76 penny-weight alloy in the pound Troy of mixed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. The British ſtandard has 18 dwt. The Spanish coins aſſayed by Sir Iſaac Newton have from 18 to 19 ½ dwt. The new French crown has in fact 19 ½, though by edict it should have 20 dwt. that is 1/1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. The taſte of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen will require that their furniture plate should be as good as the British ſtandard. Taſte cannot be controuled
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018541_0008_0FA7B31EF03AE898"/>
by law. Let it then give the law in a point which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to a certain degree. Let the legiſlatures fix the alloy of furniture plate at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8 dwt. the British ſtandard, and Congreſs that of their coin at one ounce in the pound, the French ſtandard. This proportion has been found convenient for the alloy of gold coin, and it will ſimplify the ſyſtem of our mint to alloy both metals in the ſame degree. The coin too being the leaſt pure, will be leſs eaſily melted into plate. Theſe reaſons are light indeed, and of courſe will only weigh if no heavier ones can be oppoſed to them.</p>
            <p>The proportion between the values of gold and ſilver is a mercantile problem altogether. It would be inaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to fix it by the popular exchanges of a half Joe for eight dollars, a Louis for four French crowns, or five Louis for twenty-three dollars. The firſt of theſe would be to adopt the Spanish proportion between gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; the ſecond the French; the third a mere popular barter, wherein convenience is conſulted more than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy. The legal proportion in Spain is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6 for 1, in England 15 ⅕ for 1, in France 15 for 1. The Spaniards and English are found in experience to retain an over-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of gold coins and to loſe their ſilver. The French have a greater proportion of ſilver. The difference at market has been on the decreaſe. The Financier ſtates it at preſent as at 4 ½ for 1. Juſt principles will lead us to diſregard legal proportions altogether; to enquire into the market price of gold in the ſeveral countries with which we shall principally be connected in commerce, and to take an average from them. Perhaps we might with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lean to a proportion ſomewhat above par. for gold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering our neighbourhood and commerce with the ſources of the coins, and the tendency which the high price of gold in Spain has to draw thither all that of their mines, leaving the ſilver principally for our, and other markets.</p>
            <p>It is not impoſſible that 15 for 1, may be found an eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible proportion. I ſtate it however as conjectural only.</p>
            <p>As to the alloy for gold coin, the British is an ounce in the pound; the French, Spanish, and Portugueſe differ
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018541_0009_0FA7B31FB71038D0"/>
from that only from a quarter of a grain to a grain and a half. I should therefore prefer the British, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its fraction ſtands in a more ſimple form, and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litates the calculations into which it enters.</p>
            <p>Should the unit be fixed at 365 grains of pure ſilver, gold at 15 for 1, and the alloy of both be one twelfth, the weights of the coins will be as follows:</p>
            <p>The golden piece, containing 243 ⅓ grains of pure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,—22.12 grains of alloy, will weigh 11 dwt. 1.45 grs.</p>
            <p>The unit or dollar, containing 365 grs. of pure metal, 33.18 grs. of alloy, will weigh 16 dwt. 14.18 grs.</p>
            <p>The half dollar, or five tenths, containing 182 ½ of pure metal.—16.59 grs. of alloy, will weigh 8 dwt. 7.09 grs.</p>
            <p>The fifth, or piſtereen, containing 73 grains of pure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,—6.63 grs. of alloy, will weigh 3 dwt. 7.6<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> grs.</p>
            <p>The tenth, or bit, containing 36 ½ grs. of pure metal,— 3.318 grs. of alloy, will weigh 1 dwt. 15 818 grs.</p>
            <p>The twentieth, or half bit, containing 8 ¼ grs. of pure metal,—1.659 grs. of alloy, will weigh 19.9 grs.</p>
            <p>The quantity of fine ſilver which shall conſtitute the unit being ſettled, and the proportion of the value of gold to that of ſilver; a table should be formed from the aſſay before ſuggeſted, claſſing the ſeveral foreign coins accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their fineneſs, declaring the worth of a penny-weight or grain in each claſs, and that they shall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tenders at thoſe rates, if not clipped or otherwiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished; and where diminished, offering their value for them at the mint, deducting the expence of re-coinage. Here the legiſlatures should co-operate with Congreſs in providing that no money be received or paid at their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries, or by any of their officers, or any bank, but on actual weight; in making it criminal in a high degree to diminish their own coins, and in ſome ſmaller degree to offer them in payment when diminished.</p>
            <p>That this ſubject may be properly prepared and in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for Congreſs to take up at their meeting in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, ſomething muſt now be done.

            <head>Supplementory Explanations.</head>
            <p>THE preceding notes having been ſubmitted to the conſideration of the Financier, he favored me with his opinion and obſervations on them, which render neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the following ſupplementory explanations.</p>
            <p>I obſerved in the preceding notes, that the true propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of value between gold and ſilver was a mercantile problem altogether, and that perhaps 15 for 1 might be found an eligible proportion. The Financier is ſo good as to inform me, that this would be higher than the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket would juſtify, Confident of his better information on this ſubject, I recede from that idea.<note n="*" place="bottom">In a Newſpaper, which frequently gives good details in politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal oeconomy, I find, under the Hamburgh head, that the preſent market price of gold and ſilver, is, in England 15.5 for 1: in Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia 15: in Holland 14.75: in Savoy 14.6: in France 14.42: in Spain 14.3: in Germany 14 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>55. The average of which is 14.675 or 14 5 8ths. I would ſtill incline to give a lîttle more than the market price for gold, becauſe of its ſuperior convenience in tranſportation.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo informs me, that the ſeveral coins in circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among us have been already aſſayed with accuracy,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018541_0012_0FA7B32241DB7AA8"/>
and the reſult published in a work on that ſubject. The aſſay of Sir Iſaac Newton had ſuperſeded, in my mind, the neceſſity of this operation as to the older coins, which were the ſubject of his examination. This latter work, with equal reaſon, may be conſidered as ſaving the ſame trouble as to the latter coins.</p>
            <p>So far then I accede to the opinions of the Financier. On the other hand, he ſeems to concur with me in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſmalleſt fractional diviſion too minute for an unit, and therefore propoſes to transfer that denomination to his largeſt ſilver coin, containing 1000 of the units firſt propoſed, and worth about 4<hi>ſ</hi>2 lawful, or 25/<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6 of a dollar. The only queſtion then remaining between us, is whether the dollar, or this coin, be beſt for the unit. We both agree that the <hi>eaſe of adoption with the people</hi> is the thing to be aimed at.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the dollar, events have overtaken and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded the queſtion. It is no longer a doubt whether the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can adopt it with eaſe. They have actually adopted it, and will be to be turned out of that into another tract of calculation, if another unit be aſſumed. They have now two units, which they uſe with equal facility, viz. the pound of their reſpective ſtate, and the dollar. The firſt of theſe is peculiar to each ſtate: the ſecond happily common to all. In each ſtate the people have an eaſy rule for converting the pound of their ſtate into dollars, or dollars into pounds. And this is enough for them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing how this may be done in every ſtate of the union. Such of them as live near enough the borders of their ſtate to have dealings with their neighbours, learn alſo the rule of their neighbours. Thus in Virginia, and the Eaſtern ſtates, where the dollar is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>ſ</hi> or 3/<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0 of a pound, to turn pounds into dollars, they multiply by 10 and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide by <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to turn dollars into pounds, they multiply by 3 and divide by ten. Thoſe in Virginia who live near to Carolina, where the dollar is 8<hi>ſ</hi> or 4/10 of a pound, learn the operation of that ſtate, which is a multiplication by 4, and diviſion by <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0, et e converſo. Thoſe who live near Maryland, where the dollar is 7<hi>ſ</hi>6 or 3/8 of a pound, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018541_0013_0FA7B327B377A4D8"/>
by 3 and divide by 8, or e converſo. All theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are eaſy, and have been found by experience not too much for the arithmetic of the people, when they have occaſion to convert their old unit into dollars, or the reverſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the unit of the Financier, in the ſtates where the dollar is 3/10 of a pound, this unit will be 5/24. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion into the pound then will be by a multiplication by 5 and diviſion by 24. In the ſtates where the dollar is 3/8 of a pound, this unit will be 25/96 of a pound, and the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt be to multiply by 25 and divide by 96, or e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſo. Where the dollar is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>/10 of a pound, this unit will be 5/18. The ſimplicity of the fraction, and of courſe the facility of converſion and reconverſion, is therefore againſt this unit, and in favour of the dollar, in every inſtance. The only advantage it has over the dollar is, that it will in every caſe expreſs our farthings without a remainder; whereas, though the dollar and its decimals will do this in many caſes, it will not in all. But, even in theſe, by extending your notation one figure further, to wit, to thouſandths, you approximate to perfect accuracy within leſs than the two thouſandah part of a dollar, an atom in money which every one would neglect. Againſt this ſingle inconvenience the other advantages of the dollar are more than ſufficient to preponderaté.—This unit will preſent to the people a new coin, and whether they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eſtimate its value by comparing it with a pound, or with a dollar, the units they now poſſeſs, they will find the fraction very compound, and of courſe leſs accommodated to their comprehenſion and habits than the dollar. Indeed the probability is that they could never be led to compute in it generally.</p>
            <p>The Financier ſuppoſes that the 1/100 of a dollar is not ſufficiently ſmall where the poor are purchaſers or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. If it is not, make a ſmaller coin. But I ſuſpect that it is ſmall enough. Let us examine facts, in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where we are acquainted with them. In Virginia, where our towns are few, ſmall, and of courſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for neceſſaries very limited, we have never yet been
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018541_0014_0FA7B328E935FCE0"/>
able to introduce a copper coin at all. The ſmalleſt coin which any body will receive there is the half bit, or 1/20 of a dollar. In thoſe ſtates where the towns are larger and more populous, a more habitual barter for ſmall wants has called for a copper coin 1/90 or 1/9<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or 1/108 of a dollar. In England where the towns are many and populous, and where ages of experience have matured the conveniencies of intercourſe, they have found that ſome wants may be ſupplied for a farthing, or 1/<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of a dollar, and they have accommodated a coin to this want. This buſineſs is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently progreſſive. In Virginia we are far behind. In ſome o her ſtates they are farther advanced, to wit, to the appreciation of 1/90, 1/9<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 1/108 of a dollar To this moſt advanced ſtate then I accommodated my ſmalleſt coin in the decimal arrangement as a <hi>money of payment,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding with the <hi>money of account.</hi> I have no doubt the time will come when a ſmaller coin will be called for. When it comes, let it be made. It will probably be the half of the copper I propoſe, that is to ſay 5/<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>00 or .005 of a dollar, this being nearly the farthing of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But it will be time enough to make it when the people shall be ready to receive it.</p>
            <p>My propoſition then is that our notation of money shall be decimal, deſcending ad libitum of the perſon noting; that the unit of this notation shall be a dollar, that coins shall be accommodated to it from ten dollars to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth of a dollar; and that to ſet this on foot, the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions be adopted which were propoſed in the Notes, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſtituting an <hi>enquiry into the fineneſs of the coins,</hi> in lieu of <hi>an aſſay</hi> of them.</p>
