            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>LET not the word <hi>ſcripture,</hi> in the title page, prevent that general attention to theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes which they might otherwiſe receive. I know it is natural for us to be cautious in looking into any thing that borders on religion, leſt we ſhould meet with ſome ſly inſinuation <hi>like a bayon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et-point to dart upon the conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this reaſon, in the very <hi>patibulo,</hi> or entrance, I am careful to aſſure my countrymen, that theſe diſcourſes are what they pretend to be, <hi>of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture chiefly political.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were written at different times, ſince the opening of the laſt campaign in Pennſylvania, and were intended for the military. The three firſt were delivered on ſome occaſions.</p>
            <p>If they ſhall now more generally ſerve the great cauſe in which we are engaged, it will be an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple recompence for the time ſpent in tranſcribing them for publication</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is very uſual in any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, when we mean to draw a character to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt point, to compare it with one already known, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly eminent in virtue, or in vice. This is the ground, of the expreſſion in this place, woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain—</p>
            <p>Cain, we know, was a bloody-minded man. The fierceneſs of his nature, did very early ſhew itſelf, in great vehemency of paſſion, and in the ſullen gloom of a reſerved countenance. He was very wroth, and his countenance was fallen. No wonder, for he was indeed a very bloody man. He ſhed the firſt blood that ever crimſoned the earth. He bathed his hands in a brother's blood. Theſe two circumſtances of his guilt, place him firſt, in the line of murderers. He is ſo infamouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015748_0006_0F9A26EBE9392190"/>
famous, that when we mean to ſay of any one, that he is fierce and ſavage to a high degree, we may ſtrike off his character at once, by ſaying, he hath gone in the way of Cain.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not detain you, with a longer introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">I. What it is to go in the way of Cain.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Who are they, who have moſt eminently, gone in the way of Cain.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, conclude with ſomething in the ſpirit of theſe words—Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What it is to go in the way of Cain. It is to give indulgence, in the leaſt unlawful meaſure, to the anger and reſentment of the breaſt; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hateth his brother, is a murderer. The evil principles of envy, malice, and ambition, like ſo many younger Cains, lurk within the breaſt, and wait only for an opportunity to ſhew themſelves in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The evil principles of envy, and ambition, lead to murder; for they ſeek to end in the death of thoſe, who ſtand in the way of the propoſed riſe, and ſtrike not readily to their ſuperior greatneſs. Hence it is, that the tyrant makes war upon his own, or the neighbouring nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they refuſe to live precariouſly by his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to hold their property, liberty, and life, intirely at his diſpoſal. It is the nature of the wicked heart of man, to deſire abſolute dominion. Let a wicked man be made a magiſtrate, and he will deſire to be ſupreme in office; and if ſupreme by the appointment of his countrymen, he will aſpire to unreſtrained authority; and in order to acquire deſpotic rule, he will not heſitate to ſhed the blood of kinſmen, friends and fellow-citizens. This is to go in the way of Cain—To ſhed blood like him, and to take the ſame character up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth—But I am to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:015748_0007_0F9A26ED34897E50"/>II. Who are they who have moſt eminently gone in the way of Cain. I need not tell you, that ſuch is the degeneracy of human nature, that we all, ſome time or other, have gone lengths in the way of Cain. The rich man hates him that is richer than himſelf, becauſe he is unwilling that any one ſhould be equal or ſuperior to him, in the ſame line of eminence. The learned for the ſame reaſon, hates him that is more learned ſtill, and the candidate for office, hates the brother candidate. A temper of this caſt, is not ſo rare, as men unattentive to themſelves and to others, may ſuppoſe it. What man is there among us, who is not conſcious to himſelf, of having too much indulged the paſſion of reſentment againſt a brother, from ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper cauſe and principle? What man is there among us who has not found in himſelf a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome revenge againſt a brother, becauſe he had not ſubmitted to him in a diſpute in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, or in a competition for a magiſtracy, or place of public truſt and appointment of ſome kind or other? Every man has his ambition, and in the fruſtration of this particular hope, by the competition of a rival, he is vulnerable. The lady envies dreſs, precedency, and degrees of honour in the ſphere peculiar to herſelf. The gentleman is troubled at the mention of ſuperior fame, in wealth, wit, learning, or honour in ſome other way. Envy, malice, hatred and revenge may be found in ſome degree, at ſome time or other, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every breaſt. We have therefore all proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frequently too much, in the way of Cain.— But,</p>
            <p>Who are they who have moſt eminently gone, in the way of Cain? From the day that Cain ſlew Abel, to the preſent hour, there have been many, who have gone in the ſame path of blood, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom hiſtory is ſilent. One half the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015748_0008_0F9A26ED697DFE78"/>
mankind is buried in oblivion. From the day of Cain to the deluge, we have particularly, the name but of one man, who ſhed human blood. Lamech, by his own confeſſion, ſlew a man to his wounding, and a young man to his hurt; and with ſuch circumſtance of aggravation, that in his own judgment, he had deſerved a puniſhment ſeventy-fold greater than the puniſhment of Cain. In this long period we have the name but of Lamech on record, though, no doubt, there were many more who ſhed the blood of man. The earth at this time was filled with violence—with contention, with havock, with war and blood-ſhed in every place. Many an unjuſt tyrant ſought dominion, and obtained it by the death of thouſands. Such was the ſcene of things before the flood: But by and by, the ſacred hiſtory, more and more unfolds it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and we begin to ſee many, very many, to take the character of Cain upon the earth. Nimrod firſt began to be a mighty one; that is, as we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, one who firſt at the head of a ſmall band made himſelf famous, but ſhortly dared to uſurp dominion over others, that were not willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. But as we have nothing more explicit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, I paſs him by, and come down to a more remarkable perſonage, even Pharoah king of Egypt, who went with haſty ſteps, and to a great length in the way of Cain. I might ſay a great deal of this bloody man, and ſet in high colours, the complexion of his crime, who to the ſlavery of the father, added the infant ſon's death. But I leave this inſtance in my view, and likewiſe all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the choſen people, under the tyrants, that made war upon them, after their ſettlement in the promiſed land. I leave behind me the cruelty of many of their own kings, and in particular the bloody tragedy of Ahab, who took the life of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, for the ſake of the poor man's vineyard,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015748_0009_0F9A26EE2BAF1EE8"/>
upon which he had fixed his covetous deſire. I leave behind me the inroad of the Syrians, and all that the Chaldean monarch did, when he tranſplanted the ten tribes from their own land, to a diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I come down to profane hiſtory, and there I likewiſe leave behind me, all that is told us of the mighty captains and conquerers of ancient time— the Alexanders—the Caeſars—the Jengiſchans—the Tamarlanes. I leave behind me, all that is related of the Hun, the Vandal, or the Goth, and all the cruel, perſecuting, bloody princes, and people in more modern times, when Europe floated as one ſea of blood. I paſs them by, and haſten on, for I have an object of greater wickedneſs in view—an object of ſuch accompliſhed fraud, perfidy, and murder, that every one heretofore mentioned, is loſt and diſappears. I mean him of England—the fierce, cruel, unrelenting, and bloody king of Britain. What has this tyrant done? What has he not done?</p>
            <p>He meditated with himſelf in cold blood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had the leaſt foundation of reſentment, the enſlaving of this riſing country. He could view with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a tear, &amp; without one check of conſcience, this early land, bound in the chains of ſervitude, which he forged for it. This was the proſpect, which he had painted to his own imagination. It was this which he endeavoured to accompliſh, by the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous, and as he hoped inſenſible gradation of a ſlow approach, in bribery, and flattering promiſes to vain perſons, and then by diſtant acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that did not ſeem immediately to involve the loſs of freedom, but did by ſure ſteps lead to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

With what continued and unbroken obſtinacy, hath he perſevered in the deſign. Let the ſtreets of Boſton, and the bloody fifth of March, be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his cruelty, when ſeveral lovely and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting youths fell by the hands of the bloody Preſton, who acted the ſavage pleaſure, of his ſtill more ſavage maſter. Let the ſtreets that were wet with this blood, and drank it not, for the blood ran down upon the ſtones.—Let the ſtreets that were wet, and ran down with this blood, ſpeak loud of it, and cry to heaven for a day of vengeance. Let the town of Boſton be witneſs to their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—The town of Boſton with the cries of infants, and the groans of diſtreſſed mothers, detained from their relatives and huſbands, by the perfidy of Gage, in violation of his plighted faith. Let the heights of Boſton, naked of the ſiſter town, which ſtood upon them, be witneſs of the cruelty of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Let theſe call to mind, and ſhew the graves of the brave men, who fell fighting gallantly, for the noble cauſe of freedom. Let theſe be witneſs to the tyranny, and at the ſame time, ſome part of the puniſhment of Britain; for the heroes ſaw themſelves revenged, and ſlept not in death, untill fifteen hundred of the foe, lay vanquiſhed on the ſoil. Let the heights of Canada, and the environs of Quebec, call to mind, and publiſh the bloody veſtiges of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in that unhappy country. Like the heights of Gilboa, let them be ever recollected, for there the blood of a Montgomery flowed upon the plain. Like the blood of Abel, it ſhall cry from the hoſtile ground, and God ſhall require it of the George of England, as he required the like blood of Cain, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where is my Montgomery, who once drew his ſword in thy defence, before theſe very walls—who
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015748_0011_0F9A26EFAA8B1148"/>
continued faithful, until the hand of tyranny was ſtretched to deſtroy? From the heights of Canada, to the diſtant barrier of Fort Sullivan, let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate ſtates, give in remembrance, to remoteſt times, what they have ſuffered, from the Heſſian raviſher, and from the inroad of the cruel Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, waſting their plantations. Let the Jerſey ſtate be witneſs to their veſtiges. Let the blood of Haſler, on the plain of Princeton, cry aloud to God for a day of retribution. Let the fourteen wounds of Mercer, with the bayonet-point, on the ſame vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious eminence, open their dumb mouths afreſh, and cry aloud for juſtice.</p>
            <p>But omitting thoſe who fell in the field of battle, let the unhappy priſoners of the ſtates declare what they have ſuffered from the tyrant.—Let the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Fort Waſhington, relate the hunger, cold, and every ſhape of miſery to which they were conſigned. Sick, emaciated, dying, let them tell, if by their laſt breath, they can give ſome faint account of it, How for many days they taſted not food, until ſharp famine began to prey upon their vitals, and deſtroy the love of life.—How for many months they were detained, in the wintry and inclement ſeaſon of the year, comfortleſs, in cold rooms, and without fire, until the blood of the body loſt its motion in the veins. Let them tell the quality and pernicious taſte, of that unwholeſome food, which was ſerved to them, and intended for their death. This let thoſe who ſuffered ſpeak; but we can teſtify, what was the appearance and lamentable ſtate, of the meagre, faint and heart-dejected few, who for a time ſurvived the uſage, and at length to ſave ſome pretence of an exchange, were diſmiſſed from the fangs of ſuch barbarity. We ſaw them— oh ſpectacle of horror and commiſeration! the legs ſwollen, and from the ancle to the knee, of an equal ſhape—the belly contracted to the ribs—the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015748_0012_0F9A26F06B861ED0"/>
eye ſunk, and hid within the head—the viſage nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row—the cheeks fallen to the bone—the voice ſhrill, feeble, and not to be diſtinctly heard—the dreſs ragged and ſcarcely hanging on the body. Aſk one of theſe, what became of his companion, whom we ſee not? He died the firſt week partly with hunger and partly with the cold. He recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his wife, and infant children, to God, and his death to be revenged by his country. What became of another whom we ſee not? He died the ſecond week on board the ſhips, by the badneſs, and, as we ſuppoſe, poiſon of the food, which was ſerved to us. He hoped that the God of heaven and the freemen of his country would call the tyrant to account for this. What became of another known to us, but whom we ſee not now amongſt you? He died the third, the fourth, the fifth, or the ſixth week of our captivity. He, with twenty more, was found dead, one morning, amongſt our feet. They had periſhed with cold, being without covering in the night. Many, very many periſhed every day. The carriage for the dead, came, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning, to the door. From twenty-five or twenty-ſeven hundred, we are now reduced to twelve, and of the twelve hundred that were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to depart, not perhaps one hundred worn out with ſickneſs, which cold and famine had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, are now alive.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, great has been the cruelty of this infernal tyrant; but to add to this, let the priſoners taken by his pyrates on the ſea, be witneſs of his horrid depredation. Let the priſoners ſent by him to India, and the burning iſlands of the eaſt, be witneſs of his inhumanity. There hath he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſend—There hath he ſent our brethren and our fellow-ſoldiers in the common cauſe. There hath he ſent them, diſtant far, and hopeleſs from their native land, to antichriſtian ſettlements and pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015748_0013_0F9A26F12A2F7810"/>
domains. There hath he ſent our countrymen, beyond thoſe ſettlements, and ſolitary ſtreams, at which the captive Hebrew ſat, and hung his harp upon the willow-tree; for muſic ſuited not in ſuch diſtreſs. There many a poor American may ſit this day, forlorn, and deeply melancholy, in a diſtant clime. There may they ſit, far on the Cape of Comorin, or on the Malabar or Coromandel ſhore, looking weſtward o'er the main, to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſun, where their native country lies. There may they ſit and look in vain; for the tyrant hath ſentenced them, though fairly priſoners in war, to this unpitied ſtate. This hath he done, and this hath he purpoſed to do, while we have treated thoſe of the enemy, who by the chance of war, have fallen into our hands, with every exerciſe of tenderneſs, compaſſion, and humanity. This we have done, but as for them, they have gone in the way of Cain.</p>
            <p>This hath come more immediately in later in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances before our eyes. Their ſad cruelties are now tranſacted on our own plains. They have landed—they have travelled through a part of the adjacent country—they have burned dwelling-houſes—they have deſtroyed proviſion and the means of life—they have tortured for money, thoſe whom they ſuſpected of poſſeſſing it—they have driven the peaceful inhabitants from their places of abode—they have violated the chaſtity of women who fell into their hands—they are bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on and breathing ſlaughter to the whole ſtate. <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>I conclude, with ſomething in the ſpirit of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015748_0014_0F9A26F1EBA581F8"/>
words; woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain. In the language of a ſoldier, too often and very iniquitouſly uſed, it might be ſaid damn them; but ſuch expreſſion is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Let our reſentment be levelled againſt their practice, and let our execution be ſtayed on their bodies, but let us ſpare the ſoul. Let us wiſh them ſpiritual happineſs; but let every thought and exerciſe of mind draw forth it ſelf againſt their conduct. Let us endeavour to conceive with ſtrength the baſeneſs of their crime; and let us ſpeak to others what we have conceived, ſo that we may fix the deteſtation of it beyond a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be eraſed This is laudable, for a juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt indignation againſt any vice or evil practice, is an evidence of virtue. This is neceſſary, for we are too apt to loſe our hatred of evil, from a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and acquaintance with it. Hence it is that they who are once enſlaved, do very ſeldom exert themſelves, to ſhake off the bondage. It is in this as it is ſaid to be in the charm of a ſerpent—We fall in love with that which ought to be the object of our hate, as it is the inſtrument of our deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is therefore neceſſary to beget, increaſe, and keep alive an averſion from it—To inkindle our reſentment, not by curſes and indecent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but by ſenſible remonſtrances to our ſelves and with each other. Let it be woven in our daily converſation; woe unto them for they have intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enſlave us—They have intended to ſubjugate us to their empire—To make us hewers of wood, and drawers of water, and in every baſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vaſſals to their deſpotic power. By this they have intended to prevent the growth of every art and ſcience in this country; for without freedom, learning ſhall decay and no art can flouriſh. In the deſtruction of our freedom, they have intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the eradication of every private virtue; for

when the ſoul is unbraced and enervated by the poiſon of a baſe ſubjection, nothing generous or noble can be expected from it. It is a ſentiment as old as the poet Homer—
<q>
                  <l>For Jove decreed it certain, that the day</l>
                  <l>Which makes a man a ſlave, takes half his worth away.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Woe unto them, for they have rejected the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and humility of our petitions. They have rejected them with a fierce diſdain. They have been deaf to all entreaty, and the ſofteſt words of ſoft expoſtulation. They have purſued, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, the dire intention to deſtroy us. They have purſued it in a cruel manner. They have wared with a rage unknown to civilized nations. They have mangled the bodies of our heroes, on the field of battle. They have defaced our colleges, and ſchools of learning. They have burned houſes of religious worſhip. They have ſtabbed, and ſhed the blood of an unarmed and ſupplicating clergyman. This they have done to perſons of the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and religion with themſelves. Woe unto them, for they have ſhed a brothers blood. They have gone in the way of Cain.</p>
            <p>Let us be careful to recollect, and commemorate their conduct. Let every claſs of men join to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the tyrant, and the tyranny; and to rank the George of England with the Cains, and the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Mankind. Let fathers teach their ſons the degenerate nature, and the name of Engliſhmen. let mothers ſtill with this the children on the breaſt, and make the name a bug-bear. In thought, in word, let indignation have a place; but chiefly in our actions, let ſtrong reſentment ſhew itſelf. Let the aged father ſend his ſon to battle, with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and reſignation.

or with tears. Let the ſoldier in the field, and to ſuch I principally addreſs myſelf—Let the ſoldier in the field behave with fortitude. Let him forget the effeminacy of a tender and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious life. Let him ſummon up the blood—give indignation to the viſage, and let the ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment flaſh from the enraged eye. Let him, in obedience to his orders, ſhew himſelf ſteady—in execution of them prompt—in every enterprize undaunted. Let the arm be ſtretched with vigour, and give full revenge its ſcope.

            <p>ONE remarkable character, recorded in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hiſtory, is that of Cain, who thro' envy of the accepted ſacrifice, ſhed his brother's blood. Another, not a whit behind him, in malignity of diſpoſition, is Balaam, the ſon of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs. If it may be ſaid of the fierce tyrant and his bloody ſoldiery, that they have gone in the way of Cain; with no leſs proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it may be ſaid of a certain claſs amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they have ran greedily after the error of Balaam, for reward.</p>
            <p>This will abundantly appear, if we conſider in a few words,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What was the error of Balaam.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Who are they who have ran moſt greedily, according to the ſame error.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, what is the reward, which they have in view, as the ground of this pernicious conduct.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What was the error of Balaam? In order to illuſtrate this, it will be neceſſary to ſay a little of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015748_0018_0F9A26F4EBD3F880"/>
his birth, education, character and ſtory. We have reaſon to believe he was of the family of Shem; for he was of Aram ſo called, as is moſt probable, from Aram, the ſon of Shem, who firſt ſettled in that country. If ſo, he was collaterally related to the Iſraelites; for theſe, by Abraham, the patriarch, were deſcended from Arphaxad, who was likewiſe the ſon of Shem. Uz was the eldeſt ſon of Aram, and gave name to a diſtrict of country, waſhed by the Euphrates, and bordering upon Aram. Job liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the land of Uz, and was probably of his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. Job and Balaam, therefore, may have been related in ſome degrees of conſanguinity. They lived, it is probable, nearly about the ſame period; for Moſes, a few years before this time, is ſuppoſed to have written the book of Job. The country of Midian, where Moſes kept the flock of Jethro, is not ſo far diſtant from the land of Uz, where Job lived, but that he might be well acquainted with the ſufferings of this good man, which for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Hebrews in affliction, he may have drawn up in dramatic narrative, as we now have it in the ſacred canon.</p>
            <p>Be theſe particulars as they may, with reſpect to the family of Balaam, the matter is more certain relative to his education. He was brought up, no doubt, in the knowledge of the true God; for the church was continued in the family of Shem; and though from him it ſpread itſelf principally in the line of Abraham, yet the other branches were not left wholly deſtitute of ſaving light. Job had the kowledge of the true God, and the ceremonies of his worſhip pure and unmixed with the ſuperſtition of the neighbouring nations. He was acquainted with the ſacred hiſtory, by tradition, as is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, from Adam, Seth, Noah and the other aged fathers of antiquity. This appears from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: "If I have hid my iniquity in my boſom,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015748_0019_0F9A26F5A97A7C08"/>
or covered my tranſgreſſion like Adam." Balaam, who, as we have ſaid, was co-temporary with Job, enjoyed the ſame opportunities of information, handed down in the ſame family. The knowledge of the true God was not yet wholly loſt in that eaſtern country. It was not wholly loſt, many ages after, at the coming of our Saviour; for it was from Meſopotamia, a diſtrict bordering to this, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Euphrates, that the wiſe men came, who had ſeen his ſtar in the eaſt—The very ſtar of which Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam had propheſied, as about to ariſe out of Juda. This ſtar was prefigurative of the Meſſiah; and it argues ſome knowledge of Chriſt about to come, that theſe men paid attention to it.</p>
            <p>With regard to the particular character of this ſo celebrated and extraordinary perſon, there is a great variety of judgments and conjectures. Some ſuppoſe him to have been a necromancer, and that by his ſkill in magic he was able to do wonders. They think it probable that he had ſome ſmaller devil, or familiar ſpirit, to wait upon him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with contingencies; ſo that it was no great difficulty for him, to prognoſticate the fate and iſſue of any undertaking. I am of opinion that were it even ſo, that he had formed an intimacy with the devil, yet it would have availed him very little towards the knowledge of a future circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for I am diſpoſed to believe that ſatan cannot ſee an inch before his noſe into futurity, more than other people. It is therefore to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly eſtabliſhed, that Balaam was a prophet of the true God, and had his inſpiration from the ſource that knoweth time, and chance, and all things. Yet I do not mean to ſay that he was a good and pious perſon. The contrary, is for himſelf, unhappy man! but too plainly evident; for though his language was ſometimes that of orthodox religion, yet his conduct was, in many
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015748_0020_0F9A26F66A234310"/>
places, very much its oppoſite. Theſe words are very good, and ſavour of devotion. "I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord to do leſs or more;" yet it is evident from the particulars of his ſtory, that it was not becauſe the love and fear of God reſtrained him, but becauſe in this caſe he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the gift and ſpirit of propheſy.</p>
            <p>His ſtory is as follows. The fame of one ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ſingular in the world, had penetrated to the neighbouring countries. He had, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances foretold the good or bad about to come to individuals, and ſo was thought of by the multitude, as one who muſt have had ſome hand in the good or bad which had befallen agreeable to his prediction. The notion of a ſpell, a charm, or a enchantment, is of very early origin. The king of Moab had heard of him and of his power in this capacity; and as he was at that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly uneaſy by reaſon of the Iſraelitiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in their journey through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had encamped upon his border, he caſts about for ſome expedient to ſupport himſelf againſt them. He bethinks him of the prophet who was ſaid to have ſome admirable power upon the eſtates of men, and on the human mind and body. He ſends a deputation of his wiſeſt princes, in company with the ſenators of Midian. The embaſſy was flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the meſſage not leſs ſo, for ſays the prince "I wot that he whom thou bleſſedſt, is bleſſed; and he whom thou curſedſt, is curſed." Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this inſinuating language, and the promiſe of a rich reward, the prophet is obliged to confeſs that they ſolicit him in vain; for that it was not in his power to do them any ſervice. An embaſſy more honourable, waits on him a ſecond time. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is of equal import; but withal he bids them ſtay with him that night; and in the morning he ſhould more diſtinctly know, what he could do for
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015748_0021_0F9A26F729CC93A8"/>
them. No doubt, he was very earneſt in his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, that it might be granted him, to do the king this favour. The hope of the preferment, and reward in hard money, for he would take no other, was a great incentive to his importunity. We may believe, he prayed by his bed-ſide, more heartily, this evening, for the gold, than he had prayed, at any other time, for grace. "If the men come to call thee, riſe up and go with them." The haſty prophet catches at the appearance of permiſſion; and does not wait, agreeable to the divine command, until the men had come to call him. He is up betimes, and has his aſs ſaddled at the door, and is ready to ſet out upon his journey, probably before the ſtrangers had got out of bed. It was on account of this ſuch haſte and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to go, that the anger of the Lord was ſo greatly kindled; and the aſs opening her mouth miraculouſly in the way, forbade his madneſs. I do not mean to give you circumſtancially the whole particulars of this incident. It will be equally unneceſſary to dwell upon the rite and ceremony of his offering ſacrifice, which, it is poſſible, had ſomething magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and necromantic in it; for it is ſaid on one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he went not to ſeek enchantments, as at other times; that is to offer ſacrifice, with ſeven altars, and ſeven victims on every altar; or with other rites which he had uſed before. Let it be ſufficient to obſerve, that he ſeems to have had ſome hope, by this means to prevail with God to put a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> his mouth, againſt this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for it is elſewhere ſaid, "I would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Balaam."</p>
            <p>What this wicked perſon could not do, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet commiſſioned by God, he endeavours to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh by human artifice and ſtratagem. He gives advice. The Jewiſh people, by the courteſy and arts of Midianitiſh women, are drawn in to ſin. For this, as it was ſagaciouſly expected by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015748_0022_0F9A26F7EB7F21C0"/>
who had obtained ſome knowledge of their law; the wrath of God came upon them, and there fell in one day, twenty and four thouſand. After Balaam had offered ſacrifice, it appears that he returned to his home. From thence, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he came again, with a view, moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, to give farther counſel and aſſiſtance; for in the ſlaughter of the Midianites, he is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and cut to pieces by the ſword.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee what was the error of Balaam. It was covetouſneſs. It was the baſeſt avarice. For the ſake of a ſmall increaſe of wealth, by the favour of a heathen prince, he was diſpoſed in his heart, to pronounce a curſe on the people whom God had peculiarly choſen—a people who had done him no injury, and with whom he had no quarrel—a people of the ſame origin, and of the ſame religion with himſelf. He was diſpoſed in his heart to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a curſe on this people, though he knew them to have lately ſuffered from ſevereſt bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; and to have waded through a thouſand difficulties, in emerging from this bondage. They had braved the threats of Pharaoh. They had encountered the ſolitude and famine of the deſert. They had penetrated through the wilderneſs. They had waged war with ſavage kings. They had overcome them; and were now advancing on, to take poſſeſſion of that country, which was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally their right, and which God had laid out for their inheritance. He was diſpoſed in his heart, to pronounce a curſe on this people; and if he did not actually, pronounce it, it was becauſe God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him, and turned his curſe into a bleſſing. He is forced to cry out, in the language of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic viſion, "Surely there is no enchantment againſt Jacob; nor is there any divination againſt Iſrael"—Againſt Iſrael, whoſe camp was then in view; and whoſe tents were ſpread along the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015748_0023_0F9A26F8AB834C28"/>
This was the error of Balaam. I come to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Who are they who have ran moſt greedily, after or according to the ſame error. I might ſhew that all are naturally too much of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly diſpoſition. I might prove it plain, that many who call themſelves proteſtants and good whigs, are greatly Balaamites at heart. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their own vain appetite for wealth and honour, more than the will of the moſt high, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good of men. How elſe is it, that we hear of ſo much ſquabbling for election among competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for truſt and office? How elſe is it, that many who have been advanced to honour, civil and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, do ſometimes threaten reſignation, from a chagrin, becauſe of inattention to their judgment; or from a pique and jealouſy of rank and place. This might be ground of declamation; but I mean in this diſcourſe to point out thoſe who have been moſt greedily the followers of Balaam. Dull as I am, like the aſs that ſpoke out in the way, I would, forbid the madneſs of this people.</p>
            <p>It will not be poſſible to recount every inſtance of ſuch abandoned wickedneſs, from ſacred and profane hiſtory. It may ſuffice to ſelect one more remarkable from ſcripture, and ſo come down to recent characters, well known and amply diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed among ourſelves. You will recollect the ſtory of the Edomite, who drew his ſword againſt the prieſts of Nob, to gratify the malice of the angry Saul. It is probable he apprehended them to be a vile ſet of Preſbyterians. Be this as it will, he drew his ſword againſt them; and from the ſame motive with that which operated on Balaam.—A deſire of favour and reward from a baſe prince. He dared to wage war with heaven, in order to obtain the favour of an earthly maſter. He ran in the error of Balaam.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:015748_0024_0F9A26F96B91B790"/>From the ſtory of the Edomite, let me call your attention to a certain claſs of men, amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who have ran greedily, after or according to the ſame error. This people have been long known by the name of Tories—A name originally applied in Ireland, to robbers on the high-way— afterwards to the paſſive-obedient and non-reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant men in England, who had taken part with the ſecond Charles. For as the robber on the high-way takes a purſe from the unwary and unarmed tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller; ſo the abettors of the tyrant endeavoured to rob the nation of its liberty, a more invaluable bleſſing. The loſs of liberty includes the loſs of property, nay a right to life itſelf, and all that is dear to the human heart. Such villains were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore properly enough denominated Tories. The writers of the paſt age have given us amply an account of them; but what need we conſult writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for what they have ſaid upon the ſubject, ſince there are ſuch originals amongſt ourſelves; and we have it in our power to draw from real life the portrait of many baſe perſons, who have acted in the ſame abandoned character. Let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to review their conduct.</p>
            <p>At the commencement of the diſpute between Great Britain and the colonies, they made uſe of every art to irritate the minds of Engliſhmen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. They repreſented us as a troubleſome and reſtleſs people, who were continually haraſſing government with our rebellious councils and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals—As a rich and luxurious people, that were in the mean time unwilling to contribute our propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the ſupport of government. When the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration had been made, and the tax was laid upon us, which gave riſe to the firſt remonſtrances, they endeavoured, by every art and ſoft ſurmiſe, to ſooth us into a lethargic indolence. The lenity, the mildneſs, the good intentions of the king were
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015748_0025_0F9A26FA2956B7C8"/>
at one time the ſubject of their declamation. At another time we had them perpetually harangue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the military ſtrength and reſiſtleſs empire of Great Britain. To oppoſe her arms was chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical; for in the end we muſt be forced to ſubmit. Our only way, was to petition very humbly, and by no means to iritate his Majeſty, by ſeeming to put ourſelves in the leaſt poſture of defence. When every petition had been rejected with diſdain, and reſiſtance was determined, what arts did they not make uſe of to divide our Councils and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? It was a Preſbyterian quarrel, and by no means that of the whole continent. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Boſton, doubtleſs, had it now in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation to give themſelves a king, and commence the tyrants of America. Should they unhappily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this, the hanging of the Quakers muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and the unreſerved deſtruction of every other denomination of the people called Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>When language of this nature became ſuſpicious, and was noted as a mark of Toryiſm, a new cant of villainy and nonſenſe was of neceſſity adopted. We might unite—we might wage war—but by no means think of independence. A meaſure of this nature would be madneſs; for ſuch were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of Great-Britain, that ſhe muſt devour us, at leaſt in one ſhort campaign. Baſe and ſhallow headed men! not to ſee that the very reaſon urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt independence, was of equal weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our lifting arms at all. If we had not a proſpect of ſucceſs, why did we make reſiſtance? And if in our firſt reſiſtance we had a proſpect of ſucceſs, how ſhould a ſtate of independent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire take that proſpect from us?</p>
            <p>When the declaration of an independent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, through abſolute neceſſity, had taken place; it gave to many, ſome plauſible pretence of receding from the aſſociation of their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015748_0026_0F9A26FAE96FAE68"/>
Many half-way gentlemen, who had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſteer a middle courſe, took hold of this occaſion, to retire; and plead it in excuſe for that enmity againſt the common meaſures, which they had hitherto entertained in their hearts, but thought not proper to declare. We thank them for it. We had been heretofore perplexed with them in our committees and aſſemblies, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friendſhip; and under this maſk ſtabbing the beſt intereſts of their country. Some of them had placed themſelves in the very councils of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and were plotting miſchief, in the boſom of the Congreſs. <note n="*" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>Since their retirement from what we may call public buſineſs in this way, they have not remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed idle. They have ceaſed not to circulate reports, unfavourable to the ſtate of our affairs. One while the New-England men who had been firſt in the debate were cowardly, and not to be depended on in battle. At another time the paper currency in circulation was ſo great, and of conſequence the debt of the empire ſo immenſe, that we could not hope, at any future period, to be delivered from it. Such baſe calumnies, and ſuch vain fears were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſpread by thoſe, who in the mean time, were retained in the capacity of ſpies to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and cruel enemies. What was there ſaid amongſt us which was not told to the Britiſh foe? What was there done which was not communicated to them? From within our very walls they have held a correſpondence with the forces of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. They have given them intelligence of our preparations to oppoſe them. They have ſuggeſted them advice, how, and where to invade us. They have been guides to our unnatural foes, in their inroad through the country. They have joined with them in the plunder of the inhabitans. They have
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015748_0027_0F9A26FBA975A1D8"/>
enliſted under the ſtandard of the tyrant, and have drawn the ſword againſt us.</p>
            <p>Thus invariably, from the firſt of our diſtreſs, by ſecret fraud, or open violence, they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured our deſtructon. They have ſpoken, thoſe of them who had the underſtanding to expreſs a word, if by any means they might retard our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. They have written, thoſe of them who had the ability to write, with a view to injure our exertions, and deſtroy our unanimity. They have acted, thoſe of them who had the courage to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in arms, if by any means they might faſten down that ſlavery, which they, inglorious mortals, muſt, in conſequence of our ſubjugation, be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to bear in common with us. What by ſpeeches full of fear, and cowardice, under the mark of friendſhip and of prudent thought, amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: what by counſel and advice ſuggeſted to our enemies; and what by aſſiſtance openly afforded to them, they have wrought us much injury. They have ran, after the error of Balaam—They have ran greedily—They have ran with a certain vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of appetite. They have had it in their hearts to devour men of the ſame origin, language, and religion with themſelves.</p>
            <p>Their anceſtors, equally with ours, had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the fierce rage of tyranny, under the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art family, on the throne of England. They had fled from the tyranny of Britain, to ſeek for ſhelter in the woods, and more hoſpitable deſerts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Here, we their offspring, had been born, and brought up together. Here, we had lived friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſociably, many years, in the ſame town, in the ſame village, or by the banks of the ſame native river. Their property with ours was equally invaded by the tyrant. The circumſtances of our ſuffering made the cauſe common. This, one would have hoped, might have ſoftened them to ſome warm thought
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015748_0028_0F9A26FC6AA25650"/>
of ſincere affection. There is a certain tenderneſs of the ſpirit in diſtreſs, which melts the ſoul of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſufferers to ſympathy, and expels the leaſt idea of envy, or reſentment, from the breaſt. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemies on board a veſſel, and periſhing from land, would ceaſe from variance, and be friendly to each other. The wildeſt Indian, in the woods of North-America, attacked by the common enemy, would league himſelf, and give aſſiſtance to his brothers. The fierceſt beaſt familiarized with a playful puppy, that truſts itſelf to his ſociety, would not devour, or prey upon it. But theſe men have out-ſavaged the Indian, and out-tygered the fierceſt beaſt that roams upon the mountain. They have forgot the fathers of which we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended. They remember not the town, or village, in which we drew our breath together. They call not to mind the ſchool at which we had our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon education. They have thrown aſide the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der name of country. They have rejected the idea of kinſmen and acquaintance. They have bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to the laws of God, and to all that is held ſacred amongſt men. They have curſed the cauſe in which we are engaged. They have curſed the meaſures neceſſary for our ſafety. They have ran in the error of Balaam. They have ran, for the ſame hope of a baſe reward. I am to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">III. What is the reward which they have in view, as the ground of this pernicious conduct? The favour of the tyrant, is, undoubtedly, the object which plays upon their fancy. They promiſe to themſelves great felicity, in the gladſome rays of his royal countenance. In his proclamations from his generals, and in his ſpeeches from the throne, he will vouchſafe them the heart-chearing appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of my loyal ſubjects. When the war is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and each has acted faithfully his part, he will ſend for them, and hold them out his hand to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015748_0029_0F9A26FDAC7AB030"/>
kiſs, at St. James's, in Old England. He will give ſome of them commiſſions, and admit them to the honour of ſerving him, in ſome capacity about the park, or in the palace yard. One more eminent among the reſt, he may conſtitute his butler; and another, he may graciouſly advance to the office of chief baker. Thoſe of them, whom he cannot ſtow away in this manner, he will provide for, in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. He will give them poſts in government. He will reward them for their villainy, with a number of the beſt houſes, in ſome of our chief cities. He ſhall ſatisfy their cravings, with two or three of the forfeited plantations. Some of the more active and leading men amongſt them, he will preſent, with ten or fifteen thouſand acres; and conſtitute them lords of ſome little manour, on the banks of the Delaware or Schuylkil. He will create them dukes, and earls, and baronets. He will promote them to very great honour, and he will do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall ſay unto him. This is what they have in view, as the ground of their pernicious conduct. Avarice, not conſcience, is at the bottom of their work. Avarice hath corroded, and eat out the ſoul of every tory. The ſoul of each is become degenerate, and, for every good purpoſe, uſeleſs. It is like a ſword ruſted in the ſcabbard, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be drawn forth to any thing generous or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is like the worm in the grave, and feeds upon the marrow bones of men.</p>
            <p>If then, to be a tory is ſo wicked and deteſtable a character, let us be careful to avoid that which has the leaſt appearance, or reſemblance of it. Who is there among us diſpoſed to hold back, when properly called upon to draw his ſword in our defence? That man is a tory, though not in the ſame degree with him who draws the ſword againſt us. Non-reſiſtance to the tyrant, is a ſpecies of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Who is there among us, who by unneceſſary
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015748_0030_0F9A26FDEF8DA520"/>
heſitation to comply with the injunctions of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of his ſtate, weakens the hands of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hinders the courſe of public order? That man is a tory though he know it not, and may not confeſs it. Who is there among us, who by a buſy competition at election, conſults his own vain am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and obtains by flattery, and fair ſpeeches, that place to which a perſon better qualified, might have been otherwiſe appointed? That man is a tory, and ought to be ranked with them. Who is there among us, who by envious and ill-grounded ſtories, againſt thoſe in office, endeavours to obſtruct the proper courſe and ſucceſs of the common mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? That man hath ſomething of the tory in him.</p>
            <p>If there is any man among us, who claims the reputation of a true whig, let him cultivate ſuch general philanthropy, and benevolence of ſpirit, that he ſhall eaſily prefer the good of the whole, to his particular honour and preferment. That Spartan was a true whig, who having ſtood candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date at an election, and finding himſelf out-voted by three hundred of his fellow citizens, came home contentedly; and told his little family, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he was glad to find, there were three hundred men in Sparta, better than himſelf.</p>
            <p>But in the laſt place; if toryiſm is ſo much to be dreaded, and ſo much to be abhorred, let us ſtrain every nerve to diſappoint its purpoſes, and eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it from the continent. What? Shall the day come when a baſe tory ſhall ſay to the honeſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, begone—this field is mine: the king hath given me a title to it. What? Shall he call that field his own, which is yet wet with the noble blood of your countrymen? Shall he poſſeſs that very ſoil where your father, or your brother, hath contended bravely, and perhaps loſt his life? Shall he triumph, and lead his evening dance, on the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015748_0031_0F9A26FEA96221A8"/>
very ground where the hero fell? May God avert ſuch misfortune; and under his almighty provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may our beſt endeavours be exerted, to prevent the dire and unhallowed curſe. May we uſe the means, in the uſual courſe of providence, conducive to this end—Skill in the ſenator—Valour in the ſoldier, and a ſoul of prayer, throughout the continent, in every breaſt.</p>

            <p>THESE words conſtitute the laſt branch of the ſentence, in which, to the characters already mentioned, is added that of Core, who is equally reprobated in his memory, and handed down as a warning to ſucceeding times. With a reference to him, it is ſaid, proverbially, of men vicious in their lives, and unhappy in their end, that they have periſhed in the gainſaying of Core.</p>
            <p>That I may apply this to the purpoſe, which I have in view, I ſhall conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. What was the gainſaying of Core.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Who are they, whoſe language, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath been in the ſame ſtile and character.</p>
            <p n="3">III. What ground we have to hope, that they ſhall likewiſe periſh in it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:015748_0033_0F9A2700EBBAF628"/>I. What was the gainſaying of Core. In the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew language, the name is written Korah; but our tranſlators, in this place, have elegantly changed the initial letter; and have given the word an Engliſh termination, ſo that we read it Core. The ſtory of this wicked and unhappy man, you will recollect, from the ſacred book; for he was at the head of that abandoned company, who roſe in oppoſition, to the line of order eſtabliſhed, in the ſacerdotal office. Aaron, at this time, was the high prieſt; and Moſes, in the capacity of chief judge, was veſted with the civil government. Moſes was himſelf of the tribe of Levi, and Aaron's younger brother; and ſo doubly qualify'd as the ſecond prieſt; and as the chief judge of the Jewiſh nation. The prieſtly office was by hereditary and ſucceſſive right, in his father's family; but his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the civil line, was of God's ſupreme and immediate appointment. Hence we ſee the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the crime of Core. It was an oppoſition to the will of God, in the perſons of thoſe who had been conſtituted by him. Envy was at the bottom of the wickedneſs of Cain, and avarice was the ruling motive with the ſon of Beor; but the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a vain heart, ſeems to have actuated Core. For being himſelf of the tribe of Levi, though by a younger brother, he had ſome pretenſions to the prieſthood; or at leaſt ſuch influence among the people, as flattered him with the hope of eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an equal ſhare in the adminiſtration of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. With this deluſive object in his view, we find him at the head of the above-mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, addreſſing theſe words to Moſes and to Aaron. "Ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Wherefore then lift ye up yourſelves above the congregation of the Lord!" At theſe words Moſes falls upon his face; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015748_0034_0F9A2701A9647B38"/>
with unexampled moderation, makes reply to this malicious language. He takes it not upon him, to aſſert his long eſtabliſhed authority, confirmed by ſo many miracles, and countenanced by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the divine Shekinah, in the tabernacle. He rather meekly refers it to God, from whom he had derived his authority, to annul, or to authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticate, and ſo decide between them. He appoints to-morrow for the day of tryal. "And it ſhall be that he whom the Lord ſhall chooſe, he ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; you take too much upon you, ye ſons of Levi." After this, at different times, Moſes ſeems again to have ſpoken to them; and this in the ſofteſt and moſt tender language. "Hear, I pray you, ye ſons of Levi, ſeemeth it but a ſmall thing unto you, that the God of Iſrael hath ſeparated you, from the congregation, to bring you near to himſelf, to do the ſervice of the tabernacle, and to ſtand before the congregation, to miniſter unto them? He hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren, the ſons of Levi with thee; and ſeek ye the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood alſo? For which cauſe thou and all thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany are gathered together againſt the Lord, and what is Aaron that ye murmur againſt him."</p>
            <p>Theſe words having had no effect upon their minds; he ſends for them, as it would ſeem, to his own tent; and there would willingly have talked the matter over, and have heard their grievances in private. For knowing the judgement about to fall on them, from God, he was compaſſionately ſorry for them, and deſirous by every method in his power, to prevent them bringing matters to a tryal which muſt be ſo fatal to themſelves. "Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſent to call Dathan and Abiram, the ſons of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab, who ſaid we will not come up." It is therefore no wonder, that we find, Moſes, though perhaps for the firſt time, on his own account, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wroth, and ſaid unto the Lord, "Reſpect not
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015748_0035_0F9A27026B80BBE8"/>
thou their offering; I have not taken an aſs from them; neither have I hurt one of them."</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what was the obſtinacy of theſe ambitious men. The word uſed in our text, might have been tranſlated obſtinacy. It is elſewhere, if I remember properly, rendered contradiction. Chriſt is ſaid to have endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners—that is obſtinacy and perverſeneſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. They had, no doubt, promiſed themſelves a place of greater truſt in government; and it was with this deluſive object in their view, that they rejected all intreaty, and would liſten to no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. I am to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Who are they, whoſe language and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath been in the ſame ſtate and character. That the worthies may be introduced with proper ceremony, I aſk your patience to premiſe a few particulars. In the Jewiſh theocracy, the legiſlature was commiſſioned by God; and the evidence or ſeal of his commiſſion, was the ſpirit of prophecy, or the power of working miracles. In other nations where God has not vouchſafed ſuch immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition, the conſent of the governed, is that which gives to any one, a right to empire and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Thus the choice and approbation of the people comes in the room of the divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or, in other words, is expreſſive of it. This may be the foundation of that very common max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im—The voice of the people, is the voice of God. Now let it be obſerved, that by this authority, I mean the general voice of a free people, fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had been choſen and appointed to enact laws, and regulate an empire in America. To this empire we owe obedience, and profeſs ſubmiſſion. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of this empire, the continental Congreſs takes the place of Moſes, in the Jewiſh legiſlature. Thoſe, therefore, who attempt to ſubvert ſuch conſtitution and appointment, and this in order that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015748_0036_0F9A270329F26740"/>
may have the rule over us, which is the aim of our Britiſh enemies, act in the ſame line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, with Core and his aſſociates.</p>
            <p>It will be evident, if you give me leave to aſk— what lawful ground have they on which to build authority? A divine commiſſion they have not, for otherwiſe, what propheſy of theirs hath been accompliſhed, or what miracle hath been performed by them? Our conſent they cannot plead; for we reject their government, and hate it, as we ought to hate ſin, which is the bane of human nature, and the poiſon of the ſoul. The claim of theſe men is groundleſs; yet they have perſiſted in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of it with very great obſtinacy.</p>
            <p>On the contrary our conduct with reſpect to them, has been that of mildneſs and the ſofteſt moderation. Our congreſs, in the manner of the Jewiſh legiſlature, have reaſoned and expoſtulated with them. Seemeth it to you a ſmall thing, gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen, that we have been willing to acknowledge the king of Great-Britain, the arbiter of peace and war, and with the ſame authority over us, in other caſes, as is conſiſtent with the conſtitution of a free ſociety.—That we have ſo long ſubmitted peaceably to ſuch reſtrictions, in the article of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, as throws the balance of our trade ſo greatly in your favour.—That we have propoſed to contribute handſomely towards the ſupport of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, provided you repeal the inequitable acts of parliament, and give us peace and liberty? Seemeth this to you a ſmall thing, but ſeek ye our freedom alſo? This was our language to the king of Britain, in our petitions and remonſtronces pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him: When theſe had been rejected with diſdain, we earneſtly deſired to talk the matter over with him, by ſome commiſſioners appointed for that purpoſe. The anſwer was, we will not come over.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:015748_0037_0F9A2703EB895ED8"/>In the cloudy liſt of Core's unhappy followers, I muſt place another claſs of men—The tories. I am not untaught to know, that every tyrant is a tory, and every tory is a tyrant; but I uſe the word as in converſation it is uſed, to ſignify thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ourſelves, who are our enemies. Perhaps it might be well to leave the word entirely to theſe, and for the future when we mean to ſpeak both of the Britiſh and American paſſive-obedient and non-reſiſtant loyaliſts, to denominate them Corites.</p>
            <p>The language of the tory, with relation to the meaſures of their countrymen, and more eſpecially the eſtabliſhment of an independent empire, hath a great reſemblance to the language of Core's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious company. Moſes had ſaid, "Seemeth it to you a ſmall thing that the God of heaven hath ſet you up ſo high already, in the honourable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the tabernacle, and ſeek ye the prieſt-hood alſo? Theſe were honeſt words and intended to recover in their minds, ſome ſenſe of gratitude to God, for the honour he had already put upon them; but obſerve with what ungenerous affectation of ſevere wit and irony, do they, villainouſly make reply. Yes Moſes; there is a piece of conduct ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall, we readily allow; but apprehend, that if you take a little time to think upon it, you will find it with yourſelf; not with us. "It is a ſmall thing, that thou haſt brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, except thou make thyſelf altogether a prince over us. Moreover thou haſt not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, and given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Wilt thou put out the eyes of theſe men? The ſtrain of this language, is the very ſtrain and dialect of toryiſm. Is it not enough ye patriotic whigs, that you have ſo gloriouſly deprived us of eaſe, quiet,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015748_0038_0F9A2704A95EE970"/>
and abundant plenty, which had poured in upon us, in connection with the mother country; but muſt we be obliged to ſubmit alſo to your tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic government? Moreover, this independency ſo late ſet up, hath not ſuch milk and honey flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it, as you had made us to conceive. Is it not enough that you have cauſed us, in our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſubſiſtence, to be unhappy at the preſent time; but will ye altogether take our life away?</p>
            <p>Moſes, who was a very meek man, and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling our general Waſhington, as I conceive it, was very wroth at the words of Core. May not I who am far behind them both, in patience, take the liberty to wax a little wroth, at the language of ſuch unmanly and provoking tory. What you villain—do you call that ſtate which we have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a ſtate of happineſs? Do you call ſubjection milk, and vaſſalage honey? Do you prefer garlic and cucumbers to manna? Do you ignobly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiritedly chuſe the ſlavery, and domeſtic ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Britain, before the ſweets of liberty, even at the preſent time, without ſalt? Doth it not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to your mind, that we are yet but in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and if our quails are not ſo highly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, yet we may ſolace ourſelves, that we are free, and that by and by, it ſhall be better with us? Do you not perceive that we are bending brightly to Canaan? Do you not pay attention to the ſpies who have ſeen the land, and have brought a good account of it? Every one that hath a ſoul in him, hath ſeen the happineſs of a ſtate of independence, and hath brought a good account of it. Are you the only one that cannot look beyond the preſent caſe, to a more bliſsful period? Are you the only one that cannot at any time, amidſt our preſent ſuffering, with brilliant fancy, and imagination, anticipate
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015748_0039_0F9A2705F57618A0"/>
thoſe ages of renown and plenty when fleets ſhall viſit us from every coaſt of Europe? Are you the only one ſingularly blind, that cannot contemplate, and hail yourſelf in congratulation, to thoſe days of ſweet ſerenity, and far-extended commerce, when navies from America ſhall croſs the wide Atlantic and pacific oceans, and bring the ſilks of every country, and the fruits of every iſland, at firſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, to our own ſhores?</p>
            <p>Theſe days are not far off, though many a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould not live to ſee it. The murmuring of the Iſraelites, was death to many of them; and it were matter of aſtoniſhment, if ſpeedy execution did not overtake the conſtantly-complaining tory of America, and cut him off from thoſe the nobler Calebs of our day, who ſteadily purſue the land in view, and ſo ſhall be admitted to it. I ſhall not give any farther vent to my reſentment, or take up longer time, in expoſtulation, with the tory; but go on to ſay what ground we have to hope, that as the tory and the tyrant—under one name the Corite, hath obſtinately perſiſted in his gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo he ſhall likewiſe periſh in it. The fate of the tyrant, and the tory, is the ſame. Like the ſnakes in the fabled head of Tiſiphone, they are ſo entwiſted, and entwined together, that one ſtroke ſhall be deſtruction to them both. If Britain fails in her attempt upon us, the hope and vain ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tory, is likewiſe blaſted with her. That Britain ſhall be diſappointed in her aim to ſubjugate the continent, I argue from the following principles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The injuſtice of her cauſe. I admit it as a truth declared in the word of God, and juſtified by experience; that the wicked does not always, in this life, meet with the retribution due to his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. There is another ſtate, in which, as indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015748_0040_0F9A27062ECE7BA0"/>
we ſhall again exiſt, and be accountable. But this is not the caſe, with regard to bodies po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic, of whom it ſhall no more be heard, as the French, the Spaniſh, or the Engliſh nation. It muſt be therefore in this life, that every people ſhall be judged, and ſuffer accordingly, the demerit of that wickedneſs, which as a nation they have perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. Beſides; an individual in ſociety, may have redreſs by common laws of government; but in a conteſt between nations, the appeal is made to God; and his it then becomes, to ſettle the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of juſtice. In the preſent conteſt with Great-Britain, the appeal hath been made religiouſly to God. It hath been made to him, with tears, with faſting, and with ſupplication. We have therefore ground to hope that he will ſignally appear for our deliverance. To this I add,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The uſual courſe of providence in caſes of this nature. If we revolve the hiſtory of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, we ſhall ſcarcely meet with any inſtance of a young and riſing empire given up to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by an old and decayed nation. The reverſe is uſually the caſe, in the riſe, and fall of every ſtate. A young and growing people, with great ſimplicity of life, and manners, are attacked by ſome haughty and ambitious neighbour. They ſuffer much, at firſt, from the invaſion; but at length repel the inroad, and make repriſals on the enemy. The Aſſyrian empire roſe by ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and flouriſhed in the world, till making war upon the Perſian, it was cut to pieces by it. The Perſian empire had likewiſe its progreſſion, and advance to eminence; but fell at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Macedonian, and the ſtates of Greece, whom in their infancy, it had invaded. The Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian empire fell before the Roman. The Roman had its round of greatneſs; and in its turn, gave
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015748_0041_0F9A2706E964D510"/>
way to a number of the ſmaller, and ſurrounding nations, to whom, it had been many years a terror.</p>
            <p>I might ſhew a ſimilar courſe, and revolution, in the empire of the Saracens, which hath been overthrown by that of Turcoman. I might ſhew it to be the circle, in the ſmaller ſtates of Europe, ſince the age of Charlemagne. The fate of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy is a ſtriking and particular inſtance. This dukedom, which was once ſo opulent, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, hath become, by an unjuſt attack upon the Switzers, ſo ruined and entirely bankrupt, that we hear no longer of it, but as a province of the French monarchy. Such hath been the courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in bringing forth, and putting down the empires of the world. Who then can reaſonably ſuppoſe it probable, that North-America, a young and riſing people, is ſo near her exit as to wealth and happineſs, while Britain that hath already lived a life of empire, ſhould ſtill ſurvive and be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal? That it cannot be, I argue,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great unnatural impropriety, that ſtates already paſt the age of infancy, and vaſtly larger in extent of territory, ſhould ſtill depend upon a realm, which once they called their own, and be directed by her. If we caſt our eye upon the works of God around us, we ſhall obſerve a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fitneſs and proportion illuſtrative of that which equally hath a place in all the ways of providence, in the direction of the affairs of men. What ſatellite is larger than its planet? What branch of any tree is larger than the tree? Or is there any bird that doth not leave her youg when they are taught to fly as ſwiftly as herſelf? It is not natural that ſtates, with ſuch extent of territory, and which in a few years, at the uſual rate of population, muſt be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to Great-Britain in the number of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, ſhould ſtill continue ſubject to an iſland,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:015748_0042_0F9A2707AA154120"/>
which in the map of the world is but a ſpot, ſcarcely to be diſtinguiſhed in the Geography. It is not natural, that ſtates, in full maturity of growth compared with infancy, ſhould ſtill continue in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to an empire, whom, ſome two hundred years ago, they called their parent. That it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, I mention,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The great improbability, in the uſual courſe of things, that Britain ſhould be able to reduce us. It would be a miracle in the common reaſon, and nature of events, if a country, at ſuch a diſtance, and of no greater compaſs than Great Britain, could ſend a body of troops, able to cope with and ſubdue the ſtanding army, and militia of this continent. It is true, we read in hiſtory, of very powerful kingdoms ſubdued by a band of robbers, that came upon them like an inundation; but we muſt take notice of a circumſtance in our caſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaty different. Theſe men were not only more warlike than the people whom they had invaded; but they had migrated from their own country, with the whole ſtrength and numbers of their nation. This was the conduct of the Normans who ſubdued England. Now unleſs the tyrant of Great-Britain, ſhould in like manner evacuate his own territory, and find ſhips to carry him, three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles, with his eight or ten millions, acroſs the ocean, he could not hope to effectuate his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Nay he muſt find veſſels to tranſport them all at the ſame time; otherwiſe the firſt freight would be waſted and deſtroyed, before he could bring the reſt to reinforce them.</p>
            <p>Beſides in the caſe of antient, or of more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern conquerors of kingdoms, it is to be obſerved; that the nation, overpowered by them, had been divided and at variance amongſt themſelves; ſo that they could not bring their whole ſtrength to act againſt the tyrant who invaded them. The ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015748_0043_0F9A2708697BFEC0"/>
on the other hand, by taking part with one or the other of the parties, and making uſe of their aſſiſtance, at length obtained an eaſy conqueſt over both. This was the caſe in the Eaſt-India ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where the natives effeminate, unwarlike, undiſciplined, and what is more, at variance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, became an eaſy prey to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Engliſhman. Not ſo the ſtates of North-America, which are harmoniouſly confederated, and ſhall ſtand or fall together. To this may be added,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The growing ſtrength and power of full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from America. The heroes that we looſe in battle, are every day replaced, in thrice the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by young and riſing ſoldiers, that come ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively to manhood. Our numbers, after all our battles, are now undoubtedly ſuperior to what we reckoned at the beginning of the conteſt. We have at a moderate computation, thirty thouſand in their ſeventeenth year, at this particular time, upon the continent, that ſhall the next campaign be fit for action. The ſlaughter muſt be great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if the whole, or even half of them, the next campaign ſhall fall in battle. Yet if one half ſhould fall, a new recruit, the following year, of more than thirty thouſand, ſhall add themſelves, to thoſe remaining; and thus, our numbers, which encreaſe continually, ſhall make our oppoſition cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and at laſt victorious.</p>
            <p>The ſtrength of our reſiſtance is encreaſed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the love of military duty, and improved ſkill in meaſures of defence againſt the foe, or in attack upon them. The preſent war was not by any means a thing of choice. We engaged in it with reluctance. We were dragged to it. Nothing but the ſtrong law of ſelf-preſervation, could have perſuaded men to leave the quiet ſcenes of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the noiſe and danger of the camp. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the dire neceſſity of a reſiſtance, could
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:015748_0044_0F9A27092ACF8C88"/>
have made them willing to exchange the plow, and pruning hook, for the muſket and the ſword. We were without the love, and without the ſkill of war.</p>
            <p>In the love of war we are ſufficiently advanced. It is happy, ſince we muſt fight the tyrant, that we love to fight him. Our ſoldiers are enamoured of marches, and what by others may be called fatigue. They pant ardently for conſtant and ſevere encounter with the enemy. The complaint with us, by and by, ſhall be, what it was with the King of Pruſſia, in the laſt war in Europe. It was not that he wanted ſoldiers, but that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed farmers; for all ranks and claſſes, of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſo ſmitten with a love of military life, and enterprize, that there were not ſufficient left at home to cultivate the ground.</p>
            <p>In the ſkill of war we have greatly and rapidly improved. I do not think I ſhall be chargeable with giving cauſe of juſt offence to any public military character, by ſaying, that we have now ſubalterns in our army, more capable of office and command, than many of our generals at the commencement of this debate. What inſtances of genius, and what ſpecimens of military ſcience, may we not expect in future actions? I am perſuaded, that if the war continues but a few years longer, America ſhall be the ſchool of valour and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and voluntiers of higheſt rank and fortune, ſhall flock from every court and ſtate of Europe, as many have already done, to ſerve amongſt us. Theſe arguments are nervous; and I brace them with another quite as good, which is,</p>
            <p n="6">6. The growing hatred and reſentment, every day conceived againſt the tyrant. The name of Engliſhmen will ſhortly be as much abhorred by us, as was that of the Genoeſe among the Corſicans, when, according to the account of Boſwell, mothers ſtilled with this, the children on the breaſt, and
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015748_0045_0F9A2709EB67A608"/>
ſaid proverbially, there comes a Genoeſe. I will give you to the Genoeſe. This circumſtance, is as a wall of iron, to their inroad. Men will do much before they yield obedience to thoſe whom they hate extremely. More violent preſſure, ſhould the tyrant be in a capacity to bring it on us, will give riſe to more violent exertion: And ſhould it come to a deciſive point, upon the very border of defeat and ſubjugation; the ſpirit of reſentment kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in us, would naturally produce ſuch efforts of deſpair, as could not be reſiſted by him. I cloſe theſe arguments with one, which may be taken a poſteriore, as the Schools would ſay, that is,</p>
            <p n="7">7. From a ſurvey of the face of meaſures which have had place, on either ſide, in this illuſtrious conteſt. A good Phyſician, well acquainted with the ſyſtem of the human body, can tell the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of diſorder, or the ſtate of health, by feeling gently on the pulſe of any patient; but every one can judge with ſome degree of certainty, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the countenance, and there examining the bloom, or paleneſs of complexion, as ſigns of health, or ſickneſs. Juſt ſo it is exceeding obvious, and to be read as written very legibly in the conduct of the tyrant, that he ſhall be unſucceſsful; and, at the ſame time, in characters as plain, in that of the Americans, that they are to be victorious. The tyrant has made uſe of every wicked art to bring about his purpoſe. Conſcious of his weakneſs, of himſelf, to cope with us, he has invited ſlaves, and ſavages, to his aſſiſtance. In the perſon of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral who firſt ſuſtained our oppoſition, he is chargeable with diſingenuity, and breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, relative to the blockade of Boſton. In the perſon of him, at the head of the campaign, againſt us; he has been guilty of a mean reſerve, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the cartel, for the exchange of priſoners. He has treated with inhunanity, the priſoners fallen
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015748_0046_0F9A270AAB6D3000"/>
into his hands, He has mangled the wounded, and refuſed quarter on the field of battle. He has acted baſely, in ſo many caſes, that men hereafter reading the tranſactions of this period, ſhall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally exclaim, before they hear the conſequence— this man does not deſerve to be ſucceſsful. On the other hand, the conduct of the Americans, has been ſo fair, ſo gentlemanly, that it is to me a preſage of the happineſs intended for them; and men in future ages reading their behaviour in this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conteſt, when they ſhall hear the truth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the candour in negotiation, the fortitude in ſuffering, and diſaſtrous caſes; the valour, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic ardour in the day of battle; and to caſt a glory on the reſt, the treatment of the wounded, and the priſoners, they muſt declare, before they come to the reſult, and cloſe of it; theſe men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be victorious. And why deſerve to be victorious; but that God hath given them honeſty, and in the truth, and wiſdom of their meaſures, hath laid the foundation of that policy, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which he is about to eſtabliſh on this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. You will obſerve in nature, and in every uſeful work of art, a certain correſpondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parts, ſo that the cauſe ſhall have a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the effect, and from the ground work of a building, you may gueſs the ſuperſtructue. Thus from the earlier parts of any enterprize, may be obtained, ſome diſtant apprehenſion of that event which is to be the conſequence. The confederacy of theſe united ſtates has been ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular—The wiſdom of their meaſures ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as gives a proper bottom to a mighty empire. But on the contrary, the tyrant has been deceived in every information. He has acted moſt impolitic in many caſes. His wiſdom has been turned to fooliſhneſs. His councils have been ſo broken, ſo jarring, and disjointed, that it ſeems to be of God,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:015748_0047_0F9A270B69FA5A68"/>
to baffle his unrighteous undertaking. To this purpoſe is the ſentence—<hi>whom God means to ruin, he firſt ſtrikes with madneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come to cloſe the ſubject, by obſerving; that as Great-Britain ſhall be diſappointed in her meaſures; thoſe unhappy things in human ſhape, denominated tories, are of all men moſt miſerable. They cannot hope to taſte that happineſs, which they have ſo ſanguinely expected. They muſt give up the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the city, and the pleaſant ſeats upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bank, which fancy had ſo generouſly laid out for them. They muſt forego their native country, which they have deſerted and ſo baſely labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſtroy. That the King of England ſhall ſend for them, and reward their villainy, with royal bounty and munificence is not ſo very clear; but it is moſt certain that they ſhall be ſent to make a tryal, and wait upon him for it. There ſhall they wander and walk about with other hungry depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and ſhadows conſequent on theſe, until he ſhall graciouſly be pleaſed to take notice of them. They ſhall wait long and at laſt be diſappointed; for I venture to affirm, that the king of England apprehends that they have already, had a ſufficient recompence, in the very honour of having ſerved him. It is the nature of a wicked man, who is, or thinks himſelf ſuperior, to believe that men his fellow creatures, have been born for his amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This, I am perſuaded, is the ſentiment of every tyrant, and particularly of the Majeſty of Britain, with reſpect to thoſe unhappy beings, who ſubſerve him in his dirty work, now carrying on in America. The uſe of power is intoxicating; and the very ſervitude that is offered to a baſe prince, will cauſe him to expect the continuance of ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At firſt he will look upon attachment as a favour. At length he will expect it as a duty—a duty not to be recompenced in any other way, than
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:015748_0048_0F9A270C2A3FF2D0"/>
in the pleaſure, and mighty honour which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them to have had, in performing it. For this reaſon, theſe men who labour, by a mighty kind of faith, for the unſeen realities of George's favour, are not about to find any certain ſubſtance, to anſwer the deluded expectation. Verily I ſay unto you tories, you ſhall loſe your reward. You may go home to England, and have a gracious ſight of his Majeſty's royal countenance, but this will ſcarcely ſlake your appetite, or, unleſs you have clothes upon your back, keep your bodies warm. You may go to England, and walk about as pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims on the earth, but you ſhall be buffeted by ſatan, and contemned by every claſs of men. You may go home to England, and walk about as pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims on the earth, while you live; but when you die, I am for having it written on your tombs,</p>

            <p>THESE words have not a reference to the war imagined to be in heaven, when the devil firſt ſinned and fell from the light above—ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, I ſay, becauſe we cannot tell whether God permitted him to levy war, for a while, in a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious conteſt, with the holy angels; or whether he hurled him at once, by his own almighty power, to the lake of hell. Nor have theſe words a reference to any war waged ſince in the higher world; for heaven is a place of love; and as no contention, or hoſtile debate, can ariſe amongſt the inhabitants now confirmed and ſecure in bliſs; ſo no kind of violence can have entrance to it, from any other quarter. The meaning therefore is not that angel combated with angel, on the plain of heaven; but that heaven was engaged in a war.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:015748_0050_0F9A270E4FBDDC88"/>The devil is conſtantly exciting ſome tyrannic monſter, to make war upon the world, and take away the rights and priviledges of ſociety. God is ever ready to reſiſt him; and this, in the common meaſures of his providence; or by the agency of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and celeſtial ſpirits, that execute his orders.</p>
            <p>From this it follows, that at any time, when a war is commenced againſt the cauſe of truth upon the earth, there is likewiſe a war in heaven, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is engaged in a war. In this ſenſe it is ſaid, in the words conſequent on thoſe I have choſen, "Michael and his angels fought againſt the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; and the dragon fought, and his angels."</p>
            <p>I ſhall not undertake to ſay, who was the tyrant, whom Saint John principally intended. It may have been a certain of the Roman Caeſars; Nero, or Caligula, or Domitian. Theſe were ſtirred up by the devil, to begin a war upon the earth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rights and privileges of the church of God. Theſe came all to an untimely end, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by their fate, that providence beheld their villainy, and fought againſt them.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible Saint John may have had his eye, upon a later period. The preſent time and the George of England may be that which is pointed out in this place of ſcripture. Be this as it will, the conſtruction is applicable to the tyrant; for wicked men every where are the ſoldiery of ſatan. They ſupport the cauſe, and range themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſtandard of the devil; but the troops of God are embodied, and war in heaven, is levied to oppoſe them. I ſhall ſo apply it at the preſent time, and ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That in our conteſt with the tyrant, hell hath been againſt us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That heaven hath taken an active part, and waged war for us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In our conteſt with the tyrant hell hath been againſt us. It is evident,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:015748_0051_0F9A270E696C9188"/>1. From the nature of the cauſe, the ſucceſs of which muſt be agreeable to ſatan. What would the arch fiend wiſh more, than to behold deſpotiſm in America? What would he wiſh more than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold one man with ſuch rule, and authority, that with a word, he could take away the life of the braveſt ſubject—That without a jury of his peers, he could ſentence him to death, and ſhed his blood upon the ſcaffold—That without reſtraint of law, he could take away the property of any, and ſpend it on his favourites, and debauchees, ſent out from home, to rule, with arbitrary ſway, upon the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. What would he wiſh more than to behold, in conſequence of this, the labour of the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man checked, in the annual tillage of the ground— the country waſte—every plain deſolate? For who could have heart to cultivate the ground, or build a manſion houſe to hold it, only at the precarious pleaſure of ſome Baſhaw, or vice-roy of the tyrant? How laughable would it be to the grim prince of darkneſs, to behold ſcience, which hath bloomed ſo ſweetly in theſe infant ſtates, to languiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay! This I aver to be the conſequent on tyranny.</p>
            <p>Tyranny is deſtructive to religion alſo. The ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign in his abſolute, and unreſiſted empire, may forbid this or that denomination, to worſhip God, according to the dictates of their conſciences. Good and upright men may ſtruggle hard againſt it—may ſeal the truth with blood; but the greater part ſhall ſhroud themſelves, in the religion of the ſtate, becauſe of the offices, and honours which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. The conſequence is ſpiritual death, and the face of miſery every where. Ignorance, and ſuperſtition follow deſpotiſm. Satan is old enough, and ſufficiently ſagacious, to attend to this. He ſees it every day, in India, in Turky, and in ſome parts of Europe; and as he traverſes the globe, he wiſhes to behold it in America. Can we then doubt
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015748_0052_0F9A270F294AC918"/>
but that in our conteſt with the tyrant he is, heart and hand, againſt us? It is evident from the nature of the cauſe, and</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the manner in which the tyrant hath endeavoured to eſtabliſh it. He hath made uſe of fraud in negotiation with us. He hath brought a mercenary army, from the heart of Europe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us. He hath excited Indian ſavages, to murder us in cold blood. He hath made war, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſeleſs rage; refuſing quarter, on the field of battle. He hath famiſhed our priſoners, in his goals; or ſentenced them to other climes, at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the light of God's revealed truth. He hath burned towns. He hath waſted ſettlements. He hath inſiduouſly offered terms of peace, with a view to effect by artifice, what he could not do, by open force, and fair hoſtility. When we conſider theſe things, can we doubt; but that as the cauſe hath been fabricated in the ſhop of ſatan; ſo it hath been carried on, in a manner agreeable to his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions? Can we doubt, but that ſatan hath been buſy with our enemies? He hath, undoubtedly, been buſy. He hath been preſent at the council board. He hath been an aid upon the field of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. He hath brought many evil ſpirits to aſſiſt him. The troops of hell hath been againſt us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Heaven hath taken an active part, and waged war for us. It is conſpicuous,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From our union which was ſo early, and ſo univerſal. God only, who has the hearts of all men in his hand, could have brought about ſuch conſent and full agreement in the cauſe, amongſt a people of different origin, and occupations, and cuſtoms, and manners, and religion. The deſcendants of the Scot, the Iriſh, the Engliſh and the German, have all embarked on the ſame bottom. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, the huſbandman, the merchant, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic, have underſtood and equally reſented the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:015748_0053_0F9A270FE95D4778"/>
meaſures of Great-Britain. The preſbyterian, the independant, the anabaptiſt, and the churchman, have made the cauſe common. The inhabitant of cold New-Hampſhire, and of burning Georgia, felt alike the patriotic ſpirit. The polite Virginian, and ſeverer moraliſt of Pennſylvania, were equally the ſubjects of this noble paſſion. The obedience paid to the reſolves of congreſs by every one of theſe, was ſo regular, and ſo ſteady, as to excite the wonder of our enemies. What prince, or any legiſlator in the world, has ever found an equal pliancy, in the minds of ſubjects, to his laws, as was diſcovered in the attention of this people, to the committees, and conventions of their reſpective colonies? The hand of God is viſible in this ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular a circumſtance. It is equally apparent,</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the wiſdom of our councils. A more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable body of men never ſat upon the earth than the firſt congreſs. Their writings were truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſo great a cauſe. If any man feels himſelf to flag in his patriotic principles, let him take up the letters, and remonſtrances ſent to Britain—let him read the addreſs to Canada—to Ireland—to the Americans, and the declaration, and appeal to foreign powers; and I defy him, if he has the leaſt ſpark of virtue in his breaſt, not to feel a noble, a reſiſtleſs, and almoſt enthuſiaſtic ardour for his country. The ſpirit of God, which taught the workmen at the building of the temple, and gave them uncommon ſkill, was preſent with theſe men. The ſpirit of God, which brightly kindles, the clear ſpark of genius in the ſoul, and gives a fine degree of underſtanding, doubtleſs, aided them in theſe productions. The bleſſed God directed them to prudent words, and to wiſe and uſeful mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Heaven hath taken an active part in our behalf; and this illuſtriouſly appears,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:015748_0054_0F9A2710AB7073F0"/>3. From the great, and almoſt unhoped for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with which our cauſe has been attended. We took up arms with trembling apprehenſions of the mighty difficulties we were obliged to encounter. We ſaw behind us ſlavery, and before us, the moſt trying ſcenes of fortitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuffering. As every virtuous and generous mind would do, we fled from ſlavery, though we know not, but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences was death. We had not arms—we had not amunition—we had not many officers of good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience—we had not ſoldiers trained and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined for battle—we had not any thing, but the juſtice of our cauſe, and the goodneſs of almighty providence, to ſupport our ſinking ſpirits. Glory to God, who hath befriended us—hath given us arms, and ammunition, and many officers of good experience, and ſoldiers trained and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined, for battle—hath made our arms ſucceſsful— illuſtriouſly ſucceſsful in many places.</p>
            <p>Heaven hath made our cauſe her own, and this appears.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From the manner of our ſucceſs in general, and deliverance in ſome particular caſes. At the commencement of the war, our greateſt fears ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated, from the navy of Great-Britain. We did not entertain the leaſt idea of ſaving the ſmalleſt boat or veſſel, from her depredation. We appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended her ſo fully the miſtreſs of the ocean, that not one bay or creek, or inlet could be found, which was not under her inſpection; yet we ſee, our merchantmen have brought, from every port of Europe, a great ſupply of what we wanted. Our privateers have ſcoured the ocean, and in the very channel, on the coaſt of England, have captured ſuch prizes as more than makes amends for all the loſs we have ſuſtained. Our ſhips of force, of which we had not one at the beginning, have brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fought the tyrant; and often proved victorious.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:015748_0055_0F9A27116B674078"/>
This is a noble and exhauſtleſs fund of evidence that God himſelf hath been our Admiral.</p>
            <p>In our operations on the continent, we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected little from the militia ſoldiery; yet theſe have had a ſhare not inconſiderable in ſome the moſt important actions. The militia fought at Lexington, they fought at Bunker-hill engagement. Theſe little victories were kindly granted them, by providence, as neceſſary at the firſt, to lift their hope, and ſatisfy the mind of every one, that Americans were not irreſolute, and Britons, however veteran in experience, were not invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable. The militia fought in Carolina, and quelled the Tory inſurrection. They fought in the Virginia ſtate. They fought in Jerſey. They fought with Harkemer. They fought with Stark. They fought with the illuſtrious Gates. They acted nobly in every battle, and encounter, from the weſtward of the Hudſon, to the heights of Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toga.</p>
            <p>Nor leſs remarkable was our deliverance, in ſome particular caſes. A gracious providence hath not permitted us to be ſucceſsful in any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place, more than was conſiſtent with the ſafety, and general intereſt of our whole exertions. We made the greateſt ſlaughter, but loſt the ground at Bunker-Hill engagement, and this becauſe it did not ſuit us to retain it. Had we poſſeſſed the heights, the Britiſh muſt have left the city of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and ſailed for New-York or Philadelphia, where we had not been ſo well prepared to receive them; but flatterd vainly with the ſmall advantage of the ground, they ſtill continued to attempt this province. The ſummer and ſucceeding winter was, in conſequence of this, exhauſted fruitleſsly; and before they could approach us to the weſtward, we alſo were in readineſs to bid them welcome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:015748_0056_0F9A27122A9BD258"/>Our cauſe was at the loweſt ebb, when Howe had travelled through the Jerſies, and appeared upon the Delaware; yet even then, we roſe upon the wings of conqueſt; and from an almoſt hopeleſs ſituation, became the talk and panegiric of the world. Our foe themſelves could not but own the merit of our general, thoſe of them eſpecially, who had the ſoul to underſtand what praiſe was due to patience, fortitude, and ſkill and valour in the breaſt of heroes.</p>
            <p>Our caſe was gloomy, when Burgoine had paſſed Ticonderoga, and penetrated deeply through the northern provinces. In this diſtreſſed quarter we had expected nothing but defeat and devaſtation. Our eye of hope was fixed chiefly on the ſucceſs of the campaign in Pennſylvania. But on the contrary our principal ſucceſs has been obtained againſt the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern forces of the tyrant. In this department we have been remarkably victorious; and it would ſeem that God permitted the rude foe to come thus far, in order that at length his gracious providence might have an ampler field of triumph, in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ignominy and defeat amongſt us.</p>
            <p>With this I mention what at firſt may ſeem unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; that is the inroad of the foe through Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania and the Jerſies. But is it not compleatly evident, that thus it was the will of God to make us taſte ſo much of gall and wormwood, in the cup of tyranny preſented to us, that afterwards we ſhould not eaſily forget it; or even half-way tories, be tempted to deſire a ſecond draught of ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant poiſon?</p>
            <p>Thus in the manner of our ſucceſs in general, and deliverance in ſome particular caſes, the hand of God is viſible. We have ſucceeded where we had not hope to ſucceed. We have been delivered when we looked not for deliverance. Our aid hath come from whence we had not much expected it. We have
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:015748_0057_0F9A2712EB604368"/>
been favoured in a manner, and on occaſions truly ſingular. Are we not then ſenſible that heaven is active for us? I argue laſtly,</p>
            <p>The company of good and pious men, who have moſt eminently ſtruggled with us. Take a view of thoſe amongſt ourſelves, who are againſt us, and count the debauchees, and rakes, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and deſigning, and ſelf-intereſted men, and you will find them to compoſe a greater part of that collection. On the other hand, ſet down the honeſt, the ſenſible, and ſerious of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and extend your computation, to the good and virtuous of the country round you; and how few, if any of theſe, will you will find againſt our meaſures? nay are not the moſt religious, and moſt pious perſons, the warmeſt advocates for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and reſiſtance? How many ſweet and holy prayers, are every day put up, by good and worthy men of all denominations? Our company in this debate is heavenly; and heaven I am perſuaded, doth patronize, and will finally ſucceed it.</p>
            <p>Heaven knows nothing of neutrality. The ſound of ſuch indifferance, was never heard in heaven. Every angel, every ſeraph feels in our behalf. They know not the ſecret will of God, and ſo are anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the great event. Doubtleſs it is pleaſing to any one of theſe, when he is ordered to take his flight to earth, and there direct the courſe of ſuch a victory, in favour of the brave American. For providence is but the agency of God, either by his own interpoſition, or by the miniſtry of powers, and principalities, that ſtand before him. Angels are his miniſtring ſpirits, and they delight to execute his orders amongſt men, or through the bounds of the unſeen creation. Much ſweet aſſiſtance have we had from theſe ſince the beginning of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. There is not one tory, to be found amongſt the order of the ſeraphim. There is not one cold
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:015748_0058_0F9A2713A96BF548"/>
phlegmatic ſpirit, that can bear to be a neutral. Heaven is active for us, and her inhabitants, through all their ſhining ranks and orders.</p>
            <p>Let me now improve the ſubject,</p>
            <p n="1">1. You ſee from hence, that we are to give God the glory. The arm of fleſh is weak, and in itſelf contemptible. It is God that ſteels the heart, and gives a reſolution to engage in trials. It is God that crowns our efforts with ſucceſs. Let the cauſe in which we are engaged praiſe God. Let the councils by which it hath been pleaded praiſe God. Let the patriots he hath raiſed to ſupport it, praiſe God. Let the ſucceſs which hath attended it, praiſe God. Let the day of Lexington and the dawn of our renown, praiſe him. Let the death of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and the Bunker-Hill engagement, praiſe him. Let our approach through Canada, and the death of a Montgomery, praiſe him. It was God who raiſed theſe gallant men, and filled their boſoms with the ſacred glow of freedom. It was God who bade them die, and give them immortal to their country.</p>
            <p>Think, my brethren on Fort Sullivan, and lift your ſouls to God. Think on the Carolina—and the Virginia victories. Think on the thouſand that we ſtormed at Trenton. Think on victorious Princetown, and be aſhamed of your ingratitude. Think on the Brunſwick Ambuſcades. Think on the ſouls who fought at Brandywine. Think on the well-conducted charge at Germantown. Think on Fort Mercer, and the ſhore of Delaware. Think on Fort-Miflin ſo gallantly defended. Think, O think, on theſe my countrymen, and let your hearts be warmed with a holy fervour.</p>
            <p>Think on the noble death of Harkemer. Think on victorious Stark, and the ſucceſs at Bennington. Think on illuſtrious Warner, who ſhared with him in the glory. Think on the garriſon at Fort Montgomery—a fort retained and quitted with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:015748_0059_0F9A2714D1279618"/>
honour. Think on the field—the field of Stillwater. Think on the heights—the fair capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated heights of Saratoga. Think on Burgoyne. Think on his proclamation—what ſound, what tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph—what defeat, what ignominy. 'Tis God that raiſes up the humble, but lays the lofty low before him. Let every pulſe that beats throughout our veins, let every breath that draws the air this day, be ſacred to his glory. He is God, and there is not another. He is great, and there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him.</p>
            <p>From the ſubject, and the thoughts ſuggeſted on it you have</p>
            <p n="2">2. Foundation of encouragement. Our cauſe is yet upon the balance. Our ſwords are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathed. Our hands are ſtill upon the hilts of them. Much hath been done. Much yet remains to do. Be not diſmayed. Remember your ſupport. Hath France declared war; or is it out of doubt, that Spain hath taken an active part in our behalf? Of this, I am not certain, nor ſtrictly able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you; but this I ſay, that God is for us, and heaven hath taken an active part. The court of heaven hath long determined it, nor was there one diſſenting voice among them. Michael ſays 'tis war, and younger angels ſay, 'tis war—with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>Are the officers of France called home, to take their places in her armies? <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The above diſcourſe was drawn up and delivered on thn</hi> 18<hi>th of December,</hi> 1777, <hi>in Queen-Ann's county, Maryland; at which time there was a report that France had declared war, and that in conſequence of this, her officers who ſerve in America were ordered home to take the command of their reſpective regiments and diviſions.</hi>
               </note> 'Tis ſaid they are; but what is that to us, my countrymen. The offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of France, are noble, gallant and experienced,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:015748_0060_0F9A271529595B90"/>
but ſtill inferior to the bright and the ſhining cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the hoſt of heaven. The officers of France have ſeen the wars in Germany, in Poland, and in Ruſſia. The captains of the hoſt of God have ſeen the war, and combat with the dragon—have ſeen the wars before the flood, and ſince in every age and country. Theſe have come down to help us, and theſe ſhall be continued with us. Had we our eye-ſight, we ſhould ſee, that they that be with us, are more than they that be againſt us. Had we our eye-ſight we ſhould behold chariots of fire, and winged ſteeds encompaſſing our mountains. We are afraid perhaps that Britain will recruit from the European continent, and ſend in thouſands to augment her forces. Let us be confident that God is for us, and the armies of the univerſe, are not ſufficient to reſiſt his providence. The ſubject,</p>
            <p>Laſtly; ſuggeſts to us a motive to repentance. It ſeems to me our cauſe ſhall proſper, and be final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceſsful; yet cloudy days of ſuffering may be in reſerve before us. I do not by any means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a ſudden iſſue to the conteſt. Before it is concluded, many a mother ſhall have loſt her ſon and many a wife her huſband. Let every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual lay this matter for himſelf to heart. If we are delivered from our enemy, yet many wicked perſons, like the unbelieving lord, that that was trodden under foot, at the gate of Samaria, ſhall not live to ſee it. What ſhall it profit any man, if we gain our liberty, and aſſert our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, if in the mean time, he ſhall have loſt the eternal liberty, and freedom of his own ſoul? What will it profit him, if he eſcape the taxation of Great-Britain; but in the mean time, muſt lie down in ſorrow, and pay the debt, due to God's juſtice in the flame of hell. In time of war, or in time of peace, there is no ſafety but in Chriſt. Haſte therefore, and give no reſt to your eyes, nor
<pb n="61"
                   facs="unknown:015748_0061_0F9A2715E9431858"

ſlumber to your eye-lids, till you have found an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his mediation and atonement. As ſome countryman, who travels in the ſtormy night, when the wind ſhakes the foreſt, and the rain beats upon him, would haſten to the ſhelter of a rock, where he may be ſafe from the hurricane, and the forked lightnings, which play above the mountain; ſo it becomes every one in this day of ſtorm and ſore commotion, to fly ſwiftly to the rock Chriſt Jeſus, and ſeek for refuge, in the merit, and peace ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood of a redeemer. Amen.</p>

            <p>I DO not mean to enter into the controverſy, whether it is the Pope, that originally is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by theſe words, or ſome other noble worthy of an equal mouth. I mean to ſay, that they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to a certain general, with whom we have tried our ſwords a while; and that is the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted John Burgoyne Eſquire, lieutenant-general, in North-America, with many other deſignatory titles, which it were tedious to recapitulate or mention. This general hath ſpoken great things, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Great things. It is ſaid that a certain old gentleman, of whom many things are fabled, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally comes upon the earth, eſpecially about even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-time,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:015748_0063_0F9A27176A011CE0"/>
in the ſhape of a common man; but on diſcovery of his cloven foot, takes departure in a flame of fire. The general, hath no reſemblance, in this particular, to ſatan; for he came amongſt us in a flame of fire, but went away like a common man.</p>
            <p>He made his firſt appearance on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, in a ſky-rocket, and fire-work deſcription of the day of Charles-Town, and the Bunker-hill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. Pyramids of flame, and the roar of cannon, muſketry and mortars, ſounded and blazed through the paragraphs. I have ſeen poems on the <hi>laſt</hi> conflagration that were nothing to it. The heart of every Whig was made to tremble, for certainly a man that thought and ſpoke ſo loftily, muſt be capable of doing very lofty actions.</p>
            <p>We do not hear much more of him, except in his letter to general Lee, until at the opening of the laſt campaign, when with about eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, and half a dozen Indian nations, at his heels, he landed from the lakes of Canada.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of an earth-quake is ſaid to be a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of condenſed air, pent up in the bowels of the earth, and ſuddenly rarified by a hill of ſulphur, nitre, or hot materials, of ſome kind or other, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneouſly on fire. In this caſe the column haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily expands, and not finding an immediate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, opens to itſelf a vent, with great noiſe and concuſſion of the continent. This may ſerve to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the paſſion and behaviour of the general, who had for a long time conceived a moſt fierce indignation againſt the inhabitants of North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. His wrath was pent up in his breaſt, and ſtrugg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to expreſs itſelf. He wanted elbow-room. We need not wonder, therefore, that on meeting with ſome ſmall advantage, like a bed of nitrous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, to inflame his ire, he burſt forth, all at once, in the ſound of a proclamation.</p>

               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:015748_0064_0F9A2718293AA448"/>The cuſtom of a proclamation from a warrior, is of very antient date. The champion of Gath was the firſt who brought it into practice. We read that he came forth and proclaimed to the hoſt of Iſrael. <hi>Give me a man that we may fight together.</hi> O, I love fighting mightily. Do, turn out ſome active, briſk fellow, that we may have a knock at one another.</p>
            <p>David, a young militia ſoldier, that had never been in action, takes him at his word, and comes out againſt him. The Philiſtine thought it an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to be matched with a boy, and truſting to his great ſtature, and his long experience in the ſervice, diſdains the ſtripling rebel, and <hi>curſed him by his gods.</hi> As they approached to the combat, the giant opens wide his mighty mouth, in a ſecond proclamation—<hi>come to me, and I will give thy fleſh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beaſts of the field.</hi>

            <p>I am of opinion that Goliah, notwithſtanding his challenge to the hoſt of Iſrael, was, as all bullies are, a coward at the bottom; and that his great vaunt of words, previous to the conteſt, was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to intimidate, and, if poſſible, prevent the young ſoldier from coming on the ground at all. He could not, conſiſtent with the reputation of his proweſs, decline the propoſed duel; but it was his hope that he ſhould be able to prevent it, by high looks, big words, and ſome parade at a diſtance. <hi>True valour, like true wiſdom, talks little.</hi>

            <p>The proclamation of Burgoyne was not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the proclamation of the ſon of Gath. O ye ſaints and rebels of New-England, wherefore are ye come out againſt me with pitch-forks, <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Burgoyne had written a play, called</hi> The blockade of Boſton, <hi>in which the New-Englandmen were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as coming out to battle, with pitch-forks, and ruſty, muſkets on their ſhoulders.</hi>
               </note> and with
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:015748_0065_0F9A2718EA856FE0"/>
pruning hooks? Am I a dog that you think to drive me into Lake Champlain, with ſtaves and with broken bayonets? But if ſo, leave your prayers, and your faſtings, and come along, that I may ſcalp your heads, and toma-hac your carcaſes. <hi>I have but to give ſtretch to the Indian forces under my command and they amount to thouſands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one proclamation is very much a copy of the other; yet I am not certain that the Britiſh general had this monument of jewiſh hiſtory in view, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not certain that Burgoyne reads the ſcripture. There is indeed no neceſſity to ſuppoſe that he had it in his view, in order to account for the reſemblance; for the ſame ſpirit, however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in place or period, will always beget the ſame manner, and produce the ſame language.</p>
            <p>It is more probable our gallant general, took the idea of ſtriking terror by a proclamation, from the behaviour of Achilles, at the ſiege of Troy, as it is told us by Homer, in the eighteenth book of his Iliad. The Trojans, with Hector at their head, contending for the body of Patroclus, preſs upon the Greeks to the very limits of their camp. In this critical conjuncture, Achilles is prevailed on by Minerva, to ſhew himſelf at the head of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, and endeavour to ſtop the fury of the Trojans by a proclamation. Accordingly he mounts the parapet, and bawls out very briſkly, ſo that the hoſtile army are ſhocked by the clamour and driven back from the battle.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Forth march'd the chief, and diſtant from the crowd,</l>
               <l>High on the rampart raiſed his voice aloud,</l>
               <l>So high his brazen voice the hero rear'd,</l>
               <l>Hoſts dropped their arms—</l>
            </q>
            <p>As the Scotch-man ſaid, when he ſaw a rope-dancer on the ſtage, it is a noble thing to be a
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:015748_0066_0F9A2719A92E30C8"/>
ſcholar. Burgoyne loves poetry, and doubtleſs had admired this circumſtance in the conduct of the great ſon of Pelus. He was willing to adopt and put forth in the modern taſte, ſomething in the ſame ſtile and manner.</p>
            <p>A thing of this ſort is very pardonable, for we are all uſually one half of what we are, by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: nay it is commendable, for a ſtudy to equal, or excel fine models, is placed by the antient cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics amongſt the ſources of good writing; and may it not be ſo likewiſe in the ſublime of character and conduct? The great Don-Quixotte made himſelf ſtill more great, by a conſtant and careful peruſal of the hiſtories of green, black &amp; grey-coloured knights, and by a magnanimous and ſteady reſolution to emulate their warlike glory and atchievements.</p>
            <p>Burgoyne is not more a poet than hiſtorian. Is it not then poſſible, that he may have had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the great Pyrrhus in his eye as we have it related by Polibyus? This prince was not leſs daring in an enterprize, than crafty in device and ſtratagem. When he had invaded Italy, and lay with his troops above Tarentum, he thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make tryal of the patriotiſm of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and of their fortitude, before he adventured far into their country. For this purpoſe he invites Fabricius, the conſul, to a conference, in ſome ſuch manner, as Lord Howe, on Staten-Iſland, the other year, invited three members of the continental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. By ſmooth ſpeeches without any meaning, and by the offer of a ſum of money, he endeavours to engage Fabricius, to act inconſiſtently with the true intereſt of the common-wealth. Having failed in the attempt, and finding that Roman patriotiſm was not to be corrupted, he next determines an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment upon their fortitude.</p>
            <p>He provides an old reſty elephant, and had it placed behind a curtain, juſt by Fabricius, with its
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:015748_0067_0F9A271A6952BC40"/>
proboſſcis over him, where he ſat in converſation. All at once a ſtout able-bodied ſerjeant pricks it with the end of his halbert. The beaſt ſuitably alarmed and opening its mouth in a loud proclamation, is exceeding terrible. The animal was ſtrange and unuſual to the Roman; but diſcovering no ſign of fear or perturbation, he ſat ſtill, and continued his diſcourſe with this reflection: <hi>Thy beaſt, O Pyrr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hus, hath moved me to day as little as thy gold did yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday.</hi> The king obſerving ſuch dignity and ſtrength of ſoul in this people, gave over his attempt upon their country, and tranſported his troops back to Epirus.</p>
            <p>Burgoyne to a certain length hath imitated Pyrr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hus. He had not been able to procure an elephant; for though ſome large bones found upon the banks of the Ohio, do indicate that there may have been of this creature in America, yet none are to be found at the preſent time.—He had not been able to procure an elephant, to make the tryal in a true claſſic way; but he does what he can do, and thinks it not amiſs to make a little noiſe himſelf.</p>
            <p>To ſay the truth he roared very hideouſly. His firſt roar was on Ticonderoga hill, <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The proclamation was given at Ticonderoga.</hi>
               </note> ſtamping with his foot, and the ſecond roar was on the margin of Lake-George, about ten miles nearer to us. His roaring waxed loud, and ſhrill, and terrible. As he came down through the woods of Skeenſborough, it was audible to a very great diſtance. It was his intention to roar on to Albany; but a giant of the name of Gates, with a parcel of New-England men, came out againſt him and caught him by the beard, and ſmote him, ſo that his proclamatory voice ſhall not be heard any more, in the woods of North-America.</p>
            <p>I have already ſaid, that Burgoyne, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the great Quixotte, had built up himſelf,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:015748_0068_0F9A271B8FEB8408"/>
on the ſyſtem of the early battle-men. He had not read ſo fully as that celebrated Spaniard, the hiſtory of the renowned Amadis de Gaul, Don Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis of Greece, or the Seven Champions of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom; but he had ſtudied, what was equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, the exploits of Mahoment the ſecond, and of Tamarlane who put Bajazet in an iron cage, and made uſe of him as a block to aſſiſt him when at any time he ſhould chuſe to mount his horſe. He had made himſelf acquainted with the great killing times, at ſeveral periods, on the border of the Greek and Roman empires, ſo that if the hero of Cervantes had it in his power to boaſt a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior knowledge in the laws of chivalry and knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, yet the Britiſh general was conſiderably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the ſkill of Caeſar-hood and Alexander-ſhip. That you may know what I mean, it muſt be told you, that it is the humour of theſe great combatants, to cut and carve furiouſly about them, and to rage and rave like angry lions, or like mad tygers, until they have ſlain half the world of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and then to ſit down, and be as tame as a dog that has juſt chewed a bone, or as a young ox that licks his lips after ſalt.</p>
            <p>The above may ſerve as a key to the famous ſpeech of Burgoyne, before he left England, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to <hi>temper his puniſhment to the Americans with humanity.</hi> It may ſerve to explain that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration alſo, that he would <hi>dance with the ladies, and coax the men to ſubmiſſion;</hi> for you muſt be told, if you know it not already, that it is the humour of your well bred ſlaughter-men, to be highly complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, gentle and humane, to a diſtreſſed lady, the very next hour after they have cut the throat of a fond huſband, or an only ſon, or beloved brother. Of this you have an inſtance in the behaviour of the Macedonian, to the wife and mother of Darius, whom a few hours before, he had unjuſtly ſlain,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:015748_0069_0F9A275D2B461830"/>
and baſely deprived of his kingdom.—It was ſomething of this nature which Burgoyne would have us underſtand by the <hi>honour of a ſoldier,</hi> of which he ſpeaks in his proclamation. For though he had let looſe, or as he himſelf terms it, <hi>given ſtretch</hi> to the Indian forces under his command, to murder the infant, and the young ſoldier, and the mother, and the virgin, on her bridal day; yet this did not hinder, but that when he came to Albany victorious, he might ſhew himſelf a generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, by wiping away the tears of the mourning family, as Alexander wiped away the tears of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira.</p>
            <p>There is another ſpecies of writing not leſs fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the general, and that is the French and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tragedy. Hence it is that he hath drawn many of thoſe noble flights of fancy, conceived in very lofty language, which appear in his ſpeeches and epiſtolary correſpondence. The ſentence which may ſerve as a ſpecimen of many others, ſays to this purpoſe; <hi>I would not be juſtly chargeable with ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, no, not for North-America, had ſhe the wealth of worlds, in her bowels, and a paradiſe upon her ſurface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is thought by ſome young gentlemen to whom I have the honour to be known, that Burgoyne hath in this ſentence caught ſomething of the true ſpirit and ſublime of the antient authors. The taſte of theſe young gentlemen is accurate and good; for I defy you to impoſe upon them a ham of bacon, for a ſea-turtle, or a diſh of turnips, for a bowl of eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nog. The only objection that any man can offer to their judgement, is, that, <hi>his non erat locus</hi>—Theſe words are not in their proper place, and do not ſo well ſuit a letter upon buſineſs, as a ſpeech of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony to Cleopatra, or of Herod the great, to his Mariamne.</p>
            <p>The General in many places, ſhines out in ſuch high-winged and ſilver-tongued words. It is his
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:015748_0070_0F9A275DEBF518F8"/>
happineſs to have ſo rich a vein of tragic fancy, and high flight of dramatic thought, that on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions very common, he can get upon his buſkins, and talk—<hi>rotundo ore</hi>—with a ſwelling mouth.</p>
            <p>When, therefore, we ſum up the evidence, and conſider that the general hath a moſt intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with all Homer's heroes; that he hath at his fingers ends, all the great examples of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient hiſtory; that to this he hath added a full and univerſal reading of the beſt Engliſh plays, and particularly that of the two rival queens, writ by the immortal <hi>Lee</hi>—when to cloſe and compleat the whole, we take it into view that he hath drawn copiouſly of rich ſtile and ſentiment, from this ſource, or rather theſe ſources; need we wonder that when he came upon this weſtern continent, a new world, and a new ſtage opening to his view, he hath ſpoken great things.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Blaſphemies. Here I mean to be ſerious. The word blaſphemy is of Greek original, and is made up of two words, one of which is—to wound, and the other is—the reputation. According to its etymology, it is what is wounding to the reputation. It is the Greek word for calumny, and anſwers to one we have borrowed from the latin—defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. I have not any author by me to eſtabliſh it; yet I make no doubt, but that at firſt it was uſed to ſignify a ſlander againſt the character of men, as well as againſt the providence of God. After a little time, in the manner of many words, it loſt a part of its original application; and by it we now underſtand what is ſaid in derogation of the divine Majeſty of heaven, either in the perſons of the Trinity, his attributes, or providence This is the ſtrict and higher ſenſe; yet, no doubt, a word may be occaſionally and by conſtruction blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous. The man that declares to the world, that he will do this or that, and at the ſame time
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:015748_0071_0F9A275EAA4A9578"/>
pays no attention to the permiſſion of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, makes a near approach to that which is called blaſphemy. It ought to be our language, that if God will, we ſhall do ſo. What, ſo to ſpeak can be more wounding to his reputation in whoſe hands our breath is, and whoſe are all our ways, than not to acknowledge him, when we engage in any matter, or not to give him thanks, when, with his help, we have been enabled to perform it? It is treaſon to the monarchy of heaven. It is blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>Let us apply this to the proclamation of which we have ſaid ſome things laughingly. Omitting the invective and falſhood contained in it; even the ſoul of a tory muſt be ſenſible that with regard to God, it is daringly impious and profane. Except in one ſlight phraſe, he pays not the leaſt attention to the almighty providence, who rules and governs all things: and even this ſlight phraſe is crouded down, and diſappears in the boaſt and ranting of the other periods. Self-dependent, and balanced on his ſtrength, he ſeems to look down with ſcorn, on all the caſualties of circumſtance and time.</p>
            <p>"At the head of troops in the full powers of health, diſcipline and valour, determined to ſtrike where neceſſary, and anxious to ſpare where poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I invite and exhort all perſons, in all places, where the progreſs of this army ſhall point—<hi>And by the bleſſing of God I will extend it far.</hi>" The laſt words of this ſentence make the phraſe to which I have a reference as that ſeeming to hold forth ſomething rational, and pious. Yet if you examine its poſition, and the manner of its flow in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, you will find that it is not ſo much an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the ſuperintendency of God, as an oath that verily in ſpite of all oppoſition, he will do what he had propoſed. It differs little from the common declaration of a ſoldier ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the almighty, that in ſpite of fortune he
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:015748_0072_0F9A275F69C9A5A8"/>
will do it. The beſt that we can ſay of it, is, that when he meant to pray, he naturally fell into the idiom of an oath. Such is the force of habit, on the human mind, and ſo hard is it to ſpeak in a language different from that to which we have been long accuſtomed.</p>
            <p>But if he meant it even ſerious, it has ſomething in its nature blaſphemous; for if it is wounding to the character of God, the great diſpoſer of events, to deny his kind and good providence, ſurely it is ſo likewiſe, to aſk his countenance and aid, in a courſe of action diametrically oppoſite to juſtice and to truth. What?— ſhall it be your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſtrip, rob, and cut the throats of men and mankind, and ſhall you in the mean time aſk the bleſſing of God in the execution of it? It is an inſult upon heaven. It is blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>I remark farther on the proclamation; that it ſeems to adopt the ſtile of the ſacred book, and ſpeaks of thoſe called rebels as the ſcripture ſpeaks of reprobated men after death. The Britiſh army are <hi>the meſſengers of juſtice and of wrath;</hi> and thoſe which ſhall be ſo unhappy as to fall into their hands <hi>are the wilful outcaſts.</hi> This is arrogancy to a high degree, for it is more than falls to the ſhare of man to apply to himſelf or claim.</p>
            <p>Such was the language of the general with regard to what he had in view to do. Not leſs exceſſive was it in the account of what he had already done. Of this, his letter to lord George Germaine, on the reduction of Ticonderoga, may be ſelected as an evidence. It is pompous in idea, and conceived in very lofty terms. Were one to read it over, it would naturally extend his mouth as if he had been uſed to pronounce the high heroic ſcenes of ſome ſwelling tragedy. When you hear him deſcribe the mount, whoſe top, and gradual aſcent was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with artillery: when you conſider the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:015748_0073_0F9A276029A0A1A8"/>
of the booms and ſunken piers through which he made his way: when you liſten to the great addreſs of his officers and men in ſcaling, and climbing over theſe, you would ſuppoſe that each of them was at leaſt a Themiſtocles, and that the general himſelf had done more than Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander did, when he took by ſtorm the city of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, having firſt in ſpite of winds and a thouſand ſtorms, built a mole in the ſea to join the iſland to the continent. A gaſconade of this nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes irreligious, when it is not accompanied with the leaſt idea of gratitude to God for that wherein he had ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>Taking theſe things into view, we may eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the ignominious exit of Burgoyne. It is to be reſolved not ſo much into our ſkill and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as into the providence of God, which he had ſlighted and deſpiſed. He had made himſelf maſter of the only poſt of conſequence, where he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected oppoſition. He had hung on the rear of our broken army, and had taken camp-equipage and priſoners. He had penetrated through a great depth of country, and the road to victory was now ſmooth before him. At this very inſtant he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of his wonted prudence. It behoved him to have marched on, with his whole army ſolidly, and to have given no time to the troops before him, to re-aſſemble, or to rally. His great ſtrength lay in continnuing ſelf-collected and impenetrable to our ſmaller bodies. But how providentially for us, do we find him ſending out his army by detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! Hence it was that in the very triumph of ſucceſs, like an eagle that hath ſtooped for a lamb, and mounted to the clouds, he was wounded with an arrow, and brought down again. Pride and ſelf-confidence was the effect of his ſucceſs, and it became the cauſe of his future loſſes, and his laſt cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:015748_0074_0F9A276192ED0FF0"/>From what we have ſaid upon this ſubject, may there not ariſe ſome pertinent reflections? It is the duty and intereſt of every man, who aſpires to be diſtinguiſhed by a happy ſucceſs, in that to which he puts his hand, that he acknowledge God, and have an eye to his Almighty providence. <hi>God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</hi> Let me ſee a man go forth in any enterprize, confiding in his own ſkill, reſolution, or diligence, and paying no attention to the great diſpoſer of events, and I think I ſhall pretty generally be right, if I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to fore-tell to him that he ſhall not proſper in it. God is repreſented in the ſacred book as jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his glory. He will not fail to aſſert his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty over thoſe who deny it, and by a proud vaunt and boaſting of their own great ſtrength and proweſs, do virtually preclude the neceſſity of the divine interpoſition and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>We are told in the antient hiſtories, of ſome great and fortunate commander, whoſe name I cannot now recollect, that in recounting his ſucceſſes, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded frequently, at the end of each relation, <hi>and in this fortune had no ſhare,</hi> after which it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that he never once more ſucceeded in any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
            <p>The Aſſyrian monarch is an inſtance of the ſame nature. Under God he had done very great things. He had over-run half the world with his arms. He had built Babylon for the domicilium of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The temple of Belus, in magnitude and height, equalled the largeſt of the pyramids of Egypt. His gardens hanging in the air, and groves planted on a level with the clouds, were a ſight new and admirable to the eye of man. His palace for its architecture far ſurpaſſed any thing that had ever been in the world before this period. In this palace it is ſaid he walked, and, it was moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, in ſome lofty ſtory of it whence he could
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:015748_0075_0F9A2761AC8C9250"/>
have a view of the whole city, as it lay beneath him. His vain heart ſwelling with its pride, he breaks forth in a ſtrain of ſelf-applauſe and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, not to be endured by the God of heaven. <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the houſe of my kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majeſty?</hi> And while the word was in his mouth, a voice fell from heaven, and no doubt it came with an awful ſhock to his ſoul, <hi>O king, to thee is it ſpoken; the kingdom is departed from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaying is as good as it is old, and as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as it is ſimple, that <hi>pride goes before a fall.</hi> It is the hiſtory of many men, that they have flouriſhed and continued to aſcend in the world for a time; but by and by have experienced a reverſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and were again daſhed down. It is the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of many people, that they have endured pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pain, and at length ſurmounted theſe; but that now, almoſt eſtabliſhed in plenty and in eaſe, they have become viciouſly ſecure, and are ſtruck from the happineſs which they had in view. The next generation ſaw their names blotted out, and loſt among the things that had once been.</p>
            <p>It is the uſual courſe of every war, that ſome one of the contending people is ſuffered to prevail, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they are become ſecure, and irreligious by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; then the wheel returns, and the troops which they had beaten, recover new ſtrength, make head again, and prove the laſt upon the field.</p>
            <p>It is for this reaſon that I look upon the preſent to be the moſt critical point of time, that has yet revolved to America. We ſet out very weak, and we were ſure of the providence of God, becauſe we were ſure that we needed it. We were beaten very low, and we deſpaired not, becauſe there were many inſtances of thoſe who had emerged from the deepeſt ſituation of trouble and diſtreſs.</p>

Laudible hath been our practice hitherto, in aſking the aid of divine providence when we were about to engage in any undertaking. Laudible hath been the recommendation of our Congreſs in ſetting apart a day for public thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and praiſe to God, when through divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour we have been ſucceſsful. Let this taſte and ſenſe of things be kept up in the breaſt of every ſenator, and ſoldier, and ſubject of the ſtates of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:015748_0077_0F9A27632A04C278"/>
North-America. How much more becoming is a day ſet apart for praiſe to God, than entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a hall of merriment, or aſſembly of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate joy. How much more becoming is it at a time, when it is yet undecided what ſhall be the fate and iſſue of our conteſt—at a time more eſpecially when many of our countrymen lie in jails famiſhing for bread. Theſe poor men, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſoldiers and fellow ſufferers in the common cauſe, muſt certainly take it very hard to hear of mirth, and muſick, and feſtivity entertained by others, while they lie faint and hungry in the hand of the cruel foe. For this reaſon, and for many others, may ſobriety, and wiſdom, be the ſpirit of our times.</p>
            <p>If we begin to <hi>exult</hi> too ſoon, we ſhall look very mean and contemptible if we are ſhortly beaten, and have the ground of our triumph taken from us. If at any time we are frowned on by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, let us <hi>hope</hi>; but if on the contrary we bend along in a full gale of fair proſperity let us <hi>fear.</hi> In every inſtance of ſucceſs,

                  <l>But in true piety, and light of love,</l>
                  <l>And warm devotion in the inward part.</l>
                  <l>Let your feſtivity he mixed with thought,</l>

            <p>I have ſaid that the preſent time is a <hi>criſis</hi> to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. We are in that ſituation where a reverſe of fortune doth uſually take place. We have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced for ſome time paſt a high flow and full gale of continued ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The latter end of the laſt campaign was <hi>critical</hi> to the Britiſh arms in America. They had reduced fort Waſhington, and travelled through the Jerſies.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:015748_0078_0F9A2763E9F614A8"/>
They had obliged us with a few troops to retire on this ſide the Delaware. What now remained but the full taſte of triumph, and the fruits of victory? They had reached a ſummit, and this was the <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi> From the eminence attained, they now began to decline down the hill. This is no more than what is uſual to thoſe, who, flattered by ſucceſs, look upon their work as already done.</p>
            <p>The preſent time is a <hi>criſis</hi> to America. We have vanquiſhed Burgoyne. We have reached a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great eminence. Let us ſo behave, that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may not in juſtice and in puniſhment fix it down as the ſummit to which we ſhall attain. Let not ſecurity take the place of prudence. We have yet a great height of mountain to aſcend. It would be the beſt policy of general Howe and the devil, if they knew it, to give way, and make as if they were beaten altogether, ſo that by and by they might return again, and taking us unguarded, deal a ſeverer blow. On the other hand, it is our beſt policy to be upon our guard, and notwithſtanding our late ſucceſs and victory, not to tempt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by a remiſſion of our vigilance and care—not to offend the great arbiter of cauſes, by giving way to vain glory and a boaſting ſpirit, while our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is yet incompleat, and it remains to be decided, whether we ſhall live freemen, or be made ſlaves.</p>

            <p>THESE words are characteriſtic of the devil, who, in the late age of the world, and juſt before the <hi>millenium,</hi> is about to act with redoubled fury, knowing, that in a ſhort time, he ſhall be ſhut up in the dark abode of hell, not to vex or diſturb the human race any more. It is the caſe not only with the devil, but with all who in any ſhape reſemble him, that they vent themſelves the more outragiouſly, in proportion as the time is ſhort in which they have any hope of opportunity to exerciſe their vengeance. It is the caſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with the tyrant of Great-Britain, who at this time hath made war upon us—He hath had great wrath; and it is becauſe he knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:015748_0080_0F9A27656B77C308"/>1. He hath had great wrath. It is uſual in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage when a man is angry, for himſelf as well as others to ſay that he is mad. He is mad with rage—you have made me mad and the like. Nor is there ſo great an impropriety in theſe words as may at firſt be imagined; for according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, <hi>anger is a ſhort madneſs.</hi> Paſſion of any kind and more eſpecially that of anger, diſturbs or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents any exerciſe of reaſon, ſo that the ſubject of it, in the wildneſs of his looks, the impetuoſity of words, and the extravagance of action, ſhall differ little from a madman. In the ſally of reſentment he ſhall take the way to gratify it which is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt ineffectual to hurt the perſon with whom he is offended, but is moſt deadly and deſtructive to himſelf. An eager thirſt of revenge will prompt a man to engage in a duel with a more ſkilful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and to riſk his life with but half a chance, forthe preſervation of it. At the ſame time, the blind and inconſiderate fury of his rage, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deſtroy that ſmall ſhare of ſkill and prudence which he may have had, and render him an eaſy prey to the more cool and deliberate combatant.</p>
            <p>We ſaw this remarkably in the direction of the war waged by the tyrant. He was principally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the four New-England provinces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore was diſpoſed to make theſe the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of his vengeance. Prompted by his paſſion, this quarter of the confederate colonies he attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt, contrary to the well eſtabliſhed maxim— <hi>Seek the weak ſide of an enemy.</hi> Had he brought his firſt ten thouſand men up the Bay of Cheſapeak, and made his inroad on the then unarmed, undiſciplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and defenceleſs Pennſylvanians, he might have effectuated ſomething. But ſo inveterate was his rage againſt the people of the Maſſachuſett's-Bay province in particular, that theſe he muſt attack firſt, though he well knew, that of all the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:015748_0081_0F9A27662BB6F2D0"/>
they were the beſt prepared to receive him. This province, which at that time might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accounted the citadel, he continued with unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiduity to batter, until the other parts of the empire were put into a poſture of defence, and rendered equally impregnable to his aſſault. Thus it may be ſaid that the tyrant hath been mad with rage—that his anger hath overſhot his wit, and that from a deſire inſtantly to ſatiate his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, he hath loſt the opportunity to ſatiate it at all.</p>
            <p>The madneſs of his paſſion was equally obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in many other parts of his behaviour. His bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was to rob, and it was his wiſdom to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it, like a man of honour, ſo that many might give up their purſe with ſome degree of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, taken with the gallant look of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-man, and the politeneſs of the manner in which it was demanded. "Gentlemen, he might have ſaid, I am in want of money, and you muſt pardon me if I take the freedom to requeſt a little. You ſee my arms, and my capacity to force it from you; nevertheleſs I ſcorn any ungentlemanly and unfair advantage Equip yourſelves, and come out and fight with me, and my retinue, in even play and fair hoſtility. I ſcorn the aſſiſtance of the Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian offered me from Germany—the Negro, or the Indian, to ſhed the blood of Chriſtians. If I cannot conquer you myſelf, I will diſdain to take your money. Ladies in the coach be eaſy and compoſe yourſelves. I make not war upon the fairer ſex. It is your huſbands with whom I am to combat."</p>
            <p>Very contrary to this was the behaviour of the tyrant. By his grim threats, cruel outrage, and baſe barbarity, he at once diſcovered himſelf to be a ruffian and a villain. The paſſion of his ſoul was too dark and gloomy to admit the appearance of ſo much gallantry and ſprightlineſs, but which, if
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:015748_0082_0F9A2766E9D4BD80"/>
exerciſed, would have been the only moſt effectual way to have gained his purpoſe, and prevented that declaration of independence and ſeparation from his empire, which, in conſequence of his brutality, hath taken place upon the continent.</p>
            <p>It is evident from the bad policy of all his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that the tyrant hath been mad; and to what can we attribute this, ſo naturally as to the ſtrength of his reſentment, which hurried him impetuouſly to gratify it, without attention to the rules of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or the maxims of experience. He hath been mad with rage. Like a madman he hath been impolitic, but at the ſame time violent. His rage hath been exerted without ſkill, but at the ſame time with great ſtrength and great cruelty. He hath had great wrath.</p>
            <p>I need not write, nor deſcribe it to you. It is writ in blood. You may caſt up your eye, and read it on every height from Bunker's-hill to fort Sullivan—on the heights of Abraham—on the heights of Danbury—on the heights of the Hudſon-river— on the heights of Raritan—on the heights of Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware—on the heights of Schuylkill—on the heights of Brandywine.</p>
            <p>Some time ago we read ſad appearances of blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, in the fiery vapours ſpread upon the north. <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note> Ah! my countrymen, you may read it much better, not in the firmament, but upon the earth. The Heſſian hath writ in blood—the Indian hath writ in blood—the Britiſh ſoldiery hath writ in blood. Here lies a Warren—here lies a Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery—here lies a Mercer—a Haſlet—a Worſter—a Harkemer—a Naſh—a Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoon. The wrath of the tyrant, in blood-red cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters hath been writ by every one of theſe. He hath had great wrath, and</p>

glimmering of light upon his mind, as to ſee what was very eaſy to be ſeen, that theſe colonies could not be very long a member of his empire. It was therefore his policy, he apprehended, to make the beſt uſe of them, while he had them in his power. For this purpoſe he laid the ſtamp-act upon them, in order to enrich himſelf, and at the ſame time keep them low, and at a greater diſtance from that period, when conſcious of their own importance, they might be diſpoſed to throw off all ſubjection to his authority. In the impoſition of this tax he found a greater ſpirit of reſiſtance than he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and therefore thought it prudent to repeal it for the preſent. Senſible that he had aimed a moſt unfriendly ſtab at the vitals of our liberty, he did not think it poſſible that we could in any future time forgive him. Thus he was enraged againſt us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was perſuaded that we muſt be enraged againſt him. So true it is that <hi>he who injures never can forgive.</hi> His fancy and imagination whirled in a perpetual fit of jealouſy. He felt within himſelf, that he had intended the greateſt injury, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly thought, that the people againſt whom it was intended muſt have conceived an anſwerable indignation. He was convinced that it was our true and beſt intereſt, to break off all connection with him; and therefore judged that we muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take the firſt opportunity to do it. <hi>A ſtate of ſuſpence is worſe than a ſtate of diſappointment.</hi> His eager and unquiet ſpirit prompted him, as ſoon as poſſible, to make the experiment, and to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Americans had really thoſe deſigns of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, which his own evil and foreboding fears had given him to believe they began to entertain. He openly aſſerts the claim of binding them <hi>in all caſes whatſoever,</hi> and thus immediately brings about that eſtabliſhment of an independent empire in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:015748_0084_0F9A27686A793EC8"/>
which otherwiſe might have ſlept in embryo, for two or three ages.</p>
            <p>When the claim was denied, and the attempt to enforce it was reſiſted, he waxed very wroth, but was not yet come to the height of rage and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. He had ſtill ſome fluctuating hope that he ſhould be able to reduce us for the preſent, and hold us ſome longer time in ſubjection. At the commencement of the debate he was pleaſant in his manner, and talked much of clemency. It was ſome time before he uſed the word—<hi>rebels.</hi> His deluded and miſtaken ſubjects was the term. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blockade of Boſton he confined our priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to dungeons, and to jail, but did not put them to death by famine, and the ſupply of vitiated food. He ſhed our blood in the Bunker-hill engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but we do not hear that he butchered the wounded, or refuſed quarter to any ſupplicating for their life. He ſet fire to Charles-town, but this was rather to ſkreen his own cowardice behind the ſmoke, than with a deſign to deſolate the country. In proportion as he became leſs ſanguine in his hope of reducing us, he became more outrageous, and barbarous in his reſentment.</p>
            <p>It was not until his departure from Virginia, that he ſet fire to the town of Norfolk. It was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his retreat from the White Plains, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to burn dwelling houſes, and lay waſte our ſettlements. It was not until he had ingloriouſly withdrawn from this tract of country, and retired back into New-York, that he began to ſhew the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized world ſomething to aſtoniſh them, in the uſage of the unhappy priſoners of Fort-Waſhington.</p>
            <p>It was not until his inroad through the Jerſies that he let fully flip the hounds that followed him, to lap, and feaſt luxuriouſly upon the blood of men. It was not until this time that he mangled the wounded on the field of battle, and ſtabed unpitiedly the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:015748_0085_0F9A2769D70CC1C0"/>
ſupplicating for his life. It was not until his departure from this ſtate, that he ſo wantonly every where began to burn and deſtroy the buildings and edifices of the country through which he made his rout.</p>
            <p>In the laſt campaign he ſurpaſſed all that he had done before. In the retreat of Clinton from the neighbourhood of Albany, he conſumed every fine building on each ſide of the Hudſon river. He laid in ruins the beautiful and pleaſant ſtreets of Eſopus or Kingſton. He burned many other ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler villages, and marked every veſtige of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs with waſte and deſolation.</p>
            <p>In the inroad of Burgoyne he ſtirred up the ſavages to come down upon us, and with more inhumanity than uſual even to himſelf, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them by a reward to ſcalp and murder the inhabitants in their places of abode. He ordered our priſoners, under the very eye of the Britiſh troops, to be gnawed upon by theſe <hi>dogs of hell.</hi> He murderouſly ſent them in amongſt the trembling captives, and in the manner of the Canibals of South-America, cauſed them to chuſe out the fatteſt, that they might put their knives in him, and feaſt upon his limbs with a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid appetite <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>.</p>
            <p>In his progreſs through the ſtate of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, we have heard the cry of the raviſhed virgin, and the murdered ſoldier, and have ſeen every horrid act perpetrated that can diſgrace the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of wicked and apoſtate men. The ſoft-expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating ſouls that want bread in the jails of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, recal the memory of fort Waſhington, and lodge a new complaint in the ear of the God of heaven, and in the ears of their countrymen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:015748_0086_0F9A2769EF426768"/>I expect that next campaign, if the tyrant is able to effect an inroad, he will vent his fury with a ſtill more diſpairing vengeance. <hi>We may gueſs his loſs of hope by his increaſe of wrath.</hi> When his rage is come to the very height, ſo that no gleam of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity remains to temperate his actions, we may conclude that it is over with him and the day of our deliverance draweth nigh. Thus, that hour is the darkeſt which precedes the break of day, and February, which is the laſt month, is the coldeſt and moſt ſtormy of the wintry year.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid that it is probable the tyrant will act, in the next campaign, with a ſtill more diſpairing vengeance. When I ruminate upon it, I do not ſee that he has any thing to add, to the gloomy cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of his former cruelties. It is true he might aſſaſinate and endeavour to ſatisfy his malice by the private death of ſome of our greateſt ſtateſmen, and braveſt heroes; but this is what he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready plotted, and endeavoured to accompliſh. The dark ſcene of hell laid againſt our general, on York-Iſland, is an evidence of this; And the late attempt made againſt the great FRANKLIN at the court of France, ſets it beyond a poſſibility of doubt. It would ſeem therefore that nothing bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous or cruel of a new nature remains for him to perpetrate. If ſo, may we not hope that he has run his round, and that ſhortly his opportunity of ſhewing himſelf barbarous and cruel to Americans, ſhall be made to ceaſe?</p>
            <p>It is indeed devoutly to be wiſhed; for much pain and ſore calamity is yet upon us; and many poor families driven from their places of abode, ſuffer in the conteſt. Well might it have been ſaid with a reference to this war, as in the words of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture immediately preceeding thoſe prefixed to this diſcourſe. <hi>Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and the ſea, for the devil is come down unto you.</hi> The devil is
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:015748_0087_0F9A276AB5C113F0"/>
indeed come down in the ſervice of the tyrant. We have felt his fury on the <hi>land</hi> We have felt it on the <hi>ſea.</hi> Many of our poor ſailors, taken by him, hath he forced to act againſt the cauſe in which we are engaged and to do reluctantly that which the principle of conſcience diſapproves. Many of them hath he ſhut down in the dark holds of veſſels to lament the loſt light and the hope of day. Many of them hath he ſent away to the ſcorched iſles, where ſlavery takes place, and where hot fevers ſoon fix a limit to the life of man.</p>
            <p>The time of war is the devil's time. War is not friendly to religion.—It is not friendly to the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Animoſity and bloodſhed is unfavourable to all that is good and uſeful on the earth. I truſt we ſhall ſoon be delivered from the neceſſity of wading in it.</p>
            <p>The reign of the tyrant is the reign of ſatan. I truſt that a ſhort ſpace of time ſhall fix the limit to them both. War and fierce debate ſhall ſhew themſelves no more. Tranquility and days of happineſs ſhall again be ours. The huſbandman now deſtitute of habitation, ſhall return to his dwelling-houſe. The tear ſhall be wiped from the eye of the fair virgin, driven from the city, where ſhe had been delicately bred. The priſoner ſhall be lifted from the jail, and have his name placed with thoſe who have ſuffered for their country. The ſoldier ſhall retire from the danger of the camp, and the wooden leg and the grey hairs of valour ſhall be honourable. Hiſtorians ſhall hear from him the tale of that which he did in battle. They ſhall dip their pens in the luſtre of his fame, and give immortality to what they write.</p>
            <p>Be cheared, O my country, for thy garden-bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and thy walls ſhall be built again. Thy meads ſhall be decked with graſs, and the grain ſhall be heavy on thy fields. The villages ſhall riſe from
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:015748_0088_0F9A276B6BCB70E8"/>
their rubbiſh and their ſmoke, and new towns ſhall ſmile along thy ſtreams.</p>
            <p>Commerce ſhall extend her wings, and come from every ſhore. It will be pleaſant to ſee a new <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> in every fair metropolis upon our coaſt. It will be pleaſant to obſerve every nation in their proper dreſs about to barter their commodities upon our wharfs—The native of Bencoolen, of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra, of Borneo, and the Malayan, with his pearl fiſhed from the bottom of the ſea—The Turk with his Turban on his head—the Venetian— the Genoeſe—the Frenchman—the Dane—the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe—the Dutchman, and the Engliſhman him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf taught the arts of peace.</p>
            <p>Science ſhall be planted in our country, and many ſeminaries ſhall again ſhew their heads. Like fair lights, and pyramids of fire, they ſhall ſhoot up in every ſtate. The muſes every where ſhall ſtrew the land with flowers; and ſlumbering bards ſhall yet awake, to ſing of nature, and the praiſe of men.</p>
            <p>Religion ſhall again come down and live upon the earth. Free exerciſe of conſcience ſhall be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where. Bigotry—vile bigotry that ſprings from ignorance, ſhall fly away. Truth, pure truth ſhall diſpel the fog and vapour of the mind. The light of knowledge, like the light of day ſhall kindle heat in the pious ſoul. Days, happy days are yet before us.</p>
            <p>The devil, in equal meaſure with the tyrant, hath had great wrath, and it is <hi>becauſe he knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time.</hi> He hath been let looſe for a while, but after he hath taken a turn or two more, he ſhall be ſhut down in the lake of hell.

            <p>Let theſe bright ages haſten on, and to God, with whom all time, and ſituation, and event is inſcrutably laid up, be the glory. Amen.</p>
