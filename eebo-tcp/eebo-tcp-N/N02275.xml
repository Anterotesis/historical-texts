            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

FROM the <hi>Thurſday</hi> before the Battle, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were apprehenſive they were Diſcover'd and Dog'd by the Enemy: And on <hi>Friday</hi> Night, the Watch heard the <hi>Indians</hi> about the Camp and Alarm'd the Company, but it being very Dark, they could make no further Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SATURDAY</hi> the Eighth of <hi>May,</hi> while they were at Prayers, very Early in the Morning, they heard a Gun; and ſometime after ſpy'd an <hi>Indian</hi> on a Point, that ran into <hi>Saco Pond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY now concluded that the deſign of the Gun, &amp; of the <hi>Indian'</hi>s Diſcovering himſelf, was to draw them that way: And expecting without fail to be Attack'd; It was now propoſed, whether it were Prudent to venture an Engagement with the Enemy, (who they perceiv'd were now ſufficiently Alarmed,) or, endeavour a ſpeedy Retreat. The Men Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally &amp; Boldly Anſwered, <q>We came out to meet the Enemy; we have all along Pray'd <hi>GOD</hi> we might find 'em; and we had rather truſt Providence with our Lives, yea Dy for our Country, than try to Return without ſeeing them, if we may, and be called Cowards for our Pains.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Captain</hi> readily comply'd to lead them on, though not without Manifeſting ſome Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;—And (ſuppoſing the Enemy were a Head of 'em, when as it prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

it's evident, That <hi>David</hi> in the midſt of his mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is not unmindful of what was neceſſary for the good of the Common Wealth: Teaching us, not to be ſo overcome with Grief, on ſuch ſorrowful oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as to forget our Duty and neglect means for our own or our Countries ſafety.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> IT is Juſt and Equal, for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD to Lament the Death of Brave and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Soldiers Slain by their Enemies, and in their Service. Tears and proper Lamentations are a Debt we owe them. They've dearly merited this piece of Reſpect from their People. It's but juſt, to ſhed Tears for them, that have ſhed their Hearts Blood for us.

Now whatſoever we would that men ſhould do to us, we ſhould do the ſame to them; or, we tranſgreſs a Golden Rule. But if this Rule be out of faſhion with any; yet</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> AGREABLE Lamentations for Expert and Succeſsful Soldiers Slain in War, are very uſeful and advantagious. It's a Comfort to their Bereaved Relatives, when they obſerve that the People of GOD do greatly bewail the Death of their Friends, and heartily Sympathize with them, tho' their Loſs may poſſibly be in ſome reſpects Irreparable; yet <hi>this</hi> ſhould and will contribute not a little, to alleviate their ſorrow, eaſe their diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed minds, and dry up their Tears.</p>
            <p>AND then, its a Spur to Virtue. When Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soldiers (and particularly ſuch as have been Eye-Witneſſes of the Fall of their Brethren, and fought with uncommon Bravery, and were either Wounded, or Equally Expoſed in the ſame Battle,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002706_0029_0FE60EDC9B88DBD0"/>
with thoſe that are Slain) take Notice that the Death of their Officers or Fellow-Soldiers is deeply reſented by the People of GOD, that they ſtill ſpeak of them with great Honour in their Lamentations; this will Animate them, we hope, to do Worthily, and rather Die with Honour, if call'd to Battle, than live with Diſgrace; and for their Cowardice, have the offer of a <hi>Wooden Sword,</hi> and be Branded with the Infamous Character of <hi>Cowards,</hi> even by the Weaker Sex.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, on the other hand, it's a great Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the Affliction of diſtreſſed Mourners, when they obſerve that the Generality only give the News of their Friends Death, the hearing, but ſeem as Stoical and unconcern'd about it, as if their Lives were of no value, and their Death what does no way concern them. Such Ingratitude and Inhumanity is very Exerciſing to Ingenious minds and ſuch as have any ſenſe of Honour. Beſides ſuch a Sordid Inſenſibleneſs is very Diſcouraging to our Brave Soldiers. Who would be willing to venture their Lives for ſuch ungrateful People!</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>S Pious and Scriptural to bewail the Death of ſuch Brave and Succeſsful Soldiers, whoſe Lot it is to be Slain at laſt in the Field of Battle.

This is an awful Frown, and argues the great diſpleaſure of GOD. Hence He threatned the men of <hi>Anathoth,</hi> that ſaid to the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Propheſy not in the Name of the Lord, that their <hi>Young men ſhould die by the Sword,</hi> Jer. 11. 21, 22. and a like threatning he denounc'd againſt <hi>Moab,</hi> Jer. 48 15.—<hi>His choſen young men are gone down to the ſlaughter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

If the <hi>Lion</hi> roar, who will not tremble? but alas, who can ſtand when GOD is angry! And he highly reſents it, when his people are inſenſible under the Tokens of his holy Anger: if they cry not, when he corrects them.

            <p>BESIDES, We've many Scripture Precepts and Examples, that teach us to Lament, on the occaſion

under conſideration. When GOD threatned <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the weeping Prophet, that a People ſhould come from the North Country, that ſhould lay hold on Bow and Spear, being <hi>Cruel,</hi> and having <hi>no Mercy:</hi> Jer. 6. 22, 23. It's added, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>O Dau'ter of my People, gird thee with Sackcloth, and wallow thy ſelf in aſhes: make thee Mourning as for an</hi> ONLY SON, <hi>moſt bitter Lamentation;</hi>—Surely then, there ſhould be a proportionable Lamentation, when ſeveral choſen Young Men, and ſome very promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and hopeful, are actually Slain by Men of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Character. Another Inſtance we have, Jer. 9 17.—<hi>Conſider ye, and call for the mourning Women.—Let them make haſte—that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eye-lids guſh out with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters—And teach your Dau'ters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation. For Death is come up,—to cut off the young Men from the ſtreets. And even the Carcaſes of men ſhall fall as dung upon the open field—and none ſhall gather, or,</hi> BURY <hi>them. This</hi> evinces, that GOD calls to mourning when young Men fall by the Sword, and the Mighty in the Battle. And then to mention no other Scriptures, our Text and Context is a full and direct proof of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For, as was obſerv'd before, this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Song was <hi>Davids</hi> Lamentation over thoſe that were ſlain by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> on Mount <hi>Gilboa.</hi>

            <p>GOD allows us indeed, in our Spiritual Warfare, (and in extraordinary caſes, as, in <hi>David'</hi>s, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Challenge of the Giant, in a <hi>Carnal</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare alſo) to triumph before the Battle and to ſay, <hi>Thanks be unto GOD, that giveth us the Victory, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For, in all theſe things we are more than Conquerors, thro' the Captain of our Salvation, whoſe is the Victory, and who hath lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and who will give it to us!</p>

            <p>THE wretched <hi>Jeſuites</hi> or <hi>Friers,</hi> are wont ('tis ſaid) to abſolve their deluded Proſelytes, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <hi>Indians,</hi> when they come forth to War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us: and flatter 'em with the promiſe of an immediate paſſage to Paradiſe, without any ſtop at Purgatory, if they fall in Battle: And theſe delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Hopes may poſſibly animate them, to fight with great Fury in their Engagements with us.

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002706_0035_0FE60ECBEF33E490"/>
SO then, <hi>A well grounded Perſwaſion of a Part in Chriſt, and an Intereſt in the Favour of GOD, is what all that go forth to War, would do wiſely to give all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to obtain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> SINCE the beſt of Soldiers are liable to be overcome and ſlain in War, <hi>It ill becomes the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD to put their truſt in Man.</hi> Tho' it's their Duty and Wiſdom to employ and encourage expert Soldiers; yet it's their Sin and Folly to truſt in them. As it's Idolatry for <hi>Soldiers</hi> to truſt in their Arms, or in their Dexterity and Courage to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them; or in one another: So it's Idolatry for the People of GOD, in whoſe Service they go forth to truſt in <hi>them.</hi> For alas! What is Man whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils, and wherein is he to be accounted of? His Breath goeth forth, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his Duſt; in that very Day, all his Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Reſolutions and Accompliſhments for War, periſh!</p>
            <p>SURELY then, It's the greateſt Folly for a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to truſt in their Forces, how well ſoever quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſpirited and equipp'd: and how Succeſsful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have been. For, <hi>Every Creature is that to us that GOD makes it to be;</hi> and unleſs GOD give Help, <hi>vain</hi> is the Help of Man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Truly in vain is Salvation hoped for from the Hills, and from the multitude of Mountains; truly in the Lord our GOD is the Salvation of Iſrael.</hi> And we know who has ſaid, <hi>Curſed be the Man that truſteth in Man, and maketh Fleſh his Arm—But bleſſed is the Man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is.</hi> Jer. 17. 5,—7.

            </p>
            <p>MEN may fail us, be overcome, and utterly fruſtrate our Expectations: But, if we truſt in GOD, we may pray with <hi>Aſa,</hi> when <hi>Zerah</hi> the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> came againſt him, with an Hoſt of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Thouſand, and three Hundred Chariots; LORD, (ſaid he) <hi>It is nothing with thee to help, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with many, or with them that have no Power: Help us O LORD our GOD, for we</hi> REST <hi>on thee, and in thy Name we go againſt this Multitude.

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ARE the Braveſt and moſt ſucceſsful Soldiers, liable to fall in Battle? Such then as are preſerv'd in Military Expeditions and Engagements, and ſafely return'd to their Families and Friends, are oblig'd to ſtudy <hi>what they ſhall render to the Lord,</hi> and take heed they don't forget <hi>his Benefits,</hi> but that all their Days they perform their Vows. It is the LORD that has covered their Heads in the Battle; It is the LORD that redeemed their Lives from Deſtruction, when thoſe, no more expos'd than

they, are fallen, and gone down to the Grave, and ſhall come up no more, and return to their Houſes no more. O that all ſuch as have experienc'd the diſtinguiſhing Favour of Heaven, would praiſe Him for his Goodneſs, and not content themſelves to deſire Thanks to be return'd for them in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Aſſemblies of GOD's People, tho' that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, but that they would endeavour to live the Praiſes of GOD. They ſhould now at their Leiſure, calmly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>equently during Life conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what <hi>Great Things</hi> GOD has done for them. How He has greatly honour'd them, in inſpiring them with ſo much Courage, and making them the Inſtruments of ſo much Service to their Country.—And alſo how GOD has highly favour'd them, in ſo wonderfully preſerving them, in His diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providence, ſo that all their Bones may ſay, Who is like unto Thee! The LORD who is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Help in Trouble, was ready to ſave them: They ſhould therefore <hi>ſing their Songs</hi> in the Houſe of the LORD all the Days of their Lives! It's very diſpleaſing to GOD, when His People don't render to Him according to his Benefits, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 25. <hi>David</hi> celebrates the Praiſes of GOD, for Preſervation and Succeſs in War, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. <hi>begin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> HENCE the People of GOD ought to aſcribe to Him the Glory of all their Succeſs in War. His is the Victory, and he gives it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will. He furniſhes Men with Military Skill and Courage: <hi>Teaches their Hands to War, and their Fingers to Fight.</hi> He finds out the Enemy for his People, and gives a Preſence of Mind to their Forces; and if they are not ſwallowed up quick,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002706_0038_0FE60F66F332DB78"/>
when Men, vaſtly ſuperiour in Number, and other Advantages, riſe up againſt them, it's becauſe the LORD is on their ſide, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124. Again, we find <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> giving Glory to GOD, for aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his People in the defeat of <hi>Siſera</hi> and his Hoſt, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. and how often is <hi>David</hi> the famous War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> harping on this String, as we noted before.</p>
            <p>GOD highly reſents it, when his People Sacrifice to their own Net, and burn Incenſe to their own Drag: When they aſcribe that to Inſtruments that is due to GOD alone. This no doubt often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes GOD, to deprive a People of their Choſen Soldiers. For he is a very jealous GOD, and will not give his Glory to another. And, as the former Paſtor of this Church would ſay of Miniſters, we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay of Soldiers, <hi>People kill them two ways:</hi> either, by aſcribing too much, or too little to them: Idolize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, or Detracting from them, and Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> LET us all <hi>Religiouſly Lament</hi> the Fall of the Brave <hi>LOVEWELL,</hi> and ſeveral of his <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Company,</hi> that offered themſelves willingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People. Let us take up this Lamentation over them, <hi>How are the Mighty fallen!</hi> And if we would herein approve our ſelves to GOD, let us conſider that theſe Brave Men (tho' I hope we've many left as capable of ſerving their Country, yet they) were <hi>no inconſiderable part of the Beauty and Strength of New<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> England.</hi> Indeed, being wholly a Stranger to moſt of them, I can't pretend to give their Character; yet it's evident to the Country, they were Men form'd and rais'd up by Providence to ſerve us in purſuing an Enemy, of whom we
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002706_0039_0FE60EE76E7DE2D0"/>
may ſay as of the wild Aſs, <hi>The Wilderneſs yieldeth Food for them and for their Children,</hi> Job 24. 5.</p>
            <p>THESE our <hi>worthy Friends</hi> could endure Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as good Soldiers: And were well able to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Fatigues of long Marches, both in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Summer.

            <p>FURTHERMORE, By the ſore Judgment of War, and particularly by the Fall of our Brethren we are now weeping over, GOD is loudly calling upon us to amend our Ways and Doings. And GOD expects we ſhould all in our places endeavour a Reformation, that we ſhould do <hi>our</hi> Part in this Work: And if we do ſo, whatever be the Event, GOD will ſet a <hi>Mark</hi> upon us, <hi>and our Labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> Let not any then be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, becauſe ſome proper Eſſays and noble Efforts have miſcarried and prov'd abortive.

            <p>BUT then, our Soldiers that are fit to go forth to War, and may probably be call'd forth, You my Brethren in an eſpecial manner, are oblig'd to take the Alarm given you by the late Intelligence.

            </p>
            <p>AND if you'r truly Religious, and thus equipp'd for, and train'd to War, and GOD call you forth, He can eaſily, and we hope will, preſerve and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per you.

               <hi>Again,</hi> WE ſhould amidſt our Lamentations, be much in Prayer to GOD. If we would have <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevail, we muſt keep up as well as lift up the hand of Prayer. If our Soldiers would conſtitute a Thundring, they muſt be a Praying Legion. And we that tarry at home muſt get into the Mount and pray for 'em. A <hi>good Woman</hi> in her Cloſet, (tho' ſhe's afraid to take a Gun in her Hand) may ſerve her Country to very good purpoſe, even in reſpect of the War; as really, as the Magiſtrate at the Council-Board; or the moſt daring and well advis'd Commander in the open Field in a thro' Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

near Relations. They are greatly to be pitied, and their Caſe remembred in our Devotions. We ſhould pray for them, that GOD would give them Songs in the Night, and ſay unto them weep not! That he would comfort thoſe that are caſt down, would afford 'em thoſe Divine Conſolations that are not ſmall, and refreſh their Spirits, in the multitude of their perplexed Tho'ts within them. That he would give them Patience to ſubmit to his holy Will, to bear his Indignation, to hold their Peace and be ſtill, knowing that he is GOD, who gives none account of his matters.—And that he would be a GOD to the <hi>Widow,</hi> a Father to the poor Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Children:</hi> And better than <hi>Ten Sons</hi> to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Parents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briefly,</hi> WHILE we lament our Caſe is ſo <hi>ſad,</hi> let us be very thankful it is no <hi>worſe,</hi> that it is ſo well. That we've ſuch abundant cauſe to ſing of <hi>Mercy</hi> as well as <hi>Judgment.</hi> For tho' we've loſt ſome brave Men, (and have cauſe to mourn on that ſcore) yet it's probable the Enemy have loſt more than treble the Number, and amongſt them ſome of their Chiefs, and particularly their bold <hi>Paugus,</hi> and a remarkable Check is given to their Inſolence, and many Lives may be ſav'd by this means. While therefore we cry out, <hi>How are the mighty fallen!</hi> Let us admire the Divine Goodneſs, that under all their <hi>Hazards, Hardſhips</hi> and <hi>Diſadvantages,</hi> ſo many are returned. That our Friends can't ſay as <hi>Job'</hi>s Meſſengers, <hi>I only am eſcaped alone to tell thee:</hi> But that ſo many are well, and give us the joyful Account that our <hi>little Army</hi> behav'd <hi>bravely,</hi> fought <hi>manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and very <hi>ſucceſsfully;</hi> ſo that tho' our Loſs is great, yet our Enemies have no cauſe to Triumph.

               <hi>O let us magnify the Lord, and exalt his Name together,</hi> that the Enemy did not ſwallow them up quick, that in Wrath GOD has remembred Mercy, and has not dealt with us after our Sins.</p>
