            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

When on a Promontory I fix my Foot on firm Earth, while mine Eyes launch out into the Main, and ſee the Billows come wallowing one in on the Neck of another, as if they mutually encourag'd themſelves to an Univerſal Deluge; yet when they ſome and make a Noiſe as unkennelled, I may ſoon obſerve them at the End of their Chain.

When I look on the Reciprocation of the Waters, I feel a Spring of Thoughts at the higheſt Flow within me, and go beyond the Moon to find a Cauſe. Sometimes I look upon the Uſe of a Sea, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great Mercy and Wiſdom in placing of it; thoſe heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buckets that pour out refreſhing Showers on the parched Soil are dipt in this Ciſtern, and it is as the Liver to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, fills the Earth with irriguous Veins. Again, when I ſee the Earth once every Day muffle it ſelf in its own Shadow, and that the Dark may not be irkſome to us, our buſie Eyes are as often cloſed by a Law of Reſt, which upon pain of Death, we may not long infringe with a watchful Diſobedience, for, <hi>quod caret alterna Requie durabile non est.</hi> Now while we ſleep the Night ſteed's us for a Curtain, the half of the Term of our Life runs out in a ſleepy Vacation of Senſes, and is moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable, tho' leaſt lightſom; in this I adore a Supreme Wiſdom.

But while I ſtand admiring thus, here is one within tells me I need not go fiſh for Wonders in the Deep, or climb the Height of Heaven for Heaven, for my ſelf am one.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when I reflect on the Structure of my Body, I ſee it is not ordinary; my Stature is Erect when other Creatures gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vle.

But when I remember (that) whereby I work all this and more, I am arrived at an Height of Admiration; If you demand me of it, I will ſay it is ſome ſtrange Divine Thing, but what I know not; 'tis called a Soul, a moſt active Being I'm ſure it is: It is ever grinding, if you rake it up in the Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of a Sleep, it will glow in a Dream. It is fixt in a <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm,</hi> but yet not to be contained by the immenſe <hi>Macrocoſm</hi>; it is plac'd in the Orb of a minute Body, but raiſes it ſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Sun, will pierce the moſt ſolid Subſtance, reſt not in a few Objects, tho' a ſingle one may ſometimes like a Glaſs collect its Beams into a Flame—Oh! the Soul that can drag the paſt and future Time to the Bar of preſent Conſideration, that will in my moſt retiredneſs diſcourſe to me of various Matters; this Coſmographical Spirit, that can ſhew me the Heavens and the Earth as in Land-skip in the darkeſt Room, oh! the Swiftneſs of its Motion, 'twill beat againſt Eaſt and Weſt like a Bean in a Bladder, with leſs Noiſe and more Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs; Lightning to it is Leaden-heeled, and the Wink of an Eye the Conſumer of too much Time to ſtand in Compare. Sometimes I look on my Sway in the World, and obſerve all the viſible Creation bow down to me, the Sun, Moon &amp; Stars wait upon me, but, what ſhall all this fill my Life with Pride as my Mind with Marvail?

I further know my Subjection by mine Ignorance,—that Being I have, when I received it, I was meerly patient, how I was brought hither, I have it not in mine own Knowledge; if thoſe about me had conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it had been more eaſy to have made me believe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of my ſelf, <hi>a parte ante,</hi> than the <hi>Atheist a parte poſt.</hi> That I had a Beginning is delivered me by Tradition, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Motions of Accretion and Diminution in my ſelf and others; for I was lighted I know not how, or when.

               <p>THere is a ſort of cunning Men whom the World ſtile's Politicians, tho' ſomewhat improperly, for they labour of the Diſeaſe called the Feaver of Policy, or the Diſtemper of Prudence; and tho' they make fair as if indued with this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Virtue, (if I may call it a Virtue, and not rather <hi>aliarum Virtutum Retrix)</hi> yet I rather term it in them <hi>Calliditas, Astutia, Dolus,</hi> or ſome one of thoſe which indeed doth ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and emblemiſh Prudence; and tho' the ſame Hands at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this Vice which wait upon the other Virtue, as Memory, Underſtanding, Providence, Circumſpection and Caution, yet as old <hi>Ennius</hi> ſays of the Ape,

            <l>To th' utmoſt Height of Happineſs enjoy:</l>
            <l>(Such Happineſs I mean as is by Fate</l>
            <l>Allow'd unto our ſublunary State.)</l>
            <l>It is a ſoft, a dear, obliging Fair,</l>
            <l>Who with her Charms diſpels intruding Care:</l>
            <l>Whoſe dear Enjoyment Softneſs do's infuſe</l>
            <l>To all my Verſe, and animates my Muſe.</l>
            <l>'Tis She alone, believe me Sir, 'tis She</l>
            <l>Raiſes my Numbers into Harmony.</l>

               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:001715_0046_0FB74EB75F8B39D0"/>But yet, when ſcarcely eighteen Years had ran</l>
            <l>Over my Head,</l>
            <l>And ſprouting Down began to promiſe Man,</l>
            <l>Then, then I've hear'd, (I've hear'd it with Delight)</l>
            <l>I've hear'd it whiſper'd—<hi>Corydon can write.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But ah!—</l>
            <l>Since ſacred <hi>Hymen's</hi> genial Taper ſhone,</l>
            <l>And with its Brightneſs warm'd young <hi>Corydon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Fame I have hear'd with her loud Trumpet tell</l>
            <l>(Oh may 't be true!)—<hi>young</hi> Corydon <hi>writes well.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus (deareſt Friend) you ſee I plainly ſhow</l>
            <l>That all <hi>my Joys</hi> from th' Premiſes do flow.</l>
            <l>And yet I wou'd not have you think that I</l>
            <l>Owe this <hi>great</hi> BLISS to Senſuality,</l>
            <l>No, mine 's a noble Flame.</l>
            <l>Our Conſort-Souls harmoniouſly do move,</l>
            <l>And Pilot-Reaſon dictates how to love.</l>
            <l>Theſe are the Pleaſures I 've been treating of,</l>
            <l>Which tho' I'm full, I have not yet enough.</l>
            <l>Dear Youth,</l>
            <l>May your <hi>caelebian</hi> Sun ſerenely ſet,</l>
            <l>And may indulgent Heaven then ſee fit,</l>
            <l>To crown the Reſidue of your remaining Life</l>
            <l>With that great Happineſs, a vertuous Wife,</l>
            <l>And may You then with me</l>
            <l>And Halcyon-Days, in that bright Orbit move,</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Hymen</hi> dwells with all the Charms of Love.</l>
