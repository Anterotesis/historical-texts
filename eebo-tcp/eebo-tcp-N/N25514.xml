            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was not the intention, to publiſh the Memoirs during the life-time of the writer. They were penned for his own review, and the information and ſatisfaction of his own family, as well as poſterity: If any ſhould think their preſent publication in any reſpects relative to himſelf as too oſtentatious, candour, it is preſumed, will decide that there is no alternative, unleſs the Memoirs are <hi>mutilated in facts,</hi> or <hi>denied at preſent a publication.</hi> The preſſing importunity of very many is the ſole reaſon of their appearance at this time.</p>
            <p>SUCH of the facts as happened under the obſervation, or within the immediate knowledge of the writer, have been impartially narrated: Thoſe which he has been obliged to collect from other information, have been as faithfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted; but their authenticity cannot be equally vouched for. There are doubtleſs many errors. It is the lot of man to be fallible.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>NATURE ſeems to have decreed, that not only the minor branches of families, when they arrive at a proper age of maturity, ſhall ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arate from their parents, and become diſtinct fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies; but that Colonies, when they arrive at a certain degree of population and affluence, ſhall ſeparate from the mother State, and become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent and ſovereign. Howſoever fit and proper this economy of nature may be, experience has taught the world, that it has been the miſtaken policy of nations, in almoſt all ages, to oppoſe ſuch ſeparations, as the period approximates, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic exerciſe of power, thereby alienating the affections of the Coloniſts, and rouſing in their breaſts thoſe innate principles of liberty which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath implanted; (but which, had they not been awakened by a ſeverity of conduct, would have much longer repoſed on the boſom of a mother, and even have ſpurned the idea of ſeparation) and have alſo made uſe of armed force, in the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and cruel manner, to hold in ſubjection thoſe by nature in every reſpect free as themſelves, And in the proſecution of a war thus enkindled, alliances are ſought for, and formed, by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, even with thoſe who before were conſidered as the enemies of each. This has been exempliſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the conduct of Great-Britain towards her American Colonies, and by the people of the now United States of America, in their ſtruggle for freedom, and the eſtabliſhment of independence and ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:033865_0004_0FF958C0DAED8248"/>
IT is not the intention of the writer to go into a detall of the firſt ſettlement of this country, or the viciſſitudes which have attended it, at different pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods; nor of the riſe of the late revolution; as theſe have already been attempted by ſeveral writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and probably will hereafter be further elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidated by other pens.</p>
            <p>To preſerve and perpetuate a <hi>daily Journal of occurrences,</hi> through nearly the whole of the late American war, is the preſent object. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the following pages are not decorated with the flowers of Greece or Rome, and for their dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot claim the patronage of the learned, they contain a ſtate of facts in detail, which may not be unpleaſing to poſterity, who will wiſh, as much as is poſſible, to learn from every remaining veſtige, the conduct and ſucceſſes of their anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, in that revolution which laid the foundation of the independence and ſovereignty of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. To them, therefore, are the following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs bequeathed, by him who was an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to many of the facts which are related, and who collected the others from the beſt information the then moment and circumſtances would admit.</p>
            <p>THAT the United States of America, by their virtue, their wiſdom and their valour, may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and maintain the noble achievements of their anceſtors, and render them ſtill more brilliant, is the earneſt wiſh of their devoted,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AJOR-GENERAL <hi>WILLIAM HEATH</hi> deſcended from an ancient family in Roxbury, near Boſton, in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, and is of the fifth generation of the family who have inherited the ſame real eſtate, (taken up in a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) not large, but fertile, and pleaſtantly ſituated. He was born March 2d, (old ſtile) 1737, was brought up a farmer, of which profeſſion he is yet paſſionately fond. He is of middling ſtature, light complexion, very corpulent, and bald-headed, which led the French officers who ſerved in America, very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to compare him to the Marquis of Granby. <note n="*" place="bottom">Chaſtellu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'s Travels.</note> From his childhood he was remarkably fond of military exerciſes, which paſſion grew up with him, and as he arrived at years of maturity, led him to procure, and attentively to ſtudy, every military treatiſe in the Engliſh language, which was obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. This, with a ſtrong memory, rendered him fully acquainted with the <hi>theory</hi> of war in all its branches and duties, from the private ſoldier, to the Commander in Chief.</p>
            <p>Through the inactive ſtate of the militia company to which he belonged, in the ſpring of the year
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033865_0006_0FF958D01D255978"/>1765, he went over to Boſton, and entered a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. This immediately recommended him to the notice of the Colonel of the firſt regiment of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia in the county of Suffolk, who ſent for him, and importuned him to take the command of his own company; to which Mr. Heath was reluctant; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that his youth, and ſtepping over thoſe who had a better claim, by former office in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to the command of it, might produce an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs. He was, however, commiſſioned by Gov. Barnard; and his apprehenſions of uneaſineſs proved to be groundleſs.</p>
            <p>In the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, he was choſen, and ſerved, firſt as Lieutenant, and afterwards as Captain.</p>
            <p>In the firſt regiment of the militia of Suffolk, he became the military favourite of Gov. Barnard, who publickly declared, that he would not only make him Colonel of the regiment, but, if it were in his power, a General Officer alſo.</p>
            <p>As the diſpute between Great-Britain and her American Colonies put on a more ſerious aſpect, our Captain did not heſitate, for a moment, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his ſentiments in favour of the rights and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his fellow-countrymen. This alarmed Gov. Barnard's apprehenſions, but did not alter his open conduct to wards our Captain; though he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately intimated, that if he ſhould promote him, he might injure the cauſe of his royal maſter. It was afterwards intimated to our Captain, that if he was not advanced to the command of the regiment, he might reſt aſſured, that his feelings would never (during Gov. Barnard's adminiſtration) be hurt by any other officer being promoted over him; which was verified; Gov. Barnard leaving the province with this regiment unorganized.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:033865_0007_0FF95ABCF72D07D0"/>
Capt. Heath, convinced that the cloud was rapidly gathering, and would aſſuredly burſt over America, in the beginning of the year 1770, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced his addreſſes to the public, under the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>A Military Countryman,</hi> and which were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally continued until hoſtilities commenced. In them he urged the importance of military diſcipline, and ſkill in the uſe of arms, as the only means, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, that could ſave the country from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a prey to any daring invader.</p>
            <p>Gov. Hutchinſon ſucceeded Gov. Barnard. He organized the firſt regiment in Suffolk; and, as might be expected, our Captain had a reſpite from command.</p>
            <p>When it was recommended to the <hi>people</hi> of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, to chooſe officers themſelves to command them, our Captain was unanimouſly choſen to take the command of the firſt company in the town of Roxbury, (his old and favourite company;) and on the meeting of the Captains and ſubalterns of the firſt regiment of militia in Suffolk, he was choſen Colonel.</p>
            <p>The people of Maſſachuſetts, having determined to ſupport their rights and liberties at every hazard, (finding that ſuch was the ſenſe of the people of their ſiſter Colonies) after the diſiolution of their General Court, elected a Provincial Congreſs. This Congreſs appointed a <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> (of whom our Colonel was one,) veſted with executive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and another committee, called the <hi>Committee of Supplies.</hi> The latter were to purchaſe military ſtores, proviſions, &amp;c. and depoſit them in ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as the former ſhould direct. Both committees entered on the duties of their reſpective functions. The Provincial Congreſs voted a ſum of money for the purpoſe of procuring military ſtores and proviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions; and a quantity of both were collected, and ſtored in the town of Concord.</p>

            <p>In the month of March following, the Provincial Congreſs appointed a committee to make a minute inquiry into the ſtate of the operations of the Britiſh army. On the 20th of the ſame month, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee reported, that the Britiſh army then conſiſted of about 2850 men, diſtributed as follows: On Boſton common, about 1700; on Fort-Hill, 400; on Boſton neck, 340; in barracks at the Caſtle, 330; quartered in King-ſtreet, 80;—that they were erecting works on Boſton neck, on both ſides of the way, well conſtructed and well executed; the works were in forwardneſs, and then mounted with ten braſs and two iron cannon; that the old fortification, at the entrance of the town, was repaired, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much ſtronger by the addition of timber and earth to the parapet; that ten pieces of iron cannon were mounted on the old platforms; that a block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, brought from Governor's Iſland, was erecting on the ſouth ſide of the neck, between the old forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and the new works advanced on the neck.</p>
            <p>On the 18th of April, our General had been ſitting with the Committee of Safety, at Menotomy in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge; and on his return home, ſoon after he left the committee, and about ſun-ſetting, he met eight or nine Britiſh officers on horſeback, with their ſwords and piſtols, riding up the road towards Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington. The time of day, and diſtance from Boſton, excited ſuſpicion of ſome deſign. They indeed were out reconnoitring, and getting intelligence, but were not moleſted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:033865_0010_0FF958EB786B2D20"/>
On the 19th, at day-break, our General was awoke, called from his bed, and informed that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of the Britiſh army were out; that they had croſſed from Boſton to Phipps's farm, in boats, and had gone towards Concord, as was ſuppoſed, with intent to deſtroy the public ſtores. They probably had notice that the committees had met the preceding day at Wetherby's tavern, at Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notomy; for, when they came oppoſite to the houſe, they halted. Several of the gentlemen ſlept there during the night. Among them were Col. Orne, Col. Lee, and Mr. Gerry. One of them awoke, and informed the others that a body of the Britiſh were before the houſe. They immediately made their eſcape, without time to dreſs themſelves, at the back door, receiving ſome injury from obſtacles in the way, in their undreſſed ſtate. They made their way into the fields. The country was immediately alarmed, and the minute-men and militia turned out with great ſpirit. Near Lexington meeting-houſe the Britiſh found the militia of that town drawn up by the road. Towards theſe they advanced, ordered them to diſperſe, huzzaed, and fired upon them; when ſeveral were killed and wounded, and the reſt diſperſed. This was the firſt ſhedding of blood in the American war.</p>
            <p>This company continuing to ſtand ſo near to the road, after they had certain notice of the advancing of the Britiſh in force, was but a too much braving of danger, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r they, were ſure to meet with inſult, or injury, which they could not repel. Bravery, when called to action. ſhould always take the ſtrong ground on the baſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh proceeded on to Concord, where they deſtroyed a part of the ſtores, while others were ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the vigilance, activity, or policy, of the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants. In the latter, a Capt. Wheeler practiſed with
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033865_0011_0FF95AE2AA09E6E0"/>ſuch addreſs, as to ſave a conſiderable quantity of flour, although expoſed to the <hi>critical examination</hi> of a Britiſh officer.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh had ſent a party to the North Bridge, while they were deſtroying the ſtores in the town. A body of militia, who had retreated beyond the bridge, and collected in this quarter, now marched up reſolutely to the bridge. The Britiſh officer, finding their firmneſs, ordered his men to fire, which they did, and two men of the militia were killed. The fire was briſkly returned; ſome were killed and wounded of the enemy, and an officer taken priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner. The Britiſh party retreated with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their main body, and the whole ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced their retreat towards Boſton; the militia galling them on all ſides. This detatchment, under the command of Col. Smith, muſt have been worn down, and the whole of them killed, or taken priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, had it not been for the reinforcement ſent out to them, under the command of Lord Percy, with two field-pieces, who joined them in the lower part of the town of Lexington.</p>
            <p>Our General, in the morning, proceeded to the Committee of Safety. From the committee, he took a croſs road to Watertown, the Britiſh being in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Lexington road. At Watertown, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome militia who had not marched, but applied for orders, he ſent them down to Cambridge, with directions to take up the planks, barricade the ſouth end of the bridge, and there to take poſt; that, in caſe the Britiſh ſhould, on their return, take that road to Boſton, their retreat might be impeded. He then puſhed to join the militia, taking a croſs road towards Lexington, in which he was joined by Dr. <hi>Joſeph Warren,</hi> (afterwards a Major-General) who kept with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:033865_0012_0FF958F9BADBB020"/>
Our General joined the militia juſt after Lord Percy had joined the Britiſh; and having aſſiſted in forming a regiment, which had been broken by the ſhot from the Britiſh field-pieces, (for the diſcharge of theſe, together with the flames and ſmoke of ſeveral buildings, to which the Britiſh, nearly at the ſame time, had ſet fire, opened a new and more terrific ſcene;) and the Britiſh having again taken up their retreat, were cloſely purſued. On deſcending from the high grounds in Menoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, on to the plain, the fire was briſk. At this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, a muſket-ball came ſo near to the head of Dr. Warren, as to <hi>ſtrike the pin out of the hair of his earlock.</hi> Soon after, the right flank of the Britiſh was expoſed to the fire of a body of militia, which had come from Roxbury, Brooklyn, Dorcheſter, &amp;c. For a few minutes the fire was briſk on both ſides; and the Britiſh had here recourſe to their field-pieces again; but they were now more familiar than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Here the militia were ſo cloſe on the rear of the Britiſh, that Dr. <hi>Downer,</hi> an active and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing man, came to ſingle combat with a Britiſh ſoldier, whom he killed with his bayonet.</p>
            <p>Not far from this place, ſeveral of the militia (among whom was Iſaac Gardner, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Brooklyn, a valuable citizen) imprudently poſted themſelves behind ſome dry caſks, at Watſon's Corner, and near to the road, unſuſpicious of the enemy's flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, which came behind them, and killed every one of them dead on the ſpot.</p>
            <p>The militia continued to hang on the rear of the Britiſh, until they reached Bunker's Hill in Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town; and it had become ſo duſk, as to render the flaſhes of the muſkets very viſible. At this inſtant, an officer on horſeback came up from the Medford road, and inquired the circumſtances of the enemy; adding, that about 700 men were cloſe behind, on
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033865_0013_0FF95AF00B0DE138"/>their way from Salem to join the militia. Had theſe arrived a few minutes ſooner, the left flank of the Britiſh muſt have been greatly expoſed, and ſuffered conſiderably; perhaps their retreat would have been cut off. As ſoon as the Britiſh gained Bunker's Hill, they immediately formed in a line oppoſite to the neck; when our General judged it expedient to order the militia, who were now at the common, to halt, and give over the purſuit, as any further attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enemy, in that poſition, would have been futile.</p>
            <p>Our General immediately aſſembled the officers around him, at the foot of Proſpect Hill, and ordered a guard to be formed, and poſted near that place, centinels to be planted down to the neck, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troles to be vigilant in moving during the night; and an immediate report to him, in caſe the enemy made any movements. The militia were then ordered to march to the town of Cambridge; where, after forming and ſending off another guard to the points below the town, the whole were ordered to lie on their arms.</p>
            <p>About midnight, there was an alarm that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy were coming up the river. It proved to be only an armed ſchooner, probably ſent to make diſcovery. She got a-ground, and continued ſo untin the next tide; and if there had been a ſingle field-piece with the militia, ſhe might have been taken. The marſh was too deep to approach ſufficiently near to do any execution with ſmall-arms; and the firſt day's hoſtilities of the ever memorable American war, was, on their part, without a ſingle piece of cannon in the field! Gen. WHITCOMB was in this day's battle.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 20th, our General ordered Capt. <hi>John Battle,</hi> of Dedham with his company of militia, to paſs over the ground which had been the ſcene of action the preceding day, and to bury ſuch of the ſlain as he ſhould find unburied. The grounds
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033865_0014_0FF9591359A70058"/>around Cambridge were immediately reconnoitred, and alarm-poſts aſſigned to the ſeveral corps; and in caſe the Britiſh ſhould come out in ſuperior force, and drive the militia from the town, they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to rally and form on the high grounds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Watertown.</p>
            <p>How to <hi>feed</hi> the aſſembled and aſſembling militia, was now the great object. All the eatables in the town of Cambridge, which could be ſpared, were collected for breakfaſt, and the college kitchen and utenſils procured for cooking. Some carcaſſes of beef and pork, prepared for the Boſton market on the 18th, at Little Cambridge, were ſent for, and obtained; and a large quantity of ſhip-bread at Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, ſaid to belong to the Britiſh navy, was taken for the militia. Theſe were the firſt proviſions which were obtained.</p>
            <p>At 11 o'clock, A. M. our General appointed Mr. <hi>Joſeph Ward,</hi> a gentleman of abilities, his Aid-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp and Secretary, (afterwards Muſter-Maſter-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of the army) who entered on the duties of his new office—This was the firſt appointment of the kind in the American army. Before noon, a letter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Committee of Supplies at Concord, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their joy at the event of the preceding day, with aſſurances that every exertion in their power ſhould be put in exerciſe, to forward ſupplies to the militia in arms. In the afternoon, Gen. WARD ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Cambridge, who, being ſenior in the order of appointment, took the command accordingly.</p>
            <p>In the battle on the 10th, the British were ſaid to have 65 killed, 180 wounded and 28 made priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; in all, 273. Of the militia, 50 were killed, and 34 wounded; in all, 84. It might have been expected, that in a retreat of ſo many miles, the Britiſh loſs would have been greater; but it is to be remembered, that as they kept the road, the fences
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033865_0015_0FF95B040BB17050"/>(a large proportion of which are ſtone walls) covered their flanks almoſt to the height of their ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. It will alſo be obſerved, that the wounded of the militia did not bear the common proportion with the killed, and is an evidence that the Britiſh did not chooſe to encumber themſelves with priſoners, either wounded or not, as the marks left at <hi>Watſon's Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and on the height above Menotomy meeting-houſe, evinced: Nor was the daſhing in of many windows, the firing of muſket-balls into the houſes, in ſome of which there were only women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or the ſoldiers leaving their ranks, and going into the houſes to plunder, (in conſequence of which a number loſt their lives) marks of humanity or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elpline. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Stedman,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the American War, vol. 1ſt, p. 119, ſays, "Several of Smith's party were ſcalped by the Americans;" than which nothing can be more untrue. Both the wounded and the dead were treated with every mark of humanity and decency.</note> Their whole force on this enterpriſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the reinforcement, was from 1500 to 2000 of their beſt troops.</p>
            <p>Gen. WARD was now the Commander in Chief of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he aſſembled army, and exerciſed the immediate command on the Cambridge ſide; while Gen. Thomas had the immediate command on the Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury ſide. A few days after this, the Cambridge camp being very numerous, and the Roxbury camp judged to be too weak, the Britiſh having gone over from Charleſtown to Boſton, Gen. Ward ordered our General, with three or four regiments, to march from Cambridge, and reinforce Gen. Thomas; and he continued in the Roxbury camp until after the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of Gen. WASHINGTON, in the month of July.</p>
            <p>In the month of May, the Provincial Congreſs paſſed reſolutions for raiſing twenty-four regiments, to ſerve during the remainder of the year. The
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033865_0016_0FF9590713242198"/>General Officers were each to have a regiment. As the new regiments began to recruit, the militia went home, and the camps became very weak; that at Roxbury did not exceed 1000 men. Had the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſallied at that time, there would have been but few to oppoſe them on that ſide. However, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſoon became ſtrong, it being reinforced by the arrival of Gen. Putnam from Connecticut, Gen. Sullivan from New-Hampſhire, and Gen. Greene from Rhode-Iſland; each with a reſpectable body of troops; and, in the month of June, it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take poſſeſſion of the heights of Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. Preparations were made for the purpoſe; and on the 16th, at night, a ſtrong detachment from the American army marched on, and broke ground on <hi>Breed's Hill,</hi> in front of Bunker's Hill. The latter ought to have been taken poſſeſſion of at the ſame time, but it was ſome how omitted.</p>
            <p>By the morning of the 17th, the troops had a redoubt and line on its left flank in good forwardneſs, when they were diſcovered by the Britiſh. The Lively man-of-war firſt began to cannonade the Americans; ſhe was ſoon ſeconded by other ſhips, floating batteries, and ſome heavy cannon on <hi>Cop's Hill,</hi> on the Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſide, which the Americans bore with a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of firmneſs, and continued at their work. The Britiſh army in Boſton were greatly alarmed at this near approach, and immediately reſolved on an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, before the works could be completed. A detachment was formed for the purpoſe, conſiſting of ten companies of Grenadiers, ten of Light Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the 5th, 38th, 43d, and 52d regiments, and a corps of Artillery under the command of Maj. Gen. Howe, and Brig. Gen. Pigot. In the afternoon they landed on Charleſtown Point without oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where they were afterwards reinforced by the 47th regiment, and firſt L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ttalion of marines. The
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033865_0017_0FF95B1405A6C700"/>regiments in Cambridge camp were ordered down to ſupport the detachment at Charleſtown, and to occupy other poſts thought to be eſſential, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous thereto. The Britiſh began their attack with a ſevere fire of artillery, and advanced in a ſlow and regular pace. The Americans who had march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on to the aid of the detachment, conſiſting of the New-Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut troops, haſtily formed a line of defence, compoſed of rails and other materials found neareſt at hand. This line extended down towards the low ground on the left, and was nobly defended. The Americans reſerved their fire until the Britiſh came very near, when they gave it to great effect; it ſtaggered, and even broke them, but they rallied, and returning to the charge again and again, drove the Americans from the lines on the left of the redoubt, and had nearly ſurrounded it, when the Americans ruſhed out of the redoubt, their ammunition being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and made their retreat, even through a part of the Britiſh forces. About this time Maj. Gen. <hi>Warren,</hi> who had been but a few days before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned, and was then on the hill as a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor only, was killed. A number of the Americans were killed in retreating from Breed's Hill, to Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Hill, and ſome in paſſing off over the neck. Perhaps there never was a better fought battle than this, all things conſidered; and too much praiſe can never be beſtowed on the conduct of Col. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Preſcott,</hi> who, notwithſtanding any thing that may have been ſaid, <hi>was the proper commanding of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,</hi> at the redoubt, and nobly acted his part as ſuch, during the whole action.</p>
            <p>Juſt before the action began, Gen. Putnam came to the redoubt, and told Col. Preſcott that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching tools muſt be ſent off, or they would be loſt; the Colonel replied, that if he ſent any of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033865_0018_0FF9591E9E394A18"/>men away with the tools, not one of them would return; to this the General anſwered, they ſhall every man return. A large party was then ſent off with the tools, and not one of them returned; in this inſtance the Colonel was the beſt judge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature.</p>
            <p>In the time of action, Col. Preſcott obſerving that the brave Gen. Warren was near the works, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtepped up to him, and aſked him if he had any orders to give him. The General replied that he had none, that he exerciſed no command there—<hi>"The command,"</hi> ſaid the General, <hi>"is yours."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While many officers and ſoldiers gallantly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed themſelves in this action, others were blamed, and ſome were brought to trial by court-martial. This was a ſore battle to the Britiſh, who did not forget it, during ſeveral campaigns, nor until a tide of ſucceſſes in their fayour had removed it from their minds. Their whole force on this day, which was in action, was ſuppoſed to be about 2,000, and their whole loſs, in killed and wounded, was ſaid to be upwards of 1,000, of whom 226 were killed, and of theſe, 19 were commiſſioned officers, including one Lieutenant-Colonel, two Majors, and ſeven Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Another account ſtated their killed and wounded to be 753 privates, 202 ſerjeants and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, and 92 commiſſioned officers; in the whole, 1047. The loſs of the Americans, in killed, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and priſoners, about 450.</p>
            <p>At the time the Britiſh made their attack, the houſes in Charleſtown were ſet on fire, and burnt moſt furiouſly, which increaſed the horrors of the ſcene. At the ſame time a furious cannonade and throwing of ſhells took place at the lines on Boſton neck, againſt Roxbury, with intent to burn that town; but although ſeveral ſhells fell among the houſes, and ſome carcaſſes near them, and balls went
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033865_0019_0FF8D46BF0978788"/>through ſome; no other damage was ſuſtained than the loſs of one man killed by a ſhot driving a ſtone from a wall againſt him.</p>
            <p>On the 15th, Congreſs appointed GEORGE WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON Commander in Chief; and on the 17th Artemas Ward, firſt Major-General—Charles Lee, ſecond Major-General—Horatio Gates, Adjutant-General, with the rank of Brigadier-General; and on the 19th, Philip Schuyler, third Major-General, and Iſrael Putnam, fourth Major-General; and on the 22d, Seth Pomeroy, firſt Brigadier-General— Richard Montgomery, ſecond do. David Wooſter, third do. William Heath, fourth do. Joſeph Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, fifth do John Thomas ſixth do. John Sullivan, ſeventh do.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on the 21ſt of June, our General received from the Provincial Congreſs, a commiſſion of Major-General. Generals Ward, Thomas, and Warren, had before received their commiſſions, the latter juſt before he was ſlain, Gen. Pomeroy declining an acceptance of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Congreſs, that Honorable Body, on the 19th of July, reſolved that Gen. Thomas be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed firſt Brigadier-General in the army of the United Colonies, in the room of Gen. Pomeroy, who never acted under the commiſſion ſent to him, and that Gen. Thomas's commiſſion bear the ſame date that Gen. Pomeroy's did; indeed this was the rank to which Gen. Thomas was entitled by former ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Congreſs now alſo appointed Joſeph Trumbull to be Commiſſary-General of ſtores and proviſions, for the army, but left the appointment of a Quarter-Maſter-General, and ſome other officers, to Gen. Waſhington, who appointed the able and very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Col. Thomas Mifflin, Quarter-Maſter-General,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033865_0020_0FF95930D29BA048"/>who did himſelf much honour, and his country ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in this important department.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the battle of Bunker Hill, the Americans began to erect works on Proſpect Hill, a very commanding height above Charleſtown com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and at ſeveral other places. Several works were alſo conſtructed at Roxbury, and the Britiſh confined to Boſton and Charleſtown, within the neck.</p>
            <p>The works now going on, both on the Cambridge and Roxbury ſide, were conſiderable, and there was a great want of engineers. Col. Gridley was chief Engineer, and was aided by his ſon. But the ſtrength of body, activity and genius of the Americans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of conſtructing with ſurpriſing diſpatch any works in which they were guided, called for many inſtructors in this department. Lieut. Col. Rufus Putnam, of Col. David Brewer's regiment, was very ſerviceable in this line, on the Roxbury ſide; as was alſo Capt. Joſiah Waters of Boſton, and Capt. Bald-win of Brookfield, (afterwards Colonel of Artificers) and others on the Cambridge ſide, and Capt. Henry Knox, who had been an officer in the Boſton Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adier Company, (and who was afterwards at the head of the American artillery, to the cloſe of the war) occaſionally lent his aid. His military genius and acquaintance with our General, led him to be importunate with Capt. Knox to join the army; nor did he need perſuaſion to join in the cauſe of his country. His removal out of Boſton, and the then ſtate of his domeſtic concerns, required ſome previous arrangement; as ſoon as this was effected, he joined the army.</p>
            <p>24th.—About noon, a heavy cannonade and throwing of ſhells from the lines on Boſton neck into Roxbury—but no damage done. Two Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican ſoldiers attempting to ſet fire to Brown's barn,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033865_0021_0FF95B4111AAF6E8"/>on Boſton neck, were killed by the Britiſh. The ſame evening two heavy cannon were brought to the work on the hill above Roxbury work-houſe.</p>
            <p>25th.—At night, an attempt was made to burn the buildings on Boſton neck; a firing took place between the parties, but the object was not effected.</p>

            <p>2d.—About two o'clock, P. M. Gen. WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, attended by ſeveral officers, arrived at the camp in Cambridge.</p>
            <p>On the morning of this day, the Britiſh cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aded briſkly from their lines on Boſton neck againſt Roxbury, and threw ſome ſhells; a carcaſs ſet fire to the houſe of Mr. Williams, the tinman, which was burnt down; by the activity of the troops, the flames were prevented from ſpreading further, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had to work in the face of a conſtant and heavy fire from the enemy.</p>
            <p>5th.—Gen. Waſhington, accompanied by Major-Gen. Lee, viſited the Roxbury camp, works, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033865_0022_0FF95949631CFF98"/>barn eſcaped the flames; a ſcattering fire at the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt continued for ſome time; a floating battery was brought up into the bay, and moored ſo as to cover the right flank of the Britiſh works on the neck.</p>
            <p>11th.—In the morning, a party of Americans drove back the Britiſh advance guard, and burns Brown's ſtore.

Greaton with 136 men, went on to Long-Iſland, and burnt the barns; the flames communicated to the houſe, and all were conſumed. An armed ſchooner, and ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral barges put off after the Americans, and ſome of the ſhips of war near the iſland, cannonaded them. The detachment made their way for the ſhore, and narrowly eſcaped being taken. One man on the ſhore who came to the aſſiſtance of the detachment, was killed: It was ſuppoſed that ſeveral of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh were killed and wounded. The ſame day ſix tranſports, appearing to be full of men, arrived in Boſton harbour.</p>
            <p>13th.—A heavy cannonade from the Britiſh, at the American workmen—but no damage done. Gen. Waſhington viſited the camp. The men were employed on the works going on upon the ſtrong rocky hill, (Col. Williams's) to the ſouth-weſt of thoſe above Roxbury work-houſe. This was one of the ſtrongeſt works which were erected.</p>
            <p>14th.—The Britiſh fired ſeveral cannon, and a Connecticut ſoldier was killed in the ſtreet, near the George tavern. The ſhot entered his body, drove it ſome diſtance, and lodged in him, in a remarkable manner.</p>
            <p>18th.—Five tranſport ſhips arrived in Boſton harbour. Freſh proviſions were very ſcarce and dear, in Boſton—mutton and veal, <hi>2ſ.</hi> per pound; freſh beef and pork a piſtareen, ſalt pork ſixpence.</p>
            <p>

M. a Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh floating-battery came up the river, within 300 yards of Sewall's Point, and fired a number of ſhot at the American works, on both ſides of the river. At the ſame time, the Britiſh, on Boſton neck, ſalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards Roxbury; drove in the American centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, ſet fire to the George tavern, and returned to their works.

They had advanced as far as Fort St. John's; but, finding that this fort would make conſiderable reſiſtance, they fell back. Schuyler returned to Albany, to hold a treaty with the Indians; and Montgomery waited for the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of his artillery, that he might reduce the forts.</p>
            <p>Some time before this, Col. Ethan Allen, of the New-Hampſhire Grants, (ſince Vermont) with a number of volunteers, took poſſeſſion of Ticondero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga.

For this purpoſe, he marched acroſs, with a body of militia; but he was met, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he got to the town, by what force the Britiſh could collect there, who attacked and defeated Allen, taking him, and a number of his party, priſoners.

The Britiſh, ſeeing the ſpirit of the Americans, although they were very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly poſted, made a precipitate retreat to their boats. Three or four Americans were wounded, one mortally. The Britiſh ſhip and floating-batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries kept up a briſk fire; but to little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>11th.—The King of England's Proclamation for ſuppreſſing rebellion (as he called it) made its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.

Bridge with his regiment was ordered to the foot of the hill, and to patrole towards the bay and neck, conſtantly, during the night. The picket at Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Hill was alſo ordered to be in readineſs to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the troops at the works, if they were attacked, and Col. Bond's regiment alſo lay on their arms; but the Britiſh did not move. Two of the Britiſh centinels came off in the night to the detachment; the whole came off at day-break; and other troops were ordered on the works, in the day time, now in good forwardneſs, and defenſible.</p>
            <p>25th.—An additional ſhip came up and took ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the ferry.

This leſſened the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſucceſs to the American army in Canada.</p>
            <p>30th.—Intelligence was received from Cape-Ann, that a veſſel from England, laden with warlike ſtores, had been taken and brought into that place.

            <p>14th, 15th, and 16th.—Approaches were carried briſkly on to Leechmore's Point, and nearly to the top of the hill.</p>
            <p>17th.—The morning was foggy. A detachment of 300 men, under the direction of Gen. Putnam, broke ground on the top of the hill, on Leechmore's Point, at a diſtance of not more than half a mile from the ſhip. Between twelve and one o'clock, the fog cleared away, and the ſhip began to cannonade the Americans, with round and grape ſhot, and ſome ſhells were thrown from Weſt-Boſton. One ſoldier was wounded, and the party driven from the works. Several cannon were fired from Cobble Hill, at the ſhip; one ſhot was ſuppoſed to have ſtruck her.</p>
            <p>18th.—Our General was ordered, with 300 men, to proſecute the work begun on Leechmore's Point. It was expected that this would have been a bloody day, and Dr. Downer, one of the ſurgeons, was ordered down with the detachment, with his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. to aſſiſt the wounded. Fortunately for the detachment, Capt. Smith of the artillery, had, in the morning, diſcharged an 18 pounder from Cobble Hill at the ſhip, which induced her to weigh anchor, and run below the ferry-way.</p>
            <p>When our General arrived nearly at the ſummit of the hill, he halted the detachment, and went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward himſelf, and took a view of the ſtate of the works, which in ſome places were but juſt begun,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033865_0031_0FF95BA85D2E3AE8"/>in others were carried half way up. He then order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the front company to move up the hill, ground their arms, and move into a part of the works aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them—and ſo on through the whole, to prevent confuſion in entering the works, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing an object to the Britiſh gunners. As ſoon as the men were placed in the works, two centinels were poſted to watch the Britiſh batteries, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, on diſcovering the diſcharge of cannon, to call out, <hi>a ſhot!</hi> The men in the works were ordered to be ſteady; on the ſignal of a ſhot, to ſettle down and remain ſo, until the ſhot had ſtruck; or if a ſhell, until it had burſt; then to riſe and proſecute the work—no man to ſtep out of his place. In a very ſhort time, a ſhot was cried by the centinels. It prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a ſhell, which fell and burſt within a few feet of a part of the workmen, throwing the dirt among them, and a piece of the ſhell hitting a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier's hat. On the ſecond diſcharge, the men fell as before; when, on riſing, two or three heavy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-ſhot ſtruck in the face of the work; the Britiſh having diſcharged the cannon in ſuch time after the mortar, as that the ſhot might take effect juſt as the men aroſe after the burſting of the ſhell: but in this they did not ſucceed; the men being ordered to keep down until both had ſtruck. Finding this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to fail, a ſhell was broke in the air, directly over the party, at 60 or 70 feet high. This alſo had as little effect upon the Americans. The fire continued until the afternoon, when it ceaſed: and it was afterwards learnt, that the commanding-officer of the Britiſh artillery, who ſtood and obſerved the effect of their fire upon the Americans, went to their General, and informed him, that from his own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, their fire had no other effect than to inure the Americans to danger, and adviſed its diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In the afternoon, Gen. Waſhington and ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033865_0032_0FF958B227DED920"/>other General Officers came on to the Point. Towards night, the detachment were ordered to move out of the works by companies, as they went in; take up their arms, move under the hill, and form the detachment; from whence it was marched to Cambridge, attended by their ſurgeon, who had been in waiting all the day, but had no occaſion to draw his inſtruments from their caſe, or a bandage or dreſſing from his box.</p>
            <p>19th.—The proſecution of the works on Leech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's Point was continued. The Britiſh cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aded and bombarded the new detachment; but to no effect. The ſame took place on the 20th. On this day, a 13 inch ſhell was thrown almoſt up to No. 2. It was probably thrown, either at the works before mentioned, or at the colleges. It did not burſt. Nearly five pounds of powder was taken out of the ſhell.</p>
            <p>22d.—The Britiſh threw one ſhell, and fired two ſhot, from Bunker's Hill in Charleſtown, at the works on Leechmore's Point. The cannonade, &amp;c. continued, on the 23d and 24th; but to no effect.</p>
            <p>28th.—A ſtrong detachment from Winter Hill marched, in the night, to ſurpriſe the Britiſh out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts in Charleſtown. They paſſed on the ſouth ſide of Cobble Hill, and were to croſs the cove on the ice. When they came to the channel, it was found to be open. A ſoldier ſlipping down on the ice, his piece accidentally went off, which cauſed an alarm, and the detachment returned.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—Intelligence was received, that there had been an action at Norfolk in Virginia, between Dunmore's army and the Virginians, to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the latter. Fifty of the regular toops were ſaid to have been killed and wounded; among the former was Capt. <hi>Fordyce,</hi> of the 14th Britiſh regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an active and good officer. The Virginians had
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033865_0033_0FF95BBDC5669180"/>not a man killed. Dunmore's force was ſuppoſed to be about 500.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 1ſt, 1776, preſented a great change in the American army. The officers and men of the new regiments were joining their reſpective corps; thoſe of the old regiments were going home by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and by thouſands. The beſt arms, ſuch as were fit for ſervice, were detained from the ſoldiers who were going home; they were to be paid for; but it created much uneaſineſs. Such a change, in the very teeth of an enemy, is a moſt delicate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvre; but the Britiſh did not attempt to take any advantage of it.</p>
            <p>8th.—It having been thought expedient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Britiſh of the houſes in Charleſtown, below Bunker's Hill, a detachment was ordered for the purpoſe. One hundred men from the Firſt Brigade, and a like number from Frye's Brigade, with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Williams, Gould and Wyman; Lieutenants Foſter, Shaw, Patterſon and Trafton, and Enſign Cheney; the whole under the command of Major Knoulton, aided by Brigade-Majors Henly and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey. The detachment marched between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, and the object was effected without the loſs of a man. Several Britiſh ſoldiers were taken priſoners. The garriſon of Bunker Hill works commenced a briſk fire down the hill, towards the houſes; but no damage was ſuſtained. There had been a number of deſerters from the Britiſh, ſince thoſe heretofore mentioned.</p>
            <p>17th.—Intelligence was received, that on the 31ſt of December, at three o'clock, A. M. Gen. Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery made an attempt to carry Quebec by aſſault. Col. Arnold had entered the lower city, and Gen. Montgomery was aſcending the barriers at the other end, when he was killed by a muſket-ball, as was his Aid-de-camp. A number of thoſe who had
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033865_0034_0FF959E61264C938"/>entered the lower city, were killed or taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the enterpriſe defeated. No account of the American loſs was at this time reported.</p>
            <p>Great addreſs and gallantry were exhibited on this expedition. The Americans aſcending Kennebeck river, croſſing the height of land, and deſcending into Canada, was an arduous undertaking. Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery was fired with a noble ardor. He had been ſucceſsful hitherto, and the reduction of the city of Quebec would have been the finiſhing ſtroke. With this he hoped to cloſe the year. To reduce the city by ſiege, would require a long time, (if not relieved) nor had he a train of artillery for the purpoſe. With this day would expire the time of ſervice of many of his troops. He therefore reſolved to attempt to carry the place by aſſault. Two real attacks were to be made on the lower city, at the oppoſite ends; one guided by himſelf, the other by Arnold; and there were to be two falſe attacks made on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per city, to divide and diſtract the enemy. Every thing was well arranged. Arnold forced his way in, was wounded, and carried away—his party fighting on. Montgomery paſſed along a very narrow deſile, next to the bank, to a barrier obſtinately deſended; and here he fell—here was an end to his attack. The other party fought on; but theſe being now the only enemy to oppoſe, the Britiſh turned their whole force to that quarter. They could not well retreat: the whole were killed, wounded, or taken priſoners. There was here barely a proſpect of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, unleſs fortune ſhould prove more favourable to merit than ſhe is wont to do. Nothing more could be done on the ſcore of gallantry. How far the attempt was a prudent one, is another queſtion. It is a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary maxim, that "fortune may fail us, but a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct never will." At the ſame time, ſome of the moſt brilliant victories have been obtained by a daring ſtroke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:033865_0035_0FF95BCF702103B0"/>
18th.—Col. Knox, of the artillery, came to camp. He brought from Ticonderoga a fine train of artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, which had been taken from the Britiſh, both cannon and mortars, and which were ordered to be ſtopped at Framingham.</p>
            <p>22d.—Several Indians came to camp from the weſtward. Intelligence was received from Canada, that the blockade of Quebec was continued, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the rebuff on the morning of the 31ſt of December.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 1ſt.—A number of Britiſh ſoldiers from Bunker's Hill, went to pulling down the tide-mill at Charleſtown. A cannon was diſcharged at them from Cobble Hill, which diſperſed them for a ſhort time, but they returned again.</p>
            <p>5th.—Three cows were feeding near the Britiſh out-poſt at Charleſtown neck. A party of the Britiſh came out, got above them, drove them to the neck, and killed them. This brought on a briſk firing at the out-poſts, and ſome cannon were diſcharged from Bunker's Hill. It was ſuppoſed that the Britiſh had one man killed, and one wounded.</p>
            <p>8th.—At night, a party of Americans, from Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hill, went down and burnt the old tide-mill in Charleſtown.</p>
            <p>14th.—In the morning, a party of Britiſh troops from the Caſtle, and another from Boſton, croſſed over to Dorcheſter neck, with intent to ſurpriſe the American guard, which they came well nigh effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the guard but juſt eſcaping them. There was but one muſket fired, on the ſide of the Americans. An old inhabitant and his ſon were taken priſoners. The Britiſh burnt the houſes on the point, and then returned.</p>
            <p>15th.—Intelligence was received from Canada, that ſome of the Britiſh garriſon of Quebec, having made a ſally, in order to get ſuel, they were driven
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033865_0036_0FF8D41196D32B90"/>back, with the loſs of twelve killed, and fifteen wounded.</p>
            <p>The heights round Boſton, <hi>except thoſe at Dorcheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> having been taken poſſeſſion of, it was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that theſe alſo ſhould be occupied; and great previous preparation was made for the purpoſe. It was imagined that ſo near an approach to the Britiſh, would induce them to make a ſally, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge the Americans. It was therefore deliberated in Council, that, in caſe the Britiſh ſhould come forth, a ſtrong detachment of Americans, from the Cambridge camp, in <hi>boats,</hi> ſhould proceed down the river, and land at the bottom of the common, in Boſton. To this our General made a moſt pointed oppoſition; alleging, that it would moſt aſſuredly produce only defeat and diſgrace to the American army; that the Britiſh General muſt be ſuppoſed to be a maſter of his profeſſion; that as ſuch, he would firſt provide for the defence of the town, in every part, which was the great depoſit of all his ſtores; that when this was done, if his troops would afford a redundancy, ſufficient for a ſally, he might attempt it; but it was to be remembered that, at any rate, the town would be defended; that it was impoſſible for troops, armed and diſciplined as the Americans then were, to be puſhed down in boats, at leaſt one mile and a half, open to the fire of all the Britiſh batteries on the weſt ſide of the town, and to their whole park of artillery, which might be drawn to the bottom of the common long before the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans could reach it, and be flanked alſo by the works on the neck; that under ſuch a tremendous fire, the troops could not effect a landing; and that he would never give his vote for it. It was however carried, that the attempt ſhould be made.</p>
            <p>18th.—It being Lord's day, after public ſervice, a proclamation from the General Aſſembly of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033865_0037_0FF95BDCA84094A8"/>for the reformation of manners, was read to the firſt diviſion by the Rev. Mr. Leonard.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—A picket of 60 men was ordered to Leech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's Point; and Col. Sargent's regiment at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's farm was ordered to be in readineſs to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, in caſe they ſhould be attacked by the Britiſh; as ſome grounds for ſuſpecting it had been diſcovered.</p>
            <p>23d.—Enſign Lyman, of Huntington's regiment, with a ſmall party, took a Corporal and two men, who were centinels at Brown's chimneys, on Boſton neck, without firing a gun. Theſe priſoners report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the heavy cannon were removed from Bunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Hill, and put on board ſhip.</p>
            <p>25th.—Some heavy cannon were mounted on the works at Leechmore's Point. The ſame day the Britiſh were buſily employed in erecting a work, a little to the north of the powder magazine in Boſton.</p>
            <p>29th.—The Britiſh threw ſome ſhells to Leech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's Point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 1ſt.—Several mortars were ſent over to Roxbury, and great preparations made to annoy the enemy. Bundles of ſcrewed hay were brought from Chelſea, to be uſed in the works.</p>
            <p>2d.—At night, a cannonade and bombardment began at the American works, on Cobble Hill and Leechmore's Point on the Cambridge ſide, and at Lamb's Dam on the Roxbury ſide, againſt the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh works; and a number of ſhells were thrown into Boſton. The Britiſh returned the fire, and threw out a number of ſhells; one of which, of 13 inches, reached Proſpect Hill. One of the American mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of 13 inches, and two of 10 inches, were burſt. They were not properly bedded, as the ground was hard frozen.</p>
            <p>4th.—There was an almoſt inceſſant roar of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and mortars during the night, on both ſides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:033865_0038_0FF95A27577FBB58"/>
The Americans took poſſeſſion of Dorcheſter heights, and nearly completed their works on both the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ls by morning. Perhaps there never was ſo much work done in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>djoining orchards were cut down to make the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battis; and a very curious and novel mode of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was added to theſe works. The hills on which they were erected were ſteep, and clear of trees and buſhes. Rows of barrels, filled with earth, were placed round the works. They preſented only the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſtrengthening the works; but the real deſign was, in caſe the enemy made an attack, to have rolled them down the hill. They would have deſcended with ſuch increaſing velocity, as muſt have thrown the aſſailants into the utmoſt confuſion, and have killed and wounded great numbers. This project was ſuggeſted by Mr. <hi>William Davis,</hi> merchant, of Boſton, to our General, who immediately communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to the Commander in Chief, who highly approved of it, as did all the other officers: But the credit of it is juſtly due to Mr. <hi>Davis,</hi> and to him the writer gives it. As the regiments at Roxbury were parading in the afternoon of this day, to march to Dorcheſter, a ſhot, from the Britiſh lines on Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton neck, carried away a thigh of Lieut. John Mayo, of Learned's regiment: he ſoon after died. One man was killed by a ſhell at Leechmore's Point, in the night.</p>
            <p>5th.—The Britiſh, it was expected, would attempt to diſlodge the Americans from Dorcheſter heights. Signals had been prepared at Roxbury meeting-houſe to mark the moment. The detachment at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge (deſigned to puſh into Boſton in the boats) was paraded, not far from No. 2, where it remained a good part of the day. But kind Heaven, which more than once ſaved the Americans when they would have deſtroyed themſelves, did not allow the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033865_0039_0FF95BEB57308600"/>ſignals to be made. About 3500 of the Britiſh troops, it was ſaid, had been ſent down to the Caſtle, with the intent to have made an attack on the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans; but, about midnight, the wind blew almoſt a hurricane from the ſouth; many windows were forced in, ſheds and fences blown down, and ſome veſſels drove on ſhore; and no attempt was made on the works. <hi>Some</hi> were ready to blame our General, for the ſentiments which he expreſſed againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Boſton, as was propoſed, in the boats, and attributed it to the want of firmneſs: But the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of every <hi>military</hi> man, ſince that time, whether <hi>American, French,</hi> or <hi>Britiſh,</hi> who have taken a view of the land and water which was to have been the ſcene of action, with the concomitant circumſtances, (as far as we have heard) hath been coincident; and thoſe who may in future review them, will for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves determine, whether the <hi>independence of ſpirit and ſentiments</hi> of our General, expreſſed on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, merited <hi>applauſe</hi> or <hi>cenſure:</hi> For himſelf, he has been frequently heard to ſay that he <hi>gloried in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the night of the 7th, Capt. Erving made his eſcape out of Boſton. He reported, that the Britiſh were preparing to leave the town; that they were putting their cannon, mortars, ſhot, ſhells, &amp;c. on board the ſtore-ſhips; that ſome of the ſhot and ſhells, ſent into the town by the Americans, had been well directed.</p>
            <p>9th.—The Americans at Dorcheſter neck opened a battery to the north-eaſt of Bird's Hill, near the water, with the intent to annoy the Britiſh ſhipping. This night a ſtrong detachment went down to open a work on Nook Hill in Dorcheſter, ſtill nearer to Boſton. Some of the men imprudently kindled a fire behind the hill, previous to the hour for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ground. The enemy diſcovered the light
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033865_0040_0FF95A41474E2DA0"/>of the fire; and there was, during the evening and night, a continual roar of cannon and mortars, from the Caſtle and lines on Boſton neck, ſouth end of that town; as well as from the Americans at Roxbury, Cobble Hill, and Leechmore's Point, at Cambridge. The ſecond ſhot from the Britiſh at the old fortification, ſouth end of the town of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, killed 4 Americans, who were ſtanding around the fire before mentioned, at Nook Hill; one of whom was Dr. Dow, of Connecticut. Another man was killed at the point next to the Caſtle. This ſuſpended the work for the night, during which more than 800 ſhot were fired.</p>
            <p>10th.—The cannonade continued. The Britiſh were putting their cannon, military ſtores, and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, on board the ſtore-ſhips and tranſports. This evening two pieces of cannon, and two ſmall mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, were carried on to Noddle's Iſland, to diſturb the Britiſh ſhipping; but the enemy being quiet at their different works, they were not moleſted from that quarter.</p>
            <p>11th.—In the evening there was a briſk cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade from the Britiſh, at the ſouth end of Boſton, and the lines on the neck.</p>
            <p>12th.—A Mr. Woodward came out of Boſton. He reported that the Britiſh were making the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt preparations to leave the town; that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of gun-carriages, ammunition-waggons, &amp;c. had been broken to pieces, and thrown off the wharves; that ſome furniture had been deſtroyed, and that many dry goods had been ſeized, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>13th.—Six regiments of the American army, viz. Greaton's, Stark's, Patterſon's, Bond's, Webb's, and the rifle regiment, were put under orders to march for New-York; of theſe our General was to take the command. A detachment of artillery was alſo ordered to march with this brigade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:033865_0041_0FF95C00D415B170"/>
On the evening of the 15th, a fire broke out in Patterſon's barracks at Cambridge, which conſumed ſix rooms, deſtroyed ſome muſket-cartridges, &amp;c. This day the rifle regiment commenced their march for New-York.</p>
            <p>17th.—In the morning the Britiſh evacuated Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; their rear guard, with ſome marks of precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. A number of cannon were left ſpiked, and two large marine mortars, which they in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to burſt. The garriſon at Bunker's Hill practiſed ſome deception to cover their retreat. They fixed ſome images, repreſenting men, in the places of their centinels, with muſkets placed on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp;c. Their immoveable poſition led to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the deception, and a detachment of the Americans marched in and took poſſeſſion. The troops on the Roxbury ſide, moved over the neck and took poſſeſſion of Boſton; as did others from Cambridge, in boats. On the Americans entering the town, the inhabitants diſcovered joy inexpreſſible. The town had been much injured in its buildings, and ſome individuals had been plundered. Some Britiſh ſtores were left. The Britiſh army went on board their tranſports below the Caſtle. A number of American adherents to them, and the Britiſh cauſe, went away with the army.</p>
            <p>18th.—The brigade deſtined for New-York, marched from the vincinity of Boſton.</p>
            <p>19th.—The Britiſh blew up Caſtle William, and burnt ſome of the barracks.</p>
            <p>20th.—The Britiſh cannonaded, from the Caſtle, the Americans on Dorcheſter neck. The ſame morning our General left Roxbury for New-York. He reached Mendon, from whence, on the ſame evening, he obſerved the light in the air of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing ſtroke of burning the barracks, &amp;c. at the Caſtle. The Britiſh deſtroyed the gun-carriages,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033865_0042_0FF95A5576D5EEF0"/>and knocked the trunnions off the cannon, and left them ſpiked. The cannon were afterwards drilled free, and mounted on a new conſtruction, in ſtocks, placed on carriages, and were thereby rendered ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>22d.—Our General reached Norwich in Connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icut. The troops marched with great expedition; but by the badneſs of the roads, the froſt then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ground, the baggage-waggons moved heavily. The tranſports, deſtined for the troops, were fitting for ſea.</p>
            <p>26th.—They fell down to New-London.</p>
            <p>27th.—The troops were marched to that place, where they embarked, and came to ſail about noon.</p>
            <p>30th.—They arrived at Twetle Bay, diſembarked, and marched into the city at noon. The tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports fell down to the city wharves, and landed the baggage, &amp;c. Gen. Thompſon and Lord Sterling, with ſome New-York and New-Jerſey troops, were in the city; and works were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing, in and around the city, on Long-Iſland, and at Horn's Hook; the command of the whole devolved on our General. The Aſia, Britiſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of-war, then lay off in the harbour, with the Lady Gage, of 20 guns; but, on the arrival of the brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade, the Aſia moved further down, juſt out of ſhot. Our General put a ſtop to the intercourſe between the inhabitants and the ſhips, which had, until then, been kept up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 2d.—Major D'Hart, of the Jerſey troops, with 200 men, about midnight, made a deſcent on a ſmall iſland in the harbour, which the Britiſh had begun to fortify; burnt a building or two, took two muſkets, ſome entrenching tools, and came off. The Aſia fired ſeveral cannon, but did no harm.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 3d, Maj. Gen. Putnam arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at New-York, to whom the command fell. About
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033865_0043_0FF95C139461B278"/>this time, a veſſel arrived from France, with a large quantity of gun-powder.</p>
            <p>7th.—A barge from one of the ſhips going near Staten-Iſland, was fired upon by the Americans: two men were killed, the barge and 8 men taken. The Britiſh cannonaded the ſhore for ſome time, and one American was wounded.</p>
            <p>9th.—Intelligence was received, that Commodore Hopkins had fallen in with the Britiſh frigate Glaſgow, a bomb brig, and two tenders, and after a ſmart engagement, took the brig and two tenders. The Glaſgow made off.</p>
            <p>10th.—Gen. Sullivan's brigade arrived from the eaſtward.</p>
            <p>12th.—There were 18 pieces of braſs cannon in the American park, at New-York, which were view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no ſmall degree of pride and wonder.</p>
            <p>13th.—In the forenoon, Gen. Waſhington arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the city, attended by Gen. Gates and ſeveral other officers.</p>
            <p>14th.—The Britiſh men-of-war were all out of the bay. The Aſia fell below the Narrows; the Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix and others went out to ſea.</p>
            <p>15th.—Four American regiments, viz. Poor's, Patterſon's, Greaton's, and Bond's, were ordered for Canada; Gen. Thompſon was to command them. Gen. Thomas had been, ſome time before, ſent from Boſton to command in Canada.</p>
            <p>17th.—Gen. Greene's brigade arrived at New-York, as did a part of Spencer's. Mrs. Waſhington arrived the ſame day in the city.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—The regiments deſtined for Canada, ſailed for Albany.</p>
            <p>26th.—Six more regiments were ordered for Canada, viz. two from the Pennſylvania line, two from the New-Jerſey, and two from the New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:033865_0044_0FF95A6BDC6D1980"/>
27th.—Our General, having been inoculated with the ſmall-pox, went to Montreſos Iſland, where he went through the operation of that diſtemper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 8th.—An expreſs arrived from Boſton, with an account, that a number of Britiſh tranſports had arrived in Nantaſket Road, with troops on board. All the American regiments at New-York were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to hold themſelves in readineſs, to march at a moment's notice. Several ſoldiers were taken down with the ſmall-pox, and ſome of them died.</p>
            <p>28th.—Our General having recovered from the ſmall-pox, which had been pretty ſevere, returned, to the city, and took the command of his brigade; and was the next day General of the day.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—A large ſhip and two tenders arrived at the Narrows. A great number of works were now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing, and in good forwardneſs. A ſtrong work was raiſed at Paulus Hook, on the Jerſey ſide of the Hudſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 4th.—A French veſſel, with Weſt-India goods, arrived in the harbour.</p>
            <p>7th.—Intelligence was received, that two Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia privateers had taken two rich Jamaicamen, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with ſugars, &amp;c. and ſome plate on board.</p>
            <p>9th.—Unfavourable news was received from Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada. The ſmall-pox, which was raging in the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican army, in that quarter, had carried off Gen. Thomas; and that Col. Beadle and Major Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, with the detachments under their command, were taken priſoners, at or near a place called <hi>The Cedars.</hi> The army in New-York was now growing ſickly; and there was not a ſufficiency of hoſpital room, or of medicines.</p>
            <p>14th.—Congreſs gave intimations, that General Howe, with the Britiſh army under his command, might be ſoon expected at New-York. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuſpected of treacherous deſigns, were ſeized and conſined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:033865_0045_0FF95C24ECF91B78"/>
15th.—Some intelligence, more favourable than the former, was received from Canada. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadians were friendly. Gen. Sullivan, who was now in that quarter, having gone from New-York, with the reinforcement heretofore mentioned, was fortifying; the enemy were advancing; but Gen. Thompſon was ſent out to oppoſe them. This, however, proved ineffectual; Thompſon was defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken priſoner. A number of Scotch troops, with Col. Campbell, had been made priſoners, near Boſton harbour.</p>
            <p>18th.—The Pennſylvania regiments, commanded by Colonels Shee and Magaw, were arriving in the city; they had the appearance of fine troops. The day before, Gen. Wooſter arrived from Canada.</p>
            <p>20th.—Gen. Gates, who was made a Major-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, was to proceed immediately to Canada, where he was to take the command.</p>
            <p>22d.—A plot was diſcovered in the city; it was to have burſt on the Commander in Chief, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The Mayor of the city was taken into cuſtody, as was a gun-ſmith; and ſome of the General's own guard, who were foreigners, were ſaid to be in the plot. The ſame day, more particulars were received from Boſton; that the troops at Boſton had driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the King's ſhips from the Lower Harbour, and taken ſeveral tranſports, with Scotch ſoldiers on board.</p>
            <p>25th.—Two deſerters came in, from the Liverpool man-of-war. They reported, that the ſleet from Halifax, with Gen. Howe's army, were hourly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to arrive at New-York. Every exertion was now in exerciſe, to complete the works, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the river. The latter was near Fort Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, and proſecuted by ſinking a number of large hulks, and frames called <hi>chevaux-de-friſe</hi> compoſed of large and long timbers framed together, with
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033865_0046_0FF95A7D165DC8C8"/>points elevated, to pierce and ſtop the way of veſſels meeting of them. Theſe were boxed at the bottom, to contain a vaſt weight of ſtones, which were put into them, and with which they ſunk. A line of theſe, and hulks, was formed acroſs the river; ſome of them ſunk very well; others, rather irregular; and ſome of the hulks, which were ſtrapped together with large timbers, ſeparated in going down. A paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was left open for veſſels to paſs through; and the Britiſh, as it was proved afterwards, found the means of knowing where it was, and of paſſing throught it.</p>
            <p>27th.—Intelligence was received, that Gen. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne had arrived in Canada, with a ſtrong rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement. The militia were called in, to reinforce the army at New-York.</p>
            <p>28th.—One Thomas Hickey, a private ſoldier in the General's guard, was executed. He was found guilty of mutiny, ſedition, and the worſt of practices, as it was expreſſed. The ſame day, the Britiſh fleet arrived at Sandy Hook.</p>
            <p>29th.—The tranſports were coming in, during the whole day. At evening, nearly 100 ſail had arrived. Col. Durkee's regiment was ordered over to Paulus Hook. The General Officers were in council.</p>
            <p>30th.—Mrs. Waſhington left the city.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 2d.—Between 10 and 11 o'clock, A. M. four Britiſh men-of-war, and ſeveral tenders, came through the Narrows, and anchored near the watering-place on Staten-Iſland. In the afternoon, they cannonaded towards the iſland. A little before ſun-ſetting, about 40 ſail of tranſports came up to the ſhips of war. The Americans lay on their arms, during the night.</p>
            <p>3d.—The Britiſh troops landed on Staten-Iſland. A part of the ſtock had been taken off. The inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, who were about 350 men, were ſuppoſed to be generally oppoſed to the revolution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:033865_0047_0FF95C392D052580"/>
9th.—At evening roll-call, the declaration of the Congreſs, declaring the United Colonies <hi>FRET, SOVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REIGN, AND INDEPENDENT STATES,</hi> was publiſhed at the head of the reſpective brigades, in camp, and received with loud huzzas.</p>
            <p>12th.—Two Britiſh ſhips of war, the Phenix and Roſe, and three tenders, at about 4 o'clock, P. M. taking the advantage of the tide and a freſh breeze, came up from the fleet, and paſſed the city up the Hudſon. A briſk cannonade took place from Red Hook, Governor's Iſland, Paulus Hook, and all the batteries on the North River ſide. The ſhips were ſeveral times ſtruck by the ſhot, but received no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial damage. The ſhips returned the fire, as they paſſed the batteries; and the encampment of our General's brigade, (the right flank of which being Col. Shepard's regiment) was on the bank of the river. The tents were ſtruck, and dropped on the ground, before the ſhips came a-breaſt of them. Several ſhot fell on the encampment, and one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the embraſure of a ſmall redoubt, on the flank of the encampment, and ſtruck in the banquette on the oppoſite ſide of the redoubt, between the legs of two ſoldiers, but did no damage. Several American artilleriſts were killed and wounded, by the burſting of ſome of our own cannon. The ſhips ran nearly up to Tappan Bay, and came to anchor.</p>
            <p>14th.—A Britiſh officer came up with a flag, with a letter to Gen. Waſhington; but the letter not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly addreſſed, it was not received. The ſame day, a flag was ſent by Lord Howe to Amboy, with ſundry letters, directed to the chief magiſtrates of ſeveral of the Colonies, and a declaration, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's pardon to ſuch Colonies, towns, or boroughs, as ſhould ſubmit to his Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:033865_0048_0FF95E4960704688"/>
16th.—Another flag came up from Lord Howe, with a letter directed to George Waſhington, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which was likewiſe rejected, for the want of a proper direction.</p>

               </gap> the morning, one or two of the Britiſh ſhips <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> through the Narrows; and it was conjectured that a number ſailed out during the night. The Britiſh ſhips which had ſailed up the Hudſon, had moved higher up. The Connecticut light-horſe, which had come out to reinforce the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, were returning home.</p>
            <p>20th.—A flag from Gen. Howe, with Adj. Gen. Patterſon, came up with a meſſage to Gen. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, reſpecting the recent capitulation in Canada, and inſinuating that Gen. Howe was deſirous, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to bring about an accommodation. The ſame day, news was received from South-Carolina, that the Britiſh, in attempting Sullivan's Iſland, with their ſhips and a large body of troops, ſaid to be from 1300 to 2000, were defeated by the Americans; one frigate burnt and blown up, ſeveral others dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, and 172 men killed and wounded. On the ſide of the Americans, 10 were ſaid to be killed, and 22 wounded.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—A man, dreſſed in women's clothes, was taken up, in attempting to get to the Britiſh fleet: he was committed to priſon. The ſame day, Gen. Sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van arrived from Canada. About noon, a number of cannon and ſmall-arms were heard towards Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abeth-Town.</p>
            <p>25th.—A row-galley or two, arrived from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut; and fire-ſhips, rafts, &amp;c. were preparing with great expedition.</p>
            <p>26th.—The Britiſh ſhips up the river fell ſome diſtance lower down.</p>
            <p>27th.—A regiment of militia, under the command of Col. Holman, arrived from Maſſachuſetts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:033865_0049_0FF95C4B898FA5A8"/>
28th.—Two row-gallies moved up the Hudſon.</p>
            <p>29th.—Col. Sargent's regiment of Continental troops arrived at Horn's Hook, from Boſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and Col. Hutchinſon's from the ſame place. Several Britiſh ſhips arrived and joined the fleet.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—Intelligence was received, that Dunmore, with his ſleet, had got nearly 200 miles up Potowmack River in Virginia; that he had burnt one houſe, and was within about 30 miles of Gen. Waſhington's ſeat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1ſt.—About 30 ſail of Britiſh ſhips arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Hook. Three or four more row-gallies went up the Hudſon. In bringing the hulks, <hi>chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux-de-friſe,</hi> &amp;c. round from the Eaſt River, to the Hudſon, a ſloop ſunk, not far from the Grand Battery.</p>
            <p>2d.—Glover's regiment arrived from the eaſtward.</p>
            <p>3d.—About noon there was a briſk cannonade up the Hudſon, between the American row-gallies and the Britiſh ſhips: the former had two men killed; two mortally, and 12 ſlightly wounded. The Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh loſs was not known.</p>
            <p>7th.—There were ſome movements among the Britiſh fleet: the men-of-war appeared to be formed in line. Two deſerters came in, who reported that an attack on the Americans was intended ſoon.</p>
            <p>8th.—A row-galley and two fire-ſloops went up the river. It was intended to attempt burning the Britiſh ſhips in Tappan Bay. The American army was now very ſickly; four ſoldiers were buried on this day, from our General's brigade only. About, and a <hi>little after</hi> this time, the army was more ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than at any other period. The newſpapers at Philadelphia and Boſton, rated the army at 70,000 ſtrong, and in high ſpirits, and that they would ſoon clear the enemy from America. This was not a little mortifying to Gen. Waſhington, who had the evidence, that the army did not exceed 40,000, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033865_0050_0FF95E55B07E9CA0"/>included; and a large portion of theſe were levics and militia, called out for ſhort periods, and unacquainted with a camp life. Hence the number of ſick amounted to near 10,000; nor was it poſſible to find proper hoſpitals or proper neceſſaries for them. In almoſt every barn, ſtable, ſhed, and even under the fences and buſhes, were the ſick to be ſeen, whoſe countenances were but an index of the dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit, and the diſtreſs they endured.</p>
            <p>9th.—It was learnt that the Britiſh were prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an attack, and were putting their heavy artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, &amp;c. on board ſhip.</p>
            <p>In reconnoitring the poſition of New-York, long before this time, all were agreed, that the upper end of the iſland, and above Kingſbridge, muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, or there could be no ſecurity to an army on the iſland; but there was ſome difference in opinion as to the place. A commanding height, near Morris's houſe, ſome diſtance below the bridge, within the iſland, was thought by ſome, among whom was Gen. Putnam, a poſition which, if properly fortified, would be almoſt impregnable. While others, among whom was our General, and his brother Gen. Greene, who were generally in ſentiment, inſiſted that there could be no ſecurity on the iſland, although the poſt before mentioned was made as ſtrong as Gibralter, if the heights above the bridge were left unfortified, as the enemy might at any time, in an hour or two, poſſeſs themſelves of thoſe heights above the bridge, and completely entrap the army; and each declared poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itively, that he would not reſt eaſy or ſatisfied, until thoſe grounds were taken poſſeſſion of. Fort Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was begun on the hill firſt mentioned, and the works were puſhed as faſt as poſſible; and it was determined to erect another fort above the bridge, which was alſo begun, and called Independence. Every exertion was now in exerciſe to complete the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033865_0051_0FF95C633959D2E0"/>works in and about the city, ſome of which were ſtrong. Indeed, immenſe labour had been beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the works at the city, on Long-Iſland, at Horn's Hook, near Hell Gate, and at Paulus Hook, on the Jerſey ſide, oppoſite the city, on Governor's Iſland, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>11th.—Our General received a commiſſion from Congreſs, dated the 9th, appointing him a Major-General in the army of the United States of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Generals Spencer, Sullivan and Green, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the ſame time, commiſſions of the ſame tenor.</p>
            <p>12th.—In the afternoon, 30 or 40 Britiſh veſſels came through the Narrows, and joined the fleet.</p>
            <p>13th.—A number more of ſhips, ſome of them very large, came in and joined the fleet: the ſhips up the river fell a little lower down.</p>
            <p>14th.—Our General rode to Horn's Hook and Kingſbridge. The perſon who had the direction of the fire-veſſels, requeſted him to be a ſpectator on the bank of the river, of an attempt, intended to be made on that night, to burn the ſhips. Attended by Gen. Clinton, and ſeveral other officers, they waited on the bank until about midnight; but no attempt on the ſhips was made, and they returned diſappointed.</p>
            <p>16th.—Our General was again requeſted to be a ſpectator on the bank of the river, the approaching night, with the moſt poſitive aſſurances that he ſhould not be again diſappointed: he accordingly went, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as on the preceding time, and took a proper poſition on the bank. The night was pretty dark; they ſoon found that the gallies and fire-veſſels were ſilently moving up, with the tide. After ſome time, and almoſt immediately after the centinels, on board the Britiſh ſhips, had paſſed the word, <hi>"all is well,"</hi> two of the fire-veſſels flaſhed into a blaze; the one, cloſe on the ſide of the Phenix, the other grappling
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033865_0052_0FF95E6E9E7666A0"/>one of the tenders. To appearance, the ſlames were againſt the ſide of the Phenix; and there was much confuſion on board. A number of cannon were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged into the fire-veſſel, in order to ſink her. A number of ſeamen aſcended, and got out on the yard-arm, ſuppoſed to clear away ſome grapplings. The fire-veſſel was along ſide, as was judged, near ten minutes, when the Phenix either cut, or ſlipt her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let fall her fore-topſail, wore round, and ſtood up the river, being immediately veiled from the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, by the darkneſs of the night. The tender burnt down to the water's edge, and was towed to the ſhore by the Americans; out of which was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, one iron ſix-pounder, two three-pounders, one two-pounder, ten ſwivels, a cabooſe, ſome gun-bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, cutlaſſes, grapplings, chains, &amp;c. The Roſe, and the other two tenders, remained at their moorings; but it was ſaid that one of the tenders was deſerted by her crew, for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ne. Several of our gallies were ſaid to have been inactive; otherwiſe, a very conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable advantage would have been reaped. The Americans ſuſtained no loſs or injury, ſaving one man, who, in communicating fire to one of the veſſels, got conſiderably burnt in the face, hands, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>17th.—The Commander in Chief, having ordered our General to take the command of the troops and poſts, at the north end of the iſland, and above Kingſbridge, within which command fell the Forts Waſhington and Independence, and a number of other works, he took the command accordingly.</p>
            <p>18th.—Very early in the morning, the wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretty freſh, and it being very rainy, the ſhips and tenders which were up the river, got under ſail, and ran down, keeping as cloſe under the eaſt bank as they could, in paſſing our works. They were, however, briſkly cannonaded at Fort Waſhington; and the works below were ſeveral times ſtruck, but
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:033865_0053_0FF95C75D29D6180"/>received no material damage. They joined their fleet near Staten-Iſland.</p>
            <p>19th.—It was made pretty certain, that the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh were upon the point of making an attack ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. By an expreſs, which our General received from Gen. Waſhington, at half paſt 2 o'clock, A. M. of the 22d, he was pleaſed to communicate, that, by intelligence which he had received, the enemy had intentions of making attacks on Long-Iſland, up the North River, upon Bergen Point, Elizabeth-Town Point, Amboy, &amp;c. Perhaps ſo many places were mentioned, in order to divide the force of, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Americans. On this morning, however, they landed, near Graveſend Bay, on Long Iſland, about 8,000 men; Col. Hand, with his rifle corps, retreating moderately before them, and deſtroying ſome wheat which would fall into their hands. The Britiſh advanced as far as Flatbuſh, where they halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Six American regiments were ſent over, as a reinforcement. Gen. Sullivan had the command on the iſland.</p>
            <p>24th.—There were ſome ſkirmiſhes on Long-Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and; but nothing very material.</p>
            <p>25th.—A number of the enemy's ſhips fell down towards the Narrows; it was ſuppoſed, with intent to land more troops on Long-Iſland.</p>
            <p>26th.—In the morning, a briſk cannonade on Long-Iſland, for ſome time. The Britiſh had thrown up ſome works, at Flatbuſh, from which they fired at the Americans.</p>
            <p>27th.—Early in the morning, two ſhips and a brig came to anchor a little above Frog Point. Our General immediately detached Col. Graham with his regiment, to prevent their landing to plunder or burn. Before he arrived, ſeveral barges full of men landed on New City Iſland, and killed a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of cattle. Two companies of the regiment, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033865_0054_0FF95E788C35CB20"/>on their arrival, ferried over to the iſland. The enemy carried off one man and 14 cattle—the remainder of the cattle were ſecured.</p>
            <p>On the ſame day, there was a moſt bloody battle on Long-Iſland, between the Americans and the Britiſh. The Britiſh, by a long circuitous march in the night of the 26th, with a part of their army, found the left of the Americans not ſo well ſecured as it ought to have been; and they had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to reach ground, which gave them great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, while it equally expoſed the Americans in the ſtrong grounds towards Flatbuſh. There was here alſo another circumſtance of ground, which now proved very diſadvantageous to the Americans. There was a conſiderable marſh, into which a creek ran, and on which there was a mill, known by the name of M'Gowen's. At the mill there was a paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way over; but unluckily, when <hi>ſome</hi> of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans had retreated by this mill, (for they were ſoon routed by the Britiſh, who formed an attack almoſt in a ſemi-circle) it was ſet on fire. This would have been a politic ſtep, had <hi>all</hi> the Americans on the other ſide, in that quarter, previouſly paſſed; but thoſe ſtill beyond the creek were now driven to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſperate circumſtances: they could not paſs at the head of the creek; for the Britiſh column, which made the circuitous movement, were in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the ground on the left; conſequently, many were here killed or taken priſoners, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers periſhed in attempting to get over the creek, ſome of them ſticking in the mud. Thoſe who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped retreated to the American works. The Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſuſtained a conſiderable loſs in killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a ſubaltern and 23 men were taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but the American loſs was far greater, in killed, wounded, and priſoners. Among the latter were Gen. Sullivan and Lord Sterling. Several field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033865_0055_0FF95C89E17BBB48"/>were alſo loſt. At evening, the Britiſh army encamped in front of the Americans.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 28th, there was a ſkirmiſh between the Americans and Britiſh, which terminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather in favour of the former. The ſame night, the Britiſh began to open works, at the diſtance of about 600 yards from the American works on the left. Gen. Waſhington wrote to our General, to ſend down to the city all the boats that could be ſpared, from Kingſbridge and Fort Waſhington; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, that he might poſſibly find it neceſſary, at night, to throw over more troops to Long-Iſland. This order was immediately complied with, and the boats ſent down; while the real intention of their uſe was fully underſtood.</p>
            <p>29th.—The ſhips in the Eaſt River fell down to Hunt's Point. On the ſame night, the Americans evacuated Long-Iſland, bringing off their military ſtores, proviſions, &amp;c. Some heavy cannon were left. In this retreat from the iſland, and which was well conducted, an inſtance of diſcipline and of true fortitude was exhibited by the American guards and pickets. In order that the Britiſh ſhould not get knowledge of the withdraw of the Americans, until their main body had embarked in the boats and puſhed off from the ſhore, (which was a matter of the higheſt importance to their ſafety) the guards were ordered to continue at their reſpective poſts, with centinels alert, as if nothing extraordinary was taking place, until the troops had embarked: they were then to come off, march briſkly to the ferry, and embark themſelves. But, ſomehow or other, the guards came off, and had got well toward the landing-place, when they were ordered to face about, march back, and re-occupy their former poſts; which they inſtantly obeyed, and continued at them, until called off to croſs the ferry. Whoever has
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:033865_0056_0FF95E86606FD158"/>ſeen troops in a ſimilar ſituation, or duly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates the human heart in ſuch trials, well know how to appreciate the conduct of theſe brave men, on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—In the forenoon, the Britiſh appeared at Newton, where they pitched a number of tents. Governor's Iſland was evacuated the preceding night by the Americans. It was now evident, that the next object of the enemy would be to get the city; and it was equally ſo, that they would land ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where on the iſland without it. This night, ſeveral of the regiments of Gen. Miſſlin's brigade, of our General's diviſion, lay on the hills towards New-York; and Gen. Clinton's brigade on their arms. The ſame evening, Hand's, Shee's, Magaw's, Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head's, and Miles's battalions, joined our General's diviſion. Some of theſe corps had ſuffered greatly, in the action on Long-Iſland.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> 1ſt.—The Britiſh appeared to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in ſeveral places on Long-Iſland. They had run a ſhip in between Nutten Iſland and Red Hook.</p>
            <p>2d.—They ran a ſhip paſt the city up the Eaſt River: ſhe was ſeveral times ſtruck by the ſhot of a 12 pounder, which was drawn to the river's bank. Major Crane, of the artillery, was wounded in the foot, by a cannon ſhot from this ſhip. It was now a queſtion, whether to defend the city, or evacuate it, and occupy the ſtrong grounds above. Every exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been made, to render the works both nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and ſtrong; and immenſe labour and expenſe had been beſtowed on them; and it was now deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that the city ſhould be obſtinately defended.</p>
            <p>4th.—Gen. Waſhington came up, and dined at our General's quarters. The ſame day, a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the artillery, with one 24 pounder, three 12 pounders, three 3 pounders, and a howitzer,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033865_0057_0FF95CA3A07D2380"/>joined the diviſion. The enemy were plundering cattle on Long-Iſland, now fully in their poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>5th.—Our General ordered a chain of videtts and centinels to be formed at Morriſſania, Hunt's and Frog's Point, &amp;c. The Britiſh were preſſing a great number of teams on Long-Iſland—their Head-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were at Bedford.</p>
            <p>7th.—The militia on Long-Iſland were ordered to muſter, to raiſe recruits for the King. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Officers of the American army were in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, at Head-Quarters in New-York. The Britiſh were now erecting a work, nearly oppoſite to our's at Horn's Hook, and the diſtance not great.</p>
            <p>8th.—The Britiſh opened their battery againſt Horn's Hook Fort. The fire was briſkly returned. The Americans had one man killed, and two wounded.</p>
            <p>9th.—In the morning there was a briſk cannonade on both ſides. At Horn's Hook, the American ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery was ſo well plied, that the Britiſh ceaſed firing. The Britiſh were ſaid to be encamped in three diviſions; one at Newton, which was Head-Quarters, one at Fluſhing, and one at Jamaica.</p>
            <p>10th.—The Britiſh landed a number of troops on Montreſors Iſland.</p>
            <p>11th.—The Britiſh continued to cannonade and bombard our fort at Horn's Hook, and to land more troops on Montreſors Iſland.</p>
            <p>12th.—The cannonade continued againſt our fort at Horn's Hook, and the Britiſh were moving their troops towards the Eaſt River. This day, Col. Ward's regiment of Connecticut troops removed from Burditt's Ferry, and joined our General's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. The General Officers were in council. A former reſolution to defend the city was reſcinded, with three diſſentients.</p>
            <p>13th.—Four Britiſh ſhips, one of which was a two-decker, ran by the city up the Eaſt River. The
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:033865_0058_0FF95E9998BF4420"/>cannonade and bombardment at Horn's Hook con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. This evening, Col. Cheſter, with five regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, joined our General's diviſion.</p>
            <p>14th.—The Britiſh ſent three or four ſhips up the North River, as far as Greenwich. The cannon and ſtores were removing from New-York, during the night.</p>
            <p>15th.—About noon, the Britiſh landed at Kepps's Bay. They met with but ſmall reſiſtance, and puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the city, of which they took poſſeſſion in the afternoon. They availed themſelves of ſome cannon and ſtores; but their booty was not very great. Here the Americans, we are ſorry to ſay, did not behave well; and here it was, as fame hath ſaid, that Gen. Waſhington threw his hat on the ground, and exclaimed, "Are theſe the men with which I am to defend America?" But ſeveral things may have weight here;—the wounds received on Long-Iſland were yet bleeding; and the officers, if not the men, knew that the city was not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Maj. Chapman was killed, and Brig. Maj. Wyllis was taken priſoner. A few others were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wounded, and taken priſoners. The Americans retreated up the iſland; and ſome few, who could not get out of the city that way, eſcaped in boats over to Paulus Hook, acroſs the river. The houſe, in the fort at Horn's Hook, was ſet on fire by a ſhell, and burnt down. The fort was afterwards abandoned.</p>
            <p>16th.—A little before noon, a ſmart ſkirmiſh hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on the heights weſt of Haarlem Plain, and ſouth of Morris's houſe, between a party of Heſſian Yagers, Britiſh Light-Infantry and Highlanders, and the American riflemen and ſome other troops, which ended in favour of the latter. The troops fought well, on both ſides, and gave great proof of their markſmanſhip. The Americans had ſeveral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers killed and wounded; among the former, Lieut.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033865_0059_0FF95CB800221A78"/>Col. Knoulton, of the Connecticut line, and Capt. Gleaſon, of Nixon's Maſſachuſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s regiment, two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent officers; and Maj. Beech, of one of the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern regiments, a brave officer, was among the latter. This ſkirmiſh might have brought on a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for both armies were then within ſupporting diſtance of the troops which were engaged.</p>
            <p>It now became an object of high importance, to calculate, if poſſible, where the Britiſh would make their next attempt; and here the General Officers were divided in opinion. A part of them imagined, that the Britiſh would firſt endeavour to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of the whole of New-York Iſland, and that, therefore, the reduction of Fort Waſhington, and its dependencies, would be their object. Others ſuppoſed, that they would make a landing either at Morriſſania, Hunt's or Frog's Point, which eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally would produce as certain a reduction of the works on the iſland, with very little lofs to the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. It was therefore determined in council, to guard againſt both; and for this purpoſe, 10,000 men were to be retained on the iſland, at and near Fort Waſhington. Our General's diviſion was to be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to 10,000 men, and a floating bridge was to be thrown acroſs Haarlem Creek, that theſe two bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies might communicate with and ſupport each other, as circumſtances might require; and Major-Gen. Greene was to command the flying camp on the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey ſide of the Hudſon, which was to conſiſt of 5,000. The different arrangements took place accordingly.</p>
            <p>17th.—The remains of Lieut. Col. Knoulton were interred with military honours. The ſame day, a troop of militia light-horſe arrived from Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut; others, and many of the militia were on their<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to join the army.</p>
            <p>18th.—Gen. Parſons's and Scott's brigades, and the brigade commanded by Col. Dudley Sargent,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:033865_0060_0FF95EA6A88A20C8"/>joined our General's diviſion; and Shee's, Magaw's, Haſlett's, Atlee's, and Broadhead's battalions were ordered away. The Britiſh army encamped between the American army and the city.</p>
            <p>A picket from our General's diviſion, of 450 men, conſtantly mounted, by relief, at Morriſſania; from which a chain of centinels, within half gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of each other, were planted, from the one ſide of the ſhore to the other, and near the water paſſage, between Morriſſania and Montreſors Iſland, which in ſome places is very narrow. The centinels on the American ſide were ordered not to preſume to fire at thoſe of the Britiſh, unleſs the latter began; but the Britiſh were ſo fond of beginning, that there was frequently a firing between them. This having been the caſe one day, and a Britiſh officer walking along the bank, on the Montreſors ſide, an American centinel, who had been exchanging ſome ſhots with a Britiſh centinel, ſeeing the officer, and concluding him to be better game, gave him a ſhot, and wounded him. He was carried up to the houſe on the iſland. An officer, with a flag, ſoon came down to the creek, and called for the American officer of the picket, and informed him, that if the American centinels fired any more the commanding-officer on the iſland would cannonade Col. Morris's houſe, in which the officers of the picket quartered. The American officer immediately ſent up to our General, to know what anſwer ſhould be returned. He was directed to inform the Britiſh officer, that the American centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels had always been inſtructed not to fire on <hi>centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,</hi> unleſs they were firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>red upon, and then to return the fire; that ſuch would be their conduct: as to the cannonading of Col. Morris's houſe, they might act their pleaſure. The firing ceaſed for ſome time; but a raw Scotch centinel, having been planted, one day, he very ſoon after diſcharged his piece at an
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:033865_0061_0FF95CCD6A8F0118"/>American centinel, neareſt to him, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately returned; upon which a Britiſh officer came down, and called to the American officers, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that he thought there was to be no firing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the centinels. He was anſwered, that their own began; upon which he replied, "He ſhall then pay for it." The centinel was directly after relieved, and there was no firing between the centinels, at that place, any more; and they were ſo civil to each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on their poſts, that one day, at a part of the creek where it was practicable, the Britiſh centinel aſked the American, who was nearly oppoſite to him, if he could give him a chew of tobacco: the latter, having in his pocket a piece of a thick twiſted roll, ſent it acroſs the creek, to the Britiſh centinel, who, after taking off his bite, ſent the remainder back again.</p>
            <p>20th—The Commander in Chief, Maj. Gen. Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, and ſome other officers, came up to our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral's diviſion, and rode round the camp, which, by the return. given in on the next day, conſiſted of 8,771; but of theſe there was 1,294 ſick preſent, and 1,108 ſick abſent.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 21ſt, between one and two o'clock, the light of a great fire was diſcovered to the ſouthward, which proved to be at New-York; when a conſiderable part of the city was conſumed.</p>
            <p>22d.—Two ſeamen, belonging to the La Brune, a Britiſh ſhip of war, which lay near Montreſors Iſland, deſerted, and came to our General's quarters; and informed him, upon examination, that the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh had then but a few men on the iſland, ſtating the number; that the piece of cannon, which had been put on the iſland, was taken back again, on board the La Brune; that there were a number of officers at the houſe, in which there was a conſiderable quantity of baggage depoſited, &amp;c. Our General ſuppoſed that theſe troops might be eaſily taken;
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033865_0062_0FF95EB94F5FB310"/>and, having called the General Officers of his diviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion together, took their opinion, who all coincided with him in ſentiment. He then communicated his intention to the Commander in Chief, who gave it his approbation. Two hundred and forty men were deſtined for this enterpriſe: the command was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Lieut. Col. Michael Jackſon, of the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts line, with Majors Logan and—, whoſe name cannot be recollected, of the New-York troops, They were to embark on board three flat-boats, cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by a fourth with a detachment of artillery, with a light three-pounder, in caſe it ſhould be found nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary in retreating from the iſland. The mode of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack was ſettled, and every circumſtance ſecured, to promiſe ſucceſs. They were to fall down Haarlem Creek with the ebb. The time was ſo calculated, that the young flood was to be ſo much made, at the break of day, as to cover the flats at the iſland, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for the boats to float. Matters being thus ſettled, our General ordered the two ſailors to be brought in: he then told them, that in conſequence of their information, an enterpriſe againſt the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh troops on Montreſors Iſland, was to take place that night; that he had ordered them to be kept in ſafe cuſtody until the next morning, when, if their declarations reſpecting the ſtate of the Britiſh on the iſland, proved to be true, he would give them a paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the back country, whither they wiſhed to go: but, in caſe their information was falſe, he would or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them hanged immediately, as ſpies; that he gave them the opportunity, if they had made a wrong ſtatement to him, then to correct it. They both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, with perfect compoſure, that they would cheerfully ſubmit to the condition. Major Thomas Henly was now one of our General's Aids-de-camp. He importuned that he might go with the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was refuſed, and told that he had no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:033865_0063_0FF95CE31A315668"/>there; that he could exerciſe no command. He grew quite impatient, returned again to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral's room, and addreſſed him: "Pray, Sir, conſent to my going with the party—let me have the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of introducing the priſoners to you to-morrow." All his friends preſent adviſed him not to go. The General finally conſented. The troops, at the hour aſſigned, embarked. Our General informed them, that he, with others, would be ſpectators of the ſcene, from a certain point near Haarlem Creek. Notice had been given to the guards and pickets on the <hi>York Iſland</hi> ſide, not to hail the party as they went down. Unfortunately, the lower centinel had not been ſo inſtructed. He was nearly oppoſite to the point where our General was to be; and juſt at the inſtant when he arrived, had challenged the boats, and ordered them to come to the ſhore. From the boats they anſwered, "Lo! we are friends." The challenge was repeated. The anſwer was, "We tell you we are friends—hold your tongue." A bounce into the water was heard; and inſtantly Maj. Henly came wading to the ſhore, ſtepped up to our General, catched him by the hand, and ſaid, "Sir, will it do?" Our General, holding him by the hand, replied, "I ſee nothing to the contrary;" to which Henly concluded by ſaying, <hi>"Then it ſhall do."</hi> He waded back to his boat, and got in. The centinel called again: "If you don't come to the ſhore, I tell you I'll fire." A voice from ſome one in the boats, was, <hi>"Pull away!"</hi> The boats went on, and the centinel fired his piece. The boats reached the iſland almoſt at the moment intended, juſt as the glimmer of the dawn was diſcoverable. The three field-officers were in the firſt boats. Their intention, on the moment of landing, was, for the two ſeconds in command to ſpring, the one to the right, and the other to the left, and lead on the troops from the other
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033865_0064_0FF95EC744B56220"/>two boats, which were to land on each ſide of the firſt boat. The field officers landed, and the men from their boat. The enemy's guard charged them, but were inſtantly driven back. The men in the other two boats, inſtead of landing, lay upon their oars. The Britiſh, ſeeing this, returned warmly to the charge. The Americans, finding themſelves thus deſerted, returned to their boat; but not until Lieut. Col. Jackſon received a muſket-ball in his leg, and Maj. Henly, as he was getting into the boat, one through his heart, which put an inſtant end to his life. The boat joined the others, and they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, having, in the whole, about 14 killed, wounded, and miſling; Maj. Henly deeply regretted. Had only one of the other boats landed her men, the ſucceſs would have been very probable; but the two would have inſured an execution of the whole plan, in the opinion of all concerned. The delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents in the other boats were arreſted, and tried by court-martial, and one of the Captains caſhiered.</p>
            <p>On the night of the 23d, the Britiſh got poſſeſſion of the works at Paulus Hook. The americans had previouſly taken off all the cannon and ſtores. On the afternoon of the 24th, the remains of Maj. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were interred by the ſide of Lieut. Col. Knoulton, on New York Iſland, with military honours.</p>
            <p>25th.—The militia, which had come out from the weſtern parts of the State of Connecticut, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>

            <p>28th.—Seven recruits for Maj. Rogers's corps, raiſing for Britiſh ſervice, were taken, going to Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iſland, and ſent in.</p>
            <p>29th.—There was an unuſual movement of boats from Long-Iſland to Montreſors Iſland, and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack was ſoon expected.</p>
            <p>30th.—The moving over of boats to Montreſors Iſland continued. The ſame day, a frigate went through Hell Gate, and came to anchor about 10 o'clock, A.M. near the La Brune. At 12 o'clock, ſhe came to ſail, and ſtood to the eaſtward. Juſt at even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another ſhip came up; and the next morning,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> I ſt, was at anchor in the channel, between Haarlem and Baman's or Eldridge's Iſland.</p>
            <p>3d.—The Brigadier-Generals of our General's diviſion were in council, and ſeveral new works were laid out; among others, a redoubt on the hill above <hi>Williams's Bridge.</hi> Our General, in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitring his poſition, accompanied by Col. <hi>Hand,</hi> below the camp of the rifle corps, being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that the Britiſh might land on Frog's Neck, took a view of the cauſeway between Weſt-Cheſter and the point. Upon the neck, which runs between theſe two, is a tide-mill; and a plank bridge at the mill, at the weſt end of the cauſeway, (the ſide of the American army) was at this time a range of cord-wood, as advantageouſly ſituated to cover a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to defend the paſs, as if conſtructed for the very purpoſe. After taking a full view, our General di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Col. Hand, immediately upon his return to his camp, to fix upon one of the beſt ſubaltern officers, and 25 picked men of his corps, and aſſign them to this paſs, as their alarm-poſt at all times; and, in caſe the enemy made a landing on Frog's Neck, to direct
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033865_0066_0FF95ED2A1EA7AD8"/>this offcer immediately to take up the planks of the bridge; to have every thing in readineſs to ſet the mill on fire; but not to do it, unleſs the fire of the riflemen ſhould appear inſufficient to check the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the enemy on to the cauſeway; to aſlign another party to the head of the creek; to reinforce both, in caſe the enemy landed; and that he ſhould be ſupported. Col. Hand made his arrangements accordingly.</p>
            <p>4th.—The brig and tenders in the Eaſt River came down, and caſt anchor near the La Brune frigate; and the Roebuck and Phenix ſailed up the North River, and joined the other ſhips which lay at anchor there.</p>
            <p>5th.—There were ſome movements among the Britiſh; and a party appeared to be very buſy at work, a little below Haarlem. The ſame night, the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans left the heights of Bergen. They were upwards of 2,000 ſtrong. They retreated as far back as Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditt's Ferry.</p>
            <p>6th.—Orders were given for throwing up a new work on Haarlem Creek, below the wood at Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſania.</p>
            <p>7th.—Gen. <hi>Lincoln</hi> came to camp. He had come from Maſſachuſetts with a body of militia. This was the firſt of his joining the main army. The ſame day, the Britiſh were putting over horſes from Horn's Hook to Long-Iſland, and fixing their pontoons.</p>
            <p>9th.—Early in the morning, three ſhips, two of 40 guns, and one frigate, with two or three tenders, ſtood up the North River. They were briſkly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonaded from Fort Waſhington and Fort Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They however paſſed our works and the <hi>chevaux-de-friſe;</hi> the American galleys, ſmall craſt, and two large ſhips ſtanding on before them. The two ſhips were ran on ſhore near Phillips's mills,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:033865_0067_0FF95D0E534CF2D0"/>and two of the galleys near Dobb's Ferry. The enemy took poſſeſſion of the two galleys, and got them off. A boat landed a number of men, who plundered a ſtore, ſtove the caſks, and then ſet the ſtore on fire, and left it. The Americans ſoon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the fire.</p>
            <p>Our General ordered Col. Sargent, with 500 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, 40 light-horſe, Capt. Horton of the artillery, with two 12 pounders, and Capt. Crafts with a how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itzer, to march immediately, with all poſſible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to Dobb's Ferry. The enemy took a ſchooner loaded with rum, ſugar, wine, &amp;c. and ſunk a ſloop, which had on board the machine, invented by, and under the direction of, a Mr. <hi>Buſhnell,</hi> intended to blow up the Britiſh ſhips. This machine was worked under water. It conveyed a magazine of powder, which was to be fixed under the keel of a ſhip, then freed from the machine, and left with clock-work going, which was to produce fire when the machine had got out of the way. Mr. Buſhnell had great confidence of its ſucceſs, and had made ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments which ſeemed to give him countenance; but its fate was truly a contraſt to its deſign.</p>
            <p>Our Gencral's diviſion was formed in line, with its advance, reſerve flank-guards, and artillery, all in order of battle, when they were moved down over the different grounds, which it was ſuppoſed might be the ſcene of action. Some of this ground was very broken, and there were many fences. Theſe afforded frequent opportunities for the troops to break off and form; for the pioneers to open ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, &amp;c. and for the whole to become acquainted with every part of the ground, and the beſt choice of it, if ſuddenly called to action.</p>
            <p>10th.—One of the ſhips which was ran a-ground, was got off by the Americans. Col. Sargent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

11th.—There was a conſiderable movement among the Britiſh boats below. This afternoon, Gen. Waſhington's pleaſure-boat, coming down the river with a freſh breeze, and a topſail hoiſted, was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by the artilleriſts at Mount Waſhington, to be one of the Britiſh tenders running down. A 12 pounder was diſcharged at her, which was ſo exactly pointed, as unfortunately to kill three Americans, who were much lamented. The ſame day, ſeveral of Gen. Lincoln's regiments arrived, two of which were poſted on the North River.</p>
            <p>12th.—Early in the morning, 80 or 90 Britiſh boats, full of men, ſtood up the ſound, from Montre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors Iſland, Long-Iſland, &amp;c. The troops landed at Frog's Neck, and their advance puſhed towards the cauſeway and bridge, at Weſt Cheſter mill. Col. Hand's riflemen took up the planks of the bridge, as had been directed, and commenced a fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their rifles. The Britiſh moved towards the head of the creek, but found here alſo the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans in poſſeſſion of the paſs. Our General imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately (as he had aſſured Col. Hand he would do) ordered Col. Preicott, the hero of Bunker Hill, with his regiment, and Capt. Lieut. Bryant of the artil. lery, with a 3 pounder, to reinforce the riflement at Weſt-Cheſter cauſeway; and Col. Graham of the New-York line, with his regiment, and Lieut. Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the artillery, with a 6 pounder, to reinforce at the head of the creek; all of which was promptly done, to the check and diſappointment of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy. The Britiſh encamped on the neck. The riflemen and Yagers kept up a ſcattering popping at each other acroſs the marſh; and the Americans on their ſide, and the Britiſh on the other, threw up a work at the end of the cauſeway. Capt. Bryant, now and then, when there was an object, ſaluted the Britiſh with a field-piece.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:033865_0069_0FF95D1FE8E0DFD0"/>
In the afternoon, 40 or 50 ſail of veſſels paſſed up, and came to anchor off Frog's Point. The ſame evening, Gen. M'Dougal's brigade joined our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral's diviſion.</p>
            <p>13th.—The brigade, formerly under the command of our General, when he was Brigadier, joined his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. The diviſion now became very ſtrong. The General Officers of the army were this day in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, at our General's Quarters.</p>
            <p>14th.—Our General, with the Generals under his command, reconnoitred the enemy at Frog's Neck; afterwards, the General Officers of the army recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitred the various grounds. The ſame day, Maj. Gen. Lee was ordered to the command of the troops above Kingſbridge, now become the largeſt part of the American army. But Gen. Waſhington had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him not to exerciſe the command for a day or two, until he could make himſelf acquainted with the poſt, its circumſtances, and arrangements of duty. A great number of ſloops, boats, &amp;c. were paſſing the ſound eaſtward, juſt at duſk—probably convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ammunition, proviſions, &amp;c. to the troops at Frog's Point.</p>
            <p>15th.—Five ſailors came off from the La Brune. They informed, that there was a large body of the Britiſh on Frog's Point, and that an attack might be ſoon expected. The ſcattering fire acroſs the marſh continued, and now and then a man was killed.</p>
            <p>16th.—Two works were diſcovered on Frog's Neck, nearly finiſhed. The General Officers of the army rode to reconnoitre the ground at <hi>Pell's Neck,</hi> &amp;c. and it was determined that the poſition of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican army ſhould be immediately changed; the left flank to be extended more northerly, to prevent its being turned by the Britiſh.</p>
            <p>17th.—Wadſworth's and Fellows's brigades, came to Kingſbridge. The Britiſh ſhipping, &amp;c. contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued moving eaſtward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:033865_0070_0FF95EF3AFA33890"/>
18th.—The regiment at Weſt-Cheſter cauſeway had been relieved by another. The officer on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand there, this morning, ſent up an expreſs to our General, informing him that the Britiſh were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an embraſure in their work at the end of the cauſeway, and that he apprehended they intended, under a cannonade from this, to attempt to paſs. Our General ordered one of his Aids to gallop his horſe to the officer commanding the brigade, near Volentine's, the neareſt to Weſt-Cheſter, and order him to form his brigade inſtantly. Arriving, himſelf, by the time the brigade was formed, he ordered the officer to march, with the utmoſt expedition, to the head of the cauſeway, to reinforce the troops there; himſelf moving on with them. When the troops had advanced to about half the way between the head of the creek, and the poſt at the head of the cauſeway, another expreſs met him, informing him that the whole Britiſh army were in motion, and ſeemed to be moving towards the paſs at the head of the creek. Upon this, the brigade was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to halt, the whole to prime and load, and the rear regiment to file off by the left, and march briſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reinforce the Americans at the paſs, at the head of the creek. At this inſtant, Gen. Waſhington came up, and having inquired of our General, the ſtate of things, ordered him to return immediately, and have his diviſion formed ready for action, and to take ſuch a poſition as might appear beſt calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to oppoſe the enemy, ſhould they attempt to land another body of troops <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ia, which he thought not improbable. Our General immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately obeyed the order</p>
            <p>The wind was now freſh at ſouth-weſt. The Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh croſſed to the other ſide of Frog's Neck, embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on board their boats, croſſed over the cove, land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Pell's Neck, and moved briſkly upward.
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:033865_0071_0FF95D39CDD2F0C0"/>Three or four of the American regiments advanced towards them, and took a good poſition behind a ſtone fence. When the Britiſh had advanced ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently near, they gave them a pretty cloſe fire, which checked them, and even obliged them to fall back; but being immediately ſupported, they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vigorouſly to the charge. The action was ſharp, for a ſhort time; but the Americans were ſoon obliged to give way to ſuperior force. <hi>Shepard's, Read's, Baldwin's,</hi> and <hi>Glover's</hi> regiments, had the principal ſhare in this action. The Americans had between 30 and 40 men killed and wounded; among the latter, Col. Shepard, in the throat, not mortally, although the ball came well nigh effecting inſtant death. The loſs of the Britiſh was not known, but muſt have been conſiderable. They advanced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to New Rochelle, and halted. The American army extended its left.</p>
            <p>A number of boats went down towards New-York. It now became neceſſary, immediately to quit the poſition in the neighbourhood of Kingſbridge, the Britiſh being in the rear of the left of our army; and it is not a little unaccountable, that they did not attempt to ſtretch themſelves acroſs to the Hudſon, which might have been done with great caſe. They only moved higher up, on the other ſide of the little rivulet <hi>Brunx,</hi> which was generally fordable. The White Plains were fixed upon for the next poſition of the American army. A ſtrong garriſon was to be left at Fort Waſhington, and our General was to leave one of his reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>nts, to garriſon Fort Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—At about 4 o'clock, P. M. our General's diviſion moved from above Kingſbridge, having, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their light field-pieces, two heavy iron twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders. About 8 o'clock in the evening, they pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> Gen. Lincoln's quarters, on Volentine's Hill,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033865_0072_0FF95F040F435170"/>where the Commander in Chief was to ſpend the night. Our General waited upon him, to know if he had any particular commands for him. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief only adviſed to ſend forward one of his regiments, to occupy the road coming from <hi>Ward's Bridge,</hi> nearly to whoſe farm the Britiſh had now advanced; leſt, appriſed of his moving, they ſhould annoy his right flank, which, if it had been day-light, would have been open to their view: But before the column reached this croſs road, it was learnt, that Col. Jonathan Brewer's regiment of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, who were pretty ſtrong, and well armed, were to paſs the night at the entrance of the road, leading to the bridge before mentioned. The diviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion reached Chaderton's Hill, to the ſouth of White Plains, at 4 o'clock in the morning of the 22d, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marched all night. The inſtant our General aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the hill, he noticed, to appearance, many flaſhes, reſembling the flaſh of the pan of a muſket, on the other ſide of the lot; on which he immediately ordered a Captain, with a party, to diſcover what it was; who returned, that he could not make diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of any thing. Theſe were indeed the ſlaſhes of diſcharged muſkets at ſome diſtance; the height of ground having decoyed the appearance of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Lord Sterling, who was before in this vicin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity with his brigade, had formed an enterpriſe againſt Maj. Rogers's corps. The old Indian hunter in the laſt French war, who had now engaged in the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſervice, with his corps, now lay on the out-poſt of the Britiſh army, near Marroneck. The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was conducted with good addreſs; and if the Americans had known exactly how Rogers's corps lay, they would probably have killed or taken the whole. As it was, 36 priſoners, 60 muſkets, and ſome other articles, were taken. The Major, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to his former general conduct, eſcaped
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033865_0073_0FF8D510EEA306A0"/>with the reſt of his corps. This was a pretty affair; and if the writer could recollect the name of the commanding-officer, with pride and pleaſure he would inſert it. He belonged to one of the ſouthern lines of the army; and the whole of the party were ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern troops.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, our General moved his diviſion, and took poſt on the high ſtrong ground, to the north of the court-houſe. Gen. Sullivan's diviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion reached the Plains in the courſe of the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night. In the poſition of White Plains, our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral's diviſion was on the left of the line. On his left was a deep hollow, through which ran a ſmall brook, which came from a mill-pond, a little above. On the eaſt ſide of this hollow was a very commanding ground, which would enſilade the diviſion. The top of this high ground was covered with wood. To this hill he ordered Col. Malcolm, with his regiment of New-York troops, and Lieut. Fenno of the artillery, with a field-piece, directing them to take poſt in the ſkirt of the wood, at the ſouth brow of the hill. The ground, from our General's left to the right, deſcended gradually a very conſiderable diſtance, and then gradually aſcended up to the plain, and ſtill on to the right, to more commanding ground. On this was the American army formed, the line running nearly from north-eaſt to ſouth-weſt. There were ſome ſtrong works thrown up on the plain, acroſs the road, and ſtill to the right of it. Chaderton's Hill was a little advanced of the line, and ſeparated from it by the little rivulet Brunx. A body of the Americans were poſted on this hill. Head-Quarters were on the plain, near the croſs roads. Our General's diviſion had only ſlight works for muſketry.</p>
            <p>23d.—A cannonade was heard towards the Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The ſame evening, Col. Tyler's, Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:033865_0074_0FF95F12A64AA0A8"/>and Throop's regiments, of General Parſons's brigade, and of our General's diviſion, moved, and took poſt at the head of King-ſtreet, near Rye Pond. Gen. Lee's diviſion had not yet got up to the army.</p>
            <p>24th.—At 5 o'clock, A. M. a firing of ſmall-arms was heard to the ſouthward. It was a ſkirmiſh between 200 men of Gen. Lee's diviſion, and 250 Heſſians—10 of the latter were killed, and two taken priſoners. The Britiſh continued moving up, but with great caution, their rear ſcarcely advancing, when they came to encamp again, much further than where the advance had moved from—they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in two columns.</p>
            <p>25th.—Eight American regiments were ordered to be ready to march in the approaching night. Gen. Putnam was to command them; and they were intended to make an attack on the enemy's advance, if it ſhould appear to be practicable. The ſame morning, one 12 pounder at Dobb's Ferry drove the Britiſh man-of-war off that place from her ſtation.</p>
            <p>26th.—Gen. Lee's diviſion joined the army. In aſcending ſome of the hills on the road, this diviſion, encumbered with many waggons, was obliged to halt, and double the teams, in open view of the Britiſh, and at no conſiderable diſtance, who did not attempt to diſturb them; which, had they done, the loſs of the cannon, wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gons, &amp;c. could not have been avoided. The troops would have bent their march unencumbered towards the Hudſon; but the waggons, &amp;c. muſt have been left. Two or three Britiſh ſoldiers and a Heſſian were taken priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and ſent in.</p>
            <p>27th.—In the forenoon, a heavy cannonade was heard towards Fort Waſhington. Thirteen Heſſians and two or three Britiſh ſoldiers were ſent in on this day. From the American camp to the weſt-ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033865_0075_0FF95D5B8EAF1438"/>there appeared to be a very commanding height, worthy of artention. The Commander in Chief or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the General Officers who were off duty, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him to reconnoitre this ground, on this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When arrived at the ground, although very commanding, it did not appear ſo much ſo, as other grounds to the north, and almoſt parallel with the left of the army, as it was then formed. "Yonder," ſays Major-Gen. Lee, pointing to the grounds juſt mentioned, "is the ground we ought to occupy." "Let us then go and view it," replied the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief. When on the way, a light-horſeman came up in full gallop, his horſe almoſt out of breath, and addreſſed Gen. Waſhington—"The Britiſh are on the camp, Sir." The General obſerved—"Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, we have now other buſineſs than reconnoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring," putting his horſe in full gallop for the camp, and followdd by the other officers. When arrived at Head-Quarters, the Adjutant-General [Read,] who had remained at camp, informed the Commander in Chief, that the guards had been all beat in, and the whole American army were now at their reſpective poſts, in order of battle. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief turned round to the officers, and only ſaid, "Gentlemen, you will repair to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective poſts, and do the beſt you can." Our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, on arriving at his own diviſion, found them all in the lines; and, from the height of his poſt, found that the firſt attack was directed againſt the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans on Chaderton's Hill. The little river Brunx, which ran between the American right and this hill, after running round its north ſide, turned and ran down on the eaſt and fouth-eaſt. The Britiſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in two columns. At this inſtant, the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade was briſk on both ſides; directed by the Britiſh acroſs the hollow and Brunx, againſt the Americans on the hill, and by them returned. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:033865_0076_0FF95D67CD5FC078"/>at the ſame inſtant, the right column, compoſed of Britiſh troops, preceded by about 20 light-horſe in full gallop, and brandiſhing their ſwords, appeared on the road leading to the court-houſe, and now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in the front of our General's diviſion. The light-horſe leaped the fence of a wheat-field, at the foot of the hill, on which Col. Malcolm's regiment was poſted; of which the light-horſe were not aware, until a ſhot from Lieut. Fenno's field-piece gave them notice, by ſtriking in the midſt of them, and a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pitching from his horſe. They then wheeled ſhort about, galloped out of the field as faſt as they came in, rode behind a little hill in the road, and faced about; the tops of their caps only being viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our General, where he ſtood. The column came no further up the road, but wheeled to the left by platoons, as they came up; and, paſſing through a bar, or gateway, directed their head towards the troops on Chaderton's Hill, now engaged. When the head of the column had got nearly acroſs the lot, their front got out of ſight; nor could the extent of their rear be now diſcovered. The ſun ſhone bright, their arms glittered, and perhaps troops never were ſhewn to more advantage, than theſe now appeared. The whole now halted; and for a few minutes, the men all ſat down in the ſame order in which they ſtood, no one appearing to move out of his place. The cannonade continued briſk acroſs the Brunx. A part of the left column, compoſed of Britiſh and Heſſians, forded the river, and marched along under the cover of the hill, until they had gained ſufficient ground to the left of the Americans; when, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the left, their column became a line, parallel with the Americans. When they briſkly aſcended the hill, the firſt column reſumed a quick march. As the troops, which were advancing to the attack, aſcended the hill, the cannonade on the ſide of the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:033865_0077_0FF95D838913F980"/>Britiſh ceaſed; as their own men became expoſed to their fire, if continued. The ſire of ſinall-arms was now very heavy, and without any diſtinction of ſounds. This led ſome American officers, who were looking on, to obſerve that the Britiſh were worſted, as their cannon had ceaſed firing; but a few minutes evinced that the Americans were giving way. They moved off the hill in a great body, neither running, nor obſerving the beſt order. The Britiſh aſcended the hill very ſlowly; and when arrived at its ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, formed and dreſſed their line, without the leaſt attempt to purſue the Americans. The loſs on the ſide of the Americans was inconſiderable; that of the Britiſh was not then known. The Britiſh hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got poſſeſſion of this hill, it gave them a vaſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the American lines, almoſt down to the centre.</p>
            <p>29th.—The Britiſh began to throw up ſome ſmall works on the hill, of which they had got poſſeſſion. The Americans were drawing back; and a poſition was to be taken on the high ſtrong grounds, before in the rear of a part of the army. The left of our General's diviſion was not to move; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his diviſion, and all the other diviſions of the army, were to fall back and form, nearly eaſt and weſt. About this time, Col. Laſher, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to our General's diviſion, (and who had been left with his regiment to garriſon Fort Independence, near Kingſbridge) ſent an expreſs, who paſſed the enemy in the night, to know what he ſhould do, the regiment growing weak and ſickly. Our General applied to the Commander in Chief, to know his pleaſure, who directed, that the Colonel ſhould give notice to Col. Magaw, who commanded at Fort Waſhington, that he might take away the cannon, ſtores, &amp;c. and that Col. Laſher, after deſtroying the barracks, huts, &amp;c. ſhould join the army, which he
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:033865_0078_0FF95F24098FC8D0"/>ſoon effected. This day, 3 priſoners were ſent in; and the Americans were now throwing up ſome ſtrong works on the high grounds.</p>
            <p>30th.—The Britiſh remained upon the ground they had taken.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—The Britiſh continued as before, throwing up a work, &amp;c. At night, the Americans evacuated their works on the plain, near late Head-Quarters, ſetting fire to ſeveral barns, and one houſe, which contained forage, and ſome ſtores that could not be removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> 1ſt.—In the morning, the Britiſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with a number of field-pieces, to the north of the road, near late Head-Quarters, (a heavy col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umn appearing behind on the hill, ready to move forward) and commenced a furious cannonade on our General's diviſion, which was nobly returned by Capt. Lieut. Bryant and Lieut. Jackſon, of the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. Our General's firſt anxiety, was for Col. Malcolm's regiment on the hill, to the eaſt of the hollow on the left, leſt the enemy ſhould puſh a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umn into the hollow, and cut the regiment off from the diviſion. He therefore ordered Maj. Keith, one of his Aids, to gallop over, and order Col. Malcolm to come off immediately, with Lieut. Fenno's artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery: But, upon a more critical view of the ground in the hollow, (at the head of which there was a heavy ſtone wall, well ſituated to cover a body of troops to throw a heavy fire directly down it, while an oblique fire could be thrown in on both ſides) he ordered Maj. Pollard, his other aid, to gallop after Keith, and countermand the firſt order, and direct the Colonel to remain at his poſt, and he ſhould be ſupported. A ſtrong regiment was ordered to the head of the hollow, to occupy the wall. The can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade was briſk on both ſides, through which the two Aids-de-camp paſſed. in going and returning.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:033865_0079_0FF95D917660B720"/>At this inſtant, Gen. Waſhington rode up to the hill. His firſt queſtion to our General, was, "How is your diviſion?" He was anſwered, "They are all in order." "Have you," ſaid the Commander in Chief, "any troops on the hill over the hollow?" He was anſwered, "Malcolm's regiment is there." "If you do not call them off immediately," ſays the General, "you may loſe them, if the enemy puſh a column up the hollow." He was anſwered, that even in that caſe, their retreat ſhould be made ſafe; that a ſtrong regiment was poſted at the head of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, behind the wall; that this regiment, with the oblique fire of the diviſion, would ſo check the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as to allow Malcolm to make a ſafe retreat. The Commander in Chief concluded by ſaying. "Take care that you do not loſe them." The artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of the diviſion was ſo well directed, as to throw the Britiſh artillery-men ſeveral times into confuſion; and finding that they could not here make any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, drew back their pieces, the column not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing. The Britiſh artillery now made a circuitous movement, and came down toward the American right. Here, unknown to them, were ſome 12 pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; upon the diſcharge of which, they made off with their field-pieces as faſt as their horſes could draw them. A ſhot from the American cannon, at this place, took off the head of a Heſſian artillery-man. They alſo left one of the artillery horſes dead on the field. What other loſs they ſuſtained was not known. Of our General's diviſion, one man only, belonging to Col. Paulding's regiment of New-York troops, was killed. The Britiſh made no other attempt on the Americans, while they remained at White Plains. The two armies lay looking at each other, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in long cannon-ſhot. In the night time, the Britiſh lighted up a vaſt number of fires, the weather grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretty cold. Theſe fires, ſome on the level
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:033865_0080_0FF95F34913964B0"/>ground, ſome at the foot of the hills, and at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances to their brows, ſome of which were lofty, ſeemed to the eye to mix with the ſtars, and to be of different magnitudes. The American ſide, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, exhibited to them a ſimilar appearance. On this day, our General ordered three redoubts, with a line in front, to be thrown up on the ſummit of his poſt, ſo conſtructed, that the whole of them could make a defence, and ſupport each other at the ſame time, if attacked. Theſe, to the enemy, in whoſe view they fully were, muſt have appeared very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, although they were deſigned principally for defence againſt ſinall-arms; and perhaps works were never raiſed quicker. There were the ſtalks of a large corn-field at the ſpot: the pulling theſe up in hills, took up a large lump of earth with each. The roots of the ſtalks and earth on them, placed in the face of the works, anſwered the purpoſe of ſods, or facines. The tops being placed inwards, as the looſe earth was thrown upon them, became as ſo many ties to the work, which was carried up with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch ſcarcely conceivable.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh, as they ſay, had meditated an attack on the Americans, which was only prevented by the wetneſs of the night. Be this as it may, our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had ordered his diviſion, at evening roll-call, to be at their alarm-poſts, (which they every morning man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whilſt at this place) half an hour ſooner than uſual. He had then no other reaſon for doing this, than the near poſition of the enemy, and the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that they would ſoon make an attack: But the Commander in Chief muſt have made ſome other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; for, after our General was in bed, Col. Carey, who was one of the Aids-de-camp of Gen. Waſhington, came to the door of his marque, and calling to him, informed him that the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were to be at their alarm-poſts, the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:033865_0081_0FF95DA18CFD3200"/>half an hour ſooner than uſual, and that he was to govern himſelf accordingly. Our General repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he had fortunately given ſuch orders to his diviſion, at evening roll-call. He therefore neither got up himſelf, nor diſturbed any other of his diviſion. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Stedman</hi> miſtakes greatly in his hiſtory, where, in vol. I. page 216, he aſſerts, that the Americans "evacuated their lines on the morning of the <hi>firſt,</hi> and retired acroſs the Croten Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to North-Caſtle, ſetting fire, in their retreat to all the houſes on White Plains." The Americans did not quit their ſtrong poſition at the <hi>back</hi> of White Plains, until the Britiſh had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated towards Kingſbridge, as far as Dobb's Ferry, and had there encamped, as is fully ſhewn in theſe Memoirs.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3d.—The centinels reported, that, during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding night, they heard the rumbling of carriages to the ſouth-eaſtward; and it was apprehended that the Britiſh were changing their poſition.</p>
            <p>5th.—The Britiſh centinels were withdrawn from their advanced poſts. It was apprehended that they meant a movement. The American army was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ordered under arms. At 2 o'clock, P. M. the enemy appeared, formed on Chaderton's Hill, and on ſeveral hills to the weſtward of it. Several reconnoitring parties, who were ſent out, reported that the enemy were withdrawing. About 12 o'clock, this night, a party of the Americans wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly ſet fire to the court-houſe, Dr. Graham's houſe, and ſeveral other private houſes, which ſtood between the two armies. This gave great diſguſt to the whole American army, and drew from the Commander in Chief the following paragraph, in his orders of the 6th: "It is with the utmoſt aſtoniſhment and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the General is informed, that ſome baſe and cowardly wretches have, laſt night, ſet fire to the court-houſe, and other buildings which the enemy left. The army may rely upon it, that they ſhall be brought to juſtice, and meet with the puniſhment they deſerve."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:033865_0082_0FF95F4986EAA140"/>
The Britiſh were moving down towards Dobb's Ferry. A detachment from the American army was ſent out in the morning to haraſs their rear, but could not come up with them.</p>
            <p>7th.—Several deſerters came in from the enemy they reported that they were removing towards New York. The reconnoitring parties diſcovered them encamped near Dobb's Ferry. They were foraging grain and hay, and driving in the cattle. Two ſtore-ſhips had run up paſt Fort Waſhington.</p>
            <p>8th.—The enemy continued encamped at and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Dobb's Ferry. A new diſpoſition of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican army was now to take place. The ſouthern troops were to croſs over into the Jerſies. Gen. Lee, with his own, Spencer's, and Sullivan's diviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, were to remain, to ſecure and bring off the ſtores; and were then to follow into the Jerſies. Our General was ordered to march with his diviſion to Peek's Kill.</p>
            <p>9th.—The diviſion moved from near White Plains, and the ſame night halted at North-Caſtle.</p>
            <p>10th.—In the afternoon, the diviſion reached Peek's Kill. Gen. Waſhington arrived at the ſame place about ſunſet. It was this day learnt, that Gen. Carleton's army in Canada, after puſhing the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans, in that quarter, from poſt to poſt, until they arrived at Ticonderoga, juſt made their appearance before that place, and then retired towards Quebec</p>
            <p>11th.—The Commander in Chief directed our General to attend him in taking a view of Fort Montgomery, and the other works up the river Lord Sterling, Generals James and George Clinton, Gen. Miſſlin and others were of the company. They went as far up the river as Conſtitution Iſland, which is oppoſite to Weſt-Point, the latter of which was not then taken poſſeſſion of; but the glance of the eye at it, without going on ſhore, evinced that this
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:033865_0083_0FF95DB1C50FC6C0"/>was not to be neglected. There was a ſmall work and a block-houſe on Conſtitution-Iſland. Fort Montgomery was in conſiderable forwardneſs.</p>
            <p>12th.—The Commander in Chief directed our General to ride early in the morning with him, to reconnoitre the grounds at the Gorge of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands; and, no his return, gave him the command of the troops and poſts in the Highlands, on both ſides of the river, with written inſtructions to ſecure and fortify them with all poſſible expedition, making a diſtribution of his troops to the different poſts; and, at about 10 o'clock, A. M. Gen. Waſhington croſſed over the river into the Jerſies.</p>
            <p>13th.—Our General made a diſpoſition of the troops under his command, to their ſeveral deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Col. Huntington's and Tyler's regiments, to the weſt ſide of the Hudſon, to Sidnum's Bridge on Ramapaugh River, to cover the paſſes into the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, on that ſide: Preſcott's, Ward's and Wyllis's regiments, of Parſons's brigade, (as were the other two regiments) to the ſouth entrance of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, beyond Robinſon's Bridge: Gen. George Clinton's brigade, to the heights above Peek's Kill Landing: Gen. Scott's brigade, with the three regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gen. Parſons's brigade: Gen. James Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, with the troops under his command, were at the forts up the river. The Britiſh moved down, near to Kingſbridge.</p>
            <p>On the 16th, the Britiſh made their attack on Fort Waſhington. Gen. Knyphauſen, with a heavy column of Heſſians, advanced by Kingſbridge. They were diſcovered by the Americans, from the high grounds north of Fort Waſhington, as the day broke; and cannonaded from the field-pieces, placed at this advanced poſt. The Heſſian column divided into two; the right aſcending the ſtrong broke ground towards Spitten-Devil Creek; the left nearer
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:033865_0084_0FF95F5083595490"/>to the road, towards the Gorge. The firſt obtained the ground without much difficulty; but the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans made a moſt noble oppoſition againſt the latter and, for a conſiderable time, kept them from aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hill, making a terrible ſlaughter among them; but the great ſuperiority of the aſſailants, with an unabating firmneſs, finally prevailed: their loſs wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> greater here than at any other place. Mean while, the Britiſh croſſed Haarlem Creek, in two different places, charged, and finally routed the Americans on that ſide, and poſſeſſed themſelves of the ſtrong poſt of Laurel Hill, on the other ſide of the road from Fort Waſhington, and not very diſtant from it; Lord Percy at the ſame time advancing, with the troops under his command on the iſland, to wards the fort on that ſide. The Americans, now g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>

               </gap> which was crowded full. A ſingle ſhell, now dropping among them, muſt have made dreadful havock.</p>
            <p>Gen. Waſhington was now a ſpectator of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing ſcene, from the high bank at Fort Lee, on the oppoſite ſide of the Hudſon; and having a with to communicate ſomething to Col. Magaw, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer at Fort Waſhington, Capt. Gooch of Boſton, a brave and daring man, offered to be the bearer of it. He ran down to the river, jumped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſmall boat, puſhed over the river, landed under the bank, ran up to the fort, and delivered the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage—came out, ran and jumped over the broken ground, dodging the Heſſians, ſome of whom ſtruck at him with their pieces, and others attempted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o thruſt him with their bayonets—eſcaping through them, he got to his boat, and returned to Fort Lee. The Britiſh had ſummoned Col. Magaw to ſurrender, and were preparing their batteries to play on the for, when Col. Magaw thought it beſt to ſurrender the poſt, which he did accordingly, between two and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:033865_0085_0FF8D5D45FA5A388"/>three thouſand men becoming priſoners. The loſs in killed and wounded, on the American ſide was inconſiderable; but the loſs in priſoners was a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blow indeed. The priſoners were marched to New-York; where, being crowded in priſons and ſugar-houſes, (many of them being militia from the Jerſey flying-camp, who had been ſent over to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the garriſon, and were unuſed to a ſoldier's life, much leſs to the poiſonous ſtagnant air of a crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed priſon,) they fell ſick, and daily died, in a moſt ſhocking manner. It was common, on a morning, for the car-men to come and take away the bodies for burial, <hi>by loads!</hi>—O ye officers of the provoſt! to whatever nation or people you belong, when the unfortunate of your fellow-men are thus committed to your charge, clothe yourſelves with humanity, and ſoothe diſtreſs as far as in your power; for by this, you will ſecure a better reward than your preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent wages. And you who have the honour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand armies, when your victories have filled provoſts and priſons, think it not beneath you to viſit the priſons, that with your own eyes you may ſee the ſtate of your priſoners: for ſuch <hi>viſits,</hi> the great CAPTAIN OF YOUR SALVATION hath ſaid, ſhall be conſidered as made to Himſelf; while it alſo gives you a name among men cloſely allied to that of the conqueror. The truly brave are always humane.</p>
            <p>Elated with the eaſy reduction of Fort Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the Britiſh determined to croſs into the Jerſies, and attack Gen. Waſhington on that ſide.</p>
            <p>On the 18th, Lord Cornwallis, with a ſtrong body of the Britiſh forces, landed at Cloſter Landing, on the Jerſey ſide, above Fort Lee, the garriſon of which were obliged to leave that poſt; and ſome cannon, ſtores and proviſions, which could not be removed, fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:033865_0086_0FF8D53CD0442770"/>
20th.—Juſt at evening, an expreſs, which our General had ſent down to Gen. Waſhington before he had any knowledge of what had happened, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a moſt alarming account of what he had ſeen with his own eyes, viz. that the Americans were rapidly retreating, and the Britiſh as rapidly purſuing. The Adjutant-General [Read] wiſhed to write to Gen. Lee; but he had neither pen, ink, or paper with him. The light-horſeman had a rough piece of wrapping-paper in his pocket, and the Adjutant-General had an old pencil. Bringing theſe two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he wrote to Gen. Lee—"Dear General, we are flying before the Britiſh. I pray"—and the pencil broke. He then told the light-horſeman to carry the paper to Gen. Lee, and tell him that he was verbally ordered to add, after <hi>I pray,</hi> "you to puſh and join us." The light-horſeman, when he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at our General's, was both fatigued and wet. He requeſted that one of his brother horſemen might proceed to Gen. Lee; but he was told that no other could diſcharge the duty enjoined on him by the Adjutant-General, and that Gen. Lee might wiſh to make many inquiries of him. He was therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed and puſhed on. Gen. Lee, inſtead of moving his diviſion, or any part of it, wrote our General, by the returning expreſs, the following letter.</p>

With reſpect to the latter, upon having recourſe to my inſtructions, I find they are ſuch as not to admit of moving any part of the troops from the poſts aſſigned to me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be by expreſs orders from his Excellency, or to ſupport you, in caſe you are attacked. My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, among other things, are as follow: <q>Your diviſion, with ſuch troops as are now at Forts Montgomery, Independence and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are to be under your command, and remain in this quarter, for the ſecurity of the above poſts, and the paſſes through the Highlands, from this place, and the one on the weſt ſide of Hudſon's
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:033865_0088_0FF95F62F0EED718"/>River. Unneceſſary it is for me to ſay any thing to evince the importance of ſecuring the land and water communication through theſe paſſes, or to prove the indiſpenſable neceſſity of uſing every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion in your power, to have ſuch works erected for the defence of them, as your own judgment, aſſiſted by that of your Brigadiers and Engineer, may ſhew the expediency of. You will not only keep in view the importance of ſecuring theſe paſſes, but the neceſſity of doing it without delay: not only from the probability of the enemy's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſeize them, but from the advanced ſeaſon, which will not admit of any ſpade-work, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the froſt (which may daily be expected) ſets in.

                  <p>"After inſtructions ſo poſitive and preſſing, you will readily agree that it would be very improper, in me, to order any of the troops from poſts, to which they are ſo expreſsly aſſigned, and from buſineſs which in his Excellency's view is ſo very important. Add to this, their preſent diſpoſition is ſuch, that to collect any thing near the number you mention, would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion as great delay, and cauſe many of them to march nearly as far, as if ſent immediately from your quarter.</p>

            <p>After the foregoing was ſent off, our General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected for a moment, that as circumſtances alter caſes, Gen.

Lee, and of his anſwers. The expreſs was directed to make the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſpatch out and returning, which he effected on the 26th, (ſeveral days before Gen.

            <p>21ſt.—A heavy cannonade was heard towards Amboy.</p>
            <p>22d.—Col. Tupper, who was down near Tappan, got up to King's Ferry. He brought off the two 12 pounders which were at Dobb's Ferry, and a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of proviſions. The ſame evening, our General ordered the Waſhington Galley to take ſtation at King's Ferry.</p>
            <p>24th.—Our General gave orders for Clinton's and Scott's brigades to hold themſelves in readineſs to march to the Jerſey ſide.</p>
            <p>25th.—Scott's brigade was ordered over to Haver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraw, and Col. Tyler's regiment, then at Ramapaugh River, to march down to Tappan, to ſecure and bring off the proviſions which were at that place.</p>
            <p>27th.—Capt Treadwell, of the artillery, with a three-pounder, was ordered to move over the river, and join Gen. Scott's brigade. It was learnt that many of the inhabitants of New-Jerſey, eſpecially in the neighbourhood of Hackenſack, were ſwearing allegiance to King George, taking letters of protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>28th.—Mr. Livingſton came from Congreſs, to adviſe with our General on meaſures to obſtruct the river. The ſame day, Capt. Harrod brought off from Tappan, a conſiderable quantity of pearl-aſh, bees-wax, oil, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>29th.—Two of the regiments of Gen. Clinton's brigade were ordered to move to Fort Conſtitution,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:033865_0092_0FF8D5AC84D4EC58"/>in order to attempt the forming of obſtructions in the river near Polipins Iſland.</p>
            <p>30th.—Juſt before dinner, Gen. Sullivan arrived at our General's quarters; and in the afternoon Gen. Lee arrived. He called at the door; when our General waiting upon him, requeſted him to alight, he aſked if he could have a cup of tea, and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that he ſhould have a good one. Upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the houſe, before he ſat down, he wiſhed to ſpeak in private, which being inſtantly granted, he told our General that, in a military view, or, to uſe his own words exactly, "In <hi>point of law,</hi> you are right; but in point of policy, I think you are wrong. I am going into the Jerſies for the ſalvation of America; I wiſh to take with me a larger force than I now have, and requeſt you to order 2,000 of your men to march with me." Our General anſwered, that he could not ſpare that number. He was then aſked to order 1,000; to which he replied, that the buſineſs might be as well brought to a point at once— that not a ſingle man ſhould march from the poſt by <hi>bis</hi> order. Gen. Lee replied, that he would then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them himſelf. He was anſwered, that there was a wide difference between the two; that Gen. Lee was acknowledged by our General to be his ſenior; but, as he had received poſitive written inſtructions from him who was ſuperior to both, he would not <hi>himſelf</hi> break thoſe orders: If Gen. Lee was diſpoſed to counteract them, its being done by him could not be imputed to any other perſon; and that he knew the Commander in Chief did not intend any of the troops ſhould be removed from that poſt—having expreſſed it not only in his inſtructions, but alſo in a letter juſt received from him. On the letter being ſhewn to Gen. Lee, he obſerved, "The Commander in Chief is now at a diſtance, and does not know what is neceſſary here ſo well as I do"—aſked if he might
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:033865_0093_0FF95E14C90AAAB0"/>be favoured with the return-book of the diviſion. Major Huntington, the Deputy Adjutant-General, was directed to hand it. Gen. Lee ran his eye over it, and ſaid, "I will take Preſcott's and Wyllis's regiments"—and turning to Major Huntington, ſaid, "You will order thoſe two regiments to march early to-morrow morning to join me." Our General, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Major, ſaid, "Iſſue ſuch orders at your peril!" and then turning to Gen. Lee, addreſſed him: "Sir, if you come to this poſt, and mean to iſſue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders here, which will break thoſe poſitive ones which I have received, I pray you to do it completely your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and through your own Deputy Adjutant-General, who is preſent, and not draw me, or any of my fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, in as partners in the guilt." Gen. Lee replied, "It is right. Col. Scammel, do you iſſue the order;" which he did, and Huntington communicated it to the regiments, who were now poſted at the Gorge of the mountains, near Robinſon's Bridge, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called the Continental Village. Matters car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thus far, our General turned to Gen. Lee again: "Sir; I have one more requeſt to make, and that is, that you will be pleaſed to give me a certificate, that you <hi>exerciſe command</hi> at this poſt, and do order from it Preſcott's and Wyllis's regiments." Lee replied, "I do not know that I will comply with your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt." Gen. Clinton, who was preſent, obſerved, "Gen. Lee, you cannot refuſe a requeſt ſo reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble." Upon which Gen. Lee wrote as follows:</p>

Gen. Lee, ſtepping out on the plazza, obſerved to an officer, "Gen. Heath is right." Early the next morning, the regiments moved from their cantonment towards Peek's Kill; but before they had reached it, Gen. Lee, now ready to paſs into the Jerſies, rode up to our General's door, and calling him, obſerved, "Upon further conſideration, I have concluded not to take the two regiments with me— you may order them to return to their former poſt." This conduct of Gen. Lee's appeared not a little extraordinary, and one is almoſt at a loſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it. He had been a ſoldier from his youth, had a perfect knowledge of ſervice in all its branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but was rather obſtinate in his temper, and could ſcarcely brook being croſſed in any thing in the line of his profeſſion. Gen. Lee took with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jerſies ſome as good troops as any in the ſervice; but many of them were ſo deſtitute of ſhoes, that the blood left on the rugged frozen ground, in many places, marked the route they had taken; and a conſiderable number, unable to march, were left at Peek's Kill. The time of ſervice for which Gen. Scott's brigade was engaged to ſerve, expired, when the whole, except about 50, went home, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the generous encouragement offered them by their State, (New-York) if they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue one month longer.</p>
            <p>2d and 3d.—Gen. Lee's troops were paſſing the ferry. Gen. Carleton having returned into Canada, a number of Gen. Gates's regiments were now mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reinforce Gen. Waſhington—their van as far as Morriſtown—the enemy as far as Brunſwick.</p>
            <p>6th.—Intelligence was received, that on the 4th, about ſunſet, 70 ſail of ſhips of war and tranſports, paſſed in the ſound towards New-England. Our General immediately ſent off expreſſes to Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, Gov. Trumbull, Mr. Bowdoin, at Boſton, the Convention of New-York, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:033865_0095_0FF95E2883E669C0"/>
7th.—Three regiments, viz. Greaton's, Bond's, and Porter's, arrived off the landing from Albany, on their way to Gen. Waſhington. Matters now looked ſerious in Jerſey. The Britiſh were extending themſelves in all directions, and the inhabitants obliged to become paſſive, if not worſe. Gen. Gates had ordered the troops, moving from the northward, to rendezvous at Goſhen.</p>
            <p>8th.—Our General wrote Gen. Lee, that the troops were moving on from the northward, and as Gen. Gates had not yet overtaken them, ſome of the commanding-officers appeared to wiſh for orders how to proceed. Gen. Waſhington, it was ſaid, was as far as Trenton—Lee, the preceding night, as far as Pompton. A flag ſchooner came up from New-York, to obtain leave for ſome families to go in. A Parſon Ingliſh was on board. Orders were given to treat the flag with politeneſs, and at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame time with proper precaution; and the buſineſs was laid before the Convention of the State.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, Gen. Clinton, with two Britiſh and two Heſſian brigades, with a ſquadron of ſhips under the command of Sir Peter Parker, took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Rhode-Iſland, without the loſs of a man; the Americans quitting the iſland without making any oppoſition. Rhode-Iſland was a great acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Britiſh, for quarters, forage, and a ſafe harbour; but leſſened their ability for other more important operations in the field.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 9th, our General received orders from the Commander in Chief, to move over the Hudſon, with Parſons's brigade, and to move on ſo as to give protection to the country, and vigour to the cauſe in Jerſey.</p>
            <p>10th.—A little afternoon, Parſons's brigade march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to King's Ferry; the greateſt alertneſs hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033865_0096_0FF95F92A52385C8"/>been diſcovered by both officers and men on the occaſion.</p>
            <p>11th.—About eleven o'clock, A. M. our General left Peek's Kill, and proceeded for the Jerſies; on croſſing King's Ferry, gave orders for the flag to be detained from returning until further orders. The troops croſſed the ferry, and marched as far as Cell Hays' at Haverſtraw. Huntington's and Tyler's regiments were ordered to advance from Ramapaugh Bridge to Paramus. Our General received a letter from Gen. Lee, in anſwer to the one he wrote on the 8th from Peek's Kill, as follows:</p>

               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:033865_0097_0FF95E3C22F0B3C0"/>
13th.—Sent out a reconnoitring party towards Hackenſack, to get intelligence, &amp;c. This day, Gen. Lee was taken priſoner, near Chatham, by a party of light-horſe, commanded by Col. Harcourt. Lee took quarters at a ſmall diſtance from his troops: an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant gave notice of it to Col. Harcourt, who was out reconnoitring near that neighbourhood, and who had the addreſs to take and carry him off.</p>
            <p>14th.—Our General held up every appearance of moving to Paramus, and ſent off his baggage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eſcort to that place; and between 11 and 12 o'clock, marched briſkly for Hackenſack, having ſent orders for Huntington's and Tyler's regiments to move from Paramus at the ſame time. Buſkirk's regiment was at Hackenſack Bridge the preceding day, where they did duty, and it was expected they were ſtill at the ſame place. To ſurpriſe and take them was the object; but it was found that Buſkirk's men had moved the preceding day to bergen, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to draw new arms. The town was completely ſurpriſed, not having an idea that any but Britiſh troops were near them. One Britiſh ſoldier and 20 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Convention of New-York, greatly alarmed at the removal of our General with the continental troops, from the important paſſes of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, ſent a requeſt to Gen. Waſhington, deſiring that they might be ordered back again. To inſure diſpatch, they offered the expreſs extra pay. The Commander in Chief was pleaſed to grant their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ordered our General to return to Peek's Kill, and re-occupy his former poſitions.</p>
            <p>Our General, having received certain information that Buſkirk's regiment was at or near Bergen Woods, it was determined to ſtrike them. For this purpoſe, on the evening of the 19th, about 8 o'clock, Gen. Parſons, with 250 continental troops, and Gen. Clinton, with a like number of the militia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>20th.—About 1 o'clock, P. M. the detachment returned to Paramus, having, in the ſhort interval of time, marched (out and returning) upwards of 40 miles. They brought back with them, beſides their priſoners, 16 new fire-locks, 6 horſes, and one waggon; having ſuſtained the loſs of one man. The enemy were ſuppoſed to have had ſeveral killed.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—Orders were given for the troops to be ready to march early the next morning. The gentleman who was taken into cuſtody at Hacken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack, chagrined almoſt to death, had been ſpending his time, like April, in weeping and lowering; and much interceſſion having been made for his releaſe,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:033865_0101_0FF960DA492E20D0"/>our General told him, that in caſe he would faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perform a piece of ſecret fervice allotted to him, he ſhould be releaſed. This he performed with punctuality, and conſequently was ſet at liberty.</p>
            <p>22d.—The troops marched from Paramus round by the ſide of Kakaat, to Clark's-Town, which they reached about ſun-ſet.</p>
            <p>23d.—The troops took up their line of march, cooſſed the Hudſon, and arrived at Peek's Kill.</p>
            <p>24th.—Gave permiſſion forthe flag to return to New-York, having on board the families of Mr. Engliſh, Moore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>25th.—It was learnt that a body of Heſſian troops had not long before moved to the upper end of York Iſland. The militia of the State of New-York were this day beginning to come in.</p>
            <p>26th.—A ſevere ſnow-ſtorm. Some of the militia from Maſſachuſetts had reached Danbury.</p>

            <p>30th.—Col. Cheſter, of Connecticut, arrived at Peek's Kill, from Gen. Waſhington's camp, with the agreenble news, that on the preceding Thurſday morning, being the 26th, Gen. Waſhington, at the head of about 3,000 men, croſſed the Delawere, and attacked the enemy at Trenton, being about 1,600 Heſſians; and in about 35 minutes entirely defeated them. One colonel, 2 Lieutenant-Colonels, 3 Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors, 4 Captains, 3 Lieutenants, 12 Enſigns, I Judge Advocate, 2 Surgeon's Mates, 92 Serjeants, 20 Drummers, 9 Muſicians, 25 Officers' ſervants, and 740 rank and file were taken priſoners, beſides the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="104" facs="unknown:033865_0102_0FF95FF123BC6448"/>victory. The ſame day, Colonel Sparhawk's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of militia arrived from Maſſachuſetts.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—Information was given, that a company of 60 diſaffected inhabitants were on their way to join the enemy. Parties were ſent out to intercept them.</p>
            <p>1777. <hi>January</hi> 1ſt.—By a letter from General Waſhington, it appeared that the enemy were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating towards Amboy. Generals Miſſtin and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Col. Cadwallader had croſſed the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and Gen. Waſhington was about to follow them, and purſue the enemy.</p>
            <p>2d.—Several infamous diſaffected perſone were taken and ſent in. The ſame day, Gen. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton being at Trenton, Gen.

The ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of war are almoſt infinite, but all have the ſame object, namely, to deceive—to hold up an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſmething which is not intended, while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this maſk ſome important object is ſecured; and be a General never ſo brave, if he be un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="7 letters">

            <p>3d.—Thirty-ſeven recruits going to Rogers, taken the preceding night, were brought in; and our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ordered out Capt. Graham at 12 o'clock at night, to intercept another gang.</p>
            <p>4th.—Gen. Lincoln arrived from Maſſachuſetts; he had come on with a body of militia.</p>
            <p>5th.—It was learnt that on the iſt inſt. Gen. Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam took a large quantity of baggage, proviſions, &amp;c. at Bordentown; and on the 3d, Gen. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's army came up with the rear of the enemy, at or near Rocky Hill, when a briſk action enſued, and the enemy were defeated, with the loſs of between 50 and 60 killed, and upwards of 100 taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, together with 6 pieces of cannon, and all their baggage: the Americans had 6 men killed. The ſame day, Col. Sparhawk's regiment of militia, from Maſſachuſetts, with two field-pieces, marched for King's Ferry, on their way to the Jerſies.</p>

11th.—A number of Britiſh officers, taken at Princeton, paſſed Peek's Kill, on their way to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut. The ſame day it was learnt, that on the 8th, Gen.

            <p>12th.—Gen. Moulton from Maſſachuſetts, and Col. Gilman from New-Hampſhire, came to camp. A number of Britiſh priſoners, taken in the Jerſies, paſſed Peek's Kill, on their way to Connecticut.</p>
            <p>13th.—Our General moved to the ſouthward, and reached North-Caſtle juſt before ſun-ſet, where he found part of four regiments had arrived, and Gen, Scott's militia of New-York had moved down to Wright's Mills.</p>
            <p>14th.—Our General moved to King-ſtreet to Mr. Clap's—about 3,000 militia had arrived, and Gen. Lincoln's diviſion marched to Tarrytown on this day. The Commander in Chief in another letter had intimated that Gen. Lincoln, inſtead of moving on to join him, ſhould ſtay on the eaſt ſide of the Hudſon, and join in the expedition.</p>
            <p>15th.—The Connecticut volunteers marched from King-ſtreet to New Rochelle, and Gen. Scott's brigade to Stephen Ward's. Plenty of proviſions were arriving. A deſerter came in from the enemy, and gave an account of their ſituation and numbers.</p>
            <p>17th.—At night the three diviſions began to move towards Kingſbridge; Gen Lincoln's, from Tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, on the Albany road; Generals Wooſter and Parſons's, from New Rochelle and Eaſt-Cheſter, and Gen. Scott's in the centre from below White Plains.

Gen. Lincoln's on the heights above Col. Van Cortland's; Wooſter's at Williams's; and Scott's on the back of Volentine's. Our General, who moved with the centre diviſion, knew that Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entine's houſe was the quarters of one of the guards; he did not know but it might be defended: as he approached it, he ordered Capt. Lieut. Bryant to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a field-piece to the advance-guard, and if there was any oppoſition from the houſe, to cannonade it immediately. He then ordered 250 men from the head of the column (as it was moving on) to incline to the right, and by a double ſtep to puſh into the hollow, between the houſe and the fort, to cut off the guard who were at the houſe, in caſe they ſhould run towards the latter. At this inſtant, two light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſemen who had been ſent out by the enemy as the day broke to reconnoitre the vicinity, came unexpectedly at the deſcent of a hill, plump upon the head of Wooſter's column. They attempted to turn about, but before it could be fully effected, a field-piece was diſcharged at them; one of them was pitched from his horſe and taken priſoner, the other galloped back to the fort, holloing as he paſſed, "The rebels! The rebels!" This ſet all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards and pickets running to the fort, leaving in ſome places their arms, blankets, tools, proviſions, &amp;c. behind them. Thoſe who fled from Volentine's, and the <hi>Negro Fort,</hi> were fired at as they ran, but none were killed: one, who could not run ſo faſt as the reſt, was taken priſoner. Ten muſquets were taken at Volentine's houſe. The guard above Van Cortland's was as completely ſurpriſed as the others,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:033865_0107_0FF960E9FB81CB90"/>where Gen. Lincoln took about 40 arms, ſome blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, &amp;c. &amp;c. The left and centre diviſions moved into the hollow, between Volentine's houſe and the fort, from whence our General immediately ſent a ſummons to the commanding-officer of the fort to ſurrender. The Commandant of the fort, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the garriſon, being Heſſians, the ſummons held out to theſe generous terms. The anſwer, which was verbal, was a refuſal to ſurrender. A detachment with two field-pieces was ordered to move to the ſouth of the ſort, to a hill above Haar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Creek, not far from the New Bridge. When the detachment arrived at this place, a battalion of Heſſians appeared drawn up on the ſide of the hill juſt within Kingſbridge, and back of Hyatt's tavern. Our General ordered the artillery to cannonade them immediately. The firſt ſhot juſt cleared the right of the battalion, nearly a platoon ſettling down as the ſhot paſſed them, which entered the bank cloſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. The ſecond ſhot paſſed about the centre of the battalion, when to the amount of a grand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ſettled down, which was an evidence that they would not ſtand much longer. One of the pieces was ordered to be drawn lower down the hill; on which the battalion quitted their ground, and marched off as faſt as they could without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to get behind the redoubt and hill at the bridge, receiving one ſhot more as they were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round the point. It was not ſuſpected that the enemy had any cannon in the redoubt within the bridge, but they now began to cannonade the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery-men who had deſcended the hill, who had to draw up their picce as faſt as poſſible, which they ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without any loſs, but received three or four ſhot quite among them, before they could reach the top of the hill.</p>

               </gap> morning, by paſſing a ſtrong detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over Spitten-Devil Creek on the ice, which, however, was not now very ſtrong, but the weather was cold. One thouſand were detached for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but the weather having grown warm in the night, the ice was judged, by the unanimous opinion of all the General Officers on the ground, to be too hazardous on the morning of the 20th to venture the attempt. On this day there was a cannonade on both ſides, and the enemy on the iſland ſide were thrown into much confuſion. Our General obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that when the enemy within the iſland were can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonaded acroſs Haarlem Creek, they ſheltered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves behind the little hill near the bridge, next to Spitten-Devil Creek, on this afternoon he rode round on to Tippit's Hill, which was in its rear, and found that a field-piece drawn up on that ſide would leave the enemy no hiding place.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—A cannonade on both ſides. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon a field-piece was hauled up to Tippit's Hill, and the enemy were cannonaded both in front and reats they were thrown into the utmoſt confuſion: ſome ſecured themſelves in their redoubt, others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the banks: ſome lay flat on the ground, and ſome betook themſelves to the cellars; ſo that in a
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:033865_0109_0FF960F274286EA8"/>ſhort time there was no object for the gunners. The weather had now grown very moderate.</p>
            <p>22d.—There was a pretty ſmart ſkirmiſh with the enemy near the fort. This day our General ordered a number of chandeliers, faſcines, &amp;c. to be made; and having nothing but light field-pieces with him, in order to keep up an appearance of a ſerious deſign on the fort, he ſent to North-Caſtle, where was a <hi>field</hi> braſs 24-pounder and ſome howitzers, to bring forward the former and one of the latter.</p>
            <p>23d.—A ſmart ſkirmiſh took place juſt before duſk, in the broken ground near the ſouth ſide of the fort; an Enſign and one man belonging to the New-York militia were killed, and five wounded; the loſs of the enemy unknown, as it was cloſe under the fort.</p>
            <p>24th.—Exceſſive ſtormy. Gen. Lincoln's diviſion, who were in huts in the woods, back of Col. Van Cortland's, were obliged to quit their ground, and move back into houſes where they could find them; ſome of them as far as Dobb's Ferry; with the loſs of a great many cartridges, from the badneſs of the boxes. The fall of rain was ſo great as to cauſe a great freſh in the Brunx, the water running over the bridge by Williams's.</p>
            <p>25th.—Early in the morning, the enemy made a ſally towards Delaney's Mills, where they ſurpriſed and routed the guard, wounding ſeveral, but not killing or taking any of them; and a regiment near that place quitted their quarters. Emboldened by this ſucceſs, about 10 o'clock, A. M. they made a powerful ſally towards Volentine's, inſtantly driving the guards and pickets from the Negro Fort and Volentine's houſe; puſhing on with great impetuoſity, keeping up a briſk fire, the balls paſſing at Williams's houſe ſufficiently ſtrong to do execution. The retreating
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:033865_0110_0FF9600AEBE51368"/>guards threw themſelves into the old redoubt on the north fide of the road, to the weſt of the bridge; on which, the enemy immediately lined a ſtrong ſtone wall, a few rods diſtant to the ſouthweſt. Two regiments of the militia being at this inſtant formed in the road near Williams's, and the horſes in the limbers of the field-pieces, our General ordered Capt. Bryant to ford over the bridge with his piece, and the militia to follow and cover the artillery. When Capt. Bryant had aſcended almoſt to the top of the hill, to prevent his horſes being ſhot, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limbered, and the men took the drag-ropes; but the aſcent of the hill was ſuch, that they were obliged to drag the piece almoſt within piſtol-ſhot, before the ground would admit the piece to be ſo depreſſed as to bear on the enemy. The moment this was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a round ſhot opened a breach in the wall, four or five feet wide; a ſecond ſhot in leſs than a minute opened another, when the enemy fled back to the fort with the greateſt precipitation. Of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, two were killed and a number wounded.</p>
            <p>27th.—The braſs 24-pounder and howitzer were brought up, and ordered to open upon the fort; on the third diſcharge of the former, ſhe ſprang her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; nor were there any <hi>live</hi> ſhells for the howit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer, there being none at North-Caſtle; nor was a regular cannonade or bombardment of the fort ever contemplated. Every attempt was now made, by feint and otherwiſe, to draw the enemy out of the fort. A detachment was ſent down to Morriſania, to light up a great number of fires in the night, to induce the enemy to ſuppoſe that a body of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans were collecting at that place, with a deſign to croſs on to New-York Iſland, at or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ear Haarlem; and to heighten this, ſeveral large boats were ſent for, and brought forward on carriages. The Britiſh
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:033865_0111_0FF960F3FAE04BD0"/>guard on Montreſor's Iſland were ſo much alarmed at this, as to ſet the buildings on fire, and flee to New-York. A brigade of the Britiſh were ſaid to have moved towards Fort Waſhington; and orders had been ſent to Rhode-Iſland, for a detachment to be ſent from thence.</p>
            <p>29th.—There was the appearance of a ſevere ſnow-ſtorm coming on, when all the General Officers on the ground, viz. beſides our General, <hi>Lincoln, Wooſter, Scott</hi> and <hi>Ten Broeck,</hi> were unanimouſly of opinion that the troops ought to move back before the ſtorm came on, to places where they could be covered from the inclemency of the weather, as there was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> artillery to batter the fort, and from firſt to laſt they were unanimouſly oppoſed to any idea of an aſſault or ſtorm of the fort with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, and the principal object being now to ſecure and bring off or deſtroy the forage, which could be as well done where the troops could have covering, as to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs them in the open fields by multiplying guards, or their being conſtantly expoſed in the ſcattered houſes to be ſurpriſed and cut off. For theſe ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the troops were ordered as ſoon as it grew dark to move back, Gen. Lincoln's diviſion to Dobb's Ferry and Tarry-Town, Gen. Wooſter's to New Rochelle, and Gen. Scott's to White Plains; the guards to remain at their poſts and alert, until the troops were all moved off, and then to form rear guards on the ſeveral roads, following the troops to whom they reſpectively belonged; all of which was performed in good order, in a very heavy fall of ſnow.</p>
            <p>30th.—The ſtorm cleared up, when 15 ſhips, 1 brig, 2 ſchooners, and 2 ſloops came too, between Heart and City Iſtands; they were from the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and were ſuppoſed to have troops on board.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:033865_0112_0FF9601797EB13D0"/>The troops on this expedition, as it was called, were in a very hazardous ſituation, and had continued in it from the morning of the 18th to the evening of the 29th; they were entirely a body of militia, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few artillery-men. So apprehenſive of this being a critical ſituation was the Commander in Chief, in the year 1780, when Gen. Sir Henry Clinton menaced the French army at Rhode-Iſland, and had embarked his troops on board tranſports for the purpoſe of proceeding to that place, and Gen. Waſhington had determined to move down towards Kingſbridge, to induce Sir Henry to give up his deſign by menacing New-York, our General being then at Rhode-Iſland with the French army, Gen. Waſhington wrote him on the 31ſt of July from Robinſon's Houſe in the Highlands—among other things, <hi>"You know the critical ſituation in which this army will be in a poſition below."</hi> This was undoubtedly a very juſt obſervation; but if the Commander in Chief, with the whole American army in 1780, well armed and highly diſciplined, ſhould ſo juſtly judge at the diſtance of 30 miles from the ſpot, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe brave mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia men, who continued in the poſition itſelf, for more than <hi>ten days</hi> in the midſt of winter.</p>
            <p>Whenever an enterpriſe is to be attempted in the teeth of an enemy, it ſhould be a <hi>daſh</hi> and away.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—A <hi>cordon</hi> of troops was ordered to be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to extend from Dobb's Ferry to Maroneck.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 1ſt.—Foraging being now the object, a large number of teams were ſent out towards Maroneck, and upwards of 80 loads of forage were brought off. Twelve more ſhips, 4 of which were of 40 guns, came down the Sound the preceding day.</p>
            <p>2d.—Col. Humphries, of New-York, arrived with a regiment of militia from Albany county, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſervice ſix weeks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:033865_0113_0FF960F89B1983E8"/>
3d.—There was another grand forage.</p>
            <p>6th.—A ſtrong detachment under the command of Col. Enos was ſent toward Fort Independence, to attempt to ſurpriſe ſome of the enemy's out-poſts, but nothing could be effected. The ſmall-pox was now making its appearance in the neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>8th.—There was a grand forage to the lower parts of Weſt-Cheſter county. A row-galley and a ſloop were coming up the North River. The covering party to the foragers on this day was nearly 1,000 ſtrong, and large quantities of forage were brought off.</p>
            <p>10th.—Our General rode to Peek's Kill, where he arrived a little aſter dark. Gen. Lincoln's troops were on their march to join Gen. Waſhington. Our General had obtained leave of the Commander in Chief, to make a ſhort viſit to New-England, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an injunction to return very early.</p>
            <p>12th.—About 10 o'clock, he left Peek's Kill, and arrived at his houſe in Roxbury on the 19th, about ſun-ſet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 14th.—Our General ſet out from Roxbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, on his way back to the army; but before he had got to Watertown, an expreſs overtook him, with orders from Gen. Waſhington, for him to take the command of the Eaſtern Department; Gen.

            <p>This year, 1777, formed an important era in the annals of America. Congreſs had determined to make great exertions to drive the Britiſh troops from America; for this purpoſe, they had ordered 88 battalions to be raiſed in the United States, 15 of which fell to the ſhare of Maſſachuſetts. Beſides the foregoing 88 battalions, they alſo ordered the

The Commander in Chief had given directions for the troops to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded on, with all poſſible diſpatch, to Ticonderoga.</p>
            <p>20th.—Maj. Gen. Ward reſigned the command of the Eaſtern Department to our General, who took the command accordingly.</p>

            <p>7th.—Capt. Cluſton arrived from France, with powder, arms, &amp;c. for the State; he had alſo made a ſucceſsful cruize.</p>
            <p>11th.—Intelligence was received, that the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans evacuated Ticonderoga on the 6th, at night; a great many ſtores, &amp;c. were loſt. The Britiſh no ſooner arrived before Ticonderoga, than they were diſcovered on Mount Hope: this ſteep and rugged hill was thought to be inacceſſible by the Americans, at leaſt with artillery; and therefore, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its nearneſs to the works, and overlooking of them in part, it was not taken poſſeſſion of; but they ſhould have recollected what had been ſaid by the late King of Pruſſia, as to ſuch poſitions—that "where a goat can go, a man may go; and where a man can go, artillery may be drawn up." The Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh were no ſooner ſeen on this hill, where the <hi>wily Phillips</hi> of the artillery is ſaid to have aſcended, than they ſaw an additional reaſon for quitting the poſt. This was a ſore and heavy loſs to the Americans; but in the iſſue proved a more certain and earlier overthrow of all Burgoyne's army: yet ſo exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated were the people at that time, that had the commanding General, St. Clair, been immediately brought to trial, he would have ſtood but a poor chance: he was afterwards tried and acquitted with honour. The Britiſh took poſſeſſion of the works, and puſhed on rapidly after the Americans, taking and deſtroying every thing that fell in their way. Brig. Gen. Frazer, with the light troops, purſued
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:033865_0119_0FF96108AD53E1C0"/>with great ardour, and on the 7th came up with a body of the Americans, commanded by the brave Col. Francis, of Maſſachuſetts. A warm action en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; the Americans were worſted; the Colonel was ſlain, and many other officers and ſoldiers kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wounded and taken priſoners. This ſlew through the country like a ſhock of electricity, and rouſed the people to noble exertions. Gen. St. Clair join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gen. Schuyler, at Fort Edward, after a fatiguing retreat. On the 10th, a moſt conſpicuous piece of gallantry was exhibited at Rhode-Iſland. Maj. Gen. Preſcott having the command of the Britiſh troops at that place, Col. Barton of Providence formed a reſolution to ſurpriſe and take him: he accordingly proceeded to the iſland with a party of choſen men in two boats with muffled oars, taking with him a negro man whoſe hard head was nearly as efficacious as a beetle, to burſt a door; and on this night with great addreſs evading the Britiſh water-guards, paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down the weſt ſide of the iſland, and landed near a hollow ground, and inſtantly puſhed for the houſe of a Mr. <hi>Overing,</hi> where the General quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The centinel at the door was ſeized, the houſe entered, and demand made whether the General was there; and finding that he was, and the apartinent, the door was burſt open, and the General and his Aid-de-camp ſeized, and told that they muſt go off inſtantly. The General aſked if he might put on his clothes? The Colonel anſwered, <hi>"very few, and very quick, Sir."</hi> The Colonel returned to his boats, and repaſſed the water-guards, which the General had much conſidence would have releaſed him; for on paſſing the laſt, he obſerved to the Colonel, "Sir, I did not think it poſſible you could eſcape the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the water-guards." This was a brilliant affair; and Congreſs duly rewarded Col. Barton for his diſtinguiſhed addreſs and gallantry.</p>

            <p>16th.—A number of Americans, who had left the northern army when it retreated, as is generally the caſe on ſimilar occaſions, came to Boſton; they were immediately taken up and conſined, to be ſent back again: the beſt method in like caſes.</p>
            <p>19th.—At evening an expreſs paſſed through Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, on his way to Philadelphia, with diſpatches which had been brought to Portſmouth, (N.

4th.—Intelligence was received that Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was moving with the main army towards Philadelphia, and had detached Gen. Glover with his brigade to join the northern army. An account was received that there had been a ſkirmiſh on Wood Creek, between a party of the Americans and the enemy, to the advantage of the former.</p>
            <p>6th.—Intelligence was received that the American northern army had fallen back to Saratoga. About this time, a party of the enemy landed on Boſton Neck (ſo called) in Rhode-Iſland: they were driven off without doing much damage. The ſame day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence was received, that on the 23d of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding month the Britiſh fleet failed from Sandy Hook, and had arrived off the Capes of Delaware.</p>
            <p>8th.—Intelligence was received, that the Britiſh fleet ſailed out of the Capes of Delaware on the 31ſt ult. ſtanding to the eaſtward. This induced Gen. Waſhington to retrograde the main American army towards the North River.</p>
            <p>11th.—There was a report that the northern ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had fallen back to Stillwater. One ſixth part of the militia in a number of the counties of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts were ordered to be detached and marched im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to reinforce the northern army.</p>
            <p>14th.—Intelligence was received, that the Britiſh fleet had returned again to the Capes of Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. Col. Johnſon and St. Leger were advancing with a body of the enemy towards Fort Schuyler, on the Mohawk River.</p>
            <p>About this time, a Miſs M'Crea, ſaid to be a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful young lady, and in all the innocence of youth, her father warmly engaged on the ſide of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and ſhe on the very point of marriage with a Britiſh officer, on ſome diſpute between two Indians, as to which of them ſhe of right belonged as a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:033865_0122_0FF96040E789B440"/>ſhe was moſt inhumanly maſſacred! The act was probably as abhorrent to the Britiſh as to the Americans; but they ought not to have engaged the favages in their cauſe, as they might well have known their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngovernable temper, and diſpoſition for blood; for this was not the only inſtance. A Britiſh officer ſending his waiter to a ſpring for ſome cool water, in a few minutes an Indian came in, with the ſcalp of the waiter ſmoaking in his hand.</p>
            <p>St. Leger having gone up the Mohawk to reduce Fort Schuyler, Gen. Burgoyne determined to ſend out another ſtrong detachment on his left, towards Bennington. The command of this detachment was given to Lieut. Col. Baum, a Heſſian; and Col. Breyman, with another detachment, was ordered to cover and ſupport Baum. Theſe were met by the brave Gen. Stark, who gave them a complete lover throw. On the morning of the 16th, 32 officers and near 700 men were taken priſoners, with 4 light field-pieces, nearly 1,000 arms, a quantity of ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fort Schuyler was cloſely beſieged by St. Leger; and the brave Col.

               </gap>. Gen. Arnold marched with a ſufficient detachment to raiſe the ſiege. As ſoon as St. Leger learnt his approach, he ſent off ſome Indians, as if friends, to
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:033865_0123_0FF96110CB1DE6C8"/>meet Arnold, and inform him that St. Leger had received a ſtrong reinforcement, and adviſed Arnold to halt and wait for a reinforcement himſelf—then abandoned the ſiege with precipitation, leaving his tents ſtanding, his baggage, artillery, &amp;c. behind him. Thus were both Burgoyne's wings effectually clipped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> 1ſt.—Intelligence was received, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much manoeuvring, Howe's fleet came to anchor in Cheſapeak Bay, on the 21ſt ult. conſiſting of near 200 ſail, and it was expected he would ſoon land his troops. The 24th, Gen. Waſhington's army was on full march to meet Howe, and then within 5 miles of Philadelphia. A valuable cargo arrived ſafe from Spain; among other articles, a large number of ſhoes, hoſe, blankets, ſhirts, cordage, duck, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2d.—Intelligence was received, that Gen. Howe's army had landed at the Head of Elk. A detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Gen. Sullivan's diviſion a little before this time made an excurſion on to Staten-Iſland, and brought off ſeveral hundred priſoners, and a large quantity of baggage. The American loſs was ſaid to be about 60, including officers.</p>
            <p>5th.—Four hundred and one priſoners, taken near Bennington by Gen. Stark, were eſcorted to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; they conſiſted of Britiſh, Brunſwick and Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian troops.</p>
            <p>9th.—Capt. Harden arrived at Boſton in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut State ſhip of 20 guns: he brought in with him a Jamaica packet, which he took during his cruize. It was ſaid the packet had a large ſum in ſpecie on board; and a Mr. Shirley and family, on their paſſage to England. The laſt accounts ſtated both Gen. Waſhington's and the northern army to be near the enemy; and important news might be momently expected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="unknown:033865_0124_0FF9604C71F206A8"/>
19th.—Col. Lee's regiment moved into Boſton.</p>
            <p>20th.—The diſagreeable news was received, that on the 11th inſt. a ſevere action took place between Gen. Waſhington's and Howe's armies, near the Brandywine, which ended rather in favour of the latter, who remained maſters of the field. The Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh here, as in ſeveral other inſtances, had recourſe to ſtratagem: they held out the appearance of an intention of forcing their way at Chad's Ford, which Gen. Kniphauſen menaced with a heavy column of Heſſians; while the Britiſh column, by a long cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitous march, reached the forks of the river, and there ſecured a ſafe paſſage. Gen. Waſhington was pretty early apprized of this movement, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took meaſures for ſtrengthening his right, by ordering ſome troops from his left. After the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had become pretty warm on the right, and the Britiſh had got the advantage, Kniphauſen paſſed Chad's Ford; and although the troops who were ſtill on the left behaved well, they were by no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> ſufficient to reſiſt the heavy column of Heſſians. It is ſaid, that after the Heſſian Grenadiers had croſſed the Ford, they halted at the foot of the hill, below the Americans, under a warm fire, and with great deliberation changed their hats for their heavy bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s caps, which were carried by a loop on a button at the hip, and then aſcended the hill, from which the Americans were obliged to retire. Here the brave Capt. Bryant, of the artillery, who had before ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times diſtinguiſhed himſelf under the eye of our General, received a muſquet-ball in the bottom of his belly; a brother officer carried him off the field, but he died of the wound. Gen. Waſhington, ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onded by his officers, did every thing in their power to check the Britiſh; and a part of the American army took a poſition which probably ſaved the army
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:033865_0125_0FF8D64073C88BC8"/>from a total defeat. Perhaps the American army were, more or leſs, more generally engaged in this action, than in any other during the war. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican loſs was conſiderable in killed and wounded, and a number of pieces of braſs field artillery were loſt. The Britiſh alſo ſuffered pretty ſeverely in killed and wounded.</p>
            <p>The next night, Gen. Gray made, with much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, an attack on a body of Americans, under the command of Gen. Wayne: the bayonet was chiefly made uſe of, and it proved but too efficacious againſt the Americans, who ſuffered conſiderable loſs, in killed and wounded. Gen. Waſhington retreated firſt to Philadelphia, and then left the city. The Britiſh army a few days afterwards advanced to Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantown, and on the 27th a detachment of their army took poſſeſſion of Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>23d.—Gen. Waſhington's orders for ſending for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Colonels Lee's, Henley's and Jackſon's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were received by our General.</p>
            <p>24th.—Several prizes were ſent in by a privateer brig belonging to Col. Sears.</p>
            <p>25th.—Intelligence was received, that on Friday, the 19th inſtant, there was a warm and bloody action between Gen. Gates's and Burgoyne's advanced troops, which laſted until dark. The troops behaved with the greateſt bravery on both ſides. Col. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan's light corps, and eleven other American regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were more or leſs engaged. Of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, 2 Lieutenant-Colonels, Coburn and Adams, 3 Captains, 3 Subalterns, and 56 non-commiſſioned officers and privates were killed, and 248 wounded. The loſs of the enemy was very conſiderable, and much greater than that of the Americans. On the 18th, the day preceding the foregoing battle, Col. Brown made an excurſion in the enemy's rear to Lake

               <hi>October</hi> 2d.—Intelligence was received, that on the 16th, Gen.

This officer, as before mentioned, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to come to America, to take the command of the artille<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>6th.—Col. H. Jackſon's regiment encamped on Boſton common, and the next day, about noon, marched out of town for the army; the regiment, although ſmall, made a good appearance. About the ſame time that the regiment marched out of town, upwards of 100 Britiſh and Canadian priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, taken near Lake George, by Col.

<pb n="129" facs="unknown:033865_0127_0FF96123855E2540"/>towards Peek's Kill. Gen. Waſhington, after he left Philadelphia, encamped near a place called Skippack Creek, about 16 miles from German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town.</p>
            <p>13th.—At 3 o'clock, A. M. an expreſs arrived from Gen. Gates's army, with an account that on Tueſday, the 7th inſt. a ſmart action took place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the right of Gen. Burgoyne's army, and the American left, when the enemy were repulſed, drove back to their works, and then forced from them. Three Field-Officers, 6 Captains, 10 Subalterns, 1 Quarter-Maſter-General, and 190 privates were taken priſoners, beſides 300 taken in the hoſpital—8 pieces of braſs cannon, 2 twelve and 6 ſix pounders, 3 am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition-waggons, 300 tents, 200 barrels of flour, and a large quantity of baggage were trophies of victory. One hundred of the enemy lay dead on the ground. The American loſs, although not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly known, was ſaid not to be more than 30 killed and 100 wounded; among the latter, Generals Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold and Lincoln, both in the leg, the former but ſlightly; it was problematical whether the latter was wounded by a Britiſh or American ſoldier. Gen. Frazer, an enterpriſing officer of the Britiſh, was mortally wounded, and died of his wounds.</p>
            <p>15th.—Intelligence was received, that a body of the Britiſh from New-York, in about 30 tranſports, had proceeded up the Hudſon; they had made ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral landings below and at Peek's Kill: on Monday the 6th inſt. they croſſed over, and landed on the weſt ſide of the river, and marched along the hills towards Fort Montgomery and its dependencies: this fort was tolerably ſituated on the bank of the Hudſon, to annoy ſhipping going up the river; and the works were pretty good on that ſide, but were not ſo, nor fully completed on the back ſide; and the right flank was commanded by higher ground
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:033865_0128_0FF9606E66761D78"/>on the ſouth, and near the fort, on the other ſide of Pooplop's Creek, the mouth of which was near to the ſouth ſide of the fort; on this higher ground, and near to the ſmall deep pond, a ſtrong redoubt, called Clinton, was erected; it was equally eſſential that this redoubt ſhould be taken, as a reduction of the fort: the Britiſh therefore moved againſt this redoubt, while another column, by a more circuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous movement, fell in the rear of Fort Montgom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery; they were met in the defiles, where the ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes were ſharp; but they continued to advance to the redoubt, which was nobly defended, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which they ſuſtained very conſiderable loſs, (a number of their ſlain were afterwards drawn out of the pond, where they had been thrown for conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) but ſoon carried it, and afterwards Fort Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery. The garriſon principally made their eſcape in the duſk of the evening; among them were Gov. Clinton, and his brother, who was a Brigadier-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral alſo: they made their eſcape in a very hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, and the latter was wounded. After the reduction of Fort Montgomery, the Americans evacuated Fort Conſtitution, and the block-houſe on Conſtitution Iſland, oppoſite to Weſt Point (the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not yet fortified;) and the two new frigates, <hi>Congreſs</hi> and <hi>Montgomery,</hi> which lay in the river, were ſet on fire by the Americans and burnt. The enemy afterwards proceeded up the river, and burnt Eſopus; their object was if poſſible to form a junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Burgoyne, or open a water communication to Albany; and ſpies paſſed between them.</p>
            <p>16th.—Two or three of the enemy's cruizers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the bay, but a few leagues from the Light. While the Britiſh army lay encamped at German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, Gen. Waſhington reſolved to attack them. This was a brave deſign; and the ſucceſs of the firſt onſet, at about 3 o'clock, A. M. of the 4th inſt. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:033865_0129_0FF96132320782A8"/>the Americans had marched all the night, was equal to the deſign; for the Britiſh, where the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack was ſirſt made, were almoſt inſtantly puſhed from their ground, and were falling back panic ſtruck on their other troops. When Lieut. Col. Muſgrove had the preſence of mind to throw ſeveral companies into a ſtrong ſtone houſe. Houſes at all times, and eſpecially thoſe of ſtone and brick, under a judicious conduct, admit of a good defence; and at this time probably proved the means of the Americans' loſing an advantage, which no one can tell how far it might have been puſhed. When an enemy is routed, and panic ſtruck are flying before the aſſailants, the beſt, if not the only way, is to follow them, if the ground will admit of it, cloſe at their heels, taking care not to fall into ambuſcades. Thus the panic of fear continues to multiply; but if the purſuers ſtop, and eſpecially if thoſe who were flying hear a firing behind them, but not upon them, they conclude that their own troops in turn have gotten an advantage, or at leaſt are holding their purſuers at bay. This immediately recovers them from their panic; they will next return to the charge, and will be more likely to make an obſtinate reſiſtance than before they were at firſt routed; while their return to the charge will greatly damp thoſe who before conſidered themſelves almoſt in the graſp of victory. Hence what took place at Germantown was no wonder. The foggineſs of the morning was unfortunate for the Americans; but the Britiſh taking poſſeſſion of the ſtone houſe, and defending it, was the moſt unfortunate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The loſs on both ſides was conſiderable; on the ſide of the Americans, Brig. Gen. Naſh, and on the ſide of the Britiſh, Brig. Gen. Agnew, were among the ſlain: but although this attempt
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:033865_0130_0FF96078B8041A68"/>was not crowned with victory, it cauſed the Britiſh to have a more reverential opinion of Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, whom they now found dare to attack their whole army, even in a choſen poſition of their own. Perhaps it was beſt that the action cloſed as it did; had the Americans made their way far into the long ſtreet of that town, probably many other houſes would have been occupied in the ſame way. The burying-yard, with a ſtrong wall, was lined with troops by the enemy; and the poſition in which their army lay, was calculated for their wings cloſing in to much advantage; at any rate, the battle muſt have been very bloody, and ſituation and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were in favour of the Britiſh. After the Britiſh were in poſſeſſion of Philadelphia, they had much to do in order to get poſſeſſion of the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and remove the obſtructions which had been formed in it. There were alſo ſeveral works to be reduced; among others, a fort on Mud-Iſland, and a pretty ſtrong work at Red Bank.</p>
            <p>22d.—Highly important and moſt intereſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence was received, that on the 17th inſt. Gen. Burgoyne and his whole army ſurrendered, under Convention. They were to be marched to then eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Boſton, and from thence ſent to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Upon the receipt of this news, the cannon on Fort Hill were diſcharged, and joy was ſeated on every brow.</p>
            <p>23d.—At 1 o'clock, P. M. the cannon on Fort Hill, and on the heights of Dorcheſter were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and alſo on board the ſhips in the harbour. In the evening, our General's quarters (the houſe of the late Hon. Mr. Ruſſel) was beautifully illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. The following is the number of troops which ſurrendered to Maj. Gen. Gates, and the ſtate of Gen. Burgoyne's army after he left Canada:

            <p>Thus were the Britiſh totally diſappointed in this quarter. The troops intended to form a junction on the Hudſon were as high up as Poughkeepſie; and Gen. Burgoyne informed our General after he arrived at Boſton, that on the evening after he had propoſed to Gen. Gates to ſurrender, in caſe he could obtain honourable terms, which were to be ſettled the next day, a ſpy came in to him from the troops down the river, ſtating how far they had got up, and what ſteps were next to be taken; on which he (Gen. Burgoyne) aſſembled his officers more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally than uſual in councils, and ſtated to them the circumſtances and ſituation of both armies, and whether, conſiſtently with fair principles of honour, they could break off the negociation for an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Convention, or not; when it was the unanimous opinion of every officer preſent that they could not.
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:033865_0132_0FF96086935D69A8"/>But in a ſituation like his, at that moment, danger at hand is more powerful on the mind, than the hope of relief at a diſtance. The troops who were up the river returned down.</p>
            <p>The capture of Gen. Burgoyne and his whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who were now on their way to Boſton, opened a new, important, and delicate field for our General. This army, in which there were many officers of military erudition, and ſome of reſined and courtly manners, who had a high opinion of national hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and proweſs, and who, in conſequence of the Convention which they had formed, had their ſpirits by no means depreſſed, as thoſe who are compelled to ſurrender at diſcretion, —were ſure to lay a heavy taſk on his ſhoulders. As ſoon as he was notified that theſe troops were coming under his direction, he ſet himſelf in earneſt to prepare for their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The barracks at Proſpect and Winter Hills were directed to be put inſtantly in order. The Council was applied to, to aid in the procurement of quarters from the citizens for the officers; nor was this an eaſy taſk. The families of the citizens generally wanting the room in their reſpective houſes, rendered it difficult to obtain ſo many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as were neceſſary for ſo great a number, and extended the limits of the parole very conſiderably. The Council were diſpoſed to do every thing in their power, and gave orders accordingly whenever they were neceſſary. A heavy duty was alſo falling on the Quarter-Maſter's department, as it reſpected quarters, and alſo fuel, the latter of which, had been rendered ſcarce in the vicinity, by the American ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my having been here in 1775; and the enemy's cruizers prevented its being brought from the eaſtern country. But the exertions of Col. Chaſe, who was Deputy-Quarter-Maſter-General, and the aſſiſtants
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:033865_0133_0FF8D64B54566FA8"/>and conductors in his department, and of Col. Davis, who was Deputy-Barrack-Maſter, and who, in the procurement of fuel, was indefatigable, a comſorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupply was obtained. Before the arrival of the troops at Cambridge, our General had digeſted and drafted a parole, and ſeveral articles for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the troops in quarters; theſe he had drawn in as an article in the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e; and the honour of the officers in this way, was p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edged for their obſervance of the articles, which rendered the government of them much eaſier; being thus bound to govern themſelves with propriety, or infringe their paroles; knowing that many things in minutiae, would be to ſettle, which would be tedious in an epiſtolary way. As ſcon as General Burgoyne had arrived at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, our General ſent over one of his Aid-de-camps to invite Gen. Burgoyne to dine with him the next day, bringing with him his two Major-Generals, Phillips and Reideſel. An elegant dinner was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and many other gentlemen invited, among whom were Generals Glover of Maſſachuſetts, and Whipple of New-Hampſhire, who were at the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and had commanded the eſcort, &amp;c. from Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atoga to Cambridge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> 8th.—Our General ſent one of his Aids to accompany Gen. Burgoyne and the other officers into Boſton, by the way of Roxbury; they arrived ſome time before dinner, as was intended, that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might be conſidered. The parole was ſhewn to them, and the articles for their government in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with which they were well pleaſed. But here a diſcovery was firſt made of ſomething which they wiſhed to retain, while in our country, and which our General would never for a moment allow. Gen. Phillips turning to our General, obſerved, "Sir, you well know the diſpoſition of ſoldiers, and that they
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:033865_0134_0FF96093EDB176C8"/>will more or leſs in all armies commit ſome diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; ſuppoſe you ſhould delegate to Gen. Burgoyne the power of ſeeing <hi>your</hi> orders executed." Our General replied, that he knew the diſpoſition of ſoldiers, and alſo the neceſſity of order and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; that he was not only willing, but expected that Gen. Burgoyne, and every other officer, would exert themſelves to keep order; that for this purpoſe among themſelves, and for internal order and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he might command and puniſh as might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be neceſſary; but in no caſe to attempt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ital puniſhment. But as to the exerciſe of his own command, and enforcement of his own orders when neceſſary, was a juriſdiction which Gen. Burgoyne muſt not expect to exerciſe while here. Gen. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne ſmiled, and Gen. Phillips turned it off by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "I only meant it for your eaſement, Sir."</p>
            <p>Before dinner was done, ſo great was the curiofity of the citizens of both ſexes, and of all ages and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, to get a peep at Gen. Burgoyne, that the ſtreets were filled, the doors, windows, the tops of the houſes and fences crowded. Gen. Burgoyne had aſked our General if he would indulge him to go out of town by the way of Charleſtown, which was inſtantly granted. When he was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, our General told him that he ſhould accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him to the ferry; and a proceſſion was formed, the American gentlemen mixing with the Britiſh, The ſtreets were ſo crowded, that it was difficult getting along; but not a word or a geſture that was diſreſpectful. When arrived oppoſite to the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince-Houſe, Gen. Burgoyne turned round to the other Generals, and obſerved, "There is the former reſidence of the Governor;" when ſome perſon on the ſide of the ſtreet, and in a tone fully to be heard, added, <hi>"and on the other ſide is the riding-ſchool;"</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="unknown:033865_0135_0FF9614553507D10"/>alluding to the Old South Meeting-Houſe, having been put to that uſe in 1775: but the General, who muſt have heard it, made no reply, but ſoon after obſerved, "Sir, I am aſtoniſhed at the civility of your people; for were you walking the ſtreets of London in my ſituation, you would not eſcape in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult." When arrived at the ferry-ways, the crowd were down to the water's edge; but when the boat put off, there was not the leaſt indecency, or wry countenance diſcovered.—O my dear country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men! how did this your dignified conduct at that moment charm my very ſoul! Such conduct flows from a <hi>greatneſs of mind,</hi> that goes to conquer a world.</p>
            <p>Col. Keith was appointed Deputy-Adjutant-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, and Maj. Swaſey Town-Major.</p>
            <p>14th.—The Council were ſtill deliberating on the ſubject of quarters, and determined to do every thing in their power; but ſome individuals were refractory.</p>
            <p>19th.—Gen. Hancock arrived in town, and was ſaluted by the diſcharge of the cannon of the Fort, Park, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>22d.—Intelligence was received of the repulſe of the enemy, before the redoubt at Red Bank, on the 22d ult. This redoubt or fort had a garriſon by no means ſufficient properly to man the whole work. The commanding officer had therefore wiſely leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, by running a parapet with a ditch acroſs the area of the fort, but had left the work entire in its largeſt extent. A body of choſen troops were ſent to reduce this work, under the command of the Heſſian Col. Donop, a brave and good officer. In order if poſſible to get ſome idea of the work, he ſent his ſummons for the fort to ſurrender by a very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Adjutant; but the Commandant of the fort took care to have him ſtopped without the work, and
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:033865_0136_0FF960A023F3C410"/>where he had no opportunity to ſee more than the ditch and parapet on that ſide. The commanding officer refuſing to ſurrender, an aſſault was made; the aſſailants at the head of the column bringing in their hands a ſufficient number of ſhort faſcines to fill the ditch where they meant to paſs, which was well done, and the parapet was mounted; but to their diſappointment and ſurpriſe, they now found there was another ditch and parapet to paſs, and in the face of a dreadful fire too, which made great ſlaughter; a number of them, however, advanced into the ſecond ditch, and began to remove the frizes on the berme; but theſe were generally killed in the ditch, and ſuch as were not killed or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obliged to quit the outer work. Their loſs in killed and wounded was great; among the latter, Col. Donop mortally; he was taken after the action n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar the fort, and brought in. An Enſign had made his way over the ſecond ditch, had got on to the frizes, and lay cloſe againſt the baſe of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet until the action was over, and then got up and ſurrendered, obſerving that he thought his poſition the only ſafe one; for had he attempted to put his head above the parapet, he knew his brains would have been inſtantly blown out; or if he had attempted to re-croſs the ditch, he ſhould have been ſhot in the back. Beſides this ſevere check, the Britiſh met with conſiderable oppoſition and loſs at other places, before they got full and peaceable poſſeſſion of the river; particularly at Mud Iſland. They loſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta man-of-war, and ſuffered other naval damage.</p>
            <p>Gen. Waſhington being now conſiderably rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with a part of the northern conquering army, advanced to White Marſh, about 14 miles from Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia, where he encamped, in a ſtrong and well choſen poſition. Gen. Howe, apprehenſive that this
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:033865_0137_0FF9615288E57B28"/>movement indicated a deſign upon Philadelphia, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to move out, and either invite Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington to a general action, or, if he found him vulner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to attack him in his own poſition. Accordingly, on the evening of the 4th of December, he marched with the Britiſh army, and on the next morning took poſt on Cheſnut Hill, in front of the American right. Gen. Waſhington, knowing the goodneſs of his poſition, wiſely continued in it; nor dare Gen. Howe attack him. The latter then changed his ground to a new poſition, oppoſite to the American left and centre; but neither dare he attack either of theſe. Several ſkirmiſhes took place, as is uſual in ſuch caſes; in one of which Brig. Gen. Irwin on the American ſide was wounded. After ſeveral days ſpent in this way, Howe was obliged to return, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effecting any thing, to the no ſmall injury of his army, who had ſuffered much from the inclemency of the ſeaſon. Indeed nothing is more deſtructive to an army than winter campaigns. After this, Gen. Waſhington moved the American army to Valley Forge, on the Schuylkill, about 16 miles from Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia, where he took a poſition as wiſely choſen as the other, and where the army erected huts for the winter.</p>
            <p>We now return to take up our chain of events.</p>
            <p>23d.—A French ſhip, with dry goods from France, by the way of St. Peters, arrived at Boſton.</p>
            <p>Gen. Burgoyne had not yet ſigned the parole; he pretended to delay until their quarters were fully furniſhed, although he had every aſſurance that it ſhould be done as faſt as circumſtances would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly admit. On this day, therefore, our Gen. wrote him the following letter.</p>

            <p>23d.—Gen. Burgoyne wrote an anſwer to the foregoing. But he now acknowledged a further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the ſupreme power, than in his former letter; but ſtill at leaſt obliquely denied the right of their interference with the Convention troops, who were under expreſs ſtipulations until they quitted the country, and that no new conditions could be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them; and aſſerting that no ſuch requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were laid upon the American priſoners in Canada; and concluding, that if it could be found that ſuch had been required by the Britiſh in any caſe, he would ſubmit to it. About this time, an officer, who had been a priſoner in Canada, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Boſton on parcle, and gave information that he and others had complied with ſimilar injunctions
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:033865_0142_0FF960BA33DB5460"/>before they came away; upon this being communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Gen. Burgoyne, he found that he had got to the end of his tether of evaſion; he did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſpute more, but obſerved, that he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed if it was done any time before the troops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, it would anſwer the purpoſe. Our General found that nothing could be done by force, for were he to attempt of himſelf to have the liſts taken, ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing might be evaded except the ſize and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. He therefore laid the matter before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, with the copies of what had paſſed. Congreſs took the matter into conſideration, and Preſident I aurens wrote our General an approbation of his conduct, and not to puſh the matter, as Congreſs wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>December.</hi>—Congreſs had received ſome intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that an application would be made to them for leave for the troops of the Convention to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark at ſome other place than Boſton; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the 1ſt of December paſſed a reſolution, that no other place than that ſtipulated in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, viz. <hi>Boſton</hi> ſhould be admitted. A few days after, Gen. Burgoyne applied, as was ſuſpected, but to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Congreſs alſo paſſed reſolutions that all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of proviſions and other neceſſaries furniſhed to the troops of the Convention ſhould be paid for in ſpecie, or replaced in quantity and quality.</p>

1778. <hi>January.</hi>—Gen. Burgoyne had now got himſelf into a very ſerious entanglement; he had not only refuſed, and then delayed to give deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive liſts of the troops of the Convention, but ſome time before, viz. in the month of November, had written a letter to Gen. Gates, complaining that the troops had not been furniſhed with quarters as they had a right to expect, and among other things a paragraph as follows:
"While I ſtate to you, Sir, this very unexpected treatment, I entirely acquit Maj. Gen. Heath and every gentleman of the military department of any inattention to the public ſaith engaged in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. They do what they can; but while the Supreme Powers of the State are unable or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enforce their authority, and the inhabitants want the hoſpitality, or indeed the common civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to aſſiſt us without it, the public faith is broke, and we are the immediate ſufferers."</p>
            <p>This was unreaſonable, as it reſpected both the civil power, and the people; for the former did every thing in their power, unleſs they had turned the citizens out of their houſes to have let the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention officers in, which was not to be expected: nor could it be ſuppoſed that the ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>izens would turn their families themſelves into the ſtreets. But Congreſs conſidered the conduct of Gen. Burgoyne, and theſe and other of his expreſſions on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as calling for ſerious conſideration. They therefore inveſtigated the whole in all its latitudes; and the Preſident of Congreſs wrote our General that as it was a matter of high importance, and required deep deliberation, it would probably occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſome days; before the reſolutions would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted. But that, in caſe the ſleet arrived before the papers were ſent to him, to forbid the embarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <pb n="146" facs="unknown:033865_0144_0FF960BEC98FFF80"/>
Gen. Burgoyne had received intimations that a fleet of tranſports were about to come round for the troops, and that the <hi>Juno</hi> frigate was to wear a flag for his particular accommodation. This he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to our General, and wiſhed to know if the frigate might come up into the harbour. Our General had no apprehenſions of any danger from a frigate entering the harbour, but apprehended that ſome people might think that he was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently vigilant, in caſe he allowed it. He therefore told Gen. Burgoyne that the frigate could not come up into the harbour, and hinted to him the taking one of the moſt convenient tranſports in the fleet for the purpoſe; and he might do as he pleaſed when he got off. This touched Gen. Burgoyne exceedingly, who wrote a letter to our General, in which was the following paragraph.</p>

            <p>Thus did the Admiral's opinion perfectly coincide with that of our General's.</p>
            <p>But Congreſs had paſſed a reſolution, on the 8th day of January, upon principles clearly expreſſed in a report of a committee, upon which the reſolution was founded.</p>
            <p>"That the embarkation of Lieut. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n. Burgoyne, and the troops under his command, be ſuſpended, till a diſtinct and explicit ratification of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saratoga ſhall be properly notified by the Court of Great-Britain, to Congreſs."</p>
            <p>Our General's correſpondence with Gen. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, reſpecting the frigate, &amp;c. was tranſmitted to Congreſs, and the Preſident ſoon after wrote him—</p>
            <p>"The Houſe appeared to be pleaſed with your "conduct in every reſpect relative to that oflicer."</p>
            <p>Gen. Burgoyne applied to Congreſs for leave to go to Europe himſelf; but Congreſs did not then
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:033865_0147_0FF9619FAA14E748"/>think proper to grant his requeſt. Although this denial muſt have been very painful to the General, he did not expreſs himſelf, or write any thing in the leaſt improper. He obſerved to our General, that he was ſorry; for that not only his health urged his departure, but that every day he was detained here, gave his enemies at home an opportunity for pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wound of his reputation the deeper.</p>
            <p>But Col. Kingſton was not ſo prudent as the General: a packet of letters which Gen. Burgoyne wiſhed to ſend to Gen. Howe, was ſent to our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral for inſpection; among theſe was one from Col. Kingſton to Lord Harcourt, in which, after obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that fortune had not ſhewn them the ſmooth ſide of her face, yet they thought their misfortunes honourable, proceeded, that he, (Gen. Burgoyne) was not well, but you know his ſirmneſs. But I think, "the inſincerity of France, bigotry of Spain, or the vindictive Portugueſe, ſituated as he is, would not have ſought for means unneceſſarily to detain him." This inſult to the authority of the country induced our General to detain this letter, and he notified Gen. Burgoyne of it, adding, that while it was his wiſh to gratify the officers as much as poſſible in writing to their friends, he expected they would be cautious and prudent in their manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. When the American Deputy-Adjutant-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral gave the letter from our General to Gen. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, and he had read it, he obſerved, "I told Col. Kingſton that Gen. Heath would not let that letter paſs;" he ſhould have done more—forbid his mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the attempt.</p>
            <p>Another ſerious matter took place about this time: Col. Henley, who had the immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at Cambridge, a brave and good officer, but warm and quick in his natural temper, having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

               </gap>ted him, as he judged, with much inſolence; upon which he pricked him with a ſword, or bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. Gen. Burgoyne immediately preſented a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt Col. Henley, charging him with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and wanton conduct, and intentional murder, as appears in the following letter.</p>

What provocations you allude to, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been offered by my troops, I am at loſs to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.

                  <p>"I have been informed of late, that ſome have hinted, that ſuch of your troops as break my orders, ought to be tried and puniſhed by your orders. Even the mention of ſuch a thing, I conceive to be (to uſe your own words in a late letter, with a little variation) a ſort of inſult, that a man of military erudition in any country would be aſhamed of, as being repugnant to every idea of military diſcipline; and from my opinion of your military knowledge, I cannot admit that you ever hinted it.</p>

Complaints of moſt enormous abuſes, have lately been made to me; one, of the conduct of a number of officers on the evening or night of the 25th of December, at Bradiſh's tavern; others, of priſoners being reſcued from the guards—centinels ouſed and inſulted on their poſts—paſſes counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, and others filled up in the moſt affrontive manner; and of late, ſeveral highway robberies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the environs of the grarriſon—one the laſt evening, in which a gentleman was robbed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 7 and 800 dollars, and a watch. The rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baries I do not charge to your people, as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luown who were the perpetrators; but there are ſeveral reaſons to ſuſpect it. All theſe, Sir, tend nor only to exaſperate the troops, but to enrage the inhabitants of the country, who view ſuch abuſes as unfufferable. I therefore call upon you to exert your endeavours to ſuppreſs all abuſes, as far as is in your power.</p>

            <p>Gen. Burgoyne found fault, that a Court of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry only was appointed, and not a Court-Martial. He was anſwered, that this was frequently the caſe; that it did not preclude the latter; and where an officer of rank, and in particular one who had the immediate command was the object, this previous ſtep was both juſtifiable and proper. The Court of Inquiry met, and gave in their opinion; and in the general orders of January 18th, the following was announced:—</p>
            <p>"The Court, whereof Brig. Gen. Glover was Preſident, appointed by the orders of the 10th inſt, to inquire into the grounds of a complaint exhibited by Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne againſt Col.

            <p>Many people having grown jealous that the troops of the Convention had collected and ſecreted arms in the barracks, they could not be quieted until the matter was aſcertained; and on the 18th, our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ordered a ſtrict ſearch to be made, when noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was found but the officer's fuzees, to which by the Convention they had a right. A <hi>wag,</hi> coming from the barracks, was aſked if any thing was found; he anſwered, "Yes—in one of the rooms a large braſs mortar." This ſpread, and was alarming to be ſure. The fact was, that in one of the rooms there was a large bell-metal peſtle and mortar, for family uſe. Jealouſy, like the other paſſions, although a virtue in itſelf, may exceed its bounds; and when it does, "trifles, light as air, to jealous minds are ſtrong as proofs of holy writ."</p>
            <p>Capt. Dalrymple wrote to Gen. Burgoyne again, an the 15th, and propoſed to put the ſpare provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on board one of the flags, and ſend them up to Boſton harbour.</p>
            <p>But on the 23d, Capt. Brathwait of the Centurion, wrote the General that he had arrived at Cape Cod, with orders from Viſcount Howe for the men-of-war and tranſports with the proviſions on board them to return to Rhode-Iſland, which they did accordingly.</p>

            <p>19th.—General Burgoyne having again applied to Congreſs for leave to go to England himſelf, they now gave him liberty.

Our General replied that he ſuppoſed that honourable body were ſerious in all their reſolutions. He then replied that this was unjuſt for the odds was double; and appealed to our General to ſay whether he thought it juſt himſelf? Our General anſwered, that as an executive officer, it was not for him to judge of determine whether the orders of his ſuperiors were juſt or not. General Burgoyne replied, that was true. He was then told, that if he did not chooſt to pay for the ſupplies, the act allowed him as replace them, in quality and quantity; and this
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:033865_0159_0FF8D67DC0A61B70"/>ſeemed to remove his objections.

If you will give me a memorandum, on my arrival in England, I will with great pleaſure forward them to you." Our General thanked him for his politeneſs, but was careful not to mention any, chooſing rather to ſuffer with his fellow-countrymen the neceſſities of the times, than to avail himſelf of ſo excluſive a favour.</p>

By the foregoing it appears, that the Britiſh were allowed to replace any and all the ſupplies which were furniſhed to them, and in that way might make all the ſavings in their power; and certainly they ought to be checked, if they attempted to deſtroy that currency on which the States had ſolely to rely for the proſecution of the war, which had been <hi>forced</hi> upon them by this ſame power.</p>

                  <p>"When by the treaty of Convention of Saratoga the officers were to be admitted on parole, it was clearly intended that a liberal interpretation was to be given of that agreement; and, to uſe your own words, generous limits were to be granted. I will not deny that the limits have been ſufficient.</p>

"I apprehend, Sir, that under no ſenſe or expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the treaty, the officers were to be denied intercourſe with the ſoldiers—indeed, there is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle particularly on that point; and by reſtricting me to my quarters, allowing me only the paſſage to the barracks by the direct road, you would certainly have reſtricted me as you have done ſeveral other of ficers, from whom you have taken the benefit of their parole, allowing for the diſtinction of my rank, having obtained a quarter inſtead of a barrack: it ſeemed therefore a very extraordinary propoſal made to me that I ſhould ſign a parole under a reſtriction which deprived me of any advantage ariſing from my giving one, according to the article on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the treaty of Convention of Saratoga; and on this conſideration I refuſed it.</p>
                  <p>"You have, Sir, made me a priſoner in my quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, under a guard, and I am perfectly at eaſe about it—ſhall bear it, Sir, and any other violence of power which may happen to me, with more patience than you may ſuppoſe. I am very regardleſs about inſults or injuries done me perſonally—I feel only, and then ſeverely, when any are offered to the troops I command.</p>
                  <p>"But, Sir, you attempt at much more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricting my perſon; for in a paper ſent me this day, being your inſtructions to Lieut. Col. Pollard, dated June 18, 1778, you direct him, after he has planted centinels around my quarters, that he is to "wait on the next ſenior officer, and acquaint him of General Phillips being conſined." I am to inform you, Sir, that, bearing the King's commiſſion, I ſhall conſider myſelf ſenior officer of the troops of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and every officer of them will obey my orders as far as their preſent ſituation will allow. You may confine my perſon, but cannot have power to take
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:033865_0171_0FF9629EBA02E420"/>from me my military place, nor my connexion with the Convention troops—it is too extravagant an idea to ſuppoſe you capable of: ſo little can it be in the power of an individual to deprive me of the commiſſion I hold, that were theſe Colonies really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Independent and Sovereign States, it would not be in the power of their government to deprive an officer of another nation of his military commiſſion, how far ſoever they might ſtretch and extend their power over his perſon. But, Sir, ſmuſt be allowed to declare, that until the Colonies are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Great-Britain to be Independent Sovereign States, I cannot view them in any other light than that in which they are conſidered by Great-Britain.</p>
                  <p>"As you will not allow me to ſend an officer to Sir Henry Clinton, I muſt requeſt to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of your expreſs for ſending my report and rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentations to him; and I will beg to know when I muſt ſend you my letters.</p>

You may be aſſured that the reaſon of my reſtricting you to your quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the day before yeſterday, was perſonally no agreeable ſervice. Duty to the honour and dignity of my country, made it indiſpenſably neceſſary. Apprehending that ſo great a reſtriction from your

I wiſhed that you might retain your quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and at the ſame time have a free intercourſe with the troops who are quartered at a diſtance from you; this diſtance is ſo conſiderable that a parole is neceſſary. I acknowledge that by the Convention, you are to be admitted on parole, and this parole is for propriety of conduct under ſuch admittance; but that parole being forfeited, by miſconduct, ceaſes to be, and conſinement in proportion to the offence, no breach of the Convention, but fully juſtifiable upon every principle of reaſon and juſtice.</p>
                  <p>"It was never in my idea to take away your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or diſſolve your connexion with the troops of the Convention; but, while under confinement, your power of acting might with propriety be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, ſo far as reſpected the tranſacting of public buſineſs between myſelf and you; but perſonal regard has prevented my going that length, any further than to notify the next officer of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</p>
                  <p>"I do not inſiſt that you, as an officer in the Britiſh army, are obliged to view the Free, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and Sovereign States of America, in any other light than they are acknowledged by the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment whoſe ſervice you are in.

The orders given to the centinels being not to allow any officer without ſide-arms, or non-commiſſioned officer, private ſoldier, woman or child, without a written paſſport, to paſs the chain of ſentries. Immediately upon my receiving the report of the officer's being ſhot, and that the centinel was confined, I gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for his being kept ſo, and notice to be given to the Coroner of the county of Middleſex, that a Jury of Inqueſt might ſit on the body for the inveſtigation of the truth of facts; at the ſame time I wrote to Maj.

                  <p>"YOUR favour of yeſterday, came to hand the laſt evening; and, I muſt confeſs, contained matter novel and ſurpriſing to me. What ideas of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partnerſhip in command you have entertained, I cannot tell. From the beginning, I have found a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the ſenior officer of the Convention, to aſſume the right and authority of trying and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing offenders for breaches of my orders. This I ever have and ever ſhall view in no other light than that of inſult. As ſuch, I repreſented it to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne, whoſe good ſenſe and thorough knowledge of diſcipline, led him, in a letter to me of the 13th Jan. to yield the matter in the following words: "I do not mean to deny that you have a right to take juſtice into your own hands." Indeed it is a ſubject, concerning which, having heretofore ſaid and wrote very fully, I ſhall not at this time dwell long upon. As to agreement or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partnerſhip in command, it is abſurd. In military command there muſt be one ſupreme head; at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the Honorable Congreſs have honoured me with the command of this department, and I imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that no officer within its limits would dare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="unknown:033865_0177_0FF962F3DB5A5D78"/>
"My orders, as I have repeatedly heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, ſhall ever be founded on the principles of honour, reaſon and juſtice, and not to infringe thoſe delicate principles in others; ſo I again declare that ſuch my orders ſhall not be broken or diſputed, by any officer or ſoldier, placed under my direction, with impunity. The matter of command is no hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den myſtery; the uſage and cuſtoms of nations are known. The celebrated Vattel, Puffendorff and Grotius, with whoſe writings I dare ſay you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, elegantly explain how an army that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to another, whether the conditions are more or leſs honorary to themſelves, are to conduct whilſt they remain within the limits of the victors' camp, or juriſdiction of their country. But I ſhall not ſpend time to reaſon on a ſubject which would reflect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour on myſelf to allow even to be diſputed. Therefore, to ſum up all in few words—that, as I am determined to treat the troops of the Convention with ſtrict juſtice and generoſity, ſo I am determined that all offenders againſt my ſtanding orders of the garriſon ſhall be brought to proper puniſhment; that I will not allow the ſenior oſlicer of thoſe troops to try or puniſh for any offence againſt my orders; and, that the truth may at all times be properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigated, I ſhall, from time to time, when occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, appoint Courts of Inquiry for that purpoſe; and ſuch as preſume to diſpute or counteract them, I ſhall duly notice.</p>

                  <p>"I HAVE, this morning, written to you a letter upon public matters. I will now affure you, that I am ſorry that my earneſt deſire of preſerving a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of intelligence, between you and I, does not meet your conſent; and I will lament that you will attend to the ſudden reports you receive, ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and act upon them, without that good-humoured attention to me, which I had hoped and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured ſhould ſubſiſt between us. You and I are nearly of an age—I will not diſpute underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with you; but I certainly am an older ſoldier, and muſt neceſſarily know the cuſtoms of armies. Allow me to aſſure you, the manner with which things are taken up ſometimes deviates from military rule. It is a fixed cuſtom to go from the head, downwards; and, when an Enſign oſſends againſt order, the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral</hi> does not condeſcend to altercate with <hi>him,</hi> but ſends his orders, his deſire, or his opinion, to the commanding officers; and, in your ſending meſſages to young officers, it injures your own conſequence, and certainly hurts mine. Believe me, that I am ſtrict againſt any breach of orders, and will never ſuffer it to paſs uncenſured. I allow, the two offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have behaved ill, and I will puniſh them; but the getting the counterſign was an effect of good humour and ſimplicity in an American ſoldier. Let me once more requeſt of you, to recollect your own ſituation, and it will put mine in a clear view to you. Whenever you have reports againſt any of our troops, let me know them, and I will give inſtant attention to them: but you will, I am ſure, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:033865_0179_0FF96315C2FE4410"/>feel, that ſending a threat to two officers, that you would ſend thern on board a priſon-ſhip, and never informing me wherefore, was not ſtrictly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to good humour or good diſcipline.</p>

Nothing of this was in the late tranſactions, that I know of: having received a report of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the two officers, I ordered them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to their quarters, and appointed a Court of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry to examine into the grounds of the complaint, that I might have a clear underſtanding of the affair, and order accordingly. In all caſes where you or the troops of the Convention are immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the orders, I have always directed that you ſhould be ſerved with a copy. As to any threatnings being ſent to the two officers, of confining them on board a guard-ſhip, I know nothing of it.</p>
                  <p>"The main difficulty ſeems to ariſe from your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that you are to try and puniſh all offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers againſt my orders. Here, Sir, notwithſtanding your knowledge and age in ſoldiery, you much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and cannot ſupport thoſe your pretenſions by any rule or authority, civil or military. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you piled your arms, and marched off the ground, you became ſubject to the ſtanding orders of the victor; and in every juriſdiction through which you marched, or where you remain, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to all the orders and laws of the place; and ſuch as violate them are obnoxious to puniſhment. The law and cuſtom of nations explicitly tell us, who are to try and puniſh: and, although I do not in the leaſt doubt your ready diſpoſition to inquire into, and even to puniſh offenders againſt my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders —yet when you attempt it, it is ſuch an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered to my authority, that you may be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ever will raiſe my reſentment; and if it did not, I am conſident that yourſelf (at leaſt hereafter) and

In a word, Sir, cultivate thoſe principles of obedience to orders among the officers in your ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, recommended and inculcated by the cuſtom and uſage of nations, and dictated by reaſon—and you may depend, that I ſhall exert myſelf to make your ſituation as agreeable as poſſible; and you may be alſo aſſured, that I never ſhall require that of the troops of the Convention, which, in the opinion of the juſt and wiſe in any country, ſhall reflect diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our on them.

            <p>The ſame <hi>feelings</hi> which had great weight in the beginning of the war, continued for ſome time, namely, that Great-Britain was one of the greateſt and moſt powerful nations in the world, in arts, and in arms; while the Americans were yet their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies, young, weak, and but barely civilized, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the world, and eſpecially ſo of arts and of arms. Hence we ſee it ſo frequently breaking out, (until experience had taught them a different opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.) There was frequently, as in the atmoſphere, placid intervals; but whenever any croſs wind hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to blow, (and there is no ſeaſon or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances without them) then inſtantly appeared thoſe ideas of ſelf-ſuperiority, and contempt for the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans, which was the true cauſe of many uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hours. Mankind have the ſame paſſions; the difference lies, in ſome riding with a double curb, while others give the reins.</p>
            <p>This Convention buſineſs was a heavy taſk for our General, and the whole ſubject would form an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

            <p>29th.—A Spaniſh xebeck and a French cutter arrived at Boſton, with diſpatches from their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Courts, which were forwarded to Congreſs.</p>
            <p>30th.—Certain intelligence was received, that the Britiſh had left Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 9th.—Intelligence was received, that a warm action happened on the 28th ult. between Gen. Waſhington's and Gen. Clinton's armies, near Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth court-houſe, in the Jerfies. Gen. Clinton, having taken the refolution to move from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia to New-York, through the Jerfies, commenced his movements accordingly, encumbered with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe train of ſtores and baggage, which occupied ſome miles in length; and theſe are the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance to a General, on a march of danger from
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:033865_0184_0FF965F915AFBE18"/>an attack of his opponent, to which he can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>Gen. Waſhington was no ſooner appriſed of this intention and movement of the Britiſh General, than he made his arrangements accordingly, croſſed the Delaware, and puſhed detached corps forward to obſtruct the advance, gall the ſtanks, and fall on the rear of the enemy, while he moved on with the body of his army. By the 27th, Gen. Clinton had got on as far as Monmouth, and Gen. Waſhington's detached troops were on his ſtanks, and cloſe on his rear. Here the Britiſh General took a wiſe reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make at ſtand with a part of his beſt troops, while he puſhed on his baggage through the diſſicult defiles, under the careful and experienced hand of Gen, Kniphauſen.</p>
            <p>Gen. Waſhington, acting with equal ſkill, and equal bravery, made every arrangement which the moment called for. On the morning of the 28th, he ordered Maj. Gen. Lee to attack the enemy's rear, himſelf moving on briſkly to ſupport him; but to his ſurpriſe, as he advanced on, he met Lee's troops retreating and the enemy impetuouſly purſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Here was Gen. Waſhington ſeen in all his ſplendor; for this critical ſituation is the orb in which he ſhines the brighteſt. He rallied the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating troops: he inſpired them by precept and by example; and the misfortune of the morning was conſiderably retrieved.</p>
            <p>The Americans fought bravely, and ſo did the Britiſh. After hard fighting, in a moſt intenſe hot day, when ſcores died of the heat, and drinking too freely of cold water when they could find it, both a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies remained on the ground. The Americans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to re-commence the action early on the next morning; but Gen. Clinton, finding that his baggage had ſtruggled pretty well through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:033865_0185_0FF8D6C22C280420"/>and had got tolerably well advanced, took the advantage of the cool of the night to ſlip off, unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Americans, and got to ground where be was ſafe. Some ſharp words took place between Gen. Waſhington and Maj. Gen. Lee, as the one advanced and the other retreated, which iſſued in the arreſt, trial and ſuſpenſion of the latter. Gen. Waſhington reported to Congreſs, that the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans buried of the Britiſh 4 officers and 245 pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates; among the former, the Hon. Col. Monckton, (who was a brave and experienced officer) and that there were a few priſoners. The American loſs; killed, I Lieutenant-Colonel, 1 Major, 3 Captains, 2 Lieutenants, 1 Setjeant, 52 rank and file—wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 2 Colonels, 8 Captains, 4 Firſt-Lieutenants, 2 Second-Lieutenants, 1 Enſign, 1 Adjutant, 8 Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, 1 Drummer, 120 rank and file—miſſing, 5 Serjeants, 126 rank and file; of the artillery, one Firſt-Lieutenant, 7 Matroſſes, and 1 Bombadier were killed—one Captain, 1 Serjeant, 1 Corporal, 1 Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to Matroſſes wounded—one Matroſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing —fix horſes killed, and two wounded. Both Generals undoubtedly have much credit for their conduct in this action. Gen. Clinton's object being to reach New-York with his baggage, &amp;c. obtained this victory, with the loſs which he ſuſtained. Gen. Waſhington's conduct was well calculated for vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory on his ſide; and how far he would have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, had it not been for the misfortune of the morning, none can tell. This misfortune began by expoſing the American advanced troops, in line, on the ſide of the field where they were cannonaded by the Britiſh, who at the ſame time wiſely expoſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their artillery to that of the Americans. It is to be remembered, that men may be led on to action in the face of a cannonade, before which they will not <hi>ſtand;</hi> the point of deciſion is in the mind;
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:033865_0186_0FF9660F79302EB8"/>while advancing, although galled by the fire of their opponents, the dead and wounded are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them as they fall, and the troops feel an ardour for arriving in a few minutes at a point, where they can uſe their own arms, to retaliate for the injury they ſuſtain. But when men are placed open to the fire of the artillery of their enemy, at ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as to preyent the uſe of their own arms in their defence, the dead and wounded fall and lie among them, or are drawn away, and every groan they make is heard. The troops ſoon conceive that they are placed as marks to be ſhot at; while the greater policy of the enemy keeps their column or line out of the rake of their cannon; the mind gives way, and retreat will be inevitable. This was experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this inſtance, and the faireſt hopes of a noble onſet in a few minutes blaſted; and theſe were ſome of the beſt troops in the army too. It was here that the firm Col. Weſſon had his back peeled of its muſcles, almoſt from ſhoulder to ſhoulder, by a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-ball. The confidence of the troops could not be fully recovered, until they ſaw the preſence of their beloved General.</p>
            <p>18th.—Intelligence was received, that the Count D'Eſlating had arrived, with the fleet under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, off the Capes of Delaware. The fleet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 12 ſail of the line, and 4 frigates. Off the coaſt of Virginia, they took a privateer, fitted out of New-York, of 26 guns—a ſhip, bound from New-Providence to London—re-captured a French ſnow, laden with dry goods, and drove a Britiſh ſhip of war 0 on ſhore.</p>
            <p>19th.—Intelligence was received, that about 2,000 men, ſaid to be invalids, had arrived at Rhode-Iſland from New-York.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—Intelligence was received, that a body of reſugees and Indians had deſtroyed the town of Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oming,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:033865_0187_0FF96387EE6EEEB0"/>on the Suſquehannah, and butchered many of the inhabitants. The ſame day, it was learnt, that Gen. Waſhington had croſſed Hudſon's River with the main army, except Gen. Wayne's brigade— that Count D'Eſtaing had appeared off Sandy Hook— that the inhabitants of New-York were in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, and that the Marquis de la Fayette, with Glover's and Varnum's brigades, were on their march for Providence.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh were very buſy in fortifying Rhode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iſland.</p>
            <p>25th and 26th.—Sent for Providence 43,000 flints, five tons hard bread, a quantity of dry fiſh, &amp;c. 0 and ſent a large number of the large flat-bottomed boats to Weymouth; they were to be conveyed, taking the advantage of the river, to the vicinity of Rhode-Iſland. Half of Col. Craft's regiment of State artillery were ordered to Tiverton; the other half of the regiment of artillery, and a draft from the militia, to the number of 3000 men, including 1000 before ordered, were to march and reinforce Maj. Gen. Sullivan in the State of Rhode-Iſland. On the 29th, at noon, the Count D'Eſtaing's ſquadron came to anchor off Point Judith, and at evening ſtretched a line from that Point to Secunnet.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—The regiment of State artillery, with 6 braſs 4-pounders, and 2 braſs howitzers, marched for liverton; and the next day the marine mortar was ſent on, ſlung under two pair of ſtout cart-wheels. The Britiſh ſloop of war, Kingfiſher, a row-galley and a ſloop, ſtationed near Secunnet, upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a French frigate, were run on ſhore by their own crews, ſet on ſire, and left to burn and blow up. Maj. Bumſtead's company of Boſton ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, with two braſs field-pieces, and Lieut. Dunnel, with a detachment of the Continental ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, with two field-pieces, marched for Rhode-Iſland,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:033865_0188_0FF9661AF0049270"/>and the militia and volunteers were on their march that way; and large quantities of military ſtores and proviſions were going from hence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 10th.—Major-General Hancock, with his fuit, went for Rhode-Iſland, to take the command of the militia. The ſame morning, Gen. Sullivan made a landing on the iſland, without oppoſition. About the ſame time, the Count D'Eſtaing, with his ſquadron, paſſed the Britiſh batteries at Newport, when there was a briſk cannonade on both ſides. Many of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ot ſtruck in the town, and the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants were in much conſternation, not knowing in what place they were ſafe. A ſhot entered the door of the houſe of Mrs. Maſon, a widow lady, a little above the floor: as the family were paſſing from room to room, not knowing where the next ſhot might ſtrike, young Mr. Maſon, paſſing through the entry, found the black man of the family ſitting with his back againſt the ſhot-hole in the door; on being aſked why he ſat there, he anſwered, "Maſter, you never know two ſhot to go in the ſame place." Under this idea he was tranquil. Lord Howe's fleet appeared in the Offing, conſiſting of 8 ſail of the line, and 12 frigates.</p>
            <p>11th.—The Count came to ſail, and ſtood out, and the Britiſh fleet ſtood off—the wind very freſh.</p>
            <p>13th.—A moſt ſevere ſtorm of wind and rain, which ſtripped many trees of their fruit, and tore others up by the roots, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The troops on Rhode-Iſland, under the command of Gen. Sullivan, were on the 11th, 10, 122, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers, excluſive of ſome volunteers from New-Hampſhire, and other corps, arranged as follows:

            <p>Theſe were encamped at and near Quaker-Hill. The ſtorm deſtroyed a great number of cartridges, owing to the badneſs of the boxes. A freſh ſupply was ſent on from Boſton.</p>
            <p>15th.—The army advanced, and in the afternoon arrived within two miles of the enemy, without the leaſt oppoſition. Gen. Waſhington with the main army, was at the White Plains, in the State of New-York, ſaid to be about 20,000 ſtrong. Seventeen tranſports with troops from Gen. Howe's army at New-York, ſailed for Rhode-Iſland; but finding the French ſquadron in the way, could not come to the place.</p>

            <p>On the night of the 17th, the covered way was nearly completed, and alſo two batteries of cannon. The enemy fired 300 or 400 ſhot, but did no other damage than ſlightly wounding two men.</p>

The militia which were coming in were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded. Admiral Byron's ſquadron arrived a few days before, at Sandy Hook. The enemy made a deſcent on New-Bedford, and did conſiderable damage: they alſo made a demand on the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Martha's Vineyard, for a large number of cattle, ſheep, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>9th.—An affray happened in Boſton between ſome American and French ſailors; two French officers in attempting to part them, were much wounded—one of them, a Major of the fleet, died of the wounds on the 15th.</p>

            <p>11th.—It was learnt, that on the 25th ult. the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh made an excurſion from Staten Iſland, with intent to ſurpriſe General Maxwell, who was ſtationed with his brigade at Elizabeth-Town, in the Jerſies. They landed at the point a little before day-break, and in ſuch ſuperior force as obliged the General to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the town, which he effected without loſs. The enemy burnt the General's quarters, the barms, and a ſtore or two, and then returned.</p>
            <p>29th.—Intelligence was received, that General Waſhington had iſſued a proclamation, offering a

            <p>Maj. Gen. Sullivan was ordered from Providence to the main army, and Maj. Gen. Gates to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at Providence.</p>
            <p>Capt. Mowatt again made his appearance on the eaſtern coaſt; he had landed ſome men, and burnt Mr. Shaw's houſe.</p>
            <p>Intelligence was received, that the Britiſh had gained an advantage on the borders of Georgia, near Briar Creek. Col. Elbert, with a number of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were taken priſoners. Matters did not wear a favourable aſpect in that quarter; but it was hoped that Gen. Lincoln, who had now got the command, would give a new complexion to things at the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 2d.—Maj. Gen. Gates left Boſton for Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence; in conſequence of which, the command again devolved on our General.</p>
            <p>11th.—It was learnt, that a fleet of refugee crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers made an attempt to land a number of men near Falmouth, (Cape-Cod) but were repulſed by the militia. They next proceeded to Nantucket, where they plundered the inhabitants of goods and effects. Edward Winſlow, formerly of Marſhfield, was ſaid to be commander, with George Leonard, and others.</p>
            <p>16th.—The Continental frigates, Warren, Ranger, and Queen of France, had been very ſucceſsful in a cruize, having taken ſeven or eight prizes going from New-York to Georgia: they were now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in; among them the Jaſon, of 20 guns and 150 men; and Maria, of 16 guns—four field and abour twenty commiſſioned officers, were on board. A large number of accoutrements for dragoons, dry

            <p>A great uneaſineſs prevailed in the army at Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence, on account of the ſcarcity of flour. Relief was ſent on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 3d.—Capt. Farnald, of New-Hampſhire, was unfortunately ſhot in the breaſt, as he was ſtanding on Hancock's wharf, by a muſket-ball diſcharged from the Warren frigate.</p>
            <p>7th.—Intelligence was received that Col. Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaak, of the New-York line, with about 500 men, had lately made an excurſion to Onondago, ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed the caſtle, killed 12 Indians, and took 34 priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; deſtroyed their caſtle, cattle, proviſions, &amp;c. without the loſs of a man.</p>
            <p>11th.—Several veſſels laden with rice, on account of the United States, arrived at Boſton, from the ſcuthward, which was a great relief to the troops.</p>
            <p>An embarkation of troops had ſailed from New-York, under the command of Gen. Matthews, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed by the ſhips under the command of Sir George Collier. They entered the Capes of Virginia, on the 8th. The 9th or 10th they took poſſeſſion of a ſort at the entrance of Elizabeth River, on the weſt ſide. They deſtroyed a number of veſſels, ſtores, proviſions, &amp;c. and returned.</p>
            <p>30th.—Sir Henry Clinton moved up the Hudſon, with a large body of troops, covered by sir George Collier's naval force, which had juſt returned from Virginia. The intention of Sir Henry Clinton was to ſeize the poſts at King's Ferry.</p>

               <hi>June</hi> 4th.—Our General received orders from Gen. Waſhington to join the main army. He had before ordered all the heavy cannon at Boſton and Providence, belonging to the United States, to be ſent on to Hudſon's River; they were ſent on, ſlung under two pair of ſtout cart-wheels each, and were a ponderous load.</p>
            <p>Our General received polite and affectionate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, on his leaving the department, from the officers of the line—ſtaff department—the officers of the Boſton regiment of militia, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the 11th, he left Boſton, accompanied by a large and reſpectable number of officers and citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, in carriages and on horſe-back, as far as Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, where the gentlemen had ordered an elegant dinner to be provided. After having dined, he took his leave, amidſt a ſhout of hearty wiſhes for his health and proſperity.</p>

Here he quitted the extent of his late eaſtern com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. He was eſcorted out of town by the officers of the ſeveral military departments, and Armand's dragoons.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—He arrived at New-Windſor; and on the 22d, attended Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. Waſhington to Weſt-Point.</p>
            <p>23d.—Our General took the command of the troops on the eaſt ſide of the Hudſon, having in front all the out-poſts towards New-York, on that fide of the river. The Britiſh were now in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of both the points at King's Ferry; and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of tranſports had lain in the river for ſome time. The advanced poſts of the Americans at this time, on this ſide, did not extend lower than Peek's Kill;
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:033865_0204_0FF9673853778540"/>and a picket mounted every night at the ſouth foot of Sugar-Loaf Hill.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 24th, about 200 of the enemy's light-horſe came up as far as Crom-Pond— ſurpriſed two militia pickets—killed and took priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners about 30 men. About 130 light-infantry of the enemy, at the ſame time, came out from Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plank's Point, made an excurſion round, and then returned.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 25th, the enemy's light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe, and about 1000 infantry, were at Pine's Bridge. Our General ordered 200 light-infantry, under the command of Lieut. Col. Groſvenor, to march to Robinſon's ſtores, near Marpoach-Pond, to cover that quarter.</p>
            <p>27th.—A deſerter came in from Verplank's Point, who reported that the Britiſh army, except five or ſix regiments, were to leave the Points, and were then embarking. Soon after, upwards of 30 ſail of tranſports were ſeen, ſtanding down the river. The Britiſh had a ſloop at anchor off Peek's Kill landing, and a ſhip off the Dunderberg. Leſt the enemy meant a deception, the Americans were ordered to lie on their arms, and a regiment extra was ordered to advance on the heights.</p>
            <p>28th.—Three deſerters, one a Heſſian muſician with his horn, came in from the enemy; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the teſtimony of the former deſerter, that the body of the Britiſh army had left the Points.</p>
            <p>29th.—Moylan's horſe croſſed the river, to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the left; they were to be followed by Armand's legion. At evening a deſerter came in from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy. A detachment from the Britiſh at Rhode-Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and arrived at New-York.</p>
            <p>Congreſs, by ballot, choſe our General a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner of the Board of War; which was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 1ſt.—Gen. Huntington's brigade moved down, and took poſt at the gorge of the mountains, near the Continental Village. A deſerter came in from the enemy.</p>
            <p>2d.—Col. Ruſus Putnam reconnoitred the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's poſitions at Verplank's and Stoney Points. At evening a deſerter came in from the enemy.</p>

               <pb n="208" facs="unknown:033865_0206_0FF9675335409D38"/>
About 360 of the enemy's light-horſe, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infantry, came out from Mile-Square, and attacked Col. Sheldon's light-horſe, who were poſſed at Poundridge, about 90 in number. The ſuperior force of the enemy obliged our horſe, at firſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, being reinforced by the militia, they, in turn, purſued the enemy. Our loſs was one Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, one Trumpeter, and eight privates, wounded: three Serjeants, one Corporal, and four privates miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and 12 horſes miſſing. The ſtandard of the regiment being left in the houſe when the dragoons ſuddenly turned out, was loſt. Of the enemy, one was killed, four taken priſoners, four horſes taken, and one horſe killed. The enemy ſet fire to and burnt the meeting-houſe and Maj. Lockwood's houſe; they alſo burnt Mr. Hay's houſe, at Bedford.</p>
            <p>The 5th was an exceſſive hot day, with a thunder ſhower; the lightning ſtruck in the encampment of Col. Putnam's regiment, on Conſtitution Iſland, by which one man was killed; ſeveral received much hurt, and a large number were ſtunned.</p>
            <p>The enemy entered the Sound—landed, and took poſſeſſion of New-Haven—plundered and inſulted the inhabitants, and left the place.</p>
            <p>7th.—The enemy landed at Fairſield, and burst many houſes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>10th.—About 6 o'clock, P. M. our General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders from Gen. Waſhington, to march, with the two Connecticut brigades, by the way of Crom Pond, towards Bedford. The next morning, although rainy, the firſt brigade marched to the Village.</p>
            <p>12th.—The ſtorm ceaſing, the tents (although as wet as water could make them) were ſtruck, and the troops took up their line of march, reaching Amiwalk about ſun-ſetting. A report having been ſpread in the ſore part of the day, that the enemy
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:033865_0207_0FF969490A9CA4F0"/>were at or near Pine's Bridge, our General ordered the baggage-waggons, under proper eſcort, to file off to the left, and purſue a road running parallel with the one on which the column was moving, thereby keeping the column between the enemy and the waggons. Both arrived on the ground of encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within a few minutes of each other. The troops lay on their arms, without pitching their tents. The enemy continued their depredations at the Sound, and burnt ſome houſes at Norwalk.</p>
            <p>13th.—At 5 o'clock, A. M. the troops took up their line of march, and reached Ridgefield, where they halted for the night. The next morning, our General ſent off all the tents and other baggage to Danbury, and took up his line of march towards Stamford. When he aſcended the high grounds in ſight of the Sound, the enemy's f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nford and Long-Iſland. About 12 o'clock, two deſerters from Gen. Clinton's army came to our troops; they had left the Britiſh army two or three hours before, at which time the enemy were on the point of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a movement; the corps of guides and pioneers being then aſſembled at Gen. Clinton's quarters. This called for the exerciſe of diſcretion. The troops on board the tranſports, with Gen. Tryon, if the whole ſhould land, were far inferior to the force with our General; but the main Britiſh army, with General Clinton, was by far ſuperior to his. If the whole of the Americans had marched down to Stanford, Clinton, by five or ſix hours forced marching, might have croſſed his rear, and have cut him off from a communication with the Highlands; he therefore reſolved to march forward to the Croſs Roads, one of which went directly to the Britiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, another to Stamford, and in his rear to the Highlands. Here he took a poſition in order of
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:033865_0208_0FF9676C44B90BA0"/>battle, and detached Col. Starr's and Meigs's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with one field-piece, to Stamford, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ce, the detachment might be ſurrounded. In this ſituation the troops remained until duſk, and then took a more advantageous poſition for the night, the whole lying on their arms, in order of battle. Early on the morning of the 15th, our General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived information that the ſhipping had gone down toward. New-York; he therefore moved and took a ſtrong position, between Ridgefield and Bedford, ſending <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> patroles of horſe and foot, on all the roads. This movement towards the Sound, quieted the mind, of the people, and ſaved Stamford and other to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> from deſtruction.</p>
            <p>While the attention of both the grand armies, and of the adjacent country, was turned towards the Sound, the Great WASHINGTON ordered General Wayne to ſtrike at Stoney Point, with the light-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, which lay not far diſtant from that poſt. This was done with great promptitude, the works being carried by aſſault, and the whole garriſon made priſoners of war, with all the artillery, ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtores, &amp;c. This was a moſt brilliant affair.</p>
            <p>In advancing to the aſſault, the front of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican column led, with unloaded arms, relying ſolely on the uſe of the bayonet. As they approached the works, a ſoldier inſiſted on loading his piece—all was now a profound ſilence—the officer, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the platoon, ordered him to keep on; the ſoldier obſerved that he did not underſtand attacking with his piece unloaded; he was ordered not to ſtop, at his peril; he ſtill perſiſted, and the officer inſtantly diſpatched him. A circumſtance like this, ſhocks the feelings; but it muſt be conſidered how fatal the conſequence would have been, if one ſingle gun
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:033865_0209_0FF9695D1C272358"/>had been fired; ſcores would have loſt their lives, and moſt probably defeat have been conſequent; and therefore this was the leſſer evil.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 16th, ſignal guns were heard in the Sound, towards New-York, at intervals, from two o'clock until day-light. Gen. Clinton's army moved to Mile-Square.</p>
            <p>Stoney Point having been taken, with ſo much eclat to the American arms, Gen. Waſhington de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined an attempt on Verplank's Point, on the eaſt ſide of the Hudſon and oppoſite to Stoney Point: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> this purpoſe Maj. Gen.

            <p>17th.—At about 10 o'clock, A. M. our General, while out reconnoitring, received, by an expreſs from Gen. Waſhington, orders to move as expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly as poſſible to Peek's Kill, where he would find Gen. Howe with two brigades. Our General was to take the command of the whole, and carry into effect the orders which had been given to Gen. Howe. Our General returned immediately to the troops, and at 12 o'clock began his march towards Peek's Kill—marched until duſk 15 miles, when the troops halted and laid down to reſt on the ſide of the road; the dragoons not unſaddling their horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. At 3 o'clock the next morning, the troops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed their march, and in the afternoon our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral received information from Gen. Howe, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, that Gen. Clinton was on full march with his whole army towards Verplank's Point: an anſwer was returned, at what point the troops then were, and that they were marching as ſalt as the men could
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:033865_0210_0FF8D794D3C16368"/>endure, and would continue ſo until they reached him. When the troops had advanced a little to the weſtward of Drake's farm, Col. Moylan came vip from Gen. Howe, with information that a part of Clinton's army were then above the New Bridge on Croten river, puſhing for the point; and that he was retreating from the point as faſt as poſſible. On this, our General ordered Gen. Huntington, with his brigade and two field-pieces, to puſh forward as faſt as the troops could march and keep in breath, and take a poſition on the high ground, to the ſouth of Peek's Kill, which commands the road to the point, and alſo that to the New Bridge, on Croten river; and ordered a regiment to file off to the right, and ſecure the paſs over the hills between Drake's and Peek's Kill, and alſo ordered the flank-guard on the left to be reinforced, and to ſend out ſmall flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards ſtill further from its flank. The troops mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on with the utmoſt expedition to the ground which Gen. Huntington had been ordered forward to ſecure. Every moment that paſſed, was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to announce the commencement of an action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the advanced or flanking parties of the two armies, but it did not take place. At this moment, Gen. Waſhington, having learnt how matters ſtood, and that poſſibly Gen. Clinton might attempt to puſh into the Highlands, ſent an expreſs to our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, to move into the Highlands immediately, which was done juſt after dark, the troops paſſing the night on Fald Hill Is was generally the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that if our General had not been at hand to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in the manner he did, that Gen. Clinton, by a forced march of his light troops, backed by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, would have got in the rear of Gen. Howe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could have poſſibly gained the road at Peek's Kill, and between his army and a ſally from the garriſon of Verplank's Point inevitably cut off the

Simcoe, and one trooper, priſoners. By the capture of Simcoe, the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were freed of a very enterpriſing and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome officer. The deſtruction of the boats was the object of this enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>29th.—Gen. Howe's diviſion formed a junction with the Connecticut line, and encamped with them. Strong fatigue parties were daily employed on the works evacuated by the enemy at Verplank's and Stoney Points. Gen. Lincoln and the Count D'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing, by the laſt accounts from Georgia, had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a junction, and were determines to attack the enemy.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—Maj. Bunſchoten arrived at camp, with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> 1ſt.—Maj. Armſtrong, Aid-de-camp to Maj. Gen. Gates, called at camp, on his way to
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:033865_0221_0FFA75F7D5F4AE88"/>Congreſs, with official diſpatches of the evacuation of Rhode-Iſland, which took place on the night of the 26th ult. The Britiſh left large quantities of forage, fuel, &amp;c. Brigadier-General Stark had gone on to Rhode-Iſland. A Heſſian Lieutenant belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Landgrave regiment, came out from the neighbourhood of Fort Waſhington; he pretended a deſire to enter the American ſervice as a volunteer. A priſoner of war was alſo ſent up from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced guard.</p>
            <p>2d.—Intelligence was received, that a body of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were advancing towards Fort Schuyler.</p>
            <p>7th.—Two German Yaugers, with their rifles, came to our camp. At night, Col. Armand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with his corps from near Tarrytown to the vicinity of Morriſania, to the houſe of Alderman Leggit, where he ſurpriſed and took Maj. Bearmore and five others priſoners. The ſecrecy, precaution, gallantry and diſcipline exhibited by the Colonel and his corps on this occaſion did them much hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. In the capture of Maj. Bearmore, the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of the adjacent country were relieved from the frequent excurſions of a troubleſome officer. The Britiſh augmented their troops on Staten-Iſland.</p>
            <p>11th.—Two deſerters came in from Col. Wurmb's Yaugers.</p>
            <p>13th.—Five priſoners taken by Lieut. Oakley, near Morriſania, were ſent to camp. The enemy had a redoubt, called No. 8, on the eaſt fide of Haarlem Creck, nearly oppoſite to the fort on Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel Hill, and under the fire of its cannon, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their advanced troops on the Morriſania fide.</p>
            <p>16th.—Intelligence was received, that on the 23d of September, Gen. Lincoln and the Count D'Eſtaing broke ground before the enemy's works, at Savannah in Georgia; and on the 5th of October,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:033865_0222_0FF96818854749B0"/>batteries of 33 cannon and nine mortars, were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and continued firing with intervals, until the 6th without the wiſhed for effect.</p>
            <p>9th.—In the morning an aſſault was made, which proved unſucceſsful—the Americans were repulſed and obliged to retreat; of the Americans, 170 were killed and wounded; among the former, Count PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LASKI, a remarkably brave and enterpriſing officer of Poliſh deſcent. The Count D'Eftaing was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the arm and leg. It was ſaid, that of the French troops, 330 were killed and wounded. Gen. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln retreated to Charleſton. It being rendered certain that the Count D'Eſtaing would not come to the northward, the American main army was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to winter-quaters.—Moylan's, Sheldon's, Baylor's, and Bedkins's dragoons to Connecticut-Poor's brigade to Danbury—The Maſſachuſetts line to Weſt-Point, and the poſts in the Highlands—The Virginia, Maryland, Pennſylvania, New-Jerſey, New-York, and Connecticut lines, Hand's and Stark's mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed corps, back of the Scotch Plains, New-Jerſey— Lee's corps, and a detachment of infantry, towards Monmouth—Marechauſee, with the main army.</p>
            <p>19th.—Four priſoners were ſent up.</p>
            <p>23d.—Maj. Gen. Gates and his family came to camp from Rhode-Iſland.</p>
            <p>25th.—The troops were moving to their different places of cantonment; many of the ſoldiers, (as fine men as ever ſtood in ſhoes) were marched barefooted over the hard frozen ground, and with an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patience. Remember theſe things, ye Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, in future times!</p>
            <p>28th.—The Commander in Chief gave our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral the command of all the poſts and troops on Hudſon's River, which Gen. Waſhington very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called the key that locked the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the eaſtern and ſouthern States; and
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:033865_0223_0FF969C6F6297A80"/>of all the poſts in the United States, was the moſt important. This was the ſecond time that our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral was deſignated to command them.</p>
            <p>29th.—Three deſerters came in from the galley in the river.</p>
            <p>30th.—Early in the morning, Gen. Waſhington croſſed the Hudſon at King's-Ferry, into the Jerſies. Maj. Gen. Gates was to proceed to Virginia—a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, corporal, and three privates, were carried off by one Joſeph M'Keels a ſly, artful fellow, in the ſervice of the enemy, and who conducted many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits from the country to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> 2d.—Col. Armand, with ſome of his corps, went down to Morriſſania, and took a Capt. Cruzer, of Bearmore's corps, and two men, priſoners. At this time the troops were greatly diſtreſſed for bread, and the horſes for forage; the former occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the want of water at the mills. All the horſes, except ſuch as were abſolutely neceſſary for incumbent duties, were ordered out into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. A man, who pretended to be a prophet, came out from the enemy—he more probably was a ſpy.</p>
            <p>16th.—Col. Paulding's corps was ordered from Stoney Point to Poughkeepſie, a grent deſertion hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken place in the corps. The Virginia line had marched to the ſouthward—the enemy at New-York, preparing for the embarkation of a large body of troops, ſaid to be upwards of 10,000, under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command of Gen. Sir Henry Clinton.</p>
            <p>29th.—Three Heſſian deſerters came into our army; they reported that Gen. Matthews had the command of all the poſts and troops on the north and of York Iſland, above the bridge, &amp;c. The long talked of embarkation of troops at New-York, ſailed on the 26th. The fleet was ſaid to conſiſt of near 200 ſail. The enemy boaſted that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed by nearly 20 ſhips of war; however, it was
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:033865_0224_0FF968350672F488"/>well known that they had very few ſhips of the line, and that they were under great apprehenſions of falling in with a ſuperior French force. They went to the ſouthward.</p>
            <p>30th.—Lieut. Col. Newhall, with 250 men prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly offloered, marched to do duty on the lines.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—There was a great body of ſnow on the ground.</p>
            <p>1780. <hi>January</hi> 1ſt.—Early in the morning about 100 ſoldiers belonging to the Maſſachuſetts regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who had enliſled, at different periods ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to January, 1777, for three years, pretending that their time of ſervice now expited, (although many of them had months to ſerve, before their three years ſervice was completed) marched off with intent to go home: they were purſued and brought back: ſome of them were puniſhed; the greater part of them pardoned. Some others, at other poſts, conducted in the ſame manner, and were treated as the firſt mentioned. Thoſe whoſe time of ſervice was expired, were all diſcharged with honour.</p>
            <p>3d.—The ſnow had got to be about four feet deep on a level, and the troops were driven to great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in keeping open the communications to the poſts—obtaining proviſions, fuel, forage, &amp;c and ſo intenſe and ſteady was the weather, that ſo more than twenty days there could not be diſcovered the leaſt ſign of the remiſſion of the ſnow in any places the moſt open to the influences of the ſun. The Hudſon ſoon becoming paſſable on the ice, the troops were comfortably ſupplied with proviſions; but m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were in extreme want of cloathing.</p>
            <p>8th.—The light-infantry belonging to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Highlands, were joining their reſpective corps; the corps of light-infantry being ſeparated for the winter.</p>
            <p>9th.—About duſk, the north redoubt was diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:033865_0225_0FF8D81AF8258CE8"/>to be on fire at the ſouthweſt corner, under the rampart, which was of timber the fire was out of reach, and threatened the deſtruction of the whole redoubt. A detachment from Weſt-Point was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over to the aſſiſtance of the garriſon of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt; but ſo ſtrongly dovetailed and ſtrapped were the timbers of the rampart, that the fire for a time ſeemed to baffle every exertion to extinguiſh it. The ammunition, and about 100 barrels of ſalted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in the magazine, were ſeaſonably removed by the garriſon; but the fire was not extinguiſhed until about four o'clock on the morning of the 10th. All the officers and men diſtinguiſhed themſelves on this occaſion; but the conduct of Col. Lyman, Col. Sprout, and Capt. Drew, were conſpicuous indeed, as was that of a Serjeant of the garriſon of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt, who, when all were on the point of quitting the redoubt, leſt the magazine ſhould take fire and blow up, inſtantly ruſhed into the magazine, and did not quit it until he had thrown out every caſk of powder, and box of ammunition depoſited in it. If his name could be recollected, it ſhould be inſerted.</p>
            <p>12th.—Artiſicers and fatigue-men were ordered to repair the redoubt. The weather continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſely cold. A man belonging to the garriſon of Weſt-Point was frozen to death on his return from New-Windſor to the point; and many ſoldiers were froſt-bitten. Maj. Gen. Putnam, who had gone home on furlough about this time, received a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytic ſtroke at Hartford in Connecticut, as he was on his return to the army.</p>
            <p>17th.—The Hudſon was ſo frozen, that travellers ſafely croſſed the river on the ice at King's-Ferry. A Heſſian deſerter came in. Two days before, viz. on the 15th, Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling made a deſcent on Staten Iſland, with a detachment, conſiſting of about 2,500 infantry, and ſome artillery; a number
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:033865_0226_0FF96849A0CC1670"/>of tents, arms, and ſome baggage, belonging to Col. Buſkirk's regiment, was taken and brought off, with ſome liquors, &amp;c. Some of the American ſoldiers deſerted to the enemy, and 17 were taken priſoners.</p>
            <p>19th.—Two deſerters came in from the enemy, and reported the ſtrength of the Britiſh at Fort Waſhington. The people croſſed from New-York to Long-Iſland on the ice. About this time, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment from Col. Mead's regiment of levies at Horſeneck, and a number of volunteers from Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, the former under the command of Captain Keeler, the latter under the command of Captain Lockwood, the whole about 80, marched to Morriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſania; and about one o'clock in the morning, made an attack on Col. Hatfield. They firſt attacked the picket, killed 3, and drove the reſt into the Colonel's quarters. The Colonel and his men took to the chambers, and fired out at the windows, and down ſtairs at thoſe who had entered the houſe; it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficult, if poſſible, to diſlodge them, the houſe was inſtantly ſet on fire, by putting a ſtraw bed into a cloſet, which compelled the enemy to jump out at the chamber windows, to avoid the flames. Colonel Hatfield, one Captain, one Lieutenant, one Quarter, Maſter, and 11 privates, were taken priſoners and brought off. This was a pretty affair, but was a little tarniſhed on the return by ſome of the militia, who were ſatigued, loitering on the road where they ſuppoſed there was no danger; but a party of houſe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſuing, overtook, killed and captured ſeveral of them.</p>
            <p>26th.—Between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, a fire broke out in the Quarter-Maſter's barrack at Weſt-Point, which threatened the moſt ſerious and extenſive damage. It had got to conſiderable height before it was diſcovered; the barrack was confed quently conſumed to aſhes, notwithſtanding every
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:033865_0227_0FF969F2AC6E8AD0"/>extertion of the garriſon, which was numerous. Brig. Gen. Patterſon, who commanded the garriſon, not only diſtinguiſhed himſelf, but alſo expoſed his perſon to the flames to ſave another building, which was fortunately effected. The loſs by the fire was conſiderable, both to the public and to individuals. The eight before, viz. the 25th, a detachment of the enemy, ſaid to conſiſt of 500 men, made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion from Staten Iſland, over the ice, to Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-Town, in the Jerſies, and completely ſurpriſed the picket poſted there, conſiſting of a Major and 100 men, properly officered; it was ſaid that not a gun was fired, nor a man hurt. The enemy ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the houſes, and took the troops aſleep.— He who ſuffers himſelf to be ſurpriſed, through the want of proper precaution, his character (ſays a great military writer) is irretrievable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 1ſt.—At two o'clock in the morning, the north redoubt was diſcovered to be on fire again in the top of the bomb-proof, between the ſally-port and the door. Every exertion was made by the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the redoubt, and detachments ſent to their did, to put out the fire, but it was ſo much out of reach, and ſpread among the joints of the large timbers, that it was not extinguiſhed until about two o'clock on the morning of the 3d. The redoubt received conſiderable damage, and would have been totally deſtroyed, had it not been for the unwearied exertions of the troops, day and night, during the whole of the time; and much credit was due to Lieut. Col. Voſe, and the other officers who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. By a more accurate account of the loſs at the Quarter-Maſter's barrack at Weſt-Point, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than 6 marques, 26 horſeman's tents, 80 common tents, 900 knapſacks, 250 narrow axes, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other articles were burnt and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 3d, about 9 o'clock, the
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:033865_0228_0FF9685FD87638E8"/>enemy made an attack on Lieut. Col. Thomſon who commanded the troops on the lines; the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel's force conſiſted of 250 men, in five companies, properly officered; they were inſtructed to move between Croten River and the White Plains, Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's River and Bedford; never to remain long at any one place, that the enemy might not be able to learn their manner of doing duty, or form a plan for ſtriking them in any particular ſituation. The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel had for ſome days taken poſt himſelf at <hi>Young's,</hi> not far from the White Plains. Capt. Watſon, with his company, was with the Lieut. Colonel; Capt. Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts and Capt. Stoddard, with their companies, were on the right; Capt. Lieut. Farley and Capt. Cooper on the left. The force of the enemy conſiſted of the four flank companies of the firſt and ſecond Britiſh regiments of guards—detachments from two Heſſian battalions—ſome mounted yaugers, and mounted reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugees. The whole under the command of Col. Norton, of the guards. The roads were ſo filled with ſnow, that the enemy advanced but ſlowly, and were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave their field-pieces behind on the road. They were diſcovered at a diſtance by Mr. Campbell, one of our guides, who, from the goodneſs of his horſe, reconnoitred them pretty near. He gave the Lieutenant-Colonel notice of their advancing, and that their force was conſiderable, and adviſed him to take a ſtronger poſition a little in his rear. But the Lieutenant-Colonel was very confident that the enemy were only a body of horſe, and that he could eaſily diſperſe them, and would not quit his ground. The enemy firſt attacked a ſmall advance-guard, conſiſting of a Serjeant and 8 men, who behaved well, and meant to reach the main body in ſeaſon; but were prevented by the horſe, and all taken pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. The enemy's horſe ſoon appeared in ſight of the Americans, and diſcharged their riſles at long
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:033865_0229_0FF969FFA22A71D8"/>for, and waited the coming up of the infantry; when a warm action commenced; the enemy ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, taking the advantage of the ground and trees in the orchard, and cloſing up on all ſides. The 3 companies of the detachment, which had joined 0 fought well. After about 15 minutes' ſharp conſlicts, our troops broke; ſome took into the houſe, and others made off; the enemy's horſe ruſlring on at the ſame inſtant, and the whole ſhouting. At this time, the two flank companies came up, but finding how matters ſtood, judged it beſt to retreat, Capt. Stodder's company giving a fire or two at long ſhot, Capt. Cooper's, from their diſtance, not firing at all. ſome who were engaged effected their eſcape, others were overtaken by the horſe. The enemy collected what priſoners they could, ſet Mr. Young's houſe and buildings on fire, and returned. Of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans, 13 were killed dead on the ſpot, and Capt. Roberts, who was mortally wounded, lived but a few minutes. Seventeen others were wounded, ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of whom died. Lieut. Col. Thomſon of Mar'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall's Capt. Watſon of Greaton's, Capt. Lieut. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Weſſon's, Lieut. Burley of Tupper's, Lieut. Maynard of Greaton's, Enſign Fowler of Nixon's, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ſign Bradley of Bigelow's, with 89 others, were taken priſoners. The enemy left 3 men dead on the field, and a Captain of grenadiers was wounded in the hip, and a Lieutenant of infantry in the thigh. The Britiſh, in their account of the action, acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eged that they had 5 men killed, and 18 wounded. Dieut. Col. Badlam, with the relief for the lines, was at the time of the action far advanced on his march, but not within reach of thoſe engaged.</p>
            <p>One Mayhew, a pedler, well known in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, was of this detachment; he made off up the road, but finding the horſe ruſhing on, he ſtruck off into the ſnow, almoſt up to his hips. Two of the
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:033865_0230_0FF968732FE035D8"/>enemy's horſe turned into his track after him; and, gaining faſt upon him, he aſked them if they would give him quarter; they replied, "Yes, you dog, we will quarter you." This was twice repeated; when Mayhew, finding them inflexible, determined to give them one ſhot before he was quartered; and, turning round, diſcharged his piece at the firſt horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who cried out, "The raſcal has broke my leg;" when both of them turned their horſes round and went off, leaving Mayhew at liberty to tread back his path to the road, and come off.</p>
            <p>7th.—A body of the enemy's horſe, ſaid to be about 300, and the 7th Britiſh regiment, came over from Long-Iſland to Weſt-Cheſter on the ice. The troops in New-York, about this time, drew four days' proviſions, which they were directed to keep cooked, and the troops to be in readineſs to move on the ſhorteſt notice, with arms and blankets only A number of ſleighs were collected, and ſome heavy cannon were drawn out; whether an attempt on Morriſtown or the Highlands was the object, was not known. Several deſerters came in from the enemy, and in this month there were ſome deſertions from the American ſouthern regiments to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy. The enemy alſo made an excurſion in the Jerſies, as far as Elizabeth-Town, and carried off a great quantity of plunder.</p>
            <p>19th.—Some ſmall parties of the enemy were on towards the White Plains.</p>
            <p>Our General having obtained leave, from the Commander in Chief, to make a viſit to his friends in New-England, commenced his journey eaſtward, on the 21ſt of February, and reached his houſe in Roxbury on the 29th. It appeared that the winter had been as ſevere, and the ſnow as deep, in the New-England States, as in the Highlands of New York.</p>

            <p>By the maſter of a flag from Bermuda, informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was received, that the fleet, in paſſing from New-York to the ſouthward, the preceding Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſuffered conſiderably; and that an ordnance ſhip was loſt.</p>
            <p>9th.—A privateer ſhip, of 18 guns, prize to the Tartar privateer, was ſent into Boſton.</p>
            <p>13th.—The Committee of the General Court of Maffachuſetts were iſſuing notes for the deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pay of the troops of their line: theſe were ſold at a very great diſcount.</p>
            <p>20th.—A rich Jamaica ſhip, prize to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental frigate Dean, arrived ſafe in Boſton harbour.

The depreciation of the continental money rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idly increaſed; many people withheld their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and produce from ſale, and the times were truly embarraſſing. An embarkation of ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Heſſian troops took place at New-York for Carolina. In the courſe of this month, the Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land line of the army, and three companies of artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, marched to the ſouthward.</p>
            <p>26th.—News was received that the Britiſh had got their ſhipping over the bar, at Charleſton; that the continental frigates, in the harbour, were hauled up, and their guns taken out and mounted on batteries: the garriſon of Charleſton numerous.</p>
            <p>27th.—The privateers Franklin and Jack ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salem a large letter-of-marque ſhip, having on board 1,000 barrels of pork and beef, 750 barrels of flour, 800 firkins of butter, and dry goods to the amount of £15,000; ſhe was from London, bound to New-York.</p>
            <p>During this month, the enemy made two excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Paramus, where they killed and took a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Americans; Maj. Byles, of the Pennſylvania line, was mortally wounded, and died the next day. The enemy burnt Mr. G. Hoper's houſes and mills; the militia turned out ſpiritedly, repulſed and purſued the enemy. By accounts from Europe, the American cauſe was viewed in a very favourable light, by the Courts in that part of the world.</p>
            <p>28th.—The French frigate Hermeone, Capt. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch, arrived at Boſton; in whom came the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de la Fayette, and ſuite, from France. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Boſton exhibited the greateſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of joy, on the occaſion. The next morning the Marquis, Capt. Latouch, and other officers, made a viſit to our General: the Marquis, the day before, on his landing at Hancock's Wharf, was received by a number of Continental officers, and eſcorted to his
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:033865_0233_0FF96A23C2EE1770"/>lodgings; after which, he paid his reſpects to the Honorable Legiſlature, who were then in ſeſſion; in the evening there were rejoicings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 2d.—The Marquis de la Fayette ſet out from Boſton, for the army.</p>
            <p>During the ſeſſion of the Legiſlature of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, they received an order from Congreſs, in favour of the State, for 2,000,000 dollars, to reimburſe the State in part of the expenſe of the Penobſcot expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which had greatly involved the State. The enemy having taken poſt at Penobſcot, the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Maſſachuſetts, without applying to Congreſs, determined to diſlodge them; and, for this purpoſe, ordered a body of militia to be detached, under the command of Brig. Gen. Lovell; and, in addition to their own State veſſels, procured a number of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, belonging to individuals. The expedition was attempted; the ſhipping arrived ſafe in Penob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot Bay; the troops, or a part of them, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked to attack the enemy, but they did not ſucceed in their attempt. The armed veſſels, inſtead of cruizing off the harbour, where they could have had ſea room, remained in the bay. The enemy ſent a naval force to the relief of the poſt, which arrived, and found the American ſhipping in the river, who immediately ran up as far as they could, where the whole were deſtroyed, and the militia and ſeamen left to find their way home through the woods. This was an unfortunate affair to Maſſachuſetts, whoſe privateers, before, were numerous, able and active, and greatly annoyed the enemy; and, had it not been for this blow, would have been of great public benefit, by depriving the enemy of many of their proviſion veſſels, and of increaſing proviſions in our own country. Congreſs, at firſt, ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline bearing the expenſe, as they had never been
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:033865_0234_0FF966C89DF51140"/>conſulted reſpecting the expedition; but they finally conſented to a reimburſement.</p>
            <p>Congreſs ordered, that 800 men, in the pay of the United States, ſhould cover and protect the Eaſtern Country the enſuing ſummer.</p>
            <p>12th.—The gentlemen of Boſton gave a ball to the French and American officers.</p>
            <p>14th.—The Hermeone frigate, Capt. Latouch, failed from Boſton harbour, on a cruize.</p>
            <p>A number of very valuable prizes, taken by the American cruizers, were ſent into different ports.</p>
            <p>The 19th exhibited a moſt extraordinary phenom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enon. The wind, in the morning, was ſoutherly, a moderate breeze; the ſun ſhone a little after it was up, but was ſoon clouded: there was ſome thunder and moderate ſhowers. A little after 10 o'clock, the clouds exhibited a yellowiſh caſt, and every object ſeemed to preſent a braſſy hue; it ſoon, after began to grow dark, which gradually increaſed; between eleven and twelve, it became neceſſary to light can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, to do houſehold buſineſs. The darkneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed until near one o'clock, P. M. the inhabitants dining by candle-light. About one, the darkneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to decreaſe, and went off gradually, as it came on; between three and four, P. M. the uſual light was reſtored. The evening, although the moon was at the full, was remarkably dark, and there was a ſprinkling of rain—the people were in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation. This phenomenon, in the opinion of our General, although he has no pretenſions to aſtronomy, was produced by <hi>oppoſite winds</hi> forcing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a vaſt body of ſmoak and vapours, (the air had been ſmoaky for ſome days before) which, from the light ſtate of the atmoſphere, as they accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, aſcended, forming, from top to bottom, ſuch a body, as to cauſe the darkneſs; and yet, ſo open were the particles, as to admit the ſun's rays ſo far,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:033865_0235_0FF96A3202BE3D70"/>as to cauſe the braſſy appearance: had the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere been heavy, the vapours would probably have condenſed, and rain, in torrents, would have enſued. Some obſervations made by our General, ſome years ſince the foregoing, on the darkneſs in Canada, and which, on the afternoon of the preceding day, he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed at Roxbury, and remarked thereon, afford ſtrong collateral evidence that the foregoing opinion was not wholly unfounded.</p>
            <p>As the learned and curious wiſh to aſcertain, as far as poſlible, the true cauſe of the phenomenon, we throw in thoſe rough materials, which our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the time, collected, that they may be ſhaped by thoſe of greater ſkill, for the information and ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction of an enlightened public. Thoſe. called the dark days, in Canada, were the 9th, 15th and 16th of October, 1785; but the greateſt degree of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was on Sunday, the 16th, when the darkneſs was ſo great as to render the uſe of candles neceſſary in the churches and families: it is ſaid to have been as dark as a dark night.</p>
            <p>On the 9th, at Roxbury, in Maſſachuſetts, the wind was at ſouth-caſt, and then at ſouth-weſt; the day fair, cool and pleaſant.</p>
            <p>The 15th, the prevailing wind was eaſterly; the day was cloudy and foggy; about 2 o'clock, P. M. it was uncommonly dark, and there was an oppoſite wind from the ſouth-weſt. There were ſeveral hard claps of thunder at a diſtance, and a few drops of rain. Towards evening, the ſun was viſible, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very red, and the clouds exhibited a braſſy complexion, ſo ſimilar to the dark day in May, 1780, as to be noticed and compared; in the evening the wind was ſoutherly.</p>
            <p>The 16th, which was the dark day in Canada, the wind, there at oppoſite points, N. E. and S. W. was at Roxbury S. W. The day was fair, warm and
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:033865_0236_0FF968A979F54F90"/>pleaſant; from which it ſeems to be obvious, that the body of ſmoak and vapour, with which the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere was fraught on the 15th, which pervaded a region which comprchended Canada and a part of New-England at leaſt, was, by the ſtrength of the ſouth-weſt wind in the night, forced north ward, and being ſtill oppoſed by the north-eaſt wind, preſſing on the other ſide, produced the accumulation of ſmoak and vapour which occaſioned the darkneſs; and if the north-eaſt wind had prevailed againſt the ſouth-weſt, the darkneſs would probably have been in New-England.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—Capt. Latouch returned from his cruize; he ran into Penobſcot Bay, and caſt anchor, firing ſeveral ſignal guns. Two Britiſh ſloops of war, which were at anchor, upon the approach of the Hermeone, came to ſail, and ran up the river. Capt. Latouch lay at anchor until he took a plan of the enemy's poſt. Our General intended to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced his journey for the army on Monday, the 29th of May; but on the afternoon of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, he received a letter from Gen. Waſhington, dated the 15th, in which his Excellency obſerved, "I have the pleaſure to inform you, in ſtrict confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that we have authentic advices of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's determination to ſend a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able armament of ſea and land forces to operate on the continent, and that the period is not remote when we may expect their arrival." The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief added, that the ſeizing of Halifax was an object with the French; and our General was inſtructed to obtain, as ſoon as poſſible, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſtate of the Britiſh in that quarter, as to their <hi>works, garriſons</hi> and <hi>troops;</hi> all of which was ſhortly after aſcertained.</p>
            <p>29th.—The Hermeone fell down, in order to proceed on a cruize to the ſouthward. The troops
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:033865_0237_0FF96A48F380E408"/>at Weſt-Point at this time were very ſhort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and without rum.</p>
            <p>Congreſs and the Commander in Chief called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeveral States to complete their battalions of the army with all poſſible diſpatch. The enemy at New-York were under great apprehenſions of a viſit from the French, and were ſaid to have prepared a number of hulks of different ſizes to ſink in the channel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 6th.—News was received, that a French fleet had been ſeen at ſea, in latitude 33, ſtanding E.N.F.</p>
            <p>About this time, Capt. Latouch ſent into Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth a prize brig, having 1700 firkins of butter, 150 boxes of candles, and 150 boxes of ſoap on board. The Legiſlature of Maſſachuſetts ordered a draft to be made from the militia, to complete their Continental battalions. The drafts were to rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous at Springfield.</p>
            <p>9th.—Our General received the following letter from the Commander in Chief.</p>

                  <p>"IT is expected that the fleet of our ally will, in the firſt inſtance, touch at Rhode-Iſland for the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of landing their ſick and ſupernumerary ſtores, and to meet the intelligence neceſſary to direct their operations. I have already ſent forward Doctor Craik, to take up proper houſes for hoſpitals, and to make ſome previous arrangements in that department: but I apprehend the French General and Admiral will, upon their arrival, want the advice and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a perſon of diſcretion and judgment, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the country. I muſt requeſt you to repair immediately to Providence, and, upon their

                  <p>"I would wiſh you to endeavour, in conjunction with the Governor, to eſtabliſh a market between the fleet and army and country, and be careful that our allies are not impoſed upon in the prices of articles which they may find neceſſary.

            <p>About this time, an engagement happened between the Hermeone and a Britiſh man-of-war, which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near two glaſſes; it was a drawn battle. Capt. Latouch, and one of his Lieutenants, were wounded; and it was ſaid 13 men were killed and 39 wounded. Several of the wounded died ſoon after; among them, an officer.</p>
            <p>15th.—At 11 o'clock, A. M. our General ſet out from his houſe, in Roxbury, for Providence, where he arrived the next day, at 2 o'clock, P. M. was met at Patucket Bridge by Deputy-Governor Bowen, and a number of other gentlemen, who attended him into town.</p>
            <p>On Friday, the 2d of June, the Continental frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, the Trumbull, James Nicholſon commander, had an engagement with a Britiſh frigate of 35 guns, which laſted five hours. The Trumbull had all her maſts wounded, 8 men killed, and 31 wounded. The Britiſh frigate was ſuppoſed to have ſuffered much.</p>
            <p>In this month, a body of the enemy, under the command of Gen. Knyphauſen, landed in the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and moved towards Springfield. Some ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing enſued; Col. Angel's regiment ſuffered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably.
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:033865_0239_0FF96A52EF171D60"/>A number of men were killed on both ſides. It was now fully confirmed that the enemy's ſhipping paſſed Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan's Iſland, in South-Carolina, on the 9th of April, with a freſh breeze, by which means they received but little dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: they came to anchor between Fort Johnſon and Charleſton, and juſt out of reach of the latter. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton had now advanced his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches ſo far, as to be erecting his batteries. The garriſon made a good defence, but, on the 12th of May, were obliged to ſurrender. Of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, 1 Coloned, 1 Aid-de-camp, 6 Captains, 3 Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, 10 Serjeants, and 68 rank and ſile, were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; 1 Major, 2 Captains, 5 Lieutenants, 18 Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, and 114 rank and file were wounded. Maj. Gen. Lincoln, with Brigadiers Moultrie, M'Intoſh, Woodford, Scott, Duportail and Hogan, with 9 Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onels, 14 Lieut. Colonels, 15 Majors, 84 Captains and Capt. Lieutenants, 84 Lieutenants, 32 Second Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and Enſigns, 209 non-commiſſioned officers, 140 drums and fifes, and 1977 rank and file, including ſick and wounded, of the Continental troops, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the whole, 2564, were taken priſoners. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the foregoing, it was ſaid that there were about 500 naval officers and ſeamen, 250 Charleſton mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, and 500 country militia, alſo taken—the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my pretended many more. About 20 American ſoldiers deſerted to the enemy, during the ſiege. Beſides the artillery and ſtores which fell into the hands of the enemy, (the former being 220 pieces, from 3 to 26 pounders) the Continental frigates, Providence, Boſton, Ranger, and Queen of France, with 4 State gallies, and one French ſhip of war, were loſt. It was ſuppoſed that about 500 Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can men, women and children, were killed, during
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:033865_0240_0FF968CA5BE73810"/>the ſiege. The enemy's loſs, in killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was conſiderable. The enemy broke ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the town on the firſt of April, at the diſtance of 800 yards from the American works. Before the ſurrender of the place, it was contemplated in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, to embark the garriſon, except about one regiment, on board the ſhipping, in the night, and run up the river, and land them; thereby to ſave the army, leaving thoſe in the town to make the beſt terms they could. This opinion for ſome time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, but it was afterwards given up.</p>
            <p>7th.—The Britiſh fleet left Charleſton, ſaid to conſiſt of 2 ſhips of the line, 2 fifties, 2 forty-gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, 6 or 7 frigates, and between 80 and 90 tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; near 2,000 negroes were put on board the fleet. Lord Cornwallis, with about 2,000 men, marched from Charleſton towards North-Carolina. A few days after the ſurrender of Charleſton to the Britiſh troops, the grand arſenal, wherein was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited all the arms, &amp;c. taken from the Americans, took fire and blew up, by which it was ſaid a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men were killed and wounded. The loſs of Charleſton rouſed the country, and ſeemed to give a check to that ſpirit of avarice and ſpeculation which had but too much prevailed in all places, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, by every exertion, to drive the enemy from the country, appeared to be catching from breaſt to breaſt.</p>
            <p>At Rhode-Iſland, every preparation was making for the reception of the French fleet and army. The handſome college at Providence was given up for a hoſpital. The American privateers had been very ſucceſsful, and many valuable prizes were ſent in.</p>
            <p>24th.—Monſieur Corney, a French Commiſſary, arrived at Providence. About this time, it was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the enemy at New-York had ſome in
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:033865_0241_0FF8D837895CCA20"/>tentions of an attempt on our poſts in the Highlands; and ſome of their ſhipping were up the Hudſon.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 30th, Capt. Latouch, in the Hermeone, ſailed from Newport harbour. The ſame day, the Britiſh frigate, the Flora, which was ſunk in Newport harbour nearly two years before, was weighed; ſhe had a quantity of proviſions on board.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 1ſt.—News was received that the enemy were again in motion in the Jerſies.</p>
            <p>2d.—News was received of the ſailing of the French fleet, which left France the 2d of May. It was ſaid in France, that if the fleet fell to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it would viſit Halifax; if to the ſouthward, it would proceed to Rhode-Iſland.</p>
            <p>A great uneaſineſs, at this time, prevailed in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>4th.—The anniverſary of American Independence was celebrated at Providence, by a diſcharge of 13 cannon from the park. Governor Greene, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Corney, and a number of other gentlemen, dined with our General.</p>
            <p>By the laſt accounts, the main army was at Rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paugh, in the Jerſies. In the ſkirmiſh, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſome time before, near Springfield, the Americans had about 40 killed and wounded.</p>
            <p>11th.—At one o'clock, A. M. our General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived advice, by expreſs, that the fleet of our illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious ally was ſeen off Newport, the evening before. Before ſun-riſe an expreſs was ſent forward to Gen. Waſhington with the agreeable tidings, and our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral immediately prepared to proceed to Newport, but the day being calm, the packet did not reach the town until 12 o'clock at night. General Rocham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau had gone on ſhore in the evening. Early the next morning our General went on ſhore, and waited on the Count; from which moment the warmeſt
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:033865_0242_0FF968DFA59D0358"/>friendſhip commenced between our General, the Count, and all the French officers. After breakfaſt, our General went on board the Duke de Burgoyne man-of-war, to pay his reſpects to the Chevalier de <hi>Ternay,</hi> who commanded the ſquadron, where the ſame friendſhip was commenced. The fleet conſiſted of ſeven ſail of the line, viz. the Duke de Burgoyne, of 80 guns; la Neptune, la Conquerant of 74; la Jazen, la Seville, la Ardent, and la Provence of 64; and the Fautaſque of 64, armed enflute with 40 guns as a hoſpital ſhip; two frigates, and two bombs, with a number of tranſports, having on board about 5,000 troops, beſides the marines, the ſoldiers, and ſailors, ſomething ſickly. The joy in the town of Newport was great. At 11 o'clock, A. M. the Admiral ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the town with 13 cannon, which was returned by the diſcharge of the ſame number. In the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the town was beautifully illuminated, and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works exhibited, to the great pleaſure and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our allies. The fleet, on its paſſage to Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, fell in with five Britiſh ſhips of the line, who, after firing a few broad-ſides, bore away.</p>
            <p>12th.—Our General dined with the Count de Rochambeau.</p>
            <p>13th.—The Chevalier de Ternay, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal officers of the ſquadron, came on ſhore.</p>
            <p>14th.—Count de Rochambeau, and the General Officers of the French army, dined with our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral.</p>
            <p>15th.—A number of the Field-Officers of the French regiments, dined with our General in the moſt happy fraternity.</p>
            <p>18th.—Four ſail of ſhips of war, two of them ſuppoſed to be of 40 or 50 guns, appeared in the offing; they were ſuppoſed to be Britiſh. The ſame day, the Chevalier de Ternay, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal officers of the fleet, dined with our General.
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:033865_0243_0FF96A7566276908"/>In the afternoon the remains of the officer, who was ſome time before wounded on board the Hermeone, and died of thoſe wounds, was interred with military honours.</p>
            <p>The miſſing tranſport of the fleet, with troops on board, arrived ſafe in Boſton harbour, and the troops marched to Rhode-Iſland.</p>
            <p>19th.—Our General dined with the Count.</p>
            <p>20th.—The frigates of the ſquadron came to ſail in the morning; but the wind being a-head, they were obliged to come to anchor. Intelligence was received that Admiral Greaves, with five or ſix ſail of the line, arrived at Sandy-Hook on the 13th.</p>
            <p>On the 21ſt, in the afternoon, 15 or 16 ſail of Britiſh ſhips of war appeared in the offing; more than one half of them were ſuppoſed to be ſhips of the line. At ſun-ſet, they appeared to be coming too under Block-Iſland. The frigates, which attempted to get out in the morning, returned at evening.</p>
            <p>Apprehending that the Britiſh fleet might be cruizing off, with a view to intercept the ſecond diviſion of the French fleet, which was expected ſoon to arrive, our General ſent off expreſſes to head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters, Boſton and Hartford, adviſing of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh fleet being off Newport—that diſpatch-boats might be ſent out to apprize the French, and point them to another port. Several works and batteries, next to the harbour, were mantled with cannon.</p>
            <p>22d.—The Britiſh fleet were cruizing off all the day, and rather nearer than they were the preceding day. Eighteen or nineteen ſail were counted, eight or nine of which appeared to be of the line. The French ſquadron kept their former ſtation, in the harbour, and in the moſt perfect readineſs for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The army was in the ſame preparedneſs, and batteries ſo conſtructed as to afford a heavy croſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>23d.—The Britiſh were cruizing off—early in the morning one of their frigates was near in. Col. Greene's regiment of continental troops took poſt at Butt's Hill, Briſtol, and Howland's Ferries. Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty French ſoldiers, from the army, were ſent on board each of the ſhips of the line. By accounts from Weſt-Point, it appeared that many recruits had joined, and were joining, the American army.</p>
            <p>24th.—The Britiſh fleet continued off Newport. In the afternoon, 12 ſail were at anchor to the caſt of Block-Iſland, and 4 frigates cruizing between that Iſland and Point Judith. In the evening, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de la Fayette came to town, from head-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>25th.—Intelligence was received, that Sir Henry Clinton intended an attempt upon the French army, with 10,000 men; upon which 1500 of the militia of Rhode-Iſland, and Brigadier Godfrey's brigade of militia, of the county of Briſtol, in Maſſachuſetts, were called in to Tiverton; and the three months' men, who were deſtined to the main army, ſuch of them as belonged to the counties of Suffolk, Eſſex, Plymouth, Worceſter, Barnſtable and Briſtol, were ordered to march to Rhode-Iſland.</p>
            <p>26th.—A confirmation of the intention of Sir Henry Clinton, againſt Newport, was received from the neighbourhood of New-York. In conſequence of which, the whole militia of the State of Rhode-Iſland was called in. Col. Tyler's, Col. Perry's, and Maj. Bullard's militia regiments, in addition to Brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adier Godfrey's, from Maſſachuſetts. Signals were fixed as far as Watch-Hill, and every thing put in train for the giving inſtant notice, both by day and night, in caſe the enemy ſhould approach towards the place.</p>

               <pb n="247" facs="unknown:033865_0245_0FF96A871AC13A58"/>
27th.—The wind being freſh at ſouth-weſt, and the air hazy, the privateer ſhip Waſhington, Capt. Munroe, ran by the Britiſh fleet, and paſſed up the harbour. The ſtock on Conanicut-Iſland was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be taken off. Howland's Ferry was to be well ſecured on both ſides.</p>
            <p>30th.—Intelligence was received, that the enemy's ſhipping, which were in the Sound, and ſuppoſed to have taken in troops at Whiteſtone, had come to ſail, and ſtood to the weſtward; on which, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia who were coming in, except the three months' men, were permitted to return home. The militia had diſcovered great zeal and alertneſs on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. About noon, the Britiſh ſhips that had been at anchor off Block-Iſland, came to ſail and ſtood out to ſea.</p>
            <p>The ſame day a brig, with diſpatches from France, paſſed up the harbour; ſhe ran on one of the wrecks, and ſunk immediately.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—Our General received letters from Gen. Waſhington, Gen. Howe, Gen. Parſons, and Gov. Trumbull, intimating that the enemy intended an attack on Newport; that about 150 ſail of veſſels were in the Sound; that about 8000 troops were to be employed on the expedition; and that Gen. Sir Henry Clinton was to command in perſon; that 26 heavy cannon, ſome mortars, &amp;c. were put on board. In conſequence of this intelligence, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia were again called in The next day (Auguſt 1ſt) our General received the following letter from Gen. Waſhington.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>"I ARRIVED here laſt night; having met your favours of the 25th and 26th at Paramus, where the army then lay. Immediately upon hearing that the
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:033865_0246_0FF96904E6B0D4B8"/>tranſports, with the troops, which had been ſome days on board, had ſailed eaſtward, I put the army in motion again; they will croſs the ferry to day, and will be joined by the troops from hence. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe moving as rapidly as poſſible down towards Kingſbridge, which will either oblige the enemy to abandon their project againſt Rhode-Iſland, or may afford us an opportunity of ſtriking them to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in this quarter, if Sir Henry Clinton has carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him the number of men reported (eight thouſand) and with leſs than which, I think, he would ſcarcely riſk an attempt upon Count Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambeau, reinforced by the militia.</p>
                  <p>"I entirely approve of the meaſures you have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for calling in aid, and have the ſtrongeſt hopes that if Sir Henry ſhould venture upon an attack, that he will meet a reception very different from what he expects. You know the critical ſituation in which this army will be in a poſition below, and how much depends upon conſtant intelligence of the motions of the enemy. I ſhall direct relays of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the whole way, between this army and you, to convey intelligence in the moſt expeditious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The neareſt expreſs to you will be upon Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Hill; and Gen. Greene adviſes, that you ſhould keep two whale-boats, to communicate with him, by South-Ferry, ſo long as that paſſage ſhall be ſafe; and if that ſhould be interrupted, by Biſſell's Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

            <p>The militia came in with great ſpirit; they were formed into brigades, and every diſpoſition made for inſtant and vigorous defence, at every point where it was ſuppoſed an attempt might be made.
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:033865_0247_0FF96A96C222B508"/>The batteries were ſtrengthened, a very ſtrong one erected on Roſe-Iſland, and redoubts on Coaſter's-Iſland: the ſtrong works on Butt's-Hill puſhed: avenues acroſs the fields, by the ſhorteſt routes, were opened, from the encampment of the French army, to thoſe points where their inſtant preſence was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſary; and ſuch marks ſixed; at ſmall diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from each other, as to prevent any miſtake in the route, either by day or night; indeed, no one precaution was omitted, or probable advantage of ground or ſituation neglected. Had Sir Henry made the attempt which he menaced, he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have met a warm reception; but for ſome reaſon or other he gave up his deſign, and the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia were again ſent home. Perhaps on no occaſion did the militia diſcover more ardour, in preſſing to the field, or more regularity when there, than at that time, which was every where teſtified by the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Our General had expreſſed a wiſh to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief, to join the main army, that he might enjoy that command, to which he was at that time entitled, viz. the right wing; to which Gen. Waſhington, in a letter dated Auguſt 3d, replied: "As to your coming on to the army immediately, I ſhall leave it entirely to yourſelf to act in the affair as you pleaſe. Your command is, and will always be ready for you; however, if you find your preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence where you are neceſſary, and that it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the accommodation of our allies, and to the cultivation of harmony, (matters about which I am very anxious) it may poſſibly be more eligible for you to remain longer, as we ſhall not probably have any inſtant active operations. But, as I have already ſaid, do in the matter as you like, and as circumſtances may decide."</p>

And in a ſubſequent letter ſome days after, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: "As to your wiſhes to join the army, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, your aid may be very material to the Count; and as we have no proſpect of immediate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive operations, I would rather wiſh you to remain with him longer.

            <p>The Britiſh ſhip of war, the Galetea, appeared off Dartmouth. The Britiſh fleet went to Gardner's Bay, excepting the frigates, which cruized off. The troops continued fortifying the iſland.</p>
            <p>15th.—The Britiſh fleet ſailed from Gardner's Bay to the eaſtward. About this time, Maj. Gen. Greene reſigned the Quarter-Maſter Generalſhip, and Col. Pickering was appointed to that office.</p>
            <p>19th.—In the afternoon, the Britiſh again appeared off the harbour of Newport. A few days before, the Continental frigate Alliance arrived at Boſton, in five weeks and four days from France, and brought news that there had been a great mob in England, headed by Lord George Gordon, and that the priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. had been pulled down.</p>

            <p>24th.—The French army, joined by the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, fired ſalutes on account of its being St. Louis' day. The fleet fired on the next day.</p>
            <p>The enemy were preparing for an embarkation of troops at New-York; their deſtination unknown.</p>
            <p>The evening of the 20th, three or four of the enemy's cruizers were off the harbour.</p>
            <p>26th.—The Britiſh fleet, to the number of more than 20 ſail, were in the Vineyard Sound.</p>
            <p>29th.—A number of Indians from the northweſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern tribes came to Newport to pay their reſpects to the General of the army of their father the King of France. They had a hearty welcome, a treat, and preſents, and were much pleaſed. They were alſo invited by our General to a ſumptuous treat. After dinner, they performed their war dance before the officers of the armies, to the great ſatisfaction of thoſe of the French, who had not ſeen the like before. The next day, the French troops were under arms, manoeuvred, and fired, in preſence of the Indians, who were much pleaſed.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—Information was received that Admiral Arbuthnot was near the Vineyard with nine ſaild of the line, eight other ſhips of war of different force, and two tenders; that he had made a demand of 11,000 lb. of beef and mutton, to be delivered every other day, at five pence per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The enemy continued their preparations for ſome grand enterpriſe, which could not be developed.</p>

               <hi>September</hi> 10th.—The Britiſh fleet were returned again to Gardner's Bay, and their old ſtation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Long-Iſland and Block Iſland.</p>
            <p>11th.—Intelligence was received that on the 16th ult. Major-General Gates was totally defeated by the Britiſh, at or near Camden, in South-Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. The Maryland line ſuffered greatly, and Maj. Gen. Baron de Calb was wounded, of which wounds he died.</p>
            <p>14th.—Intelligence was received, that Brig. Gen. Poor, of New-Hampſhire, died at camp on the 8th, of a putrid, fever; and that Brig. Gen. Nixon had reſigned his commiſſion. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton was holding a body of troops, ſaid to be about 6,000, in readineſs to embark at New-York, ſaid to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to the ſouthward. The 17th, in the morning, the Continental regiment, commanded by Colonel Greene, croſſed over from the iſland to Greenwich, from whence they were to march to the main army.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—Intelligence was received that Admiral Rodney arrived at Sandy Hook on the 13th, with ten ſail of the line, and two frigates—that on the 15th, Commodore Drake, with four ſail of the line, was detached from the Hook to join Admiral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buthnot near Gardner's Iſtand, and that theſe four ſhips joined on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This junction was intended to intercept 12 ſail of French men-of-war, which were expected to be coming from the Weſt-Indies to Rhode-Iſland—that the 76th and 80th Britiſh regiments, one Heſſian regiment, the Queen's Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Fanning's corps, a part of the horſe, and all the Britiſh grenadiers and light-infantry, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to embark immediately at New-York—it was conjectured for Virginia. The diſpoſition of the Britiſh troops at that time was ſaid to be as follows: the 22d, 76th Britiſh, 3 Heſſian regiments, Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's corps, and ſome artillery in the city—Highland

Abercrombie, with about 600 infantry, at Huntington—the 17th dragoons at Smithtown—about 1500 men from Haarlem to Kingſbridge. At this time, the Count de Rocham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau and Admiral de Ternay had an interview with Gen. Waſhington, at Hartford.</p>
            <p>22d.—Col. Greene's regiment was ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Greenwich to the iſland. The French army continued very buſy in fortifying Rhode-Iſland: ſome of their works were exceedingly ſtrong, and mounted with heavy metal.</p>
            <p>24th.—In the evening, Gen. Rochambeau and the Admiral returned to Rhode-Iſland.</p>
            <p>30th.—A French frigate arrived at Newport from the Weſt-Indies, but brought no news of conſequence. The Count de Guichen, inſtead of coming this way with the fleet from the Weſt-Indies, was going or gone for Europe.</p>
            <p>While General Waſhington was in interview with General Rochambeau at Hartford, Maj. Gen.

                  <p>"IN the preſent ſituation of things, I think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that you ſhould join the army; and requeſt that
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:033865_0252_0FF8D8A1A4690798"/>you will do it. You will come to head-quarters yourſelf. The route through Litchfield will be the moſt eligible for you, on account of ſecurity; and you may direct your baggage to halt at Fiſh-Kill, for your further orders. I write to the Count de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambeau by this conveyance; and I truſt that your coming away now, will not be attended with any material inconvenience to him.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot conclude, without informing you of an event which has happened here, which will ſtrike you with aſtoniſhment and indignation:—Maj. Gen. Arnold has gone to the enemy. He had had an interview with Major Andre, Adjutant-General of the Britiſh army, and had put into his poſſeſſion a ſtate of the army of the garriſon at this poſt, of the number of men conſidered as neceſſary for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it; a return of the ordnance, and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the artillery corps, in caſe of an alarm. By a moſt providential interpoſition, Major Andre was taken in returning to New-York, with all theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in Gen. Arnold's hand-writing; who, hearing of the matter, kept it to himſelf, left his quarters immediately, under pretext of going over to Weſt Point, on Monday forenoon, about an hour before my arrival; then puſhed down the river in the barge which was not diſcovered till I had returned from Weſt-Point in the afternoon, and when I received the firſt information of Mr. Andre's capture. Meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures were inſtantly taken to apprehend him; but, before the officers ſent for the purpoſe could reach Verplank's Point, he had paſſed it with a flag, and got on board the Vulture ſhip of war, which lay a few miles below. He knew of my approach, and that I was viſiting, with the Marquis, the north and middle redoubts; and from this circumſtance, was ſo ſtraitened in point of time, that I believe he carried with him but very few, if any, material papers;
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:033865_0253_0FF96AC1550E07A8"/>though he has a very preciſe knowledge of the affairs of the poſt. The gentlemen of Gen. Arnold's family, I have the greateſt reaſon to believe, were not privy in the leaſt degree to the meaſure he was carrying on, or to his eſcape.</p>

            <p>Gen. Arnold's panic was ſo great, when he found that the plot was diſcovered, that he called out for a <hi>horſe,</hi> any horſe that firſt came to hand, if it were a waggon-horſe; upon the horſe's being brought, the General mounted, and, inſtead of paſſing to the landing by the uſual path, he rode down a ſteep bank, where it ſeemed impoſſible for a horſe with a rider to get down, without being unhorſed.</p>
            <p>When Arnold had paſſed Verplank's Point, and had got under the guns of the Vulture, he told Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Larvey, who was Cockſwain of the barge, that he was going on board the ſhip, and that he ſhould not return; that if he (Larvey) would ſtay with him, he ſhould have a commiſſion in the Britiſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. To this, Larvey, who was a ſmart fellow, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he would be d—d if he fought on both ſides; the General replied, that he would ſend him on ſhore. Arnold then told the barge crew, that if any or all of them would ſtay with him, they ſhould be treated well; but if they declined ſtaying, they ſhould be ſent on ſhore. One or two ſtaid, the reſt, with the Cockſwain, were ſent on ſhore in the ſhip's boat; the barge was kept. Larvey, for his fidelity, was made a Serjeant. He thought he had merited more; that he ought to have had as much as Arnold promiſed him. He continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, until at his repeated requeſt he was allowed to leave the army.</p>
            <p>Maj. Andre, on his return towards New-York, fell in with three young men below the lines, John Paulding, David Williams, and Iſaac Van Vert; they
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:033865_0254_0FF96BF50A0D4DA0"/>did not at firſt know that Andre was a Britiſh officer, and he was at a loſs whether they were Britiſh, ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugees, or ſtaunch Americans. There was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a little fineſſe exhibited on both ſides; but at length it was fully diſcovered who Andre was. He then attempted to bribe the young men, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them a large ſum of money; but their fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity was too great to be purchaſed. They brought him up, and delivered him to the Americans, where he was tried, ſentenced, and hanged as a ſpy. The Britiſh General on the river endeavoured to ſave his life, firſt by threats, and then by perſuaſions; but all was in vain. Maj. Andre's behaviour, until the time of his execution, was becoming an officer and a gentleman; and ſuch, in his laſt moments, as drew tears from many eyes. But it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that he who conſents to become a ſpy, when he ſets out, has by alluſion a halter put round his neck, and that by the uſage of armies, if he be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, the other end of the halter is ſpeedily made fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Congreſs, pleaſed with the conduct of John Paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, David Williams, and Iſaac Van Vert, paſſed a reſolution, on the 4th of October, directing that 200 dollars, in ſpecie, ſhould be annually paid to them, during life; and that a ſilver medal, deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of their fidelity, with the thanks of Congreſs, ſhould be preſented to each of them.</p>

His waggon-horſes were out in the country at a diſtance; theſe were to be brought in, ſhod, &amp;c. and other preparations to be made, which prevented his leaving Providence until the afternoon of the 9th, when he was attended out of town by a number of officers and other gentlemen. Before he left Providence, he bid Count Rochambeau another farewel, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to which an anſwer was forwarded on after him, as follows:</p>

            <p>Our General had ſcarcely entered on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, before he received intelligence that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were making an incurſion upon the northern frontier of New-York; upon which he immediately, without conſulting the Commander in Chief, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Col.

                  <p>"I AM favoured with your's of yeſterday, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by a letter from his Excellency Governor Clinton, who gives me an account of the incurſion upon the frontiers. I am happy that you detached Ganſevoort's regiment immediately; you will be pleaſed to order either Weiſenfeld's or Willet's, as you may judge proper, to follow, and take orders from the Governor or the commanding officer. This is all the force I think we ought to detach from the poſts, until the views of the enemy are more fully aſcertained. They put off the long expected em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation ſtrangely. They had not ſailed the 13th, and it was then ſaid the expedition was delayed for ſome purpoſe. The number under orders, by eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, are about 2,000, or ſomething upwards. If the militia ſhould not have been diſcharged, when this reaches you, you will be pleaſed to detain about
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:033865_0257_0FF96ADB77948BD0"/>500, to make up for the detachment you have ſent up the river. I have received your's of the 13th, as I have done that incloſing the eſtimates, for which I am much obliged. You will be pleaſed to carry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution what you propoſed, reſpecting the poſts at Stoney and Verplank's Points.</p>

            <p>This was followed by another, dated the 18th, in which the Commander in Chief obſerved, "I am glad to find, by your letter of the 17th, that you were arrived at Weſt-Point, and had taken the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of that important poſt." This was occaſioned by our General's having been on the eaſt ſide of the river a day or two, until the quarters on the point were quitted by Maj. Gen. Greene, who was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſouthward.</p>
            <p>On the 17th, intelligence was received, that the enemy had advanced to Fort George and Fort Ann, both of which had fallen into their hands; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtroying the works, and burning about thirty houſes, and as many barns, they had gone back; but it was apprehended that they would advance again.</p>
            <p>19th.—Maj. Gen. Greene left Weſt-Point. The ſame day intelligence was received, that on the 16th the long talked of embarkation of troops ſailed from New-York, ſuppoſed to be deſtined to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The American troops at this time drove up the fat cattle which were near the lines, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a warrant from Gov. Clinton.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—Intelligence was received, that the enemy were meditating an excurſion as far up as Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond and its vicinity, to ſweep off all the cattle. Our General immediately ordered Col. Hazen, with a detachment of 500 men, to move to Pine's Bridge, and Lieut. Col. Jameſon, with the 2d light dragoons, to move from Bedford towards Col. Hazen. The
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:033865_0258_0FF96C041DFB3F48"/>detachment arrived at Pine's Bridge about 10 o'clock the ſame evening, and Col. Jameſon with the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons at about 2 o'clock the next morning. The evening of the 23d, Col. Hazen returned with the detachment; the enemy did not come out.</p>
            <p>About this time, the enemy received a ſmall rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement at New-York, from England, ſaid to be 1,500 or 2,000. Two or three very valuable prizes, laden with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>26th.—News was received, that the militia, under Gen. Van Renſſelaer, obtained a conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over the enemy at the northward, on the 19th inſtant, at the Fox Mills. The action laſted for ſome hours; the enemy left their baggage, priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, &amp;c. Col. Brown was killed in ſkirmiſhing with the enemy on the morning of the ſame day.</p>
            <p>28th.—Official intelligence was received of a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal advantage gained by the Americans in North-Carolina over a corps of fourteen hundred men, Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh troops, and new levies, commanded by Col. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon. The militia of the neighbouring country under Colonels Williams and Shelby, and others having aſſembled to the number of 3,000, detached 1,600 men on horſeback, to fall in with Ferguſon's party on its march to Charlotte—they came up with

               </gap>ace called King's Mountain, advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly poſted, and gave them a total defeat, in which Col. Ferguſon, with 150 of his men were killed, 800 made priſoners, and 1,500 ſtands of arms taken, with but inconſiderable loſs, except, and greatly to be regretted, the brave Col. Williams, who was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be mortally wounded. A ſecond account ſtated the enemy's whole loſs in killed, wounded and priſoners, at 1,105; and that of the Americans in killed and wounded, 64.</p>
            <p>29th.—Brig. Gen. James Clinton was ordered to Albany, to take the command in that quarter.</p>
            <p>30th.—Capt. Johnſon, with a detachment conſiſting of 100 men, marched to do duty on the lines for the protection of the inhabitants againſt the enemy, and the cow-boys, (ſo called) a ſet of plundering thieves.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—A ridiculous proclamation of the traitor Arnold, made its appearance; he ſtyled himſelf a Brigadier-General, and invited the officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the American army to join him, promiſing ample encouragement, &amp;c. but it had no effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> 1ſt.—A ſevere ſtorm of ſnow and rain. The brave ſoldiers who were but illy clad, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of blankets, were in a ſhivering condition.</p>
            <p>The devaſtation committed by the enemy at the northward, was found to be very great; at leaſt 200 dwellings and 150,000 buſhels of wheat, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of other grain and forage, were ſuppoſed to have been deſtroyed; had not the purſuit after the enemy been very rapid, the devaſtations would have been much greater.</p>
            <p>The American army were at this time experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing a great want of ſlour, which they bore with their uſual patience.</p>

               </gap>4th.—Intelligence was received, that Maj. Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, after being reinforced with 500 men, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning towards Skeenſborough; it was ſuppoſed
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:033865_0260_0FF96C11EA578210"/>that his force had increaſed to about 1,600, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depredations on the frontiers were expected. The militia of the upper counties were again ordered out by Gov. Clinton.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, the new arrangement of the army was publiſhed. The encouragement to both officers and ſoldiers was generous.</p>
            <p>5th.—The troops were again without bread. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence was received that the enemy had landed a body of troops at Portſmouth, in Virginia, and that another embarkation was talked of at New-York.</p>
            <p>6th.—News was received from Boſton, that his Excellency John Hancock had been choſen Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the State of Maſſachuſetts—the firſt Governor under the new conſtitution. The ſame day, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence was received from the northward, that the enemy had croſſed Lake George the Thurſday before, and advanced to Fort Edward, the ſmall garriſon of which abandoned the fort on the approach of the enemy, whoſe numbers were ſaid to be about 800. The militia were out, and the 1ſt and 5th New-York regiments were ordered to embark and ſail for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany immediately. They ſailed early on the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 9th. On the ſame day, intelligence was received, that the enemy had lately made an excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the upper parts of Connecticut river, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed a number of houſes at Royalton. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia turned out with ſpirit, repulſed and purſued them; the enemy made off with precipitation, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their plunder, &amp;c. behind them. Upwards of 2,000 militia were aſſembled in that quarter.</p>
            <p>The 2d regiment of dragoons moved from Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to North-Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The enemy publiſhed ſeveral letters in the New-York papers, which were taken from the Fiſh-Kill poſt-rider not long before at Stratford; in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:033865_0261_0FF96AFCD70AA2C8"/>one from the general officers belonging to the New-England States to their ſeveral Legiſlatures.</p>
            <p>A partial but not general exchange of priſoners took place about this time. Maj. Gen. Lincoln was exchanged for Maj. Gen. Phillips; General Thompſon, and a number of American officers, who had long been priſoners, were alſo exchanged.</p>
            <p>14th.—The great chain, which was laid acroſs the Hudſon at Weſt-Point, was taken up for the winter; it was done under the direction of Colonel Govion, Capt. Buchanan, and Capt. Nevers, with a ſtrong detachment of the garriſon, and with ſkill and dexterity. This chain was as long as the width of the river between Weſt-Point and Conſtitution Iſland, where it was fixed to great blocks on each ſide, and under the fire of batteries on both ſides of the river. The links of this chain were probably 12 inches wide, and 18 inches long; the iron about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> inches ſquare. This heavy chain was buoyed up by very large logs of perhaps 16 or more feet long, a little pointed at the ends, to leſſen their oppoſition to the force of the water on flood and ebb. The logs were placed at ſhort diſtances from each other, the chain carried over them, and made faſt to each by ſtaples, to prevent their ſhifting; and there were a number of anchors dropped at diſtances, with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles made faſt to the chain, to give it a greater ſtability. The ſhort bend of the river at this place was much in favour of the chain's proving effectual; for a veſſel, coming up the river with the faireſt wind and ſtrongeſt way, muſt loſe them on chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her courſe to turn the point; and before ſhe could get under any conſiderable way again, even if the wind was fair, ſhe would be on the chain, and at the ſame time under a heavy ſhower of ſhot and ſhells.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="unknown:033865_0262_0FF96C1B92E94B18"/>
15th.—The 1ſt and 5th New-York regiments returned from Albany, the enemy having returned to Canada; except about 400 men, chiefly Britiſh, who were encamped about 10 miles below Crown-Point. Proviſions were extremely ſcarce at Albany.</p>
            <p>The night of the 16th, a number of the boats were ſtove by the violence of the wind and ſtorm.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 18th, five large flat-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed boats, under the charge of a Subaltern and 25 picked watermen, were ſent down the river to the ſlote above Dobb's-Ferry, where they were to be placed on carriages, and tranſported to a certain place, for an enterpriſe which was meditating againſt the enemy.</p>
            <p>19th.—Five companies, of 50 men each, marched from Weſt-Point, for the purpoſe of impreſſing teams in the upper part of Weſtcheſter, and lower parts of Dutcheſs Counties, preparatory to the grand forage.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, the invalids of the Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut lines, and a detachment of able bodied men, the whole about 1000, arrived at Weſt-Point, from the main army.</p>
            <p>20th.—Three light field-pieces, with four ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition tumbrels, with ammunition for the artillery, and muſquet-cartridges; and alſo a quantity of hard bread, rum, &amp;c. was ſent down to Peek's-Kill, for the uſe of the grand foragers.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—The troops deſtined for the grand forage paraded between Nelſon's Point and the church. Juſt before they marched, Chevalier Chaſtellux, Major General in the French army, at Newport, and ſome other French officers, arrived; the detachment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed before them, and proceeded for the lines. The French officers were much pleaſed with the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the troops.</p>
            <p>Gen. Chaſtellux then accompanied our General over to the Point, and on landing was ſaluted by the
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:033865_0263_0FF96B086B98B0B8"/>diſcharge of 13 cannon; after dinner, he took a view of Forts Clinton, Putnam, Willis, &amp;c. At eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Count Noailles, Count Damas, and Maj. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſſis, arrived at the Point. The next morning, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 9 o'clock, Gen. Chaſtellux, and the other French officers, amidſt a ſevere cold ſtorm of rain, embarked on board the barge, and went down the river, to King's Ferry, on their way to head-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; on leaving Weſt-Point, they were again ſalut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by 13 cannon.</p>
            <p>The evening of the 22d, Brig. Gen. Starks arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at Wright's Mills, and the waggons were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected at North-Caſtle. This grand forage was to maſk an enterprize, which was to have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by Gen. Waſhington, from the main army; although the foraging was in itſelf an important object. The enterprize, for ſome reaſons, was not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, but the grand forage was very ſucceſsful. Some of the light troops went as low down as Eaſt-Cheſter; and on the 27th, Gen. Starks returned with a large quantity of corn, ſome hay, cattle, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The next day, the main army ſeparated to move into winter-quarters, and the light-infantry corps was broken up for the winter, and the men ordered to join their reſpective regiments. The corps of light-infanty was perhaps as fine a body of men as was ever formed. Major-General the Marquis de la Fayette had, with infinite pains and great expenſe, endeavoured to render them reſpectable in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as well as diſcipline, in which he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſeconded by the officers: it was a pity that the operations of the campaign did not afford an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the Marquis to ſignalize himſelf with this corps.</p>
            <p>30th.—The New-Jerſey brigade left Weſt-Point, proceeding down on the weſt ſide of the Hudſon, on their way to Pompton, where they took winter-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:033865_0264_0FF96C2532428BF0"/>In the afternoon, the four Maſſachuſetts brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades arrived at Weſt-Point, and the two Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut brigades on the eaſt ſide of the river, where the whole took winter-quarters.</p>
            <p>A few days before, viz. on the 23d, Maj. Talmadge, with a detachment from the 2d regiment of dragoons, conducted with great addreſs an enterprize againſt the enemy's Fort, St. George, on Long-Iſland. Fort St. George was ſtockaded, and encompaſſed a large ſpot of ground, a ſquare redoubt, with a ditch and abbatis. The enterprize ſucceeded completely. One half-pay Lieutenant-Colonel, 1 half-pay Captain, 1 Subaltern, and 50 rank and file, were made priſoners. The fort was deſtroyed and burnt. Two armed veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels burnt, and a large magazine of hay, ſaid to be about 300 tons, was deſtroyed.</p>

Hart, Enſign M'cCal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, Mr. Buchanan, Mr. M'cGuyer, and twenty-four non-commiſſioned officers and privates, in one barge and two whale-boats. The wind was very freſh at north-weſt in the night, and the boats were forced paſt the city, and one of them almoſt down to Sandy-Hook—one of the boats put in at Staten Iſland: at length the three went round to Brunſwick, from whence the Major and all the others, returned to the army on the 1ſt of January.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—On the evening of the 29th, a party of the enemy from Delancy's corps, conſiſting of about 100 infantry and 50 horſe, came up to North-Caſtle, where, after a ſhort halt, they proceeded towards Bedford New Purchaſe. Capt. Pritchard, who was poſted at Bedford with a company of continental troops, and ſome militia, immediately advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, attacked their van, who retreated, as did their main body. Capt. Pritchard purſued them as far as Young's. It was ſaid that one of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy was killed and ſeveral wounded, who were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off in a waggon. Four oxen and between 30 and 40 ſheep were retaken—eight or ten head of cattle were driven off: the Captain ſuſtained no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>

            <p>1781. <hi>January</hi> 1ſt.—The Pennſylvania line mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinied almoſt to a man, ſeized the artillery, broke op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the magazines of ammunition and proviſions, took out what they judged neceſſary, and took up their line of march. The officers exerted themſelves, both by threats and perſuaſion, to reduce them to order; but all was in vain. They were told that the enemy might take the advantage of their conduct, and come out—they anſwered, that if the enemy came out, they would immediately put themſelves under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their officers, and fight them; but that in any other caſe they would not be commanded. They took Gen. Wayne's horſes out of his ſtable, and put them to draw the field-pieces. At night they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, poſting out pickets, guards, and planting centinels in a very regular manner. An alarm was given to the country by firing the beacons, &amp;c. and the militia were aſſembling. The reaſons given for the revolt, were the intolerable ſufferings of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my— the want of pay, of which 11 months was due— the want of cloathing, many of the troops being almoſt naked—the want of proviſions, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were held beyond the term of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtment. They directed their march towards Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, determined to demand redreſs of their grievances of Congreſs.</p>
            <p>7th.—Maj. Gen. Knox was ſent off by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief to the eaſtern States, to repreſent the alarming ſituation and ſufferings of the army.</p>
            <p>8th.—Major Throop, with 100 men, was ſent towards Pompton, in the Jerſies, to cover the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:033865_0268_0FF96C379F0FC070"/>ſtores, at Ringwood. In the afternoon, 169 bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of flour arrived at the Point.</p>
            <p>11th.—His Excellency the Commander in Chief came down to Weſt-Point, when a Council of War was held at our General's quarters, in which all the General Officers on the ground, and all the Colonels and commanding officers of regiments ſat, to conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er what meaſures were neceſſary to be adopted, with reſpect to the Pennſylvania line. After the Council, by order of the Commander in Chief, our General iſſued orders for the forming of five battalions, by detachment from the ſeveral lines, to be held in the moſt perfect readineſs to march on the ſhorteſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, with four days proviſions cooked. The muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers remained on the heights of Princetown, and two emiſſaries were ſent out to them from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with offers, in writing, promiſing to redreſs their grievances, by diſcharging them from their enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, paying all their arrearages of pay and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, and exempting them from ſerving in the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh army, if they ſhould chooſe it. The mutineers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſdained theſe offers, and gave up the emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and their papers: they were tried, and hanged as ſpies; the one was an inhabitant of New-Jerſey, the other was a Britiſh Serjeant. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton and Gen. Knyphauſen were ſaid to have been on Staten Iſland. The State appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to inquire into the grounds of the complaints of the mutineers, and to redreſs ſuch as appeared to have foundation: this brought the buſineſs to a cloſe. A number of the ſoldiers were diſcharged, the reſt returned to their duty.</p>
            <p>Accounts were received from the ſouthward, that the American army in that quarter were in a moſt miſerable condition, on account of cloathing and proviſions, and that their ſufferings were greater than thoſe experienced by the main army. Theſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:033865_0269_0FF96B3C388FDBC0"/>of the army were rendered the keener, by the return of the officers and ſoldiers from furlough, who had been in the great ſea-port towns, where ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery neceſſary and luxury of life were enjoyed, in the greateſt abundance, many tables groaning under the preſſure of the dainties with which they were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Their liquors were not only the beſt, but alſo of great variety. Such reports to men, ſtanding cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, as it were, in the jaws of death, ill clad, cold and hungry, with nothing but water oftentimes to drink, were trials almoſt too great for human nature to bear. The old Continental currency was fixed at 75 for one, at Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>13th.—The Marquis de la Fayette and Count Deuxponts viſited Weſt-Point.</p>
            <p>17th.—Intelligence was received, that the troops which ſome time before ſailed from New-York, were in the Cheſapeak, under the command of Gen. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold, and ſuppoſed to be on a plundering expedition.</p>
            <p>The enemy at New-York removed the greater part of their ſhipping from the Eaſt River round in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the North River.</p>
            <p>18th.—Two hundred men, properly officered, marched down to the lines, under pretence of being a relief; 100 men of Hazen's regiment moved from Fiſhkill, to the village, and a detachment of artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from Weſt-Point. Theſe were intended for an enterprize againſt the enemy.</p>
            <p>19th.—150 men from the Connecticut line, and 200 from the New-Hampſhire line, were to move towards the lines; theſe, with thoſe who marched from Hazen's the day before, were to form a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party to the detachment under Lieut. Col. Hull, who was to make an attempt on Delancy's corps.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—A letter was received from Major Throop, at Ringwood, ſtating, that the evening before, the Jerſey line, at Pompton, had revolted, and it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Jerſey line, at Pompton, had revolted, and it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:033865_0270_0FF96C42B2A1BF08"/>would be joined by the other part of the line, who were at Chatham. Their intentions had not been developed.</p>
            <p>22d.—His Excellency Gen. Waſhington, the Marquis de la Fayette, and a number of French gentlemen, viſited the Point. The ſame day, 500 rank and file, properly officered from the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, Connecticut, and New-Hampſhire lines, were detached, and ordered to march the next day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Maj. Gen. Howe, to eſtabliſh order and diſcipline in the Jerſies.</p>
            <p>23d.—The detachment marched from Weſt-Point for the Jerſies. The battalion from thence was commanded by Col. Sprout. The troops on the eaſt ſide of the river were to croſs, and join thoſe from the Point, at King's-Ferry: the detachment marched in high ſpirits.</p>
            <p>24th.—In the morning, about ſun-riſe, a noiſe was heard in the air, reſembling the firing of platoon, and there were various conjectures reſpecting it. Intelligence was received, that Gen. Arnold had gone up James River, in Virginia, and had taken poſſeſſion of Williamſburg, and was moving towards Richmond; that he met with but little oppoſition, and would probably plunder large quantities of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco and other articles.</p>
            <p>28th.—The detachment, under the command of Lieut. Col. Hull, returned from the enterprize againſt the enemy at Morriſſania. The addreſs and gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the officers, the bravery and patience of the troops, exhibited on the occaſion, did them much honour. Beſides a number of the enemy who were killed, upwards of fifty were made priſoners; the Pontoon Bridge was cut away, the huts and forage were burnt, and a large number of cattle driven up. Of the detachment, one Enſign, one drummer, and ten rank and file, were killed; one Captain, one
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:033865_0271_0FF96B49EAA38ED0"/>Serjeant, and eleven rank and file wounded; ſix rank and file were miſſing</p>
            <p>31ſt.—Maj. Gen. Howe returned with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment from the Jerſies; order was eſtabliſhed among the troops in that quarter: two of the ring leaders in the revolt were executed. It was learnt, that conſiderable damage was done to the enemy's ſhipping, at New-York, by the high guſts of wind, on the night of the 23d. It was alſo ſaid, that a Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh 74 gun ſhip was diſmaſted, off New-London; another ſtruck a reef, and a third went out to ſea with one of her maſts loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 12th.—The Duke de Lauzen, Count Pherſon and Col. Sheldon, of the French army, viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited Weſt-Point.</p>
            <p>13th.—Intelligence was received, that on the 17th ultimo, an action happened near Pedee, in Carolina, between a body of the enemy, under Lieut. Col. Tarleton, and a body of about 800 Americans, under the command of Gen. Morgan: the enemy were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally routed, and purſued upwards of 20 miles. Of the enemy, 10 officers and 100 rank and file were killed, and 200 wounded; 29 officers and 500 rank and file were taken priſoners, with two field-pieces, 2 ſtandards, 800 muſkets, 35 waggons, 70 negroes, 100 dragoon-horſes, one travelling-forge, and all their muſic. The loſs of the Americans was not more than 12 killed, and 60 wounded.</p>
            <p>14th.—Gen. Warner and Col. Aſhley, of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, arrived at Weſt-Point, to diſtribute to the ſoldiers of the Maſſachuſetts line, engaged to ſerve during the war, 24 dollars, in ſpecie, each, as a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous gratuity from the State. The moſt ſenſible ſoldiers did not applaud this meaſure, as it did not aſſure to them the full payment of the wages due to them, while this boon increaſed the burden of debt on the State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="274" facs="unknown:033865_0272_0FF8D8C047CC1030"/>
16th.—Count de St. Maim, of the French army, viſited Weſt-Point. The ſame day, orders were iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for augmenting the light companies of all the regiments at Weſt-Point, and its dependencies, to 50 rank and file, each: they were to rendezvous, the 18th or 19th, at Peek's Kill.</p>
            <p>17th.—The light companies were formed into battalions, in the following order: the eight eldeſt companies of the Maſſachuſetts line to form a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion, under the command of Col. Voſe and Maj. Galvan; the two youngeſt companies of that line, and thoſe of Connecticut and Rhode Iſland, to form a battalion, under the command of Col. Gamat and Maj. Throop; thoſe of the New-Hampſhire line, and Col. Hazen's regiment, and ſuch others as might be joined to them, to form a battalion. This appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of officers, was declared to be intended not to affect the general plan of arranging the light-infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for the campaign. The preceding morning, the enemy made an excurſion from Morriſſania, towards Bedford', took Lieuts. Carpenter, Wright and Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, and five other inhabitants, priſoners; burnt five houſes, plundered and ſtript ſeveral other inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, and returned. They were purſued by Capt. Pritchard, but could not be overtaken.</p>
            <p>18th.—The light companies were inſpected. It appeared that Admiral Arbuthnot's ſquadron were ſo much damaged, in the ſtorm, on the 23d ult. as to be rendered inferior to the French, in theſe ſeas.</p>
            <p>20th.—A detachment of artillery was ordered from the park, to join the light-infantry; the whole were to be commanded by the Marquis de la Fayette, and were to march to the ſouthward. The ſame day, ſix of our guides, on a reconnoitring party, towards King's Bridge, fell in with a reconnoitring party of Delancy's corps: the guides attacked them, and took five priſoners, all of whom were wounded.</p>
            <p>

            <p>28th.—Intelligence was received, that a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able embarkation of troops was taking place at New-York— the inhabitants and army in ſome conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It was ſaid that a fleet of French merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had arrived in the Cheſapeak; but from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, there were good grounds to ſuſpect that there was ſomething more than merchant ſhips.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 1ſt.—News was received, that a part of the French ſquadron, at Newport, had ſailed as far as the Cheſapeak, where they took the Romulus, of 50 guns, and nine privateers and tranſports; four of the latter they deſtroyed, not having ſpare men to navigate them; but the remainder, with the Romulus, had ſafely arrived at Rhode-Iſland.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 2d of March, Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington ſet out from New-Windſor, for Rhode-Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and. By the laſt accounts from the ſouthward, Lord Cornwallis was advancing rapidly, and Gen. Greene retreating moderately. His Lordſhip had deſtroyed his waggons, and diſengaged himſelf of incumbrance as much as poſſible.</p>
            <p>3d.—A Capt. Simmons, of Delancy's corps, was ſent up to Weſt-Point; he aſſerted to be diſaffected to the enemy on ſome pretences, and that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his commiſſion, and deſerted from them: he was ſent to the Governor of the State.</p>
            <p>5th.—Three priſoners were ſent up; they were taken by a party of our guides, within a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the enemy's poſt, No. 8, near Morriſſania.</p>
            <p>6th and 7th.—Col. Vanſcaak's regiment of the New-York line arrived at Weſt-Point, from Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The troops were at this time well ſupplied with
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:033865_0274_0FF96C5B541501A8"/>proviſions, but almoſt totally deſtitute of forage, and ſubjected to great fatigue in obtaining fuel, which part of the troops were obliged to bring on their backs, nearly a mile.</p>
            <p>9th.—Intelligence was received, that the laſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation of Britiſh troops ſailed from New-York the preceding Wedneſday, ſaid to be ſix regiments, making about 3,000 men in the whole. The ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern militia had been ſucceſsful againſt the Cherokee Indians, and deſtroyed a number of their towns. The laſt advices from the ſouthward ſtated, that Lord Cornwallis had continued to puſh rapidly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gen. Greene, who had croſſed Dan River, and his Lordſhip had come up to it, and then began to retreat; on which Gen. Greene re-croſſed the Dan, in order to purſue him, and that the militia were collecting. Gen. Arnold kept cloſe at Portſmouth; Gen. Mecklenburgh was near him, with a ſuperior force, and the Marquis de la Fayette was as far as Elk on the 3d, with the light-infantry.</p>
            <p>11th.—A detachment of recruits from Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts arrived. The ſame day, Capt. Pray was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take command of the Block Houſe, at Dobb's Ferry, the water-guards, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the firſt of this month, the Confederation and perpetual Union of the Thirteen American States, from New-Hampſhire to Georgia, incluſive, was ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ratified by all the Delegates in Congreſs.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 12th, intelligence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Capt. Pray, that at about two o'clock in the morning, he was alarmed by the firing of guns, blowing of horns, &amp;c.—that the enemy were out on both ſides of the river. In conſequence of this, an expreſs was ſent off to Maj. Maxwell, to be on his guard; and a detachment of 150 men was ordered to be in readineſs to march early the next morning, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

13th.—The intelligence of the enemy being out on both ſides of the river, was confirmed; as to the weſt ſide of the river, the enemy came out from Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus-Hook about 200 ſtrong, with two field-pieces, and had advanced within about three miles of the Block-Houſe, at Dobb's Ferry. About noon, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of 150 men, under the command of Maj. Graham, with one field-piece, embarked on board a ſloop, and with the gun-boat, having one ſix and one three pounder, and and a flat boat, fell down the river to King's Ferry, where they were ordered to debark, and make a movement to Tappan, for the relief of the Block-Houſe. The garriſons of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts, on the eaſt ſide, were doubled.</p>
            <p>14th.—About noon, Maj. Graham returned; he had, with the detachment, embarked the preceding day, proceeded to King's Ferry, diſembarked, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Haverſtraw, where he met the militia return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; when he returned to the Ferry, re-embarked, and arrived at Weſt-Point about noon; having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a ſpirit and expedition that did the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much honour.</p>
            <p>The enemy were completely defeated in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, by the militia, who early turned out, attacked, repulſed, and purſued them, until they retook all their plunder, except two horſes, and juſtly merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed high commendation. The militia had one man wounded; the enemy were ſuppoſed to have had ſeveral killed and wounded. The ſame day, Brig. Gen. Hand was announced, in general orders, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutant-General of the army; in the room of Col.

            <p>15th.—Intelligence was received that the enemy's fleet, which ſailed from New-York the preceding week, returned on Sunday, having found that the
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:033865_0276_0FF96C61F2061B48"/>French fleet were on the coaſt; their return occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſome conſternation at New-York.

            <p>16th.—It was learnt that the French fleet, with troops, ſailed from Rhode-Iſland on the 8th; and it was ſaid that Admiral Arbuthnot, with the Britiſh fleet, came out of Gardner's Bay on the 10th. The ſmall-pox at this time made its appearance in the vicinity of the army, and ſeveral ſoldiers were taken down with that diſtemper. The enemy who were out a day or two before, on the eaſt ſide of the Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, did no miſchief. About this time, a diſcovery was made, that a number of perſons at Stratford, Norwalk, &amp;c. had been ſecretly aſſociating, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the enemy, if a favourable opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and to ſupply them with proviſions, furniſh intelligence, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>19th.—Letters from Gen. Greene, of the 28th ult. at Highrockford, on Haw River, adviſed that Lord Cornwallis had retreated from Hillſborough, and that Gen. Pickens and Col. Lee had fallen in with Col. Hamilton's corps, (riſing of 200) and had killed and taken almoſt every individual of them; and that ſeveral other ſkirmiſhes had happened, but nothing deciſive. Lord Cornwallis had erected the Royal ſtandard at Hillſborough, and iſſued a vain proclamation, as uſual.</p>
            <p>By accounts from New-York, it appeared that the Britiſh had declared war againſt the Dutch, and had taken poſſeſſion of St. Euſtatia.</p>
            <p>20th.—In the afternoon, Gen. Waſhington arrived at head-quarters, at New-Windſor, from the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="unknown:033865_0277_0FF96B77D639F8D0"/>
21ſt.—Five priſoners of war were ſent to Weſt-Point, they were taken by ſome of the light parties below the lines; a ſixth who was taken was ſo bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, as to be left behind for the preſent.</p>
            <p>22d.—Several reſolutions of the State of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, in favour of the line of the army, and for the diſcharge of governmental ſecurities, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at Weſt-Point.</p>
            <p>23d.—Intelligence was received, that the Britiſh fleet, which ſailed from New-York ſome time before, and had been chaſed back by the French fleet, ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again on the preceding Wedneſday, for the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. It was ſaid that Sir Henry Clinton was on board, and that Gen. Knyphauſen was to command in his abſence—that the enemy were collecting a number of flat boats in Spitten-Devil Creek, near Kingſbridge, and that 24 were then collected—that Arnold's corps was under orders to be in readineſs to man the boats. Two ſpies were ſent out of New-York, the ſame day that the fleet ſailed; they were to paſs, by different routes, through the country to Canada.</p>
            <p>24th.—A number of priſoners of war, who had been collected at Weſt-Point, were ſent off, under a guard of 60 men, commanded by Capt. Pope, to Lancaſter, in Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>28th.—The New-Hampſhire brigade were ordered to do duty on the lines; and the Rhode-Iſland regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to return to their quarters near Robinſon's Mills.</p>
            <p>29th.—News was received from Philadelphia, that the French and Engliſh fleets had had an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment off the Capes of Virginia, but that the iſſure was not known. The ſame day, intelligence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from New-York, that one of Admiral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buthnot's ſhips had returned to New-York, on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and reported that there had been an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:033865_0278_0FF96C7CA6B49D78"/>between the two fleets, and that it was a drawn battle.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—A New-York paper of the 28th was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which it was ſaid that an engagement between the two fleets took place on the 16th, off the Capes of Virginia, in which ſeveral ſhips on both ſides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived conſiderable damage; and that the Britiſh had 1 Lieutenant, 2 midſhipmen, and 40 ſeamen killed, and 80 wounded. The French account was not greatly different from that of the Britiſh, but did not mention the number of killed or wounded.</p>
            <p>A number of American ſoldiers who had not had the ſmall-pox, were collected and inoculated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 3d.—Intelligence was received, that a battle had been fought between Gen. Greene's army and that of Lord Cornwallis. The action was bloody; and although his Lordſhip may be ſaid to have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the victory, as Gen. Greene retreated a mile from the field of battle, yet it was a dear bought victory. Gen. Greene having loſt his horſes, 4 pieces of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non fell into the hands of the enemy. Some of the Britiſh corps, and in particular the guards, ſuffered much. This day, Capt. Pray, of the water-guards, was reinforced with a whale-boat, a Subaltern, and 14 men.</p>
            <p>4th.—Gen. Waſhington viſited the Point. In the afternoon, 2 priſoners of war were ſent up—they were of a party who had croſſed Croten River, and taken 16 head of cattle and 4 horſes. On their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, near Dobb's Ferry, they were overtaken by a party of the militia—the cattle, &amp;c. retaken, and two of the party made priſoners. About this time, the ſouthern mail was carried off, between head-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the Jerſies. The mail contained ſome let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of importance. The troops which had ſailed from New-York, arrived ſafe in the Cheſapeak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="unknown:033865_0279_0FF96B8606056D78"/>
7th.—Private intelligence was received, that four parties were to be ſent out—one to take Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, another the Governor of New-Jerſey, a third the Governor of New-York, the object of the fourth not known. The ſame day, the gun-boat was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take a ſtation oppoſite Fort Montgomery; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional guards to be mounted in the night time, and patroles to paſs frequently.</p>
            <p>8th.—The enemy's flat boats, which had been col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected near Kingſbridge, were removed down into the Eaſt River.</p>
            <p>9th.—Intelligence was received from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer on the lines, that the enemy were out towards White Plains, ſaid to be about 90 horſe and 50 foot.</p>
            <p>10th.—The great chain was hauled from off the beach near the red houſe at Weſt-Point, and towed down to the blocks, in order to its being laid acroſs the river—about 280 men were ordered on this duty.</p>
            <p>11th.—The chain was properly fixed with great dexterity, and fortunately without any accident.</p>
            <p>12th.—Our General viſited the patients who were under inoculation with the ſmall-pox, when 500 were turned out and drawn up, all of whom were then under the operation, and in a fine way. The ſame day, intelligence was received that the enemy were preparing for another embarkation at New-York, ſuppoſed for the ſouthward.</p>
            <p>14th.—A groom, belonging to Col. Gunning of the 82d Britiſh regiment, came up; he deſerted from his maſter with a very good ſaddle-horſe, which he ſold for 100 dollars in ſpecie. Intelligence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the enemy had brought a large number of waggons acroſs the Sound from Long-Iſland, for the purpoſe of making a grand forage; the covering
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:033865_0280_0FF96C7047769948"/>party to conſiſt of three or four hundred men, of different corps.</p>
            <p>22d.—Two hundred and forty thouſand dollars in new emiſſion bills were brought to Weſt-Point, from Boſton, for the troops of the Maſſachuſetts line.</p>
            <p>24th.—Monſieur Beville, Quarter-Maſter of the French army at Newport, arrived at head-quarters, New-Windſor; he came on to view the roads, and determine on the beſt route, ſhould the French ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my move that way, and to fix on proper places for magazines, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>26th.—Gen. Waſhington viſited Weſt-Point, with Monſieur Beville, &amp;c. The next day, the latter ſet out on his return to Rhode-Iſland, taking the lower road through Connecticut. Many of the ſoldiers, who had gone through the ſmall-pox, joined their regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the next day: of 500 who had been inoculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, four only had then died. At this time, proviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions were growing very ſcarce at Weſt-Point, and the proſpects daily growing more alarming. The magazines in Forts Clinton, Putnam, and ſome other of the moſt important works, had reſerves of the beſt proviſions, which were not to be touched; that, in caſe the enemy, by any ſudden movement, ſhould inveſt them, and cut off the communication with the country, the garriſons might be enabled to hold out, until other troops, or the militia of the country, could march to the relief of the beſieged; but unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, the ſcarcity of proviſions had become ſo great, that even theſe reſerves were broken in upon, and ſome of them nearly exhauſted; when, after ſome other repreſentations, our General addreſſed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing letter to Gen. Waſhington.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>"YOU will be pleaſed to proceed immediately to the ſeveral eaſtern States, with the diſpatches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the Governors of Connecticut, Rhode-Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, Maſſachuſetts Bay, and the Preſident of New-Hampſhire, on the ſubject of ſupplies for the army. The preſent critical and alarming ſituation of our troops and garriſons, for the want of proviſions, is (from the nature of your command) ſo perfectly known to you, and your perſonal influence with the New-England States is ſo conſiderable, that I could not heſitate to commit to you a <hi>negociation,</hi> on the ſucceſs of which, the very exiſtence of the army depends.</p>
                  <p>"The great objects of your attention and miſſion, are, 1ſt—An immediate ſupply of beef cattle. 2d— The tranſportation of all the ſalted proviſions in the
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:033865_0283_0FF96B9DF0570FA0"/>weſtern parts of Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts; and 3d—The eſtabliſhment of a <hi>regular, ſyſtematic, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual plan,</hi> for feeding the army through the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. Unleſs the two former are effected, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Fort Schuyler muſt inevitably, that of Weſt-Point may probably, <hi>fall,</hi> and the whole army be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded: without the latter, the ſame perplexing wants, irregularities and diſtreſs, which we have ſo often experienced, will inceſſantly occur, with event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual far greater evils, it not final ruin.</p>
                  <p>"With regard to the particular mode of obtaining and tranſporting ſupplies, I will not preſume to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; but ſomething muſt now be attempted on the ſpur of the occaſion. I would ſuggeſt whether it would not be expedient for a Committee from the ſeveral States, (conſiſting of a few active, ſenſible men) to meet at ſome convenient place, in order to make out, upon a uniform and great ſcale call the arrangements reſpecting ſupplies and tranſportation for the campaign. In the mean time, to avoid the impending diſſolution of the army, the States muſt individually comply preciſely with the requiſitions of the Quarter-Maſter and Commiſſary upon them.</p>
                  <p>"As the ſalted proviſions which have been put up for the public, in the eaſtern States, (except in the weſtern parts of Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at preſent be tranſported to the army, you will obtain <hi>accurate official returns</hi> of the quantity that has been procured in the reſpective States, at what places, and in whoſe charge it actually is; and if it ſhould not all be collected and lodged in the depoſits that have been pointed out, you will urge this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be done; and that the proviſions ſhould be repacked, ſtored, and taken care of in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to prevent the hazard of its being tainted or loſt by the approaching hot ſeaſon.</p>

            <p>During the month of April, a large number of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits from the eaſtern States, to fill up their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective battalions, arrived at Weſt-Point.</p>
            <p>9th.—The Commander in Chief viſited Weſt-Point.</p>
            <p>11th.—In the morning, our General left Weſt-Point, and proceeced up the river to New-Windſor, where he received from the Commander in Chief the diſpatches addreſſed to the ſeveral Executives of the New-England States; and in the afternoon croſſed the Hudſon, on his journey eaſtward. On his reaching Fiſhkill, he found that Governor Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, of New-York, was making every exertion in his power for the relief of the army—that he had iſſued impreſs warrants, to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>our and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions where they could be found, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>14th.—He arrived at Hartford, where he found the Legiſlature in ſeſſion. The diſpatches to Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Trumbull were immediately preſented to him, with an earneſt requeſt for ſpeedy relief. This venerable patriot gave aſſurance of his immediate attention and exertions, and accordingly laid the diſpatches from Gen. Waſhington before the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, who alſo diſcovered the ſame noble patriotiſm. They inquired into the ſtate of their treaſury, and finding it was deſtitute of money, except a ſum ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to another purpoſe, they ordered this money to be taken, and directed Col. Champion, one of their number, (a gentleman remarkable for his knowledge in the ſtate of proviſions in all the towns, ſkill in purchaſing, and expedition in for
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:033865_0286_0FF96CA522963B98"/>warding) immediately to purchaſe and forward on to the army 160 head of beef cattle, and 1,000 bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of ſalted proviſions from their ſtores; and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make every other exertion in their power, to comply with the requiſitions of the Commander in Chief, as they reſpected both freſh and ſalted provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by appointing a Committee for a general arrangement of ſupplies.</p>
            <p>16th.—Our General left Hartford, and on the 18th reached Greenwich, in the State of Rhode-Iſland, where he waited upon Gov. Greene, and preſented the diſpatches from Gen. Waſhington. The Legiſlature of the State were not then in ſeſſion; but Gov. Greene made the moſt ſatisfactory aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that the State of Rhode-Iſland would adopt every meaſure recommended by the Commander in Chief. Our General left Greenwich the ſame day, and arrived at his houſe in Roxbury on the evening of the 19th, and the next day waited upon Gor. Hancock at Boſton, and preſented the diſpatches with which he was charged. The new Legiſlature of Maſſachuſetts were to convene on the laſt Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day day of the month. Gov. Hancock gave the fulleſt aſſurances, that in the interim the Executive would do every thing in its power for the immediate relief of the army, by directing the ſeveral contractors of proviſions in the State to forward all in their power with the utmoſt expedition.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—Intelligence was received at Boſton, that the State ſhip-of-war, the Protector, of 28 guns, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Capt. Williams, had been taken and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into New-York.</p>
            <p>The next day, intelligence was received, that on the 13th, Col. Greene, of the Rhode-Iſland regiment, who was doing duty on the lines of the American army, was ſurpriſed by a body of the enemy's horſe, ſuppoſed to be about 150 dragoons, and that the
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:033865_0287_0FF96CBCF6842570"/>Colonel, Maj. Flagg, two Subalterns, and 27 men were killed, and ſeveral wounded. Col. Greene was a brave and intrepid officer, and his loſs was much regretted. The Colonel had taken poſt above and near to Croten River, at a place where the river was fordable, to prevent the enemy paſſing up by this ford to ravage the country. He had practiſed the greateſt vigilance in guarding this for in the night time, taking off the guards after ſun-riſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that the enemy would never preſume to croſs the river in the day time; but the enemy, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learnt his mode of doing duty, on the morning of the 13th effected his overthrow, by croſſing the ford ſoon after the guards had come off, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding their quarters before they had an idea of any enemy being near them. In this ſituation, the utmoſt exertion could not then avail them.</p>
            <p>23d.—Our General left Roxbury on his way to New-Hampſhire, arrived at Exeter on the evening of the 24th, and delivered to the Honorable Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>are the diſpatches addreſſed to him. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of New-Hampſhire was not then in ſeſſion. The next day, he had an interview with the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable Preſident and the Council of Safety, when ſuch repreſentations, (in addition to the requiſitions of the Commander in Chief) were made to them, as the exigencies of the caſe required; and the fulleſt aſſurances were received, that every aid in the power of the State ſhould be afforded.</p>
            <p>26th.—Our General left Exeter on his return, and on the 27th arrived at his houſe in Roxbury. On the 29th, he again waited on Gov. Hancock, and requeſted that the requiſitions of the Commander in Chief of the army might be predominant in all the public objects.</p>
            <p>The 30th was the General Election day in Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts; and it appeared that his Excellency John
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:033865_0288_0FF8D8DC2C4EFCB0"/>Hancock was re-elected Governor, who, as ſoon as the two Houſes were organized, laid the requiſitions of Gen. Waſhington before them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 2d.—Our General was heard before a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of both Houſes on the ſubject of his miſſion. The zeal and patriotiſm of the ſeveral Executives and Legiſlatures of the New-England States, to relieve and amply ſupply the army with proviſions, were ſo conſpicuous on this occaſion, that it is not poſſible to ſay which, or whether any one of them exceeded the other; each was for making every exertion in its power; and, to enſure ſucceſs to their reſolutions, they all fell in with the recommendation of the Commander in Chief, and appointed Committees to meet in Convention, to digeſt and ſyſtemize the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. The Committees met accordingly at Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence, in Rhode Iſland, and were ſo fortunate in their arrangements, that the moſt ample ſupplies of meat were afterwards furniſhed for the main army, and a ſurplus of 100 head of beef cattle weekly ſent on after Gen. Waſhington towards Virginia, until he ordered a diſcontinuance of that ſupply, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the ſequel. While the New-England States were thus intent in ſupplying meat for the army, the State of New-York was equally aſſiduous in furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flour and forage.</p>
            <p>4th.—Intelligence was received by a veſſel from the Weſt-Indies, that the Count de Graſſe, with a French fleet of upwards of 20 ſail of the line, had arrived in that quarter. The ſame day, there was a confirmation of this news, and that the fleet, with troops on board, was ſeen coming this way.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, intelligence was received, that there had been an action at the ſouthward, between Gen. Greene and the Britiſh army in that quarter. Gen. Greene, having reconnoitred Cambden, did not think it expedient to ſtorm the enemy's works, but
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:033865_0289_0FF95F9FDABDF280"/>retired a little back, with a view to draw the enemy out; in this he ſucceeded, and an action commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Maryland troops being attacked under ſome diſadvantage, an attempt was made to change their poſition; this was unfortunately taken by Gen. Greene's army for a retreat, and the whole army retreated accordingly. Gen. Greene had. 17 men killed; his retreat was about 2 or 3 miles, and the troops were in high ſpirits. It is always a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous manoeuvre to change a poſition in the face of an enemy; but neceſſity ſometimes requires it.</p>
            <p>Gen. Phillips, of the Britiſh army, had died in Virginia, of a fever.</p>
            <p>6th.—The Continental frigate, Alliance, arrived in Boſton harbour from France. The Alliance had taken 6 prizes; 2 Weſt-Indiamen, 2 ſloops of war, and 2 privateers. In the engagement with the ſloops of war, both of which engaged the Alliance in a calm, Capt. Barry was wounded in the ſhoulder by a grape-ſhot; the Captain of Marines, and 8 or 9 men killed, and about 20 wounded.</p>
            <p>9th.—Orders came on from Gen. Waſhington, to forward with all poſſible diſpatch all the cannon, mortars, powder, ſhot, ſhells, and other military ſtores belonging to the United States, which were then in Maſſachuſetts and Rhode-Iſland, and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting the loan of ſome heavy artillery, powder, &amp;c. of the State. The moſt ſpirited meaſures were taken for completing the Continental battalions, and raiſing a body of militia to be in readineſs to march when called for.</p>
            <p>The General Aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts, in their ſeſſion at this time, paſſed reſolutions for ſettling with the troops of their line to the laſt of the year 1780, making good the depreciation of their pay, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—Intelligence was received, that the Britiſh had formed a junction of their principal force at
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:033865_0290_0FF8D8E1C4CF0C70"/>the ſouthward in Virginia, by which means Gen. Greene would deprive them of all their poſts in South-Carolina; that on the 10th of May, Lord Rawdon was compelled to evacuate Cambden with precipitation, leaving behind him 3 of his officers and 58 privates, who had been dangerouſly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were unable to be removed. He burnt part of the town, and ſome of his baggage. On the 11th of the ſame month, the ſtrong poſt of Orangeburgh ſurrendered to Gen. Sumpter; a Colonel, ſeveral officers, and upwards of 80 men were made priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. On the 12th, the garriſon of Fort Mott, conſiſting of 7 officers, 12 non-commiſſioned officers, and 165 privates, ſurrendered by capitulation to Gen. Marrion. On the 15th, Font Granby capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to Lieut. Col. Lee; 1 Lieut. Colonel, 2 Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors, 6 Captains, 6 Lieutenants, 3 Enſigns, 1 Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, 2 Serjeant-Majors, 17 Serjeants, 9 Corporals, and 305 privates ſurrendered; large quantities of proviſions, and ſome military ſtores were taken at ſome of the poſts. At the ſame time, the poſts of Auguſta and Ninety-Six were inveſted by Gen. Pickens, and Gen. Greene on the 16th had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to march the army to expedite their reduction.</p>
            <p>23d.—Intelligence was received, that ſome time before, the barracks in Fort Schuyler had taken fire, and were burnt down; and that afterwards the fort was diſmantled and evacuated. The ſame day it was reported, that the Spaniards had taken Penſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola from the Britiſh. The marine mortars, and a number of heavy iron cannon, 18 and 24 pounders, were removing from Boſton to the North River, New-York. The Britiſh forces in Virginia, after their junction, were ſaid to be about 6,000. The invalids, who had been doing duty in Boſton, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed orders to march to Weſt Point, where the whole
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:033865_0291_0FF96BB8D2827AC8"/>corps was to be collected, and compoſe a part of the garriſon of that poſt.</p>
            <p>28th.—His Excellency the Commander in Chief was pleaſed to communicate to our General, that in the arrangement of the main army, the command of the right wing had been aſſigned to him.</p>
            <p>29th.—A veſſel arrived at Boſton from Cadiz, with a quantity of cloathing for the United States. This veſſel brought an account, that the Britiſh had again ſuccoured the garriſon of Gibraltar, but that the Spaniards Continued the ſiege.</p>
            <p>30th.—His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's frigate, the Servilante, arrived in Boſton harbour from the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indies; on her paſſage had a warm engagement with a Britiſh ſhip-of-war, when ſome damage was ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides. This frigate brought news, that the French had taken the iſland of Tobago, and had blocked up Admiral Rodney's fleet at Barbadoes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 4th was celebrated at Boſton, being the Anniverſary of the Declaration of American Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.</p>
            <p>6th.—Information was received, that Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington had ordered the American troops from their ſeveral cantonments, and that the whole had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and were encamped near Peek's Kill.</p>
            <p>Some of the enemy's cruizers from Penobſcot were cruizing in the Bay, where they took ſeveral veſſels; one within a league of the light-houſe.</p>
            <p>11th.—Intelligence was received, that there had been a ſkirmiſh between the Americans and Britiſh, between White Plains and King's Bridge, but no particulars were received.</p>
            <p>12th.—Our General ſet out from his houſe in Roxbury for the army.</p>
            <p>19th.—The enemy's ſhipping, which were up the North River, ran down; there was a briſk cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade at Dobb's Ferry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="unknown:033865_0292_0FF96CDA42953970"/>
21ſt.—The American field artillery, which had for ſome days been on board veſſels in the North River, proceeded downwards to the neareſt landing to the army.</p>
            <p>When the enemy's ſhipping paſſed Dobb's Ferry, on the 19th, a box of powder on board the Savage ſhip-of-war took fire, ſuppoſed by the burſting of a howitzer ſhell, on which a number of the crew, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that the ſhip would blow up, jumped overboard into the river. An American, who was a priſoner on board, jumped overboard at the ſame time, and ſwam on ſhore, relating what had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he alſo reported, that the Savage was ſeveral times hulled by our ſhot, and muſt have ſuffered conſiderable loſs. The late ſkirmiſh near King's Bridge was occaſioned by the American army's moving down, in order to give the French oſſicers a view of the Britiſh out-poſts near the bridge. A nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nber of Americans were killed and wounded by lone ſhot from the yaugers of the enemy, who kept up a popping fire whenever they could reach our troops.</p>
            <p>27th.—Our General arrived at the army, which was encamped at Phillipſburgh, in two lines; the park of artillery in the centre of the ſecond line. Accounts had been received from the ſouthward, that the enemy had no footing in Georgia, except Savannah, nor in South-Carolina, except Charleſton. The poſition which the American army now occupied was between the lines the preceding campaings; conſequently the roads and commons, as well as the fields and paſtures, were covered with graſs; while the many deſerted houſes and ruined fences depicted the horrid devaſtations of war. The French army, under Gen. Rochambeau, was encamped at a ſmall diſtance, on the left of the Americans, in one ſino.</p>
            <p>29th.—A forage was made towards Phillips's,
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:033865_0293_0FF8D890E97D3740"/>conducted by Col. Scammel. It was ſaid that ſome of the Britiſh troops had returned from the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to New-York; and that thoſe in Virginia were collected at Portſmouth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt.</hi>—On the night of the 3d, about 11 o'clock, the Britiſh and American guard-boats met in the river, near Dobb's Ferry, when a conſiderable firing enſued; we had one man badly wounded, who died ſoon after. The damage ſuſtained by the enemy was not known.</p>
            <p>6th.—The Commander in Chief, attended by a number of the General Officers, reconnoitred towards King's Bridge, covered by ſtrong detachments of cavalry and infantry. Three ſhips and a galley lay in the river between Fort Waſhington and Spitten-Devil Creek. The enemy did not make any move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The morning of the 7th, about 2 o'clock, the army was awakened by the firing of cannon at Dobb's Ferry; it appeared that 2 of the enemy's gun-boats had come up as high as the ferry, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to endeavour to ſeize ſome veſſels or boats; on finding that they were diſcovered, they fired four cannon, but to no effect. Four cannon were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged at the boats from the battery, on which they went down the river. Two days before, Delancy's corps ventured as far above King's Bridge, as Phillips's.</p>
            <p>News was received, that the great French Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier, <hi>Nechar,</hi> had reſigned, and that Monſieur Fleury had been appointed in his room.</p>
            <p>Capt. Saltonſtall, formerly of the frigate Warren, who was diſmiſſed the ſervice on account of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the Penobſcot expedition, about this time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved moſt gallantly in a privateer, on a cruize againſt the enemy.</p>
            <p>The American army at this time continued in the ſame poſition at Phillipſburgh. The Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:033865_0294_0FF96CE569C37B88"/>and Rhode-Iſland lines, and 6 regiments of the Maſſachuſetts line, compoſed the front line; the New-Hampſhire line, four regiments of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, Crane's and Lamb's regiments of artillery, with the ſappers and miners, the ſecond line; the right wing commanded by Maj. Gen. Heath, the left wing by Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling; the advance of the American army on a height a little advanced of Dobb's Ferry, under the command of Col. Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, and Sheldon's dragoons near Dobb's Ferry. The French army in one line on the left of the Americans, with their legion under the Duke de Lauzun, at White Plains. Gen. Waterbury, with the militia under his command, towards New. Rochelle. The camps at this time ſwarmed with ſlies, which were very troubleſome.</p>
            <p>11th.—Robert Morris, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the American Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier, and Richard Peters, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the Members of the Board of War, viſited the army. The ſame day, the advance of the army took a poſition a little more to the northward, and the dragoons were add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Col. Scammel's command. A fleet arrived as New-York from England; they brought over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 2 and 3,000 Heſſian recruits.</p>
            <p>14th.—Col. Hazen's and Col. Vanſcaak's reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iments joined the army. A French frigate arrived about this time at Rhode-Iſland, ſuppoſed to have brought news of the approach of the Count de Graſſe. A few nights before, Gen. Schuyler came very near being taken and carried off from his houſe in Albany.</p>
            <p>In the general orders of the 15th, the army was directed to hold itſelf in the moſt perfect readineſs to march on the ſhorteſt notice.</p>
            <p>16th.—It was whiſpered, that the Count de Graſſe, with 28 fail of the line, beſides frigates, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of land forces on board, might ſoon be expected
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:033865_0295_0FF96BCE6F945BE0"/>on our coaſt, and theſe, with the ſquadron under the command of the Chevalier de Barras, would make a ſleet of 36 ſail of the line, a force probably ſuperior to any the Britiſh could aſſemble in theſe ſeas.</p>
            <p>Under proſpects ſo flattering, the Commander in Chief determined to ſtrike the enemy a capital blow in ſome quarter. To ſtrike at their very root in New-York, was a moſt deſirable object; but the ſituation of New-York with Long-Iſland, and Staten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iſland, and the adjacent country, was ſuch, as would require a very large army to effect a complete inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titure, and give a proper ſecurity againſt the ſallies of the enemy, which, from ſituation, might be eaſily and frequently made—that ſuch an army muſt be compoſed, in a very conſiderable degree, of militia, to whom the continuing long in camp had often been found difagreeable; and the French were not without apprehenſions that if their fleet entered the harbour of New-York, and became warmly engaged with the Britiſh ſhips and batteries, in the courſe of thoſe manoeuvres which it might be neceſſary to make, ſome of their heavy ſhips, through the want of a competent knowledge of all parts of the bay, might get aground, or be damaged; while all theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences would be avoided, in caſe Lord Cornwallis, with the Britiſh army in Virginia, were made the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and his capture would be almoſt certain, while the American main army might be left in ſufficient ſtrength, to act on the defenſive againſt-Sir Henry Clinton, and effectually cover the important poſts in the Highlands of New-York.</p>
            <p>17th.—General Waſhington was pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to our General, (in confidence) his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at the ſame time intimating to him, that he ſhould give him the command of the main army during his abſence. The whole of the French army, with the two regiments of New-Jerſey, firſt regiment
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:033865_0296_0FF96CF997336C30"/>of New-York, Col. Hazen's regiment, Col. Olney's regiment of Rhode-Iſland, Col. Lamb's regiment of artillery, and the light troops under the command of Col. Scammel, were detached for the expedition againſt Lord Cornwallis, and the army under his command, at York-Town, in Virginia.</p>
            <p>18th.—Some of the corps began to move towards the ferries. The next day, the Commander in Chief was pleaſed to honour our General with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <p>"The ſecurity of Weſt-Point, and the poſts in the Highlands, is to be conſidered as the firſt object of your attention; in order to effect this, you will make ſuch diſpoſitions, as in your judgment the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhall from time to time require, taking care to have as large a ſupply of ſalted proviſions as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, conſtantly on hand; to have the fortifications, works, and magazines repaired and perfected as far as may be; to have the garriſon at leaſt, in all caſes, kept up to its preſent ſtrength; to have the minutes, plans, and arrangements, for the defence and ſupport of this important poſt, perfectly underſtood and vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly executed in caſe of any attempt againſt it. Ample magazines of <hi>wood</hi> and <hi>forage</hi> are to be laid in, againſt the approaching winter; the former ſhould be cut on the margin of the river, and tranſported to the
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:033865_0297_0FF96BD459CDF118"/>garriſon by water; the latter ought to be collected from the country below the lines, in the greateſt quantities poſſible, and depoſited in ſuch places as you ſhall judge proper.</p>
                  <p>"The force now put under your orders, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, will be ſufficient for all the purpoſes above mentioned, as well as to yield a very conſiderable protection and cover to the country, without haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arding the ſafety of the poſts in the Highlands; this is to be eſteemed, as it reſpects the friendly inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and reſources of the country, an extremely intereſting object; but when compared with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of a ſecondary nature. The protection of the northern and weſtern frontier of the State of New-York, as well as thoſe parts of that and other States moſt contiguous and expoſed to the ravages and depredations of the enemy, will claim your attention; but as the contingencies which are to be expected in the courſe of this campaign, may be ſo various, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen, and almoſt infinite, that no particular line of conduct can be preſcribed for them—upon all ſuch occaſions, you will be governed by your own prudence and diſcretion, on which the fulleſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is placed.</p>

            <p>19th.—About noon, his Excellency Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington left the army, ſetting his face towards his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive State, in full confidence, to uſe his own words, <hi>"with a common bleſſing,"</hi> of capturing Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis and his army; while our General was left to watch Sir Henry Clinton, and guard againſt thoſe attempts which it was probable he would make to ſuccour Cornwallis, direct, or by making ſuch other movements as might tend to induce Gen. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton to give up his object, or to avail himſelf of ſome important poſts in his abſence. Sir Henry Clinton was conſequently on the rack, to deviſe ſomething
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:033865_0300_0FF970F8A78C2158"/>which ſhould effect this purpoſe; a ſtroke at the poſts in the Highlands, Connecticut, New-Jerſey, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany and Philadelphia, was contemplated. Againſt all this had our General to guard.—Let impartiality judge, and candour decide on his conduct.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the ſame day, the French ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marched from their encampment towards King's Ferry, where they were to croſs the river. The American park of artillery, Col. Olney's regiment, and the New-York regiment, decamped and moved the ſame way.</p>
            <p>20th.—A little after noon, our General ordered off the baggage to the ſtrong grounds near Young's, which at about 6 o'clock was followed by the army, marching by the left in one column, which took a ſtrong poſition during the night. The pickets af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter duſk were drawn back a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. The advanced parties under Maj. Scott were orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed to join their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive regiments, and Sheldon's horſe to patrole in the front.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—Col. Putnam, with 320 infantry, Col. Sheldon's horſe, and two companies of the New-York levies, were ordered to form an advance for the army, and remain at or near their preſent ground. About 12 o'clock at noon, the army took up its line of march, and halted at night on the lower parts of North-Caſtle. Two regiments had been detached on the march to Sing-Sing church, to cover a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of baggage belonging to the French army, aſſiſt in removing it, &amp;c. and a detachment was ſent to the New Bridge, to ſecure a quantity of flour lodged near that place.</p>
            <p>22d.—The army marched from North-Caſtle, and encamped at Crom-Pond; all the French ſtores at Tarrytown and Sing-Sing had been ſecured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="unknown:033865_0301_0FF9729D4E186218"/>
23d.—The army marched from Crom-Pond, and took a ſtrong poſition at Peek's Kill; the firſt line encamping before the village, and the ſecond behind it. After the troops were encamped, 80 waggons were ſent off to aſſiſt in forwarding the ſtores of the army with Gen. Waſhington. Intelligence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that a frigate and ſtore-ſhip had arrived at Boſton, from France, with military ſtores, &amp;c. for the United States.</p>
            <p>24th.—The French troops had not all paſſed the Ferry—150 Americans were ſent to aid them, and at evening 150 more. Intelligence was received that a large French ſleet had been ſeen ſtanding for the continent.</p>
            <p>26th.—The whole of the French army had croſſed the river. Gen. Waſhington was as far as Rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paugh in the forenoon. Six deſerters came in from the enemy, and three priſoners of war belonging to Delancy's corps, were ſent up; they had taken and were driving off about 30 ſheep, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>27th.—Diſpatches were ſent off to Gov. Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull at Hartford, and Gov. Hancock at Boſton. A heavy cannonade was heard towards New-York, from early in the morning till two in the afternoon, ſuppoſed to be off at ſea.</p>
            <p>30th.—At evening a detachment conſiſting of 250 men, marched to wards the New Bridge, where wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons were collecting for a grand forage, which was to be covered by this detachment and the troops on the lines—the whole under the command of Col. Greaton. By the laſt accounts, Gen. Waſhington was as far as Chatham, in the Jerſies.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—Colonel Laurens paſſed the army, on his way from Boſton to Philadelphia: he had brought from France a large ſum in ſpecie, for the United States. Col. Laurens reported the friendly diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:033865_0302_0FF8D9D070126D50"/>of the European powers towards the United States, that Great-Britain continued to ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fingle ally, nor could ſhe obtain one in the war in which ſhe was engaged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> 1ſt.—The foragers returned with 42 loads of hay. A Heſſian rifleman came in with his rifle.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, letters were received from Gen. Waſhington, dated at Trenton, the 29th ult. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning that a Britiſh fleet of 15 ſail of the line had arrived at Sandy-Hook from the Weſt-Indies. The ſame evening, about 40 Indians, from the Oneida and other neighbouring tribes, came to the army, on their way after Generals Waſhington and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambeau.</p>
            <p>2d.—Intelligence was received from New-York, that a fleet, under the command of Admiral Sir Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel Hood, had arrived at Sandy-Hook from the Weſt-Indies, conſiſting of 14 ſail of the line, three 44 gun ſhips, one of 28, a ſloop and fire-ſhip. The ſhips of the line were, Barfleur, of 90 guns, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſa, Invincible, Alcide, Alfred, Aj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>x, Reſolution, Centaur, Intrepid, Terrible, Montague, Shrewſbury, Belliqueax, and—, 74 guns each. It was ſaid that the 1ſt battalion of Royal, 13th and 69th Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh regiments came in the fleet.</p>
            <p>3d.—Intelligence was received, that Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was at Philadelphia the preceding Friday, and that his army was to march from Trenton, as yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday.</p>
            <p>4th.—Intelligence was received from New-York, that the Britiſh fleet had ſailed to counteract the French. The day before, the ſouthern poſt-rider, with the mail, was ſtopped near Pompton in the Jerſies, and the mail carried off; the horſe was left in the road. The ſame day, a fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of 26 ſail, ſome
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:033865_0303_0FF972A7D711C6E8"/>of which were large, paſſed Stamford to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>6th.—Intelligence was received from New-York, that an embargo was laid on the ſhipping there, and that 6 Britiſh tranſports had been taken by the French. The enemy's ſhipping in the North River above Fort Waſhington, had all gone down.</p>
            <p>7th.—Intelligence was received from New-York, that the Count de Graſſe had arrived in the Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apeak on the 31ſt ultimo; that a 64 gun ſhip and a frigate had entered York River; that Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis was preparing for a vigorous defence; and that 6 ſail of victuallers had been taken by Admiral Barras. A heavy cannonade was heard the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, towards the Hook. The ſame day, there was much paſſing between the city and Fort Waſhington, which occaſioned a great riſing of duſt, viſible at a great diſtance; and there was a rumbling of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in the night. Mr. Rivington, in his paper, obſerved the preſent to be the moſt intereſting and critical era of the war. The ſame evening, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment marched from our army for a grand forage.</p>
            <p>8th.—Two companies of Col. Weiſſenfel's reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iment were ordered to Albany, to cover that city againſt the deſigns of the enemy. The ſame even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our General received a letter from Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, dated at the Head of Elk the preceding day, in which he obſerves, "I have it now in my power to congratulate you on the arrival of Count de Grafſe, with 28 ſhips of the line and ſome frigates, in the Cheſapeak, with a body of land forces on board, which he debarked immediately on his arrival. On his paſſage, he took Lord Rawdon, who was bound from Charleſton to England. This arrival, with Col. Laurens, from France, muſt fill the United States with the moſt happy proſpects and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions."
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:033865_0304_0FF9711595F19978"/>—"I am thus far on my way to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, with the troops under my command; we are now embarking the heavy baggage, ſtores, and ſome of the troops."—"I muſt beg of you not to forget ſending the quantity of beef I requeſted, as I muſt at preſent altogether depend on that ſupply."</p>
            <p>The ſame day, intelligence was received, that the enemy's fleet, which ſailed up the Sound on the 4th, had made a deſcent on New-London. At evening, Maj. Talmadge, with 20 cavalry and 200 infantry, was ordered to move immediately towards the Sound. The preceding day, about 30 ſail of the enemy's veſſels paſſed the Sound towards New-York.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 9th the foragers returned, with 28 loads of hay.</p>
            <p>10th.—Intelligence was received from Governor Trumbull, that the enemy had made a deſcent on New-London, on the evening of the 6th, with about 2,000 infantry and 300 light-horſe. Their fleet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of about 40 ſail of ſhips-of-war and tranſports, they plundered the inhabitants of property to a large amount, and burnt a great part of the town. The militia behaved very gallantly, and a number of very valuable citizens were killed; among others, Gol. Ledyard, Captains Saltonſtall and Richards. The enemy, in three aſſaults on the fort on Groton ſide of the river, were repulſed, but on the fourth attempt carried it. The militia collecting in greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, with ſome pieces of artillery, the enemy retreated on board their ſhipping. Part of the American ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the harbour were ſcuttled, and ſome were run up the river. In Governor Trumbull's letter, the enemy were charged with behaving in a wanton and barbarous manner; and that of between 70 and 80 men who were killed, 3 only were killed before the enemy entered the Fort, and the garriſon had ſubmitted; that on Col. Ledyard's delivering his
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:033865_0305_0FF972BDRFC98540"/>ſword reverſed, to the commanding officer, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the fort, the officer immediately plunged it in the Colonel's body, on which ſeveral ſoldiers bayon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted him. It is alſo aſſerted, that upon the foregoing taking place, and American officer, who ſtood near to Col. Ledyard, inſtantly ſtabbed the Britiſh officer who ſtabbed the Colonel; on which, the Britiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately bayoneted a great number of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</p>
            <p>This expedition was commanded by Arnold. The Britiſh loſs was very conſiderable in killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; among the former was Major Montgomery. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold himſelf continued on the New-London ſide, and while his troops were plundering and burning, was ſaid to have been at a houſe where he was treated very politely; that while he was ſitting with the gentleman regaling himſelf, the latter obſerved, that he hoped his houſe and property would be ſafe; he was anſwered, that while he (Arnold) was there, it would not be touched; but the houſe, except the room in which they were, was ſoon plundered, and found to be on fire. During the plunder of the town, the Britiſh (as is always the caſe in a plunder) were in great confuſion, ſetting their arms againſt trees and fences, while they were collecting and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying off their plunder; in this ſituation they might have been eaſily defeated; nor would it have been the firſt time that an army in poſſeſſion of victory, loſt it in this way; hence by the articles of war, "If any officer or ſoldier ſhall leave his poſt or colours, to go in ſearch of plunder, he is liable to ſuffer death for the offence."</p>
            <p>It is not meant to exculpate or to aggravate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the enemy on this occaſion—but two things are to be remembered; firſt, that in almoſt all caſes the ſlaughter does but begin when the vanquiſhed give way; and it has been ſaid, that if this was fully
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:033865_0306_0FF9712645537EB0"/>conſidered, troops would never turn their backs, if it were poſſible to face their enemy: Secondly, in all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks by aſſault, the aſſailants, between the feelings of danger on the one hand, and reſolution to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it on the other, have their minds worked up almoſt to a point of fury and madneſs, which thoſe who are aſſailed, from a confidence in their works, do not feel; and that conſequently when a place is carried, and the aſſailed ſubmit, the aſſailants cannot inſtantaneouſly curb their fury to reaſon, and in this interval, many are ſlain in a way which a cool by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtander would call wanton and barbarous, and even the perpetrators themſelves, when their rage ſubſided, would condemn; but while the human paſſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as they now are, there is ſcarcely a remedy.</p>
            <p>11th.—Amold's fleet was ſtill in the Sound, and further depredations were expected; they were this morning at Killingſworth, and about noon 50 ſail of veſſels came to anchor between Norwalk and Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. Major Talmadge, who was returning, upon ſuppoſition that the enemy had returned to New-York, was ordered back immediately. Maj. Knapp was detached with 100 men to reinforce Col. Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam on the lines; and Brig. Gen. Huntington, with the firſt Connecticut brigade, and a detachment of artillery was ordered to march towards the Sound. The ſame day, the army moved from its encampment at Peek's-Kill, and took a very ſtrong poſition on Bald Hill, where it encamped in one line, the ſecond line forming in the centre of the firſt, and the 8th Maſſachuſetts regiment was ordered to march from the army, and reinforce the garriſon of Weſt-Point.</p>
            <p>13th.—Intelligence was received, that on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's anchoring off Stamford, Maj. Talmadge advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own; Gen. Huntington had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as far as Bedford; and that the preceding morning the enemy's fleet came to ſail, and ſtood
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:033865_0307_0FF972CC14E6B928"/>principally to the weſward; ſome of the fleet, at the ſame time, ſtanding over to Huntington Bay, Long-Iſſand, Maj. Talmadge was to remain at or near Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, for the protection of the inhabitants; Gen. Huntington to return to the army.</p>
            <p>The Heſſian recruits, which had a little before ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at New-York, were very ſickly, and many died. The fleet which had arrived at New-York were in bad condition. The Prudente and Robuſte, lay at the ſhip-yard; the Roebuck had been ſent to Halifax to repair, and had not returned. Mr. Rivington, in his paper, talked of another fleet coming out, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Admiral Digby.</p>
            <p>15th.—The enemy had ſtill a number of troops on board their tranſports in the harbour. The ſame day, intelligence was received from Canada, that the enemy were preparing a number of canoes and ſmall batteaux at St. John's, baking hard bread at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, and forwarding it to St. John's, &amp;c. The Cork fleet had arrived at Quebec. The ſame day, about 40 ſail of the enemy's veſſels paſſed in the Sound to the eaſtward.</p>
            <p>17th.—Intelligence was received, that a brigade of troops had lately come to St. John's, from whence an incurſion on our northern frontier might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; on which the whole of Wieſſenfel's regiment was ordered for Albany immediately; notice was alſo given to the eaſtern Governors, and the Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers commanding the militia in the countics of Hampſhire and Berkſhire, in Maſſachuſtetts, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lend their aid, if it ſhould be found neceſſary.</p>
            <p>18th.—A deſerter came, in from New-York; he reported, that when he left the city, about 20 ſail of veſſels were falling down to the Hook, ſaid to have troops on board.</p>
            <p>19th.—The 2d and 5th Maſſachuſetts regiments were ordered to go into garriſon at Weſt-Point, and
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:033865_0308_0FF9713360E9DF70"/>the 7th regiment to join the army; it had before been in garriſon. The ſame day, intelligence was received from New-York, that there had been a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val engagement off the Cheſapeak, between 19 ſail of Britiſh men-of-war, and 24 French ſhips of the line: the ſtory was ſo badly told in New-York, that there was good grounds to conclude that the Britiſh had received a ſevere drubbing. On the 17th, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>acket arrived at New-York, 3,000 people were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>lles of fortune. The enemy had taken a number of heavy cannon from the grand battery, which were put on board ſhip. The troops ſtill remained on board the tranſports, and had fallen down to the Hook. A mortal ſickneſs prevailed in Delancy's corps, at Morriſſania which was much reduced in its numbers.</p>
            <p>22d.—Intelligence was received, that the Britiſh fleet had been pretty ſeverely handled by the French, and ſome of the ſhips were conſiderably damaged: that the inhabitants were in great conſternation in New-York; many were packing up their goods: that Arnold's loſs at New London, in both killed and wounded, was very conſiderable: that the 38th, 47th and 50th regiments were on that expedition, and then conſidered as unfit for duty. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton was ſaid to be embarked with the troops, report ſaid from 7 to 8 thouſand; among them the Britiſh and Heſſian grenadiers, light-infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, 42d regiment, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>24th.—A grand forage was made below the lines. The Britiſh fleet returned to the Hook on the 20th. The Prudente of 64 guns, had gone down in a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable condition to join the fleet; and the Robuſte of 74 guns, had hauled down nearly oppoſite to the
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:033865_0309_0FF972E2C92C6B50"/>city. The heavy cannon had been taken from Fort Waſhington, as well as the grand battery.</p>
            <p>25th.—Forty-ſix loads of forage were brought off from below the lines. Mr. Rivington publiſhed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other account of the naval engagement between the fleets on the 15th; he acknowledged that ſeveral ſhips were much damaged, and that two which had come from the Weſt-Indies leaky, were more ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the engagement: that in particular, the Terrible was ſo much damaged, as occaſioned the taking out her guns, &amp;c. and ſetting her on fire; after which the fleet returned to the Hook, finding it impracticable to ſuccour Lord Cornwallis. It was ſaid that the troops which had embarked, (about 6,000) had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked on Staten Iſland. Other accounts ſtated their number not more than 4,000—they were impreſſing and collecting waggons.</p>
            <p>27th.—Three deſerters came in from Col. Wurmb's corps, with their arms, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>28th.—Apprehending that the enemy might have intentions of croſſing over from Staten Iſland to the Jerſies, a detachment of 300 infantry, with light ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, under the command of Col. Swift, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to croſs the ferry the next morning, and move as far as Ramapaugh, to be at hand to aid the militia, in caſe the enemy ſhould land in the Jerſies.</p>
            <p>29th.—Intelligence was received from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that a ſmall party had been ſent from St. John's to Saratoga, to take a priſoner or two, for the purpoſe of obtaining information; but that five of the party, with the inſtructions of the Britiſh commandant at St. John's, were taken and brought in by Captain Dunham.</p>
            <p>30th.—Intelligence was received that Admiral Digby arrived at New-York the 25th inſt. with three ſail of the line, and one frigate. Prince William Henry, the King of England's third ſon, came in
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:033865_0310_0FF9713D6A42EC88"/>this fleet. It was ſaid in New-York, that Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis's force in Virginia conſiſted of 5,000 regular troops, and 3,000 levies; but that behind him was a numerous continental army—before him a powerful French fleet. The troops on Staten Iſland were at this time ſuſpected to be planning ſome ſecret ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; and Congreſs, from ſome intelligence which they had received, were not without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions that Philadelphia might be their object. The militia of Pennſylvania were held in readineſs for inſtant ſervice; and our General was notified to hold the army in readineſs to move, if neceſſary. The enemy were carefully watched. Sir Henry Clinton was endeavouring to deviſe ſome means whereby he might relieve Lord Cornwallis; but nothing would have diverted Gen. Waſhington from capturing him. The New-York papers were fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with addreſſes and adulations to their young Prince; but theſe could not retard the advances of a WASHINGTON, or deſend Cornwallis. The fleet of Count de Graſſe made ſeveral captures.</p>

            <p>6th.—The enemy were again embarking their troops from Staten Iſland; they embarked on board the men-of-war. Conſidering their caſe as deſperate, they were determined to make one deſperate attempt. Ten or twelve fire-ſhips were prepared to ſail with the fleets; they were filled with proper materials for the purpoſe, and, to prevent ſuſpicion, they were n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>8th.—A derachment was ſent on a grand forage. The ſame day, intelligence was received, that a party of refugees and Indians, from Niagara, had burnt a number of houſes and barns at Warworſing; they were purſued by Col. Paulding, but could not be come up with. Sir Henry Clinton, in his orders of the 3d, directed 3,000 regular troops to embark on board the men-of-war as marines; in was ſuppoſed that every thing would be ready by the 14th. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret intelligence had been received from Albany, that the enemy had intentions on that city; that they would advance by diſſerent routes, and on their near approach, would be joined by ſome diſaffected people in the country, and the deſtruction of the city be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Brig. Gen. Stark had been in commond for ſome time at the northward.</p>
            <p>10th.—Our General ordered the 2d New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire regiment, and a detachment of artillery, to the northward. Gen. Stark had executed a Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſent in by Capt. Dunham, as a ſpy.</p>

               <pb n="314" facs="unknown:033865_0312_0FF8D9E1DACCAFF0"/>
14th.—The 1ſt New-Hampſhire and 10th Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts regiments, with a detachment of artillery, were ordered to Albany, were matters wore a more ſerious aſpect.</p>
            <p>15th.—Intelligence was received, that on the 28th ult. Gen. Waſhington took a poſition in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of York—the enemy gave him no annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: on his advancing, a body of horſe paraded before the enemy's works; but retired upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a few ſhot at them.</p>
            <p>The 29th was ſpent in taking another poſition as near the enemy's advanced works, as could be done without placing the encampment in the range of their ſhot. Some ſkirmiſhing happened between our rifle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and the yaugers, in which the former had the advantage. At night, the enemy abandoned all their out-poſts, (ſome of which were very advantageous) and retired to the town; the Americans occupied the ſame ground, and made lodgements at a ſhort diſtance from the enemy's lines. The heavy artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery was to be brought up as ſoon as poſſible, and the ſiege puſhed with vigour.</p>
            <p>30th.—Col. Scammell, who was officer of the day, was wounded and taken priſoner by a party of the enemy's horſe, as he was reconnoitring one of the works which had juſt before been evacuated.</p>
            <p>Our General had ordered Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling to proceed to Albany, and take the command of the troops in that quarter; he ſet out for the northward about noon on the 16th. The ſame day, Col. Tup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with the 1ſt New-Hampſhire and 10th Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts regiments, and a detachment of artillery, embarked at Fiſhkill Landing, and arrived at Albany in 18 hours afterwards. The ſame day, it was learnt that the enemy's fleet at New-York, was 24 or 25 ſail of the line; and that 5 or 6,000 of the beſt troops at New-York had embarked, and were on the
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:033865_0313_0FF972FEF691AE48"/>point of ſailing to attempt to relieve Earl Cornwallis; it was alſo ſaid that Cornwallis was ſhort of bread, and that his meat proviſions would not laſt him more than the month out at fartheſt—he had received freſh proviſions but once after he was blockaded.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 17th, a horſe-guard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Gen. Howe's diviſion, conſiſting of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, 9 privates, and 8 waggoners, with 30 horſes, were taken by Delancy's hoiſe a little below Croten River, where the horſes had been put to paſture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to orders. A Court of Inquiry was ordered to inveſtigate the matter.</p>
            <p>18th.—It was learnt, that on the preceding Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, a Britiſh 74 gun ſhip was ſtruck by the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at New-York, and ſuſtained conſiderable dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
            <p>22d.—Gen. Greene's official letter to Congreſs, announced that his battle on the 8th, near Eutaw Springs, was well fought; that on the field he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the victory, drove and purſued the enemy for ſeveral miles; when the enemy, throwing themſelves into a three-ſtory brick houſe, a ſtockaded garden, and thick bruſh, renewed the action, when, after ſome efforts to diſlodge them, Gen. Greene thought it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to call off his troops, which was done, and the wounded brought off, except ſuch as were under the fire of the houſe. Four braſs ſix-pounders hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had their horſes killed, were alſo leſt near the houſe, in poſſeſſion of the enemy. This was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſimilar to what took place at Germantown battle, and now very probably ſaved the Britiſh, from a total defeat. The cloſe of this action barred its being called a complete victory, although its <hi>effects</hi> proved it ſuch. General Greene, of Continental State troops and militia, had one Licutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, 1 Major, 6 Captains, 8 Subalterns, 8 Serjeante, and 114 rank and ſile killed—5 Lieutenant Colonels,
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:033865_0314_0FF971622E630FA0"/>13 Captains, 25 Subalterns, 32 Serjeants, and 300 rank and file wounded—1 Serjeant, and 40 rank and file miſting—1 Brigadier-General of militia wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Of the enemy, 500 priſoners, including the wounded, which the enemy left behind them, were taken; and it was ſuppoſed that the killed and other wounded of the enemy, muſt be nearly 600 more. Perhaps troops never fought better than the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans did in this battle; and of the Britiſh, General Greene obſerved, "the enemy fought with equal ſpirit, and worthy of a better cauſe."</p>
            <p>By a letter from Gen. Waſhington, of the 6th, it appeared that the operations againſt Earl Cornwallis had then gone on but ſlowly, but that the trenches were to be opened that night. The ſame letter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that ſome miſunderſtanding, which had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in Vermont, was ſettled; and that Gen. Enos, and the troops under his command, were to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the orders of our General.</p>
            <p>The army in the Highlands were at this time ſhort of flour, occaſioned by the dry ſeaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent want of water for the mills.</p>

The 11th, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſhip was deſtroyed in the ſame manner. The ſame night, the ſecond parallel was advanced within leſs than 400 yards of the enemy's lines. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach was alſo effected without annoyance; and on the 12th, the fatigue men were ſecurely covered, while they were completing the works. The ſame evening there was a flying report, and which ſeemed to gain credit, that Earl Cornwallis, and his army, ſurrendered on the 17th; and that Count de Graſſe had gone out to meet Admiral Digby.</p>
            <p>25th.—Intelligence was received of the advance of the enemy at the northward.</p>
            <p>26th.—Col. Francis, with the ſpecie from Boſton, paſſed the river; the money was eſcorted by 40 horſe of Sheldon's regiment, and 150 infantry; and Lieut. Col. Mellen, was ordered with a detachment of infantry, to move on the lower road as far as Morriſtown, keeping between the eſcort and the enemy.</p>
            <p>28th.—In the afternoon, a letter from Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington to our General, announced the pleaſing and highly important news of the complete capture of Earl Cornwallis, and his whole army, on the 19th. Our General had aſſured the army, that the moment he received the certain intelligence of the capture of Cornwallis, it ſhould be announced to them by the diſcharge of 13 cannon, near his quarters; theſe were now the heralds to the army, and were inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered by a like number of field-pieces in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brigade on the ground.</p>
            <p>On the 15th, two of the enemy's redoubts were ſtormed, one by the Americans, and the other by the French troops, and ſoon carried, with but little loſs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Theſe were excluſive of ſailors, negroes, &amp;c. Earl Cornwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis was to go to England on parole, and remain a priſoner until exchanged. The officers and men were to be exchanged as far as the garriſon of Charleſton would extend; the remainder were to continue priſoners of war; the Britiſh were to retain their private baggage. It was ſaid that more than 100 veſſels were taken from the enemy. A detail of the priſoners taken, was ſtated as follows: one Lieut. General, one Brig. General, 2 Colonels, 14 Lieut. Colonels, 16 Majors, 97 Captains, 180 Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, 55 Enſigns, 4 Chaplains, 6 Adjutants, 18 Quarter-Maſters, 18 Surgeons, 25 Mates, 385 Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, 197 Drummers and Trumpeters, 6,039 rank and file, 189 in the Commiſſary's department—ſailors in the pay of the King, 840—killed during the ſiege, 309—deſerters, 44-75 braſs cannon, 169 iron do. 5,743 muſkets with bayonets, 915 muſkets without bayonets, and 1,136 damaged muſkets were among the trophies of victory. Thus was the principal force of the enemy cruſhed in the ſouth. At the northward, the enemy were advancing, both by the way of the Lakes and by the Mohawk River. Col. Willet, with his regiment of New-York levies, and ſome militia of New-York, and from the weſtern parts of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, were advancing to meet Maj. Roſs, who, with from 500 to 700 men, principally Britiſh troops, was making his way towards Albany, through the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Mohawk.</p>
            <p>29th.—Intelligence was received that an action took place the preceding Thurſday, near Johnſtown, between the troops under the command of Col. Willet and Maj. Roſs.</p>

               <pb n="319" facs="unknown:033865_0317_0FF9732197801530"/>
Col. Willet having advanced until he had arrived near Maj. Roſs, detached Maj. Rowley of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, with a body of militia, by a circuitous move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to get in the rear of the enemy, with orders, that as ſoon as he heard the ſiring in the front, to fall on them. Maj. Rowley performed his manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre accordingly; and as ſoon as Col. Willet judged that the Major had gained the rear of the enemy, he made a vigorous charge on their front, when they immediately gave way, and to all appearance the Colonel was nearly in the graſp of victory, when, all at once, without any viſible occaſion the levies came to a ſtand, and then immediately began to fall back, the enemy facing about and charging vigorouſly; the Colonel's braſs field-piece and ammunition tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brel fell into the hands of the enemy, and a rout ſeemed to be taking place, when Maj. Rowley, not knowing what had taken place in the front, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a briſk attack on the enemy's rear; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly threw them into confuſion; the levies rallied in the front, and fought with redoubled bravery; the field-piece and tumbrel were retaken, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my put to a moſt complete rout, and purſued until the levies, militia, and ſome Oncida Indians who were with Col. Willet, were worn down with fatigue. It was not poſſible to aſcertain the number of the enemy's ſlain; for, to uſe the words of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting officer, "Unleſs the ſwamps and rivers, in which they fell, were to report the killed, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make a return of them." Major Butler, ſo frequently a troubleſome partizan officer on the frontiers, was killed by the Indians, as he was paſſing a river.

            <p>31ſt.—The army in the Highlands, celebrated the glorious victory obtained over Lord Cornwallis. The whole army was under arms in one line; the
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:033865_0319_0FF9732684171A98"/>artillery interſperſed with the brigades to which it was attached: at 12 o'clock, the army was reviewed by the General; at one, a grand <hi>feu-de-joy</hi> was fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; after which, all the officers dined together, at a table ſpread in the field, and formed a great ſquare, where great feſtivity and ſocial mirth prevailed. The ſoldiery had an extra boon on the occaſion; and, to crown the whole, in the midſt of the joy around the table, an officer approached our General, and informed him, that, at the requeſt of the priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in the provoſt, (who were pretty numerous) he was deſired to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>eſent that their hearts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded with joy on account of the glorious victory obtained by their illuſtrious Commander in Chief— that they lamented they could not expreſs it with their comrades in arms; but that they did it heartily in their confinement, and ſolicited the General's goodneſs in an order for ſomething to cheer their ſpirits. This was inſtantly done, with an additional order to the officer of the provoſt guard, to ſet every priſoner in conſinement at liberty. The promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this order drew a ſhout of approbation from the whole body of the officers at the table; and probably had a better effect on the diſcipline of the army, than a continuation of conſinement, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary puniſhment of the culprits, could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The general order of the day directed, that, "As ſoon as the <hi>feu-de-joy</hi> is over, the arms, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, &amp;c. are immediately to be put in perfect order for inſtant action. All guards, pickets, and centinels to be vigilant and alert on their poſts;" which, notwithſtanding the joy of the day, was ſtrictly obſerved.</p>
            <p>On this occaſion there were rejoicings in all parts of the United States: one inſtance ſeems to be worthy of notice; the company collected had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to burn Gen. Arnold in <hi>effigy,</hi> for his treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:033865_0320_0FF9719C304FEF68"/>at Weſt-Point; juſt as they were going to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the effigy to the ſlames, one of the company ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that one of Arnold's legs was wounded when he was fighting bravely for America, that this leg ought not to be burnt, but amputated; in which the whole company agreed; and this leg was taken off, and ſafely laid by.</p>

               <hi>November</hi> 3d.—At night, the eſcort with the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern mail, who had put up at Col. Cooper's, in Clark's Town, were attacked by a gang of villains, who fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the houſe, and killed the Serjeant dead on the ſpot, and wounded Capt. Champion, of Connecticut, who had put up at the ſame houſe, in the ſhoulder: the Corporal of the eſcort behaved well, threw the mail behind a bed, and defended the houſe—the aſſailants made off.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, the foragers returned from below the lines, with a large quantity of forage, and two priſoners, taken near Col. Phillips's.</p>

The Britiſh at New-York, at this time, wiſhed to ſtrike ſome of the poſts in the Highlands,
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:033865_0321_0FF9732F54616070"/>but did not attempt any of them. The army was ſhort of flour, but amply ſupplied with meat.</p>
            <p>About this time, our General received a letter from Gen. Waſhington, dated at York, (Virginia) October 27th, 1781; in which, among other things, the Commander in Chief obſerves: "There will be no occaſion for forwarding on any more beef cattle, from the northward, for this army. Should there be a greater quantity of cattle ſent from the New-England States, than the daily conſumption of your army ſhall require, I would wiſh the ſurplus might be ſalted (if practicable) at ſome convenient place on the North River; otherwiſe, it will be neceſſary for you to give orders to the Agents and Commiſſaries, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ſending more cattle than you ſhall have occaſion for." This was the good fruit of the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematic arrangement.</p>

            <p>20th.—Col. Tupper, with the 10th Maſſachuſetts regiment, a detachment of artillery, &amp;c. arrived at Weſt-Point, from Albany.</p>

The enemy afterwards attacked Lieut. Moſher, to whom the command of the detachment fell; Licut. Moſher and the detachment behaved with great bravery, repulſed the enemy, killed one of them and two horſes, and wounded eight of the enemy; among them a Capt. Kipp, ſaid mortally; Colonel Holmes and Capt. Kipp had their horſes killed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. The levies had not a man killed or wounded.</p>
            <p>The army were now buſily employed in building their huts, which they proſecuted with great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:033865_0323_0FF97341F9C6BDB0"/>and ſoon rendered them comfortable as to ſhelter; but many of the troops were in a moſt nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſtreſſed condition as to clothing; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was daily arriving from the eaſtward.</p>
            <p>8th.—The officers and ſoldiers, who had been in Virginia, were now returning to the army. Some of the ſoldiers brought the ſmall-pox with them.</p>

            <p>24th.—The Clothier-General was iſſuing the new clothing to the regimental Pay-Maſters—a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary piece of buſineſs.

The preceding day, viz. the 23d, Capt.

Capt. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams conducted this enterprize with addicts and gallantry. Capt.

Greene and the Britiſh, in that quarter—for the Count de Graſſe's having viſited our coaſt with the moſt formidable fleet ever before in theſe ſeas—and for general ſucceſſes on the American arms, under the ſmiles of Divine Providence, in every quarter. May the new year be rendered more auſpicious in the completion of the American warfare, and in the eſtabliſhment of the United States in the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of independence, peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>

The ſixth dragoon would not come off, on which the others took from him his horſe, cloak, ſword, &amp;c.

31ſt.—The whole of the troops who had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had the ſmall-pox, were then under the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inoculation—their number near 2,000; ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral had died, but in general it was very favourable.</p>

            <p>20th.—Two deſerters came in from Arnold's corps, and alſo two Heſſians; ten had come in, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the courſe of two or three days.</p>

The enemy again appeared in ſome force at a diſtance, but dared not to renew the attack. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time, a fleet of tranſports ſailed from New-York to the ſouthward; it was conjectured to bring away troops.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 3d.—The river was ſo freed of ice, that the General's barge croſſed to Weſt-Point. Two priſoners of war taken from Delancy's corps, were ſent up.

The enemy were completely ſurpriſed, and fled in every directions; ſome were cut down on the ſpot, others ſo badly wounded as not to be able to be removed. Some of the enemy availed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of poſitions where the horſe could not aſſail them, from whence they began to ſire on the horſe;
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:033865_0328_0FF971E2DEED86B8"/>this occaſioned the firing of the alarm guns at No. 8. The horſe having nearly accompliſhed their deſign, moved off, taking the Eaſt-Cheſter road, on which Maj. Woodbridge had poſted the inſantry in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade. Capt. Hunnewell had brought off one Subaltern and 20 men priſoners, and 20 horſes. The enemy in the vicinity collected a number of horſe, backed by light-infantry, and purſued Capt. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newell until he came to Maj. Woodbridge. The enemy were drawn into the ambuſcade, who made one or two diſcharges on them, on which they broke and retired, but ſoon returned to the charge; ſkir miſhing enſued, and continued to a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Of the Americans, two privates were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed —Mr. Dyckman, one of the guides, a brave and active man, mortally wounded, and three privates flightly wounded.</p>

               </gap>s. The ſame number were to be furniſhed daily. Theſe preparations were a defenſive ſhield for the time of approaching negociation; for from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and ſpeeches in the Britiſh Parliament, the olive-branch was evidently putting forth its buds.</p>
            <p>10th.—Two ſoldiers, belonging to the 6th Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts regiment, having ſome words reſpecting their meſs, one of them ſtruck the other with his fiſt a blow on the head, and killed him dead on the ſpot.

            <p>

When Sir James Lowther made a motion, that the mode which had been purſued was ineffectual, many Members ſpoke for and againſt the motion; when it was put, there was againſt the motion, 220; for it, 179; major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, 41.</p>
            <p>14th.—Lieut. Harris, with ſix men belonging to Capt.

            <p>26th.—About this time, putrid fevers were preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent among the American troops, and in ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces proved mortal. About this time, an embarkation of about 800 troops took place at New-York; their deſtination not publickly known.</p>
            <p>28th.—The whole army were ordered to be in readineſs for inſtant action, or to march to ſuch place or places, as might ſtand in need of aid. An additional company was ordered to the lines, and

News was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the citizens of London and Weſtminſter had petitioned the King, in the ſtrongeſt terms, to relinquiſh the American war.</p>
            <p>29th.—Five deſerters came in from Arnold's corps, with their arms, &amp;c. complete. The enemy were buſily employed on their canal and lines: a number of heavy cannon had been put on board ſhip, at New-York. About this time, the Britiſh cruiſers were but too ſucceſsful againſt the Americans, at ſea. A ſhip of 18 guns, had, for ſome time, taken a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion off Spitten-Devil Creek.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—His Excellency Gen. Waſhington arrived at Newburgh; he had been abſent from the main army ſince the 19th of the preceding Auguſt, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent the winter at Philadelphia, after the capture of Earl Cornwallis.</p>

Pray's men, from the water-guard, being on ſhore, on the eaſt ſide of the Hudſon, fell in with a party of our own militia, who, in the dark, attacked each other; four of the latter were wounded, and eleven (being the whole of the party) were taken priſoners, before the miſtake was diſcovered. An expreſs, on his way from St. John's to New-York, with ſeveral letters, one in characters, had been taken.</p>

            <p>6th.—The Commander in Chief viſited Weſt-Point, and reviewed the ſirſt Maſſachuſetts brigade. On his arrival at the Point, he was ſaluted by the diſcharge of 13 cannon.</p>
            <p>8th.—Four deſerters came in, three from the 42d Britiſh regiment, and a ſeaman from the ſhip Venger; this ſhip, ſtationed in the North River, mounted 24 guns, and had two gun-boats with her. The enemy continued at work on their canal and lines, which they were making very ſtrong. An incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of faſcines had been made, during the winter, on Long-Iſland and Staten-Iſland, ſtrongly bound with eight bands; theſe were placed in the face of the work, with five pickets in each faſcine.</p>
            <p>9th.—The Commander in Chief reviewed the 3d Maſſachuſetts brigade and 10th regiment, and dined with our General. The ſame day, two deſerters came in from the ſhip in the river. The ſame night, an armed brig, and three boats, full of men, came up the Hudſon, and came to anchor a little above the place where our guard-boats rendczvous, at Nyack; they were early diſcovered, and the alarm given. The ſoldiers landed at Haverſtraw, about one o'clock on the morning of the 10th, and took 3 or 4 militia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. It was ſuppoſed that their deſign was to have taken our whale-boats: they were reſugees and ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. Not knowing but this might have been a feint,
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:033865_0332_0FF97201A6319E50"/>to an attack on the lines, 200 men were detached for their ſupport, if neceffary. The enemy returned down the river, in the afternoon, having, in addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the militia, above mentioned, taken two of Capt. Pray's men, who were out, burning coal, and two others who were over at Tarrytown, fiſhing, and deſtroyed ſome ſeines. It was learnt, from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that the enemy were repairing and building boats at St. John's, and bringing up proviſions to that place; this rendered it probable, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would be troubleſome in that quarter, the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing campaign. Several parties of Indians had been ſkulking about, on the Mohawk River, had killed a ſoldier and a lad, and had taken a ſoldier priſoner, and burnt a building.</p>
            <p>14th.—Three deſerters came in from Robinſon's corps; they made their eſcape from Long-Iſland, by croſſing the Sound in a canoe. They reported, that the enemy were under great apprehenſions of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, and were making every preparation for defence; that 62,000 faſcines had been made on Long-Iſland, during the winter and ſpring. A fleet of tranſports had arrived at New-York, from Charleſton. Lines were traced out on Long-Iſland, from the great fort to the marſh, near M'Gowen's mill-dam.</p>
            <p>18th.—It was learnt, that the enemy had laid an embargo on the ſhipping at New-York. News was received, that Holland had formed an alliance with France, and that a Spaniſh fleet had arrived in the Weſt-Indies.</p>
            <p>19th.—The General Officers, and officers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding brigades and regiments, met at our Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al's quarters, in conſequence of orders from the Commander in Chief, to give an opinion what meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures ought to be adopted, in conſequence of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and brutal murder of a Capt. Huddy, who had commanded a block-houſe at Tom's River, in the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:033865_0333_0FF97391F17F3808"/>and had been taken priſoner by the enemy, and carried to New-York, where he was cloſely confined, under guard, and in the ſugar-houſe, and on board a veſſel, in irons, and then carried over to Bergen, in the Jerſies, and hanged by the refugees, a Capt. Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pincot directing the execution. This was done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence that Capt. Huddy had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the death of one Philip White, although White was killed by the guard, from whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make his eſcape, and Capt. Huddy was at the ſame time a priſoner with the enemy. Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was left hanging on a tree, with the following la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel faſtened on his breaſt: <hi>"Up goes Huddy for Philip White."</hi> This wanton and cruel act, ſo exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the inhabitants of New-Jerſey, that they drew up a petition, ſigned by a vaſt number of reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble citizens, claiming of Gen. Waſhington, as the Military Guardian of their country, the obtainment of juſtice for this horrid act, or <hi>retaliation</hi> in caſe juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was refuſed. Indeed, painful as the idea of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation muſt be to the feelings of humanity, it ſeemed now to be the only preventative of more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid murders. Gen. Waſhington, with his wonted prudence and talent for inveſtigation, free of all bias, ordered the officers to aſſemble as before mentioned, and directed our General to ſtate to them the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their being convened, and then the following queſtions: "Shall there be retaliation for the murder of Capt. Huddy? On whom ſhall it be inflicted? And how ſhall the victim be deſignated?" The offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers aſſembled were forbidden to converſe on the queſtions ſubmitted to them, each one was to write his own opinion, ſeal it up, and addreſs it to the Commander in Chief. By this mode of procedure, all the influence which ſome officers might have on others was prevented, and the ſpontaneous feelings of every individual officer collected. Col. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phries
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:033865_0334_0FF97214E1FFA0E8"/>and Col. Trumbull, of the General's family, attended the Council, and every direction of the Commander in Chief was moſt ſtrictly obſerved. It was found that the officers were unanimous in their opinion, that retaliation ought to take place; that it ſhould be inflicted on an officer of equal rank, viz. a Captain; not under convention or capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but one who had ſurrendered at diſcretion; and that in deſignating ſuch an one, it ſhould be done by lot. The Commander in Chief was pleaſed to approve of the opinion of the officers, and wrote to the Britiſh commander, demanding juſtice for the wanton murder of Capt. Huddy; informing the Britiſh General at the ſame time, that if juſtice was not obtained, retaliation would moſt aſſuredly take place. At the ſame time, arrangements were put in train for retaliation; the names of ſeveral Britiſh officers, of equal rank and circumſtances, were thrown together, and a fair and impartial lot was drawn, when young Capt. <hi>Aſgill</hi> was taken; he was of a noble family, his father was dead, and on him were the fond hopes of his mother, Lady A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gill, placed. Indeed a more affecting ſcene than this can ſcarcely open; an innocent young man, doomed to ſuffer for the wanton offence of another, which deed no doubt his ſoul deſpiſed; and the tender breaſt of a mother rent in twain on the fate of her darling ſon. Nor were the feelings of the Great WASHINGTON unmoved on this occaſion; they were too manifeſt not to be obſerved, and could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be curbed by the invariable reſolution, in every exigence, to exhibit the adminiſtrator of juſtice. It was months before this tragic buſineſs cloſed; and that the reader may have the whole narrative to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it will be carried forward to ſuch periods as will render a return back to the proper chain of events neceſſary.</p>

Gen. Sir Guy Carleton, who had come into the command in chief at New-York, wrote to Gen. Waſhington, aſſuring him of the fulleſt ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Sir Guy ordered a Court-Martial for the trial of Capt. Lippencot, who was charged with the murder of Capt. Huddy. The Court-Martial had ſet, and given in their proceedings to Gen. Carleton, who wrote a letter to Gen. Waſhington, requeſting a paſſport for Chief Juſtice Smith, to repair to the head-quarters of the American army, in order to lay before the Commander in Chief the proceedings of the Court-Martial, with other documents, which he (Sir Guy) had no doubt would give full ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Upon Gen. Waſhington's receiving the letter from Sir Guy Carleton, he informed our General that he ſhould not conſent to, or give a paſſport to Mr. Chief Juſtice Smith, to come up with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Court-Martial on Lippencot; but that he would ſend him (Gen. Heath) down to Col. Phillips's, near King's Bridge, to meet ſuch officer of equal rank, as Sir Guy Carleton might think proper to ſend out to meet him, with the proceedings of the Court-Martial, &amp; and on the 30th of July the Commander in Chief wrote to our General as follows:</p>

It ſeemed that a kind of Board of Directors who had a ſubordinate direction of the refugee operations, were ſome how concerned in this buſineſs, and that <hi>argument</hi> and ſome <hi>artifice</hi> were neceſſary to ſmooth it over. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Gen. Waſhington, painful as his taſk was, was not to be diverted from juſtice or retaliation; but execution was ſuſpended. Lady Aſgill, learning the unhappy ſituation of her darling ſon, with much policy, and equal ſucceſs, applied to the Count de Vergennes, then Prime Miniſter of France, who ſpread the matter before the King and Queen: indeed it was a ſubject that needed no extra colouring to fix it on the mind of humanity. The King and Queen liſtened to the requeſt; and Congreſs was addreſſed in a repreſentation, that the French, as well as Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican arms, were victorious at York; and that the former ſeemed to have ſome ſhare in the priſoners; and hinted that it would be pleaſing to the French Court, if young Aſgill was pardoned—which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs complied with: and although reparation for the wanton murder of Capt. Huddy was not fully obtained, yet it is highly probable, that the firm and determined conduct of Gen. Waſhington, on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, put a ſinal ſtop to any further repetition of the kind.</p>
            <p>Sir Guy Carleton was probably the greateſt Ceneral which the Britiſh had in America, during the war; and it was fortunate for the Americans, that he was ſo long kept within the limits of Canada. In him were combined many of thoſe great qualiſications which form the General.</p>

When Sir Guy viſited the American priſoners in confinement in Canada, he addreſſed them with all the tenderneſs of a father; he obſerved to the young priſoners, that he did not blame them, it was the fault of the deſigning men of their country, that had led them into difficulty; that he would not hold them in confinement, but would ſend them home to their fathers and friends. See here the ſoothing art, that could not fail to cool the ardour of the young warrior in the cauſe of his country.</p>

               </gap>n. Waterbury of Connecticut, when he ſhew him his commiſſion, Sir Guy obſerved—"Your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is from the proper authority of your Colony; (Connecticut had not changed her form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) you are no rebel, Sir; you ſhall go home to your family."</p>
            <p>Soon after Sir Guy Carleton came into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at New-York, a Connecticut ſoldier, who had been a priſoner, came out to our army, and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a paſs to go home, informing that he had given a parole to Sir Guy, not to ſerve again, during the war; but he was ordered to join his regiment, which diſappointed the ſoldier exceedingly. Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington ordered the Commiſſary of Priſoners to credit the Britiſh for one man exchanged; and informed Sir Guy that this practice would not be allowed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoldiers were at that time very uneaſy in the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican army—had a conduct of this ſort been allowed, many ſoldiers on the out-poſts and otherwiſe, might have gone to the enemy, have pretended they were taken, and have come out under parole, and have gone home, to the unſpeakable injury of the army but it was nipped in the bud—only one other hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come out in the ſame way, before it was put a ſtop to.</p>

The 20th of April, two priſoners of war, taken near Kingſtreet, were ſent up by Major Oliver.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—A Serjeant-Major deſerted and came out; he reported that an enterprize was contemplating at New-York, and a number of large boats were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting at Turtle Bay.</p>
            <p>24th.—Two deſerters came in from the Adamant man-of-war, of 50 guns, which lay in the Eaſt River, againſt New-York. Admiral Digby's ſlag was then hoiſted on board the Centurion. The ſeamen on board the ſhips very ſickly.</p>
            <p>The latter end of April, the Duke of Cumberland packet, Capt. Daſhwood, arrived at New-York, in ſix weeks from England, with the March mail: by which it was learnt, that the debates in the Britiſh Parliament on the American war, grew more and more intereſting; that a motion had been made by Gen. Conway, for bringing in a bill, empowering the King to make peace with America.</p>
            <p>The beginning of May, the Britiſh cruizers were very ſucceſsful againſt the Americans; eleven ſail of veſſels from Philadelphia were taken, and carried into New-York, with near 9,000 barrels of flour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 4th.—This evening exhibited the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>aurora borealis</hi> ever before ſeen by thoſe who obſerved it.</p>
            <p>5th.—It was learnt, that the merchants of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, at a meeting on the 7th of the preceding January, declared and publiſhed their ſentiments and wiſhes for a peace with America, and a renewal of friendſhip. It was alſo further learnt, that it was the prevailing ſenſe of the Britiſh Houſe of Commons, as a firſt ſtep to an accommodation with America, to change the mode of carrying on the war, and to act only on the defentive, on the Continent; and that the perſon who ſhould adviſe to offenſive opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Americans, ſhould be conſidered as
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:033865_0343_0FF8DA7F4637A8D8"/>an enemy to the King and nation. At the ſame time, France and Holland appeared to be making great preparations for a vigorous campaign.</p>
            <p>6th.—Symptoms of a dangerous mutiny were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Connecticut line; it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with ſo much addreſs, as to have been nearly matured before it was divulged. Under the preſſure of real or ſuppoſed grievances, the ſoldiers of the whole line had determined, at revelle the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to have marched from their cantonment with arms, &amp;c. complete, for Fiſhkill, were they were to take a number of field-pieces, and ſuch ammunition and proviſions as might be neceſſary, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Hartford, and there demand of their new General Aſſembly that juſtice which they ſuppoſed was their due. Juſt as the officers were going to bed, a faithful ſoldier, who was waiter to an officer, came into his room, and told the officer that he could not go to reſt until he divulged to him an event which would aſſuredly take place the next morning, at break of day; and that every thing was then in readineſs for it—and laid open the whole ſecret. The matter was immediately communicated to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers of the line, and ſeveral ſoldiers were ſeized and confined, and one ſuffered. The whole deſign was fruſtrated. Mutiny is a moſt horrid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in an army, which, without ſtrict order and diſcipline, is but a rope of ſand. On the other hand, human nature can bear but to a certain degree, and no further; hence any trial of human nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſuch a degree, is impolitic, and unjuſtifiable. Of this line, it may with ſtrict juſtice be ſaid, that their whole conduct through the war was highly meritoricus.</p>
            <p>7th.—A ſtop was put to the inoculation with the ſmall-pox.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="346" facs="unknown:033865_0344_0FF97267907370E8"/>
8th.—A prifoner was ſent up, and a deſerter came in.</p>
            <p>9th.—News was received, that there had been a total change of the Britiſh Miniſtry, and that Fort St. Philip, and the whole iſland of Minorca, ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the Spaniards, on the 6th of the preceding February, by capitulation.</p>
            <p>15th.—Eleven truſty Serjeants were ſent to Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, to march on the recruits to the army from that State.</p>
            <p>17th.—Two deſerters came in, who reported that a packet had arrived at New-York, from England.</p>
            <p>24th.—Near 100 old and decrepid ſoldiers were collected from the different regiments, and many of them diſcharged. About this time, a packet arrived at Boſton, in 25 days paſſage from France; the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were immediately forwarded to Congreſs.</p>
            <p>26th.—The 1ſt Maſſachuſetts brigade was ordered to move out of its cantonment, and encamp near the German Huts.</p>
            <p>The United States of Holland acknowledged the independence of the United States of America, the 28th of the preceding March.</p>
            <p>There was a great talk of peace in New-York.</p>
            <p>In the American army great preparations had for ſome time been making to celebrate the birth of the Dauphin of France. At leaſt 1,000 men a day were employed, under the direction of the engineers and other artiſts, in conſtructing a moſt ſuperb <hi>arbor,</hi> decorated with every emblem and device, deſcriptive of the occaſion, and the alliance between France and America, which ingenuity could invent; and perhaps for any thing of the kind, conſtructed in the field, was never ſurpaſſed.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—The birth of the Dauphin of France was celebrated by the American army. An elegant din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was provided, by order of the Commander in
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:033865_0345_0FF973FD86B0A968"/>Chief; of which the officers of the army, and a great number of ladies and gentlemen, invited from the adjacent country, partook. Thirteen toaſts were drank, announced by the diſcharge of cannon. At evening there was a grand feu-de-joy, opened by the diſcharge of 13 cannon, three times repeated. The feu-de-joy, being fired in the duſk, had a pleaſing appearance to the eye, as well as the ear; and was ſo ordered for that purpoſe. The army was not formed in line, but each brigade was drawn up in front of its own cantonment, or camp, on both ſides of the river; and thus were in a circle of ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral miles circumference, in the centre of which, the Commander in Chief, and the ſpectators were plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After the feu-de-joy, there was an exhibition of fire-works, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 2d.—Information was received, that the iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and of New-Providence, and its dependencies, were taken by the Spaniards, on the 11th of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing May. The garriſon, which conſiſted of about 200 men, were ſent to Europe. The new frigate South-Carolina, built in Europe, artived about this time in the Delaware; ſhe was an exceeding fine ſhip, mounting 28 42-pounders on one deck, and 12 12-pounders on her quarter and fore-caſtle. She was commanded by Commodore Gillon.</p>
            <p>There had been a bloody engagement in the Weſt-Indies, the 12th of the preceding April, between the Count De Graſſe and Admiral Rodney; but all the accounts had been very vague. The Britiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="348" facs="unknown:033865_0346_0FF9727628A8EF80"/>having obtained a very ſignal advantage in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean ſeas, over Admiral Kempelfelt.</p>
            <p>5th.—It was reported, that a French fleet had been ſeen on the American coaſt. A fleet about this time ſailed from New-York, eaſtward, through the Sound, conjectured to be deſtined to Penobſcot. The brigades of the American army daily manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vred, and fired to great acceptation.</p>
            <p>14th.—The Britiſh had been removing a number of heavy cannon and ordnance ſtores from their works at the north end of New-York iſland, and placing light pieces in the room of them. A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of deſerters daily came in.</p>

            <p>13th.—Two priſoners of war were ſent up, and three German deſerters came in, and the next day a light dragoon, with his horſe, &amp;c. complete. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time, the ſouthern mail was taken, between Philadelphia and Morriſtown.</p>
            <p>18th.—It was learnt, that on the 21ſt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding May, Gen. Wayne obtained a conſiderable advantage over the enemy, with very little loſs on his ſide, near Ogechee, in Georgia: the enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into Savannah. About this time, a Corporal and 8 men deſerted from our block-houſe, at Dobb's Ferry.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—Three deſerters came in. About this time, a fleet of about 40 ſail arrived at Sandy Hook, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der convoy of two frigates; they were ſuppoſed to be from Ireland.</p>
            <p>22d.—Three deſerters came in from the Britiſh
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:033865_0348_0FF974F463F692D0"/>grenadiers; two others deſerted at the ſame time, but had not got in. The ſame day, four deſerters came in from the Huſſar frigate, and the next day three ſoldiers. At this time the cow thieves and refugees were lurking in the Highlands, and detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſent out to patrol them.</p>
            <p>26th.—Information was received, that a party of the enemy, to the number of 4 or 500, had appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Mohawk River, advancing towards Fort Herkemer. They killed a continental ſoldier.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 2d.—The Britiſh May and June packets had arrived at New-York. Admiral Barrington had taken a French man-of-war, of 74 guns, and ſeveral tranſports, deſtined for the Eaſt-Indies. The next day it was learnt, that a French fleet, conſiſting of 12 or 13 ſail of the line, and 3 frigates, had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the Cheſapeak.</p>
            <p>On the 29th ult. a bloody engagement took place off the Cheſapeak, between the French frigate Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azon, of 36 guns, and the Britiſh frigate Margaretta, which terminated in favour of the latter.</p>
            <p>6th.—Information was received, that the Britiſh had evacuated Savannah in Georgia.</p>
            <p>8th.—Four deſerters came in from the enemy.</p>
            <p>10th.—The proſpect of an approaching peace brightened; Gen. Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby informed Gen. Waſhington, that Mr. Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville had gone over to France on the negociation for peace, and that the independence of America was to be acknowledged previous to, or as an opening of the negociation. The refugees at New-York were greatly alarmed at the proſpect of peace. Sir Guy Carleton had notified the inhabitants to meet him; and, in Rivington's paper of the 7th, there appeared a proclamation, adviſing the refugees to continue
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:033865_0349_0FF9741B2C3F3988"/>their loyalty, and make themſelves eaſy, until the event of the negociation was known.</p>
            <p>12th.—A large ſtone magazine, capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 1,000 barrels of gun-powder, was begun to be erected on Conſtitution Iſland; it was built upon the principles of Monſieur Vauban, and under the direction of Maj. Villefranche.</p>
            <p>15th.—It was learnt, that the French fleet, which had been at the Cheſapeak, had arrived at Boſton. The Britiſh troops evacuated Savannah the 11th of July, leaving the town and works uninjured. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the evacuation, the refugees ſent out to Gen. Wayne, to know if they might depend on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in their perſons and property; they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the affirmative, until they were delivered over to the civil authority, who, they were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt decide on their caſe. When the Britiſh left the town, near 200 of the inhabitants immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately entered the American ſervice in the Georgia battalion.</p>
            <p>19th.—Three priſoners of war were ſent up; they were taken near Eaſt-Cheſter. Several deſerters came in about the ſame time.</p>
            <p>22d.—The light-infantry of the American army moved down, and encamped near Peek's Kill.</p>
            <p>24th.—Maj. Gen. Knox was in the general or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders appointed to the command of Weſt-Point. The artillery, ſappers and miners, 10th Maſſachuſetts regiment, and the corps of invalids, for the garriſon.</p>
            <p>From the 25th to the 27th, incluſive, 7 deſerters came in; they reported that the ſick of the Britiſh army were ordered to be ſent on board the hoſpital ſhips, and not to the hoſpitals on ſhore. The heavy baggage was alſo ordered to be put on board the ſhipping; the officers to retain on ſhore no more than what was of abſolute neceſſity.</p>
            <p>29th.—An order of encampment and battle for
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:033865_0350_0FF97500861B2410"/>the American army was publiſhed. The army was to encamp in one line, with a reſerve; the New-Jerſey and New-York troops were to form a diviſion under the command of Maj. Gen. St. Clair; the Connecticut troops, a diviſion under Maj. Gen. M'Dougal; theſe two diviſions to form the right wing, to be commanded by Maj. Gen. Gates: the New-Hampſhire brigade and firſt brigade of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, to form a diviſion under the command of Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling; the 2d and 3d Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts brigades, a diviſion under the command of Maj. Gen. Howe; theſe two diviſions, forming the left wing, under the command of Maj. Gen. Heath. The 2d Connecticut and 3d Maſſachuſetts brigades to form the reſerve; and when the ground would admit, form at 200 paces in the rear of the army. Maj. Gen. Lord Sterling was ordered to Albany to take the command of that part of his diviſion which was then in that quarter.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—As many of the army as could be carried in the boats, embarked at their reſpective brigade landings; and the whole of the boats being formed in order, fell down the river to Verplank's Point, where the troops diſembarked and encamped. They made a moſt beautiful appearance, when in the boats and in motion. The remainder of the army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down by land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> 1ſt.—Information was received, that the Britiſh were on the eve of evacuating Charleſton, South-Carolina. The ſeaſon was remarkably dry, both to the eaſtward and ſouthward; it was with difficulty that the army could obtain a ſupply of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. About this time, an embarkation of Heſſian troops took place at New-York.</p>
            <p>7th.—There was a grand review and manoeuvre of the army, which gave great ſatisfaction. The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly packet arrived at New-York about this time; it
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:033865_0351_0FF8DA8FE0BCB108"/>appeared that the Marquis of Rockingham had died, that Mr. Fox and Lord Cavendiſh had reſigned their places, and that Lord Shelburne was appointed one of the Secretaries of State.</p>
            <p>14th.—The American army was under arms to receive Gen. Count de Rochambeau; after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the army defiled before him, and returned to their reſpective encampments. The French ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was now arriving from the ſouthward; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped to the South of Peek's Kill as they arrived.</p>
            <p>16th.—The enemy made a grand forage near Volentine's Hill; Sir Guy Carleton was out in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as was the young Prince. The covering party, it was ſaid, conſiſted of 5 or 6,000 men; a number deſerted. The American army at this time was in great want of forage, occaſioned by the dry ſeaſon. 18th.—The laſt of the French army arrived.</p>
            <p>20th.—Gen. Waſhington reviewed the French army; the troops made a fine appearance. A French frigate had been run on ſhore in the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and taken by the enemy.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—The American army manoeuvred before the Commander in Chief, Gen. Rochambeau, and many other officers. The troops made a handſome appearance, and manoeuvred well.</p>
            <p>22d.—It was learnt, that the ſhips-of-war and tranſports, at New-York, were watering and prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſea, and a number of regiments were under orders for embarkation. A little before this time, Congreſs had authorized and empowered Gen. Waſhington to adjuſt and finally ſettle the accounts ſubſiſting between the United States and the Britiſh government, reſpecting the ſupport of the priſoners of war on both ſides; and to provide, by a general cartel, for their greater comfort and exchange, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great ſeal ratifying what he, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of their army, ſhould agree to.
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:033865_0352_0FF9750AE57DD2F8"/>Gen. Waſhington transferred this power to Major-Generals Heath and Knox, whom he appointed Commiſſioners for the purpoſe, and inſtructed them not to proceed to buſineſs, unleſs the Britiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were found to be equally empowered to bring the buſineſs to a final iſſue.</p>
            <p>The time and place of meeting were agreed to by the two Commanders in Chief, and was to be on the 25th of September, at Tappan.</p>
            <p>24th.—The American Commiſſioners ſent down two of their Aids-de-Camp, to take up the neceſſary quarters, and make other preparations; and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of light-infantry was ordered to Tappan, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh guard and centinels.</p>
            <p>25th.—The American Commiſſioners embarked on board their barges, at King's Ferry, and fell down the river to Tappan Landing, where they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived about 2 o'clock, P.M. In leſs than half an hour, the Britiſh Commiſſioners, in two veſſels, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flags, came up the river, and caſt anchor off the Landing. The American Commiſſioners waited at the ſhore, and ſent off their barges to aid, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Britiſh Commiſſioners on ſhore, the river be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time very rough: on their reaching the ſhore, it was found that Lieut. Gen. Campbell and the Hon. Mr. Elliot, who had been Lieut. Governor of New-York, were the Commiſſioners on the part of the Britiſh. The whole dined together, an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant dinner having been ordered by the American Commiſſioners, and politeneſs and great ſociability took place; and a mutual arrangment for the dally ſupport of the table, was agreed on, as it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the buſineſs would not be completed in leſs than three or four weeks, if the whole object was adjuſted.</p>
            <p>26th.—The Commiſſioners interchanged copies of their reſpective powers; theſe were to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:033865_0353_0FF9743AF13E0888"/>until the next day, when anſwers were to be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in writing, whether the powers were ſatisfactory on both ſides. On examining the powers, given to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ritiſh Commiſſioners, it appeared that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would not be concluſive, until confirmed, and were very ſhort of thoſe held by the American Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, whoſe agreement and ſignature were to be final.</p>
            <p>27th.—The American Commiſſioners ſtated to the Britiſh Commiſſioners, that the powers with which they were veſted were inadequate to effect the expectations of the government of the United States, and that therefore the negociation muſt be broken off. Of the great difference of the powers, the Britiſh Commiſſioners were fully convinced. The American Commiſſioners thought it to be their duty, when they gave their note of objections to the Britiſh delegated powers, to hand with it a very pointed proteſt, in behalf of the United States, againſt that conduct, on the part of the Britiſh, which had ſo long delayed the ſettlement of the accounts for the ſupport of the priſoners of war, which were in the power of the United States. The Commiſſaries of Priſoners, on both ſides, were preſent, to preſent and ſupport their reſpective accounts; and a ſettlement would not only have been juſt, but alſo very intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the United States.</p>
            <p>28th.—About 12 o'clock, at noon, the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners parted with the ſame politeneſs and good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with which they met, and which had invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly continued during the time they were together. Our General ſent orders to the commanding officer at Dobb's Ferry, to permit the Britiſh flags to paſs down the river; and the American Commiſſioners returned to camp. The day before, (the 27th) Gen. Waſhington, covered by the dragoons and light-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, reconnoitred the grounds on the eaſt ſide of
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:033865_0354_0FF9751411A063E0"/>the river, below the White-Plains; and the 29th, about noon, returned to camp.</p>

               <hi>October</hi> 3d.—It was learnt, that the enemy had evacuated Lloyd's Neck, and deſtroyed their works at that place: their works at Bergen Point, in the Jerſies, had been deſtroyed before that time.</p>
            <p>5th.—Maj. Gen. Gates arrived at camp. At this time, the horſes of the army were ſuffering for want of forage.</p>
            <p>6th.—Intelligence was received from the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that on the 27th of Auguſt, Col. Laurens was killed, in a ſkirmiſh with the enemy: the loſs of this brave young officer was much regretted. The enemy, previous to their leaving Charleſton, deſired to purchaſe ſome proviſions; and Gen. Leſlie had intimated to Gen. Greene, that if this could not be permitted, he muſt take the proviſions by force. The former being denied, the latter was attempted, and Col. Laurens fell; 24 or 25 others were killed, wounded, or taken priſoners, and one howitzer fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>
            <p>7th.—Intelligence was received, that Maj. Gen. Lee had died, a little before, at Philadelphia; he had juſt before ſold his eſtate, in Virginia, for £6,100 ſterling.</p>

            <p>12th.—Intelligence was received from Europe, by the arrival of a veſſel in 34 days from Amſterdam, that the negociation for peace was going on, and that additional Miniſters and Envoys had gone to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; that the combined fleets were all in port; that the ſiege of Gibraltar was continued; and that there had been an obſtinate engagement in the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indies,
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:033865_0355_0FF97449F7E53828"/>between the French and Engliſh fleets, in which both fleets had ſuffered much, but no ſhips were taken by either ſide. The inſurrection in South-America had been quelled.</p>

            <p>On the 19th (ſeveral preceding days having been ſtormy) the grand manoeuvre was performed, by the eight picked battalions. The evolutions and firings were performed with regularity and exactneſs, much to the credit of the troops, and general ſatisfaction of the numerous ſpectators of the American and French armies.</p>
            <p>20th.—The Secretary at War arrived at camp. The enemy were demoliſhing their works at No. 8, Morriſſania. Intelligence was received, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers of Gibraltar had made a nearer approach to the place, and were playing upon it with 200 pieces of artillery.</p>
            <p>22d.—The firſt diviſion of the French army mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eaſtward; they were to halt at Hartfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, where the whole were to rendezvous. The American army was put under orders, to be ready to move on the ſhorteſt notice. The Auguſt pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, from England, arrived at New-York the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>24th.—The whole American army manoeuvred before the Hon. the Secretary at War. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief, in the orders of the day, expreſſed his own, as well as the Secretary at War's fulleſt approbation.</p>

            <p>27th.—The troops croſſed the Hudſon in boats to Weſt-Point, the whole having croſſed by half paſt 12 o'clock.

            <p>28th.—At 7 o'clock, A. M. the troops reſumed their march from Butter-Hill, and reached the ground on which they were to build their huts, in New-Windſor, at about half paſt 10 o'clock, A. M. Upon this ground, and its vicinity, the army paſſed the enſuing winter. The cantonment, for its nature and kind, was regular and beautiful. Upon an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inence, the troops erected a building, handſomely finiſhed, with a ſpacious hall, ſufficient to contain a brigade of troops on Lord's days, for public worſhip, with an orcheſtra at one end; the vault of the hall was arched; at each end of the hall were two rooms, conveniently ſituated for the iſſuing of the general orders, for the ſitting of Boards of Officers, Courts Martial, &amp;c. and an office and ſtore for the Quarter-Maſter and Commiſſary's departments. On the top was a cupola and flag-ſtaff, on which a flag was hoiſted occaſionally, for ſignals, &amp;c.

The regiments ſo formed, to be completely officered; the officers to agree and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine who ſhould ſtay in ſervice; or if this could not be effected by aggreement, the juniors who were ſupernumerary of each grade were to retire, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their rank, and be entitled to the emoluments to which the officers were entitled, who retired un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſolutions of the 3d and 21ſt of October, 1780.

Had Spain long before this given over the ſiege of Gibraltar, and employed her naval and land forces againſt the Britiſh in ſome quarter more vulnerable, ſolid advantages might have accrued, much money and many lives have been ſaved.</p>
            <p>28th.—General Thankſgiving throughout the United States. The French fleet, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Marquis de Vaudreuil, was at this time in Nantaſket Road, except a few ſhips which were at Portſmouth, New-Hampſhire.</p>

A reinforcement of French ſhips and troops had arrived in the Weſt-Indies from France. This day the laſt diviſion of the French troops reached Boſton.

            <p>6th.—Intelligence was received, that a number of loyaliſts had gone from New-York to Nova-Scotia; that Gov. Franklin, in England, had written to his friends in New-York, that peace would certainly take place. About this time, the articles of a treaty of amity and commerce, between the United States of America and Holland, was publiſhed by Congreſs. In the month of the preceding December, Congreſs paſſed a ſpirited reſolution, reſpecting the conduct of the government of Vermont; and about this time, the Council of Vermont preſented to Congreſs a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance againſt the reſolution, as interfering with their internal police.</p>
            <p>About this time, Gen. Waſhington and Gen. Sir Guy Carleton had an interview on the lines of the two armies.</p>
            <p>20th.—Intelligence was received, that Don Sola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, with ten ſail of Spaniſh men-of-war, had arrived at the Havannah, and that the Count D'Eſtaing had arrived, with a French fleet, at Martinico; that an attack on the iſland of Jamaica was ſoon expected to take place; in conſequence of which, ſeven Britiſh regiments were to go from New-York to the Weſt-Indies. The refugees at New-York were ſelling off
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:033865_0363_0FF8DAA706599470"/>their effects at auction, and preparing for a ſudden removal to Nova-Scotia.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—The Britiſh King's ſpeech, to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, appeared in a hand-bill. The ſpeech breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reconciliation throughout. The King informed his Parliament, that he had gone the utmoſt lengths the power granted to him would allow; and that he hoped ſoon to lay before them the articles of peace, which were in great forwardneſs, and ſuch as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended they would approve. That he hoped the two countries would ſtill be in friendſhip, —that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, language, intereſt, &amp;c. urged this, —that he devoutly prayed Great-Britain might not experience any of thoſe calamities, which might be feared from ſuch a diſmemberment of the Empire; and then extends ſome compaſſionate expreſſions to America. Alas, O King! it might have been happy for both countries, if a due conſideration had been early ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed; then might much blood and much treaſure have been ſaved. Let it be a warning to other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be wiſe and juſt! Nature will have her own way, and do her own work in her own time. Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica of courſe would be independent and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; but a miſtaken policy in Great-Britain, hurried on an event to her own loſs, long before nature had ripened it for her own conſummation. The public expectation now was high, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod when peace ſhould be announced ſuppoſed to be even at the door, and divers premature accounts were at different times circulated.</p>
            <p>25th.—It was learnt, that Lieut. Col. Barber, of the New-Jerſey line, had a little before been killed, together with his horſe, near the army, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected fall of a tree, which a ſoldier was cutting. By this event a brave officer and valuable citizen was loſt, who had frequently diſtinguiſhed himſelf in action; his fall, therefore, in this manner, and

            <p>27th.—Intelligence was received from Virginia, that the Houſe of Delegates of that State had rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommended to their conſtituents, not to chooſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to places of power and truſt, men who had not been attached to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>28th.—It was found, that the Britiſh cruizers, from New-York, had lately taken a number of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican veſſels, among them ſeveral from Boſtom Virginia.</p>

            <p>6th.—Intelligence was received, that not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the French frigate Sibill had been taken by ſome of the Britiſh cruizers, and carried into New-York.</p>
            <p>20th.—It was learnt from Philadelphia, that the Waſhington packet, Capt. Barney, had arrived at that place from L'Orient in France, which place ſhe left the 17th of January. The public diſpatches brought by this veſſel, although they did not announce a peace to be concluded, yet informed that the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations were going on; every thing was ſettled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween America and Great-Britain, and matters look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:033865_0365_0FF974958D92F5D8"/>favourable towards France; but difficulties were ſubſiſting between Great-Britain, Spain and Holland. Several of the out-lines of the articles of the treaty, between Great-Britain and the United States of America, were publiſhed, and in general were thought to be favourable to the latter. The ſame packet brought diſpatches for Gen. Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby, which were forwarded to New-York.</p>
            <p>22d.—It was learnt, that a great uneaſineſs had diſcovered itſelf in the American army, on account of the great arrears of pay which was due, and ſome doubting apprehenſions as to the real intention of the public to fulfil their promiſes to the army, and in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The evening of the 28th, a letter was received from Philadelphia, purporting that a veſſel had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there from Europe, with the intelligence, that the preliminary articles of peace were ſigned on the 20th of the preceding January. Hoſtilities were to ceaſe in Europe the 20th of February, and in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica on the 20th of this month. The public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches had not now arrived, but were momently expected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 2d.—It was learnt, that a very valuable prize was carried into Salem.</p>
            <p>7th.—Our General ſat out from his houſe in Rox-bury, and arrived at the head-quarters of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican army at Newburgh, on Hudſon's River, on the 14th, in the forenoon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="368" facs="unknown:033865_0366_0FF97554B8466710"/>
On the 16th, in the general orders of the day, our General was directed to take the immediate command of the army, during the abſence of Maj. Gen. Gates. Congreſs had publiſhed their procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſuſpending hoſtilities.</p>
            <p>18th.—The Commander in Chief addreſſed the army on the happy ceſſation of hoſtilities as follows:
"The Commander in Chief orders the ceſſation of hoſtilities between the United States of America and the King of Great-Britain, to be publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to-morrow at 12 o'clock, at the New Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that the Proclamation which will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated herewith, be read to-morrow evening, at the head of every regiment and corps of the army; after which, the chaplains, with the ſeveral brigades, will render thanks to Almighty God for all his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, particularly for his over-ruling the wrath of man to his own glory, and cauſing the rage of war to ceaſe amongſt the nations.
"Although the Proclamation before alluded to, extends only to the prohibition of hoſtilities, and not to the annunciation of a general peace, yet it muſt afford the moſt rational and ſincere ſatisfaction to every benevolent mind, as it puts a period to a long and doubtful conteſt—ſtops the effuſion of human blood—opens the proſpect to a more ſplendid ſcene—and, like another morning-ſtar, promiſes the approach of a brighter day than hath hitherto illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated this weſtern hemiſphere! On ſuch a happy day—a day which is the harbinger of peace—a day which completes the eighth year of the war, it would be ingratitude not to rejoice: it would be inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility not to participate in the general felicity.
"The Commander in Chief, far from endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtifle the feelings of joy in his own boſom, offers his moſt cordial congratulations on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to all the officers of every denomination—to all
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:033865_0367_0FF8DAAE22FA1DE8"/>the troops of the United States in general, and in particular to thoſe gallant and perſevering men who had reſolved to defend the rights of their invaded country ſo long as the war ſhould continue; for theſe are the men who ought to be conſidered as the pride and boaſt of the American army, and who, crowned with well-earned laurels, may ſoon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the field of glory to the more tranquil walks of civil life.
"While the General recollects the almoſt infinite variety of ſcenes through which we have paſſed with a mixture of pleaſure, aſtoniſhment and gratitude— while he contemplates the proſpects before us with rapture,—he cannot help wiſhing that all the brave men, of whatever condition they may be, who have ſhared in the toils and dangers of effecting this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious revolution, of reſcuing millions from the hand of oppreſſion, and of laying the foundation of a great empire, might be impreſſed with a proper idea of the dignified part they have been called to act (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſmiles of Providence) on the ſtage of human affairs; for happy, thrice happy, ſhall they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced hereafter, who have contributed any thing, who have performed the meaneſt office in erecting this ſtupendous <hi>fabric of Freedom and Empire,</hi> on the broad baſis of independency; who have aſſiſted in protecting the rights of human nature, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing an aſylum for the poor and oppreſſed of all nations and religions.
"The glorious taſk for which we firſt flew to arms, being thus accompliſhed—the liberties of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being fully acknowledged and firmly ſecured, by the ſmiles of Heaven on the purity of our cauſe, and the honeſt exertions of a feeble people, determined to be free, againſt a powerful nation diſpoſed to oppreſs them; and the character of thoſe who have perſevered through every extremity of hardſhip, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:033865_0368_0FF8DAE94E127A60"/>and danger, being immortalized by the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious appellation of the <hi>Patriot Army,</hi>—nothing now remains but for the actors of this mighty ſcene to preſerve a perfect, unvarying conſiſtency of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter through the very laſt act; to cloſe the drama with applauſe; and to retire from the military theatre with the ſame approbation of angels and men, which have crowned all their former virtuous actions.
"For this purpoſe, no diſorder or licentiouſneſs muſt be tolerated; every conſiderate and well-diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoldier muſt remember it will be abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to wait with patience, until peace ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, or Congreſs ſhall be enabled to take proper meaſures for the ſecurity of the public ſtores, &amp;c. As ſoon as theſe arrangements ſhall be made, the General is confident there will be no delay in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging, with every mark of diſtinction and honour, all the men enliſted for the war, who will then have faithfully performed their engagements with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. The General has already intereſted himſelf in their behalf; and he thinks he reed not repeat the aſſurances of his diſpoſition to be uſeful to them on the preſent, and every other proper occaſion. In the mean time, he is determined that no military neglects or exceſſes ſhall go unpuniſhed, while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the command of the army.
"The Adjutant-General will have ſuch working parties detailed to aſſiſt in making the preparation for a general rejoicing, as the Chief Engineer, with the army, ſhall call for; and the Quarter-Maſter-General will alſo furniſh ſuch materials as he may want. The Quarter-Maſter-General will, without delay, procure ſuch a number of diſcharges to be printed as will be ſufficient for all the men enliſted for the war; he will pleaſe to apply to head-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the form.
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:033865_0369_0FF974AB13267B28"/>"An extra ration of liquor to be iſſued to <hi>every</hi> man to-morrow, to drink perpetual peace, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and happineſs to the United States of America."</p>
            <p>In the afternoon of the 18th, aſchooner,— Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, maſter, from Nantucket, with fiſsh, oil, rum, &amp;c. came up the Hudſon, to Newburgh. This was the firſt American veſſel which had come up the river, ſince the Britiſh took poſſeſſion of New-York, in the year 1776.</p>
            <p>19th.—At noon, the Proclamation of the Congreſs, for a ceſſation of hoſtilities, was publiſhed at the door of the New Building, followed by three huzzas; after which, a prayer was made by the Rev. Mr. Ganno, and an anthem (<hi>Independence,</hi> from Billings) was performed by vocal and inſtrumental muſic. The ſame day, Gen. Waſhington went for Ringwood, to meet the Secretary at War, on ſome buſineſs of importance.</p>
            <p>20th.—At evening, the Commander in Chief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to head-quarters.</p>
            <p>21ſt.—Permiſſion was given for ſuch perſons as might chooſe it, to go to New-York, with proviſions, &amp;c. A veſſel was loading with flour, to go down the river; and one laden with rum, porter, cheeſe, beef, &amp;c. &amp;c. came up from New-York. Thus, as we have ſeen how the rage of war came on, we now ſee how by degrees that rage ſubſided, until the <hi>olive</hi> ſprang up and progreſſed to full bloom.</p>
            <p>24th.—It was learnt from Europe, that on the 5th of February, preceding the Bedford, Capt. Morris, made entry at the cuſtom-houſe in London, being the firſt veſſel that had arrived in the river, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the United States.</p>
            <p>26th.—It was learnt that the reſugees were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking, in order to leave New-York; and many tranſports were ſailing down to the watering-place.
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:033865_0370_0FF9756A4FFF9C90"/>About this time, Congreſs recommended an impoſt duty to the ſeveral States.</p>
            <p>27th.—Intelligence was received, that the Indians had recently committed ſome outrages on the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern frontier; had killed and ſcalped 17 perſons near Wheeling Creek.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 1ſt.—Congreſs had expreſſed their opinion in a reſolution which was this day publiſhed, that the term for which the men engaged for the war, are to ſerve, does not expire until the definitive treaty is received; and that then, thoſe engaged for the war, and who ſo continue, ſhall have their arms and accoutrements, as a preſent, for their long and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervices.</p>
            <p>2d.—The next morning, the Commander in Chief was to go down the river, to Dobb's Ferry, to meet Gen. Sir Guy Carleton. Four companies of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infantry marched this morning for that place, to do the duty of guards. Sir Guy was to come up the river in a frigate.</p>
            <p>3d.—In the forenoon, the Commander in Chief, and Gov. Clinton, with their ſuites, &amp;c. went down the river.</p>
            <p>7th.—It was learnt that ſeveral veſſels had arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Boſton, from Europe, Halifax, &amp;c. with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize; in conſequence of which, the price of goods had much fallen, and the inhabitants of the eaſtern States were ſitting out a great number of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veſſels.</p>
            <p>8th.—It was ſaid that 11,644 American priſoners had died, during the war, in the priſons, and on board the priſon-ſhips, at New-York: a ſurpriſing number, and evidences that if their treatment was not ſevere, they were too much crowded, or not properly attended to, in other reſpects. Thoſe who have ſeen, know, and others can eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that where men are cloſely conſined in great
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:033865_0371_0FF8DAB30F17FF98"/>numbers, in priſon-ſhips, or in goals, that without frequent airing and cleanſing, the air in ſuch places becomes putrid and poiſonous, and produces almoſt certain death. How much care then ought to be exerciſed by every humane commander, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of provoſt officers, to be aſſured that thoſe whom they appoint are not only firm and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olute, (neceſſary qualifications in ſuch officers) but that they alſo are <hi>conſiderate</hi> and <hi>humane;</hi> and that ſuch commanders themſelves take care to know, and if neceſſary, correct any abuſes which may exiſt. Such conduct towards the confined and diſtreſſed, would add a laurel to the hero's brow, equal to the triumphs of victory, and more laſting: for if the merciful man be merciful even to his beaſt, how much more ought a great and brave man to feel for the unfortunate of his own ſpecies!</p>
            <p>9th.—At evening, the Commander in Chief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to head-quarters, having had an interview with Gen. Sir Guy Carleton.</p>
            <p>15th.—The Commander in Chief went for Pough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepſie. A letter from Gen. Sir Guy Carleton, to Gov. Clinton, had rendered an interview between the Governor and the Commander in Chief ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p>16th.—At evening, the Commander in Chief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to head-quarters.</p>
            <p>28th.—The army about this time were badly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with proviſions, and much uneaſineſs was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, both by the officers and ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>31ſt.—It was learnt that Congreſs had paſſed a reſolution, to furlough the men engaged for the war. This mode appeared to be marked with policy in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 2d.—The general orders of the day an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that the men engaged for the war, ſhould be immediately furloughed, with a proportion of the

Having recently expreſſed our ſenſe of what was due to our diſtreſs; having repeated to your Excellency the confidence we had, that our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts would be liquidated, the badances aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and adequate funds provided for payment, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to our being diſperſed or diſbanded; having ſeen with pleaſure, the approbation which Congreſs gave our reliance, it is with a mixture of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and chagrin, that we view the late reſolve of Congreſs, by which the ſoldiers for the war, and a proportionate number of officers, are to be furlough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any one of thoſe important objects being accompliſhed; and, to complete the ſcene of woe, are to be compelled to leave the army without the means of defraying the debts we have neceſſarily incurred in the courſe of ſervice, or even of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe menials in the pittance which is their due; much leſs to carry with us that ſupport and comfort to our families, of which, from our long military ſervices, they have been deprived. No leſs expoſed then to the inſults of the meaneſt followers of the army, than to the arreſts of the ſheriff—deprived of the ability to aſſiſt our families, and without an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that any thing is due to us for our ſervices, and conſequently without the leaſt proſpect of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining credit for even a temporary ſubſiſtence, until we can get into buſineſs—to what quarter can we look? We take the liberty to ſay, Sir, only to your Excellency; and, from the ſincerity of our hearts, we do it no leſs from a perſuaſion of the efficiency of your further efforts in our favour, than from the kind aſſurances you have been pleaſed to give us of your ſupport.</p>
                  <p>"To your Excellency, then, we make our appeal, and in the moſt ſolemn manner, from that abhorrence of oppreſſion and injuſtice which firſt unſheathed

                  </opener>
                  <p>"BEFORE I make a reply to the ſubject of the addreſs of the Generals and Officers, commanding the regiments and corps of this army, preſented by yourſelf, yeſterday, I entreat that thoſe gentlemen will accept my warmeſt acknowledgment for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence they have been pleaſed to repoſe in me; they may be aſſured it ſhall never be abuſed: and I beg they will be perſuaded, that as no man can poſſibly be better acquainted than I am, with the paſt merits and ſervices of the army, ſo no one can poſſibly be more ſtrongly impreſſed with their preſent ineligible ſituation, feel a keener ſenſibility at their diſtreſſes, or more ardently deſire to alleviate or remove them. But it would be unneceſſary, perhaps, to enter into a detail of what I have done, and what I am ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to do, in order to aſſiſt in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this intereſting purpoſe. Let it be ſufficient to obſerve, I do not yet deſpair of ſucceſs; for I am perfectly convinced that the States cannot, without involving themſelves in national bankruptcy and ruin, refuſe to comply with the requiſitions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; who, it muſt be acknowledged, have done every thing in their power to obtain ample and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete juſtice for the army; and whoſe great object in the preſent meaſure undoubtedly was, by a reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of expenſe, to enable the Financier to make the three months' payment to the army, which on all hands has been agreed to be abſolutely and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary. To explain this matter, I beg leave to inſert an extract of a letter from the Superintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of Finance, dated the 29th ult.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="378" facs="unknown:033865_0376_0FF975859A9BCC50"/>
"It is now a month ſince the Committee conferred with me on that ſubject, and I then told them no payment could be made to the army, but by means of a paper anticipation; and unleſs our expenditures were immediately and conſiderably reduced, even that could not be done. Our expenditures have nevertheleſs been continued, and our revenues leſſen, the States growing daily more and more remiſs in their collections. The conſequence is, that I cannot make payment in the manner firſt intended; the notes iſſued for this purpoſe would have been paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at two, four, and ſix months from the date, but at preſent they will be at ſix months, and even that will ſoon become impracticable, unleſs our expenſes be immediately curtailed.</p>
                  <p>"I ſhall cauſe ſuch notes to be iſſued for three months' pay to the army; and I muſt entreat, Sir, that every influence be uſed with the States to abſorb them, together with my other engagements, by tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation."</p>
                  <p>"Three days ago, a meſſenger was diſpatched by me to urge the neceſſity of forwarding theſe notes with the greateſt poſſible expedition.</p>
                  <p>"Under this ſtate of circumſtances, I need ſcarcely add, that the expenſe of every day in feeding the whole army, will increaſe very conſiderably the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the public to diſcharge the debts already incurred, at leaſt for a conſiderable time to come.</p>
                  <p>"Although the officers of the army very well-know my official ſituation, that I am only a ſervant of the public, and that it is not for me to diſpenſe with orders, which it is my duty to carry into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; yet, as furloughs, in all ſervices, are conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as a matter of indulgence and not of compulſion —as Congreſs, I am perſuaded, entertain the beſt diſpoſition towards the army—and, as I apprehend, in a very ſhort time the two principal articles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:033865_0378_0FF974CF5D1E0E48"/>will be removed—I ſhall not heſitate to comply with the wiſhes of the army, under theſe reſervations only, that officers ſufficient to conduct the men who chooſe to receive furloughs, will attend them, either on furlough or by detachment. The propriety and neceſſity of this meaſure muſt be obvious to all; it need not, therefore, be enforced; and with regard to the non-commiſſioned officers and privates, ſuch as from a peculiarity of circumſtances wiſh not to receive furloughs at this time, will give in their names by 12 o'clock to-morrow, to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers of their regiments, that on a report to the Adjutant-General, an equal number of men, engaged for three years, may be furloughed, which will make the ſaving of expenſes exactly the ſame to the public.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot but hope the notes will ſoon arrive, and that the ſettlement of accounts may be completed, by the aſſiſtance of the Pay-Maſters, in a very few days. In the mean time, I ſhall have the honour of laying the ſentiments of the Generals and Officers, commanding regiments and corps, before Congreſs; they are expreſſed in ſuch a decent, candid and affecting manner, that I am certain every mark of attention will be paid to them.</p>

            <p>A little before this time, the officers of the army beginning to realize that the diſſolution of the ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y was drawing nigh, and wiſhing to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate that friendſhip which numerous hardſhips, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and common dangers had inſpired in their breaſts, —reſolved to form themſelves into a Society,
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:033865_0379_0FF974D51DCF06F8"/>by the name of the <hi>Cincinnati.</hi> Several meetings were had for the purpoſe, and an Inſtitution was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and completed; and although our General preſided at one of the meetings, and cheerfully, at the requeſt of his brother officers, tranſmitted copies of the Inſtitution, covered by a letter, to the officer commanding the ſouthern army, and to the ſenior officers of the reſpective State lines, from Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania to Georgia—yet he had ſerious objections to the Inſtitution, as it ſtood, and refuſed for ſome time to ſign it. He wiſhed, as much as any one in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to perpetuate the happy friendſhip cemented in the breaſts of the officers by an eight years common danger and ſufferings; but he thought this would be beſt done, by ſimply forming a Society, to meet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in their reſpective States, for the purpoſe of a ſocial hour, and to brighten the chain of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, with a fund for the relief of the unfortunate of their brethren; but he was oppoſed to any idea of any thing that had any reſemblance of an order, or any inſignia or badge of diſtinction, <hi>aſſerting</hi> that it would only ſerve to mark them in an unfavourable light with their fellow-citizens: but the prevailing opinion of the officers was otherwiſe. Our General was finally induced to ſign the Inſtitution, from the following conſideration—(but not until all the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were appointed, and he nearly ready to leave the army) converſing with an officer of rank, who was of the ſame opinion with him, they parted in the reſolution not to ſign the Inſtitution; but the next morning, the officer called upon him, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that one conſideration, not before mentioned, had occurred to him, viz. that it might happen in the days of their poſterity, in caſe they did not ſign, that the deſcendant of one who was a member might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fall in company with the deſcendant of one who was not; that the latter, on obſerving the badge,
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:033865_0380_0FF9759712116978"/>might inquire what it was, and what its intention? upon its being anſwered, that it was the inſignia of a Society, of which his anceſtor, who ſerved in the American army, during the revolution, was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber—the other might reply, my anceſtor too ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during that war, but I never heard any thing of ſuch a badge in our family; to which it might probably be anſwered, it is likely your anceſtor was guilty of ſome miſconduct, which deprived him of it. Upon this, our General broke out—"I ſee it, I ſee it, and ſpurn the idea;" which led him to ſign the general Inſtitution: and he ſubſcribed to the State fund, 166 dollars, being one month's pay, as was ſtipulated in the Inſtitution. He however never met with the Society, although no one has cheriſhed a warmer affection for every member of the army. After the revolution in France, finding that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignias of diſtinctions were doing away, it led him <hi>anew</hi> to review the diſtinction which the <hi>badge</hi> of the Society to which he belonged, if not in fact, yet in appearance ſeemed to exhibit, and brought to mind all his former objections, which induced him to write to the Secretary-General to eraſe his name from the Inſtitution; but that his ſubſcription to the fund ſhould remain, ſo long as it was applied to the purpoſe for which it was given—the relief of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.</p>
            <p>6th.—In the forenoon, the Jerſey line marched from the cantonment to their own State, where they were to be diſbanded. The ſame day, the firſt New-York regiment made a preſent of their ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and band to Governor Clinton; they were eſcorted to Poughkeepſie by the light-infantry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the regiment.</p>
            <p>8th.—The men for the war, belonging to the Maryland, New-Jerſey, New-York, and New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire lines, having marched from the cantonment, a
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:033865_0381_0FF974D8510FF738"/>diviſion of the Maſſachuſetts men marched on this day.</p>
            <p>9th.—A diviſion of the Suffolk and Worceſter furloughed men, marched for their own State, and ſo on, a diviſion each day, until the whole had marched.</p>
            <p>10th.—Our General was General of the Day. In the after orders of the Commander in Chief on this day, it was expreſſed—"The ſtrength of the army in this cantonment being conſiderably diminiſhed by the number of men lately furloughed, the order of the 16th of April, directing a General, Field-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Quarter-Maſter to be of the day, and alſo a regiment to parade every day for duty, is diſpenſed with. For the preſent, there will be one Field-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and an Adjutant of the day; and the guards only will form on the grand parade at 9 o'clock in the morning." It is here a little remarkable, that our General, by whoſe orders and under whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection the firſt guard in the American war mounted at the foot of Proſpect Hill, on the evening of the 19th of April, 1775, after the battle of that day, ſhould happen, in the courſe of ſervice, to be the laſt General of the day in the American main army, on the 10th of June, 1783, to inſpect, turn off, and viſit the guards. At the firſt period, the roads were full of <hi>militia,</hi> preſſing towards Boſton, to commence and proſecute a dubious war; they were now filled with <hi>veteran ſoldiers,</hi> covered with laurels, returning from the field to their peaceful abodes.</p>
            <p>11th.—About 2 o'clock, P. M. the wind freſhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the weſt; there were ſeveral thunder-ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with large hail-ſtones, ſome of which were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be two inches long. The lightning ſtruck the flag-ſtaff of the New Building, entered the houſe, and ran down the ſouth ſide of it, doing ſome dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and ſtunning ſeveral ſoldiers near the door. In
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:033865_0382_0FF975A2D039FDE0"/>the general orders of this day, it was announced, that the <hi>levees</hi> were to be diſcontinued.</p>
            <p>13th.—The men who had enliſted for 3 years, and for ſhorter periods not expired, were formed, thoſe belonging to Maſſachuſetts into 4 regiments, and were to be commanded by Colonels Michael Jackſon, Henry Jackſon, and Joſeph Voſe, and Lieut. Col. Commandant Sprout. On the morning of the 16th, theſe regiments incorporated, and were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into two brigades, the one commanded by Brig-Gen. Patterſon, the other by Brig. Gen. Greaton.</p>
            <p>19th.—A number of officers of the army, viz-ſeveral general officers, and officers commanding regiments and corps, met at the New Building, and elected his Excelleney Gen. Waſhington, Preſident General; Gen. M'Dougal, Treaſurer; and Gen-Knox, Secretary, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> to the Society of the Cincinnati.</p>
            <p>20th.—The Maſſachuſetts State Society of the Cincinnati met, and made choice of Maj. Gen. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln for their Preſident; Maj. Gen. Knox, Vice-Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident; Col. John Brooks, Secretary; Col. Henry Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Treaſurer; and Capt. Heywood, Aſſiſtant-Treaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urer. The ſame day, the troops at the cantonment were put under orders, to be ready to march for Weſt-Point on the ſucceeding Monday.</p>
            <p>22d.—Our General iſſued his laſt order, which finiſhed as follows: "The long wiſhed for period having arrived, when the din of war ceaſes, the olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch of peace is diſplayed, the tolls and fatigues of the field are drawing to a cloſe, a part of the army have already mingled with their fellow-citizens, and others will probably ere long join them—Maj. Gen. Heath being about to leave the army, and this being the laſt opportunity which will remain in his power, to expreſs that affection for his brother officers and ſoldiers, which more than eight years ſervice has eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:033865_0383_0FF8DAC1E409E808"/>in his breaſt, he cannot depart without leaving his beſt wiſhes for the health, proſperity and happineſs of thoſe, whoſe lot it is a little longer to continue in the field—invoke every bleſſing on them, and bid them an affectionate farewel."</p>
            <p>23d.—The Maſſachuſetts regiments marched to Weſt-Point.</p>
            <p>The morning of the 24th, our General was to commence his journey homeward; but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief wiſhed him not to proceed until the afternoon. On his arrival at head-quarters, Col-Humphries, one of the Aids-de-Camp of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief, gave him a ſealed letter, obſerving to him to read it at his leiſure.
