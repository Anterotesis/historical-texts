            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Unknown Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT appearing by the Author's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that by your's of 1ſt of <hi>December,</hi> plain Matters of Fact were the only thing you injoin'd him, forbidding any thing of his own, I may reaſonably conclude you are deſirous without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion or Prejudice, to form a Judgment on thoſe Facts (truly related) according to Truth. That it may be ſo, and that you, <hi>Sir,</hi> and others, into whoſe Hands the ſaid Letter may fall, may not be impoſed upon, I take the Freedom to ſend you and them the following Remarks on that Author's Performance, whereby it will appear how far he has anſwered your honeſt Intentions, and how induſtrious ſome among us, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular this Author (already diſcovered) is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ſaid Manufactory Scheme, in odious Colours, and thereby excite to Reſentment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004739_0003_100DD13D792B1220"/>
it, which they could never do, if they treated it with Truth, and related the Facts as they really are.</p>
            <p>As to the Publick Currency, the Truth of the Facts with reſpect to the Province Bills on which he treats, lies thus: The Province being formerly deeply engag'd in War, their publick Charge was too great for their Ability to make prompt Payment. Not that they wanted Silver, but that they could not pay it into the publick Treaſury. This Neceſſity produced the Emiſſion Bills of Credit, to be redeemed in ſome ſhort Time. Theſe finding Credit, not ſo much by the Goodneſs of Merchants, as he ſays, as that of the Officers and Servants of the Government, who were the Creditors, and firſt honoured their Bills; and the War being aſſiſted thereby, more was emitted, and their Redemption carried for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the others redeemed in their Turn, and not poſtpon'd more than in one or two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Thoſe Bills went for ſome Time Hand in Hand with Silver, until the Goodneſs of the Merchants of that Day, taking the Advantage of thoſe Paper Emiſſions, which the Government by their aforeſaid Neceſſity had made, ſhip'd off all the Silver and Gold out of the Province, to make Remittances to other Markets, having car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their Trade to a Pitch ſo much above the Produce of the Country, as to require it. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation increaſing, and too many Hands being employed at Sea, the Land was neglected, or had not due Encouragement. Hence the Merchant would give any Price for Silver to anſwer his Demands abroad, which the Produce of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could not do; by this Means they ſunk the Credit of Paper Bills, and yet increaſed the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of them; no Money being left to pay
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004739_0004_100DD140901752E0"/>
contingent Publick Charges, (tho' the War being ended the People might otherwiſe have done it) nor none to carry on our Trade, now near double to our Ability. This put the Merchants on repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sollicitations for more Emiſſions, and many they obtained, ſome on Loans, ſome on Funds, all which by the aforeſaid Means, they conſtantly depreciated, to their own Advantage. Thus, firſt by bringing up the Price of all their Goods to what the Silver coſt, altho' they paid for much of them at a vaſtly lower Price in the Produce of the Province. Secondly, by defrauding their Creditors abroad, juſt ſo much as they ſunk the Bills in the Time they had Credit.</p>
            <p>Next he tells you, <hi>Sir,</hi> that there is an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Confuſion of Paper Currency here, and to prove it, mentions ſundry Denominations of Bills paſſing at different Value: But he muſt be an unaccountable Man to aſſert it, for this makes no Confuſion here, each one knowing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Value at which they paſs; and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument lies as ſtrong againſt different Coins of Silver, that without Confuſion paſs current in moſt Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>Then he proceeds to inform you of two Silver Schemes emitting Bills by the Merchants; the firſt of <hi>One Hundred and ten Thouſand Pounds</hi> in 1733, to prevent a large Emiſſion of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills from depreciating the Currency, which are punctually paid in Silver and Gold, and are 33 <hi>per Cent</hi> better than Province Bills. But impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial as he is (not ſuiting his Deſign) tells you nothing of his being the principal Promoter of them both. Notwithſtanding his private Opinion is againſt any, as he tells you afterwards; don't inform you, that he and ſome others, have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004739_0005_100DD142204D2E28"/>
great Part of the common Currency into Bonds, payable in thoſe Notes, or Silver at <hi>nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Shillings</hi> an Ounce, ſays nothing of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging their Debtors to give Bonds in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Money for their Book Debts, while large Sums of that Emiſſion never yet ſaw the Light, and that which did, was in a few Months board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and great Numbers by that Means alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are, or in a likely Way to be ruined, while the Notes are in the Hands of the Hoarders; and Silver is not to be had; neither does he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you that when this Scheme was compleat, notwithſtanding their giving under their Hands, not to give Credit to the ſaid <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills, (which they uſed as an Argument with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment not to ſtop their Proceedings) their Bills diſappeared, and have not been ſeen ſince; and they run to taking thoſe Bills of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> by an univerſal Conſent, while their own made to prevent them, are lock'd up in their Eſcrutores.</p>
            <p>As to their ſecond Emiſſion of <hi>One Hundred and Twenty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> we have as little Experience of it yet (being but partly emitted) as we have hope it will ever be advantageous to any but themſelves. However, from its Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, one of theſe Events muſt enſue, either firſt their Redemption depending on Silver &amp;c. at the End of fifteen Years, and their growing 46 <hi>per Cent.</hi> better in that Time in their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, they will ſoon all be boarded up, and ſo produce the ſame Miſchiefs, as their former Notes, ſaving that Multitudes being ſupplied by the <hi>Manufactory Bills</hi> at a reaſonable Rate, the Merchants don't find it ſo eaſy now, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, to perſwade People to hire theirs; or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if they redeem them by Bills of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Currency, as the Directors have lately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004739_0006_100DD144FB3E5608"/>
(no Crime in our Author to alter) then the neceſſary Conſequence is, that no Silver will be lodged in their Treaſury to redeem them, common Currency anſwering that End. Nor no increaſe of a Medium by theſe Notes, becauſe the Currency muſt be leſſened in proportion, and ſo the two profeſs'd Ends propoſed for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz</hi>
               </abbr> the bringing in Silver, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the preſent Currency, intirely fruſtrate and defeated. So this Mountain may bring forth a Mouſe, as the other did a Viper.</p>
            <p>As to what this Author has before ſaid, in his ſecond Reaſon under his firſt general Head, and often afterwards repeats as his Opinion, about private Notes invading the Prerogative: The following Diſtinction may ſet that right, and quite ſpoil his miſchievous Deſign in ſo often aſſerting it. I diſtinguiſh thus, (while no Law in force forbids) I have a natural Right to propoſe my Note of Credit, either Singly or in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with others, to any Man; if he will give it Credit; it's his own free Act, and if it is not adequate to what I received of him, he has no Reaſon to complain, he being under no Force to receive it: And this Principle correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds with the Nature and Manner of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in Trade and Commerce; and not only ſo, but if I may rely on the beſt Accounts both in this &amp; the neighbouring Province of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> I have the Authority of his moſt Sacred Majeſty and His moſt Honourable Privy Council, on my Side, in the Caſe of the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> private Notes. This Government, at the perſwaſion of the Merchants, who are now againſt all Currencys but that of their own, and that not to circulate, having paſſed a Law againſt thoſe Notes paſſing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004739_0007_100DD14682CA7658"/>
here, that Law came under Conſideration at Home, when His Majeſty in Council in Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that all His Subjects were free to Propoſe, Receive, or Reject each others Credit at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Abrogated that Law, and pronounced it Null and Void. Which Inſtance I hope, <hi>Sir,</hi> will ſettle you in that Point, altho' you have not the Concurrence of this wonderful Author.</p>
            <p>By the foregoing Definition, it may evidently appear, that however it may reſt in the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to aſcertain the Value of Money, when it is made a tender in Law, which ſeems the chief Ground of Complaint with reſpect to our Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency at Home, yet no Invaſion is made thereon by a Currency only propoſed, and no Body ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give it Credit, which is the preſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>Next he comes to the <hi>Manufactory Scheme,</hi> the main Subject of his Letter, as he ſays. And here, I doubt not, <hi>Sir,</hi> but the hard Names, ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Epithets, extravagant Gloſſes, and Ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanly Language, with many plain and obvious Contradictions, (Things never needed in a good Cauſe) which this Author in his unconnected Ramble over this Scheme, and it's Undertakers, has uſed, will induce you to give little Credit to his Performance; yet give me Leave Sir, for the more full diſcovery of this Hard-Mouth'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and for clearing the Scheme, and it's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters, from his ſcandalous Reflections, (tho' I confeſs one can hardly come ſo near him without Defilement) to examine his Aſſertion in Point of Fact, and his Concluſions with reſpect to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of this Affair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004739_0008_100DD14806C736D8"/>
And firſt he begins with the Subjects of this Undertaking; which he calls <hi>a vaſt Multitude of Neceſſitous, Idle, and Extravagant People, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining to have Money at an eaſy Rate, of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Value, which the Poſſeſſor cannot oblige them to accept, until after twenty Years, and with this to pay their Debts, which will depreciate the other Currencies, prejudice private Property, and damage the Merchants of</hi> Great Britain <hi>trading to</hi> New England.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, that as to the Numbers being Great that are actually concerned in it, it is true, but not the tenth Part of thoſe that are in Heart in favour of the Scheme, and think it the beſt calculated Method for the Province's Good, that has yet been tho't of, but that ſaid Partners <hi>are a Combination of ſuch as he repreſents,</hi> is as far from Truth as his Epithets are from the Rules of Decency and good Manners, or which is all one, as the Eaſt from the Weſt. Can it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>Sir,</hi> that the great Number of Officers Civil and Military ſelected out of the People by a wiſe Governour and Council, and performing ſo well, as that no Complaints were ever brought againſt one of them for Male-Adminiſtration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides numbers of Goſpel Miniſters now concerned in this Scheme, could deſerve ſuch a Character? Would ſuch Numbers of Officers (not Partners) as of late have reſigned their Commiſſions (that they might be free to give thoſe Bills a Credit) have done ſo to take Part with a Combination of ſuch deſpicable Mortals in a Deſign to cheat Mankind, and in which they muſt ſhare equally with others? But this (inſtead of Reaſon,) has been their Treatment all along.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004739_0009_100DD14B34FAF530"/>
As to <hi>the eaſy Rate by which the Partners have ther Money,</hi> there's no Argument in that, nor Truth in his Aſſertion, <hi>that they are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to receive it till twenty Years, or that the Bill is of no determinate Value, that it bears</hi> no <hi>Intereſt;</hi> all this is notoriouſly falſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Partners pay 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for their Bills, two of which <hi>he ſays,</hi> will be ſwallowed up, in the yearly Charges, to this add the Charge of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, apprizing of Lands, and Time ſpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, &amp; their clear Profit will be ſmall compar'd with their Riſque and Trouble; for which in ſuch Caſes, ſomething may be reaſonable. And who would grudge them ſome Profit for this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, ſince none are the Looſers? Secondly, The Value of the Bill is as expreſs as Words can make it, being by Promiſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not only after <hi>twenty Years</hi> on Demand, but at all Times in all Payments, Trade and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and for Stock in the Treaſury, as lawful Money at <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> per Ounce. This Promiſe tho' made by the Signers, yet it is for themſelves and Partners, and if the Partners refuſe it, the Poſſeſſor has a plain Action againſt the Signer or Indorſer; but to oblige the Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to receive (as before,) he executes a Covenant to the Directors for that Purpoſe, whereby they can, and (from Intereſt) will oblige him to fulfill his Promiſe. The Poſſeſſor (as by the Scheme now on publick Record) is intitled to the Stock in the Treaſury at <hi>one per Cent.</hi> lower than the Market Price, which Price he is equally intitled to ſet with the Directors, and this gives him <hi>one per Cent.</hi> Intereſt. As to theſe Bills depreciating others, not on a Silver Foundation, there will be none of them to ſuffer at the End of one Year, for that compleats the Term of their Redemption; his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004739_0010_100DD14D905BB6B0"/>
therefore that they will hurt private Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Merchants, fails and comes to nothing.</p>
            <p>And here I would propoſe to them, Which will hurt them moſt, whether to have Money circulating to pay for their Goods in Ships built, and Cargoes bought, in about ſix Months, as has been the Caſe when the Manufactory Bills are taken? Or whether to wait twice that Time, as ſome Refuſers, I am informed, have done, and the Keel not yet laid, or Cargoes bought, for want of Money, and perhaps will not till their Debtor breaks, or by ſome other Accident they are defeated of their Debt? But then, our Author lays Streſs on the length of the Period, and the largeneſs of the Sum. As to that of the Period, the Partners Obligation to take the Bills at any Time, as before related, is an Anſwer. And as to the largeneſs of the Sum, had there been the ſame Proviſion in the Province Bills, the Riſe of Silver had never affected them as it did. To clear this, pray obſerve, that when A gave B an advance Price for Silver, that ſunk the Province Bills ſo much, as A advanced in his Purchaſe. B, who thought he had got by the Bargain, ſoon found his Miſtake; for none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live was obliged to receive the Bills of him in Trade, at a higher Value than he received them of A, and ſo the Bills ſunk in Value in Trade, juſt as they did in their Purchaſe of Silver. But here the Caſe is vaſtly different, for ſuppoſe Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſhould oblige A as before, to give B <hi>Eight and eight Pence</hi> of the <hi>Manufactory Bills</hi> for an Ounce of Silver, when <hi>Six and eight Pence</hi> is their declared Value; would this of neceſſity ſink their Value as before? No, by no Means.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004739_0011_100DD14FCE32C7E8"/>
For this obvious Reaſon, becauſe there is that vaſt Number of Partners before ſpoken of, who are obliged to receive them of B at the Rate at firſt mentioned, beſides a vaſt Stock in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of <hi>Forty ſix Thouſand Pounds</hi> the firſt Year, and ſo on, where the Bills muſt be received as before expreſſed, at <hi>one per Cent.</hi> Intereſt to the Poſſeſſor. And its againſt Reaſon to ſuppoſe B will looſe his Advantage, or that the Bill will depreciate by this Means, as the others did. Moreover, this Scheme being founded on the moſt demandable Manufactories of the Province, it is highly probable that it will in a ſhort Time ſo increaſe our Produce as to enable our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to ſatisfy our Demands for <hi>European</hi> Goods, (which is one great Deſign of the Undertaking) and thereby take away that Demand for Silver that has always been the viſible Cauſe of ſinking Bills, an Effect never to be expected from their boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Silver Schemes, which on the contrary increaſe it's Demand, and raiſe its Value in proportion, and ſo leaves us worſe than they found us; whereas Silver being the Rule of the Value of the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Bills,</hi> (while none is requir'd) has all its Advantages without the aforeſaid Inconvenience. But if all this is too little to ſecure againſt the largeneſs of the Sum (and which notwithſtanding our Author's Aſſurance is difficult to determine before Hand) yet the following muſt do it. If I miſtake not, it's allowed by almoſt all States-Men, that while Money will Rent at <hi>ſix per Cent</hi> it is not too plenty. Well, if this be a ſafe Rule, then we are ſecure; for at the End of one Year of the Money's being out, <hi>Forty ſix Thouſand Pounds,</hi> Old Tenor, muſt be paid in to the Treaſury by the Partners, either in the Bills, or in <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorys,</hi> to be immediately Sold, to draw them
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004739_0012_100DD15151F1F6B0"/>
in; and ſo on, till the whole is paid in; and there it muſt lie, till it will Let for <hi>ſix per Cent.</hi> and can't be Let out for leſs: which I think wards off the Evil ſo often ſurmiſed to reſult from the Greatneſs of the Sum.</p>
            <p>But our cavilling Author will ſay, What's all this without ſufficient Security for the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and accordingly tells you, that the Bills are very Ill, or not at all ſecured. For Anſwer to which, I ſhall inform you, <hi>Sir,</hi> what the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity is, and leave you to judge for your ſelf, what Reaſon there is for this Objection. Every Partner Mortgages a Real Eſtate (ſaving a very few who gave Perſonal Security in <hi>Boſton</hi>) exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of Buildings, Timber, Wood, and wooden Fences, which are prized at nothing, to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of one and a half of the Money he takes out, done by five Men on Oath: The Deeds Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for the yearly Payment of a twentieth Part of the Principal, and <hi>three per Cent.</hi> Intereſt. To inforce theſe Payments, each Partner gives a Covenant, obliging himſelf to make them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tenor of his Mortgage; as alſo to pay his Rateable Proportion of all manner of Loſſes that may any Ways happen; beſides many other Things contained therein for the better Security of the Poſſeſſor; to which Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the Inſtruments are made. Now Sir, if he pays not, Action of Covenant broken may be brought, and on Judgment obtained, Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be Levied on his other Eſtate from Year to Year, and Payment to Payment, and his whole Mortgage lies to ſecure the laſt Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only: Hence if all they are worth will make good their Engagements, it is liable. The Directors Security as ſuch, beſides Inſtruments
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004739_0013_100DD15386252690"/>
executed to each other, obliging to the faithful Diſcharge of their Truſts, is a Covenant they give to each of the Partners, expreſſing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of their Duty; on failure of which each Partner has his Action againſt each Director, by Vertue of ſaid Covenant, which ſecures againſt all Suggeſtions of Corruption in the Directors.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the Surmiſe he pretends you make of the Merchants jeſuitically promoting the Scheme in order to get all Paper Currencies ſuppreſs'd, whether this is Genuine or not, I can't tell. But this is certain, that the Term is well adapted; for at that Game, it's notorious, he is never exceeded, and but ſeldom equalled. Then again (as tho' hurried by ſome Evil Spirit) he repeats his Abuſes of the Contrivers, ſays the Scheme was contrived for their Uſe, and in the ſame Breath ſays, it is only contrived for the Directors Uſe, who to be ſure were moſtly other Perſons; for the firſt Projector of the Scheme is no Officer. This appears, ſays he, from the Conſtitution, as firſt, becauſe their Choice is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual. Suppoſe ſo; yet if their Labour is worth the Hire, as indeed it is, and their Buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was as good or better, as indeed it was, as to moſt or all of them, it proves nothing to his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But he is here (as almoſt every where elſe) out in Fact. For altho' if they behave well, and Anſwer the publick Good, and End propoſed, they may continue, and it will be for the Credit of the whole they ſhould: yet on the leaſt Corruption, which his Objection ſuppoſes, any four Directors concurring with the major Part of the Partners, may diſplace the other five, or any one of them; and if that can't be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every Partner has his Action againſt the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004739_0014_100DD1592A281958"/>
delinquent Director, on failure of his Duty, as before. Which is an effectual Security againſt any Inconvenience on that Account. His ſecond is, <hi>that they have a Negative on all Reſolves at a General Meeting;</hi> this is alſo falſe. It's true they have in ſome, and as true that the Partners in Caſe of need, have their Remedy as before. In his Third, he gives you a freſh Inſtance of his Ill-Nature, and <hi>grumbles at the Charge, and ſumptuous Living on free Coſt,</hi> as he calls it, and that <hi>it will amount to two per Cent.</hi> all which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo falſe; and were it true, till he ſhews ſome needleſs Expence and Waſte, he proves nothing by it, but his own Rancour and peeviſh Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. And it's a poor Proof of his Aſſertion, <hi>that the</hi> South Sea <hi>Company allow'd</hi> Eight Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds <hi>only for Management,</hi> which is more than four Times as much as the Allowance and other annual Charge of this new &amp; difficult Undertaking, which takes up all the Time and Powers of the Directors; and for which they have <hi>One Hundred and fifty Pounds</hi> per Annum each (finding themſelves,) and no more.</p>
            <p>Then he wrangles and finds Fault with their Trade, and calls them <hi>Ludicrous,</hi> becauſe they Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that which others won't ſell us, &amp; that which we can't do without; whereas the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> and all other Banks well conſtituted (he muſt mean eſtabliſhed by Law) are prohibited Trade. And theſe deſire the ſame Thing, when alike cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced (their Trade not being a choſen Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance) but are loath to ſtarve in the mean Time. But then <hi>they don't underſtand Trade.</hi> This ought to move his Compaſſion, rather than his Anger. That he and his Brethren force them to Buſineſs of which they are not capable. His
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004739_0015_100DD15BB468FE00"/>
diminitive Appellation of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Bay,</hi> is very ungenerous and ungrateful, they having contributed vaſtly to the Aſſiſtance of out Trade, and to the Wealth of this very Author in particular.</p>
            <p>His next Freak is about <hi>the Alteration of the Scheme,</hi> which he thinks none have a Right to do but himſelf, he having altered as before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and what then, if it be for the better, (which he don't deny) and compleated before any Obligation was made, why ſhould he be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry? Why, for this very good Reaſon, that he and his Party will thereby be convict of a grand Impoſition on the Government at Home, as well as Injuſtice to the Directors) by laying Mr. <hi>Colman'</hi>s Scheme, ſo called, before them, as that on which the Bills were uttered; whereas in Truth it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the true Scheme is a very different Thing, and agreed to by the Directors long after that went off from <hi>New England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he miſtakes the Place, where to look for the Directors Securitys, and the Truth with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their being given. All that being done before they proceeded, as in other well ordered honeſt Schemes. And as to the Securities for their own Quota's or Shares as Partners, <hi>ſome Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken up,</hi> as he falſly affirms, if he'll ſearch again, he will find moſt of them on Record, which proves that it was Hurry that prevented it before, and not an evil Deſign, as he would have you think.</p>
            <p>In his Anſwer to your Deſire <hi>to know the Nature of our landed Intereſt,</hi> he ought to have told you, "that it is almoſt ruined by our Trade;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004739_0016_100DD15D7701D538"/>
as our Merchants manage it. It's true, <hi>Sir,</hi> Our Fore-Fathers ſpent their Blood and Treaſure, many of them, in ſubduing this Wilderneſs, and its ſavage Inhabitants; and the Land being cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated is generally exceeding Good, for ſo cold a Climate; the People orderly, vertuous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, but the want of Money and Hands to labour (too great a Proportion going to Sea) has brought them to the Paſs our Author ſpeaks of. Tho' he has his own Ends in caſting his Veil over their Nakedneſs; otherwiſe he might have diſcovered the Means which made them ſo, which would be little to his Credit. The Truth is this, that the Import too much encouraged, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port too much neglected and diſcouraged, has built up a few on the Ruins of many; the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Effect of ſuch a State.</p>
            <p>His next, being without Conſequence, remains without an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>His Miſtake about the Stock anſwered before, and the reſt of his Paragraph but a Bubble not worth Notice.</p>
            <p>His double Miſtake again repeated about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and Acceptance, already anſwered.</p>
            <p>That of the Aſſortment and Value of the Goods in which the Bills are to be paid, I anſwer thus; All the Goods in the Treaſury are the Property of the Poſſeſſor (ſo far as his Bills will reach) and conſequently he will take which he pleaſes. And the Caſe vaſtly differs from a Bond, where two Species are mentioned, as diſcharging Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; there the Creditor is intitled to but one, but here to all, therefore has his Choice. As to the Value, it being at the Market Price, the Debtor has no more Right to decide that than the Creditor; but of this alſo before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:004739_0017_100DD15F03524010"/>
His third, that the Bills will ſupply the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and no Manufactures paid: I Anſwer, that's impoſſible, becauſe the Sum to be paid in is bigger than what is emitted, and conſequently Manufactures muſt ſupply the Deficiency. And as to what Bills are paid in, they muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of the Poſſeſſor, and by them who muſt receive the Bills at the declared Value, and then who is hurt? Tho' all poſſible Means will be uſed, that Manufactures be produced for a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon herein mentioned.</p>
            <p>His fourth, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That the Directors (the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany not being a Body Politick) may emit what Bills they pleaſe, ſo none muſt be had, leaſt too much be emitted. However, a Law eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents this. But if the Argument proves any Thing, it proves too much, as by the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence aforeſaid, and ſo muſt be rejected.</p>
            <p>The ſame anſwers his fifth.</p>
            <p>His ſixth deſcribing who may ſet up a Bank, as well ſuits the <hi>Land Bank</hi> Partners, after all his Scurrility and ſoul Language, as it does the <hi>Silver Schemers.</hi> And I dare (were it convenient) put the Iſſue of the Caſe upon it. As to others following the Example, it is vertually anſwered in his fourth.</p>
            <p>His ſeventh, that the Security being among themſelves, may be ſhifted at Pleaſure. I Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Can they blot out the Face of the Bill in the Poſſeſſor's Hand? If ſo, there may be Danger, otherwiſe it's irrational to ſuppoſe the Directors will ſuffer, much leſs agree to cancel or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Securitys, while the Bill ſtands out againſt them, and muſt prove their Ruine. What can be more invidious?</p>
            <p>No wonder the Government rejected the Scheme in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as he next relates, when the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004739_0018_100DD1629884F270"/>
Signers of the Bills, the only Perſons the Poſſeſſors could come at, were to have no Security given to them, as appears, to enable them to redeem the Bills. But no doubt this Author when it ſuits his Deſign, will conclude that whatever once were the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Government, muſt always be right (let Circumſtances alter as they will) and 'tis a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we are not charg'd with Rebellion, for our proceeding contrary to what was their Mind twenty ſix Years ago. But tho' we eſcape here, he now draws up a heavy Charge indeed, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> of debauching People's Minds, inſtilling Principles into them deſtructive of the Government; and ſo he goes on with a long Detail of Particulars, equally ridiculous, and equally falſe, calculated purely to influence the Power at Home againſt this People, to procure a Diſſolution of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, doubting of his <hi>half Vote</hi> for the future. When in Fact (ſaving ſome Oppoſition made to the Merchants (by Abuſe extorted) and that in a very ſmall Degree, to what they have given) there is not the leaſt Foundation in Truth for all theſe Aſſertions. But this Inſtrument of Cruelty, with juſt the ſame Reaſon, takes the ſame Methods which his Predeceſſors the old Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees did, when they wanted Argument to hunt down the Chriſtian Religion and it's Promoters, they thought to effect it by repreſenting them as Seditious and Diſturbers of Government; and what was the Effect of their own Oppoſition, as now, was unjuſtly charg'd on them that peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuffered under it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſelect and Anſwer his moſt material Points, as that in his firſt, That <hi>for the People ſtrenuouſly to aſſert the emitting and paſſing any Thing as a Currency, in defiance of the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004739_0019_100DD164DEF21A98"/>
               <hi>is a high Crime,</hi> is anſwered before. <hi>Middletown</hi> he ſays, <hi>have Voted to receive thoſe Bills as Caſh for Town Rates;</hi> intimating—that by the Words (<hi>as Caſh</hi>) they <hi>invaded the King's Prerogative:</hi> But this is a falſe Recital of their Words, and (I fear) wilful, and diſcovers a conſciouſneſs in this Author that a bare offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or receiving of the ſaid Bills in lieu of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or any thing elſe, which was their Caſe, was no Invaſion on the Prerogative; therefore he perverts the Words on Purpoſe to ſerve his Deſign, at which he has an excellent Faculty. The Words are, "that they would receive the Bills in Town Rates," which no more infringes the Prerogative, than to have ſaid, they would pay in Corn, or any other Commodity, which ſome Towns have done before them, and were never taxed with invading the Prerogative.</p>
            <p>As to his ſecond, <hi>why Landed Men have not a Right to make Money as well as they that have none,</hi> or why <hi>they will relinquiſh their Country, ſooner to an Invader,</hi> or why <hi>they muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed eo be in Debt,</hi> or why <hi>their making Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> (he means Bills) <hi>is from a deſtructive and wicked Principle,</hi> as he aſſerts, being beyond me to diſcover, I paſs it by.</p>
            <p>His Gloſſes in his third, are intirely groundleſs. No Sir, we value our Selves on a juſt and honeſt Trade, equal to our Ability. 'Tis the Exceſs only we are againſt: ſhould be glad to enlarge our Ability, and hope by this Scheme to effect it, (our Produce being thereby improved) in an honeſt and thriſty way, and not by a Bankrupt Trade as at preſent, make our ſelves a Bankrupt People, the neceſſary and natural Effects of ſuch a Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:004739_0020_100DD167A61B37F0"/>
The Subſtance of his fourth is this, <hi>that the People in the Charter Governments, being greatly in Favour of this Undertaking, will,</hi> it's like, <hi>exerciſe their Charter Liberty in chuſing ſuch to Rule them, as they think will promote it;</hi> and ſo, ſays he, our <hi>Dependance on Great Britain would vaniſh, Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of Reſolves of Parliament, and King's Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors will enſue,</hi> (he ſeems to have chang'd his Mind ſince Governour <hi>B—t</hi>'s Day) he had better have ſpoken plain, and ſaid, it is beſt to take away the Charters, leaſt the People by Vertue of them, ſhould make Choice of ſuch as would promote, what they judged for the publick Good, inſtead of others who may deſerve the contrary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which is the grand Reaſon of a Charter: or in other Words, leaſt the People by their Charter Priviledge, ſhould give check to any arbitrary Proceedings that have or may happen, and ſo he is for abſolute Monarchy, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conſtitution, not only here but of the Nation alſo.</p>
            <p>As to his fifth, <hi>that the People are by the Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> of the Scheme <hi>excited to Mutiny &amp;c That they tell them, that the Lords at</hi> Whitehall, <hi>nor Acts of Parliament can ſtop their Proceedings;</hi> that <hi>if the Merchants won't take the Bills they muſt blame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for any Outrages that may happen;</hi> that <hi>we had as good periſh by the Sword as by Famine;</hi> that <hi>on a French Invaſion, if we ſubmit, it can't be worſe, as appears,</hi> he ſays, <hi>by the printed Papers ſent home.</hi> I Anſwer, It is hard to determine what Property of the Devil diſcovers itſelf moſt in this Relation, Malice or Falſhood both being carried to the Height. But I leave it to the Papers he refers to (abating ſome Strokes on the Merchant by their hard and cruel Uſage extorted) and let
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004739_0021_100DD16AE7D88BD8"/>
them be ſearched for the Teſt of this Author's Veracity in this Affair; and will be anſwerable for it, that ſcarce one in five Thouſand of the Landed Men of theſe. Provinces would quit their Allegiance to his preſent Majeſty, and His Royal Houſe, while the Blood in their Veins would keep them in Life; and none later than the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers he refers to, and ſo monſtrouſly abuſes.</p>
            <p>In his Anſwer to your Queſtion, as to what has been done by the Government; had he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the Truth, he would have told you, that in the Year 1739, the firſt Draught of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory Scheme was by Order of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (I mean the whole Court) laid before a Committee of both Houſes choſen for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. This being done at their Order, it was ſuppoſed, if they acted not againſt, their Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for it's Proceeding, was neceſſarily implied; the Scheme being then in the Rough and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, that Committee (if I miſtake not) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported againſt it. However, if they did, their Report was rejected, and it was referred to next <hi>May</hi> Seſſion for further Conſideration, and all Proceedings thereon forbidden in the mean Time: This by the way ſhews, that the Government (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called) had a Value for the Scheme in Subſtance, tho' they might not like it in it's then unpoliſhed Dreſs: well, ſtrict Obedience was pay'd to this Order, ſaving that ſome Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were made to obviate the Objections the Committee made againſt it. In the <hi>May</hi> Seſſions 1740, it was Reſumed, the Committee for the Partners heard by the Houſe; after which, the Queſtion being put, Whether it ſhould be ſtop'd? It <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the Negative. About this Time, a Committee of both Houſes was choſen to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004739_0022_100DD16C6B1724A8"/>
again of the Affair, but they Reported no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt it. Then the Merchants petitioned the Court it ſhould be ſtop'd; and great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Anti-Petitions, with many Hundred Hands from different Parts of the Province were prefer'd, praying it might not; however, in the forenoon it was ordered that the Affair of the Merchants Petition ſhould come on in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon of the ſame Day. This ſudden Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a ſurprize to the ſaid Committee, and the more ſo, becauſe the Gentleman of the Law, who uſually argued for them not expecting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hearing, was gone out of the Province, and thoſe on the Spot not knowing of it till one a Clock; whereas the Petitioners had by their Council learned in the Law, and a popular Speaker, prepar'd in Writing the Subſtance of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; however both Parties at Three a Clock appeared before the honourable Houſe, ſpent the whole Afternoon in Argument for and againſt the Scheme, and then withdrew. The Houſe after a long Conſultation and Debate, and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Alterations being made in the Scheme the mean while, came to a Vote in manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and it paſſed in the Negative by two to one. After which farther Amendments being made, ſundry principal Members of the Houſe that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt it, became in Favour of it, and their Number increaſed ſo faſt, that on a Motion made to the Houſe to Reſume the Conſideration of it, ſome Months after (on the Queſtion put) but about twelve Hands in that large Aſſembly were in the Affirmative, and ſo they (to wit, the Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) proceeded, having no Reaſon (they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended) to expect the Reſentment of the Court (which indeed they have never had) nor of the Governour and Council till ſeveral Months after
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004739_0023_100DD16EA82701C8"/>
their Officers were choſen, and many Hundred legal Inſtruments duly executed on all Hands, and large Quantities of the Bills emitted, by which it became impoſſible for them to Retract; this ſhews how they proceeded, and how far they are chargeable with Contempt of Government.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Governour and Council by way of Caution, did iſſue a Proclamation againſt taking thoſe Bills, ſomething earlier than before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: But that being on Suppoſition they were not for the publick Good, all that tho't otherwiſe, notwithſtanding took them, as they thought, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Contempt, the Government not being againſt it, or any Order to the contrary. When the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations for diveſting of Officers came out, Numbers that had proceeded as before related, Men of eſtabliſhed Characters, and known Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both of the Civil and Military Order, conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of the Juſtice of the Cauſe, as well as the cautiouſneſs of their Proceedings (before related) reſigned their Commiſſions, and others not their Inferiours were turned out and diſcarded for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in this Affair, but according to their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Obligations, in a Thing they might not have entred into, had not they been encourag'd as before.</p>
            <p>On this, whole Troops, nay almoſt whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of as good veteran Officers as any in the Province, no ways concerned, or ever intending to be, but from a Perſwaſion of the publick Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Uſefulneſs of this Work, either actually Reſigned, or informed their Colonels, when by them examined by Order of the Governour, whether they took the Bills, that they would Reſign, rather than not encourage that Affair. But moſt of this not ſuiting your Author, he leaves it out, as tho' aware, that ſuch a Conduct, in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004739_0024_100DD1702D84AA08"/>
ſo many Men of Note, muſt ſtrongly ſuggeſt to an impartial Mind, that this Work is another Thing than what it has been repreſented to be.</p>
            <p>In his next, he propoſes a Hearing, this would be happy for the Partners, could it be had with Convenience, who have ſuffered only where they have not been heard, always juſtified where they have; and whatever they may looſe by the Trial, they would undoubtedly regain their injured good Name, &amp; Reputation, ſo ſtrenuouſly endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be taken from them.</p>
            <p>To his nonſenſical ſecond Paragraph, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz</hi>
               </abbr> that the Partners receive no valuable Conſideration for their Deeds; I only Note, that he tells you before, that all that the Directors are worth, would not redeem <hi>two per Cent</hi> of the Bills, which now, he ſays, are no valuable Conſideration to them that receive them.</p>
            <p>His third, about Compaſſion in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being only a Reflection on the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I leave him to anſwer for it.</p>
            <p>Then he ſays, the Government will deal as natural Parents do with Children committing ſome Follies after repeated Admonitions; To which I ſay, They may expect it, as they are always ready to ſubmit to the Government they are under, and would rejoyce and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy to be fairly heard before them.</p>
            <p>In his next (the Bubbles being ſtill in his Mouth, not having fully vented his Corruption) In Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations &amp;c. (ſays he) the Guilt of the Projectors and Managers is always from a corrupt Principle, but the Errors in their Followers (the Multitude) is from a Miſtake in Judgment.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Here by a plain Contradiction of himſelf, he would now ſeem to acquit the Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the Charge of Iniquity, who before he
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004739_0025_100DD173C37ABF40"/>
calls <hi>a vaſt Multitude of Idle, Neceſſitous, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Perſons,</hi> as in Page 6. Sect. 3.<hi>A Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude contriving to indemnify themſelves againſt Acts of Government,</hi> Pa. 7. Par. 2. <hi>Contriving to baulk their Creditors.</hi> Pa. 9. Par. 1. <hi>Deſperate Men, Frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent.</hi> Pa. 10. Sect. 5, 6. <hi>Wickedneſs of Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Pa. 12 Sect. 4. and ſo on. But now this is no wicked Principle, but all an Error in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Account, becauſe they were not the Contrivers, or Managers of the Contrivance (he muſt mean) for a Manager after the Conſtitution is ſettled, is no more chargeable with the wicked Principle, on which it is founded, than any other Partner; but ſo he will miſs the Aim that hurried him thus to contradict himſelf, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the Condemnation of the Directors: For by this they will get clear too; for they were not the Contrivers of the Scheme, being in Subſtance projected and draughted long before they were choſen, or moſt of them had ever heard of it, and all they did was to Reform it, and ſtrike out what was Ill. And the Drafts Man (then and now a private Perſon) told me, that when he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and compleated his Work, this Author, before he entred on his ſecond Scheme, declared it was the beſt Thing for the Country's Good, that he had ſeen, and admired the Ingenuity of the Performance.</p>
            <p>He now tells you he has given you his Thoughts &amp;c. (altho' he was only to relate Facts) in the moſt impartial Manner he was able; tho' there is ſcarce one Paragraph or Sentence in his whole Performance reſpecting the Affair, but what is falſe in the Fact or in the manner of relating it; however they are his Thot's, and no doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by ſome Evil Spirit. Humane Nature (cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as it is) of it ſelf, not being able to equal his Performance.</p>

In his fifth Page he informs you that Shop Notes expoſe the Tradeſmen, Artificers, and other poor Labourers, to the Shopkeeper's Mercy, for their Pay in Goods, at any Rate: And now, in his <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> he calls their Agreement, to take no more Shop Notes (which is all they combine to do) an iniquitous Combination. And for this Reaſon, by thoſe Notes, ſuch great Advantage ariſes to ſome Traders on the Ruins of others, as <hi>from common Broom Peddling,</hi> in a ſhort time to acquire ſuch vaſt Wealth as to embolden them to treat almoſt this whole Province, and its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours too, with all the Contempt and Scurrility contained in this Author's Performance. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, here's a Hint from his own Mouth, how deeply miſerable this People are, thro' want of a Medium.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Sir,</hi> have I given you ſome Remarks on his Work, paſſing over much of his Fallacy, which Pity to him would not allow me to expoſe. I have alſo given you a ſummary Account of the <hi>Manufactory Undertaking,</hi> with the Manner of Proceeding, and the Neceſſity thereof. I ſhould have been more particular had Leiſure admitted. I hope, <hi>Sir,</hi> by what is ſaid, you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it is another Thing, than it has been repreſented to be, by thoſe that are it's Enemies.</p>

            <p>NUmbers of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> or Friends, noted for their Honeſty, Induſtry and good Order, are Partners in this Scheme, and many others (not Partners) in Heart and Practice favour it. Alſo many Towns take and paſs theſe Notes in Trade and Buſineſs, ſcarce one Man diſſenting, beſides paying their Town and Miniſterial Rates with it; at leaſt in Part. Great Numbers of Families, eſpecially in <hi>Boſton,</hi> muſt either have ſuffered, or been a publick Charge, as good Authors relate, had it not been for thoſe Bills. Some Thouſands of Pounds by a moderate Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ſaved in Law Suits for Debt, by Means of theſe Bills. Twenty Pounds in one Inſtance, preventing ten Actions; and indeed their Currency is ſo general now, notwithſtanding the vaſt Oppoſition they have had, that it may be affirmed with Truth, as well as good Reaſon, (theſe Bills being better founded than any heretofore emitted) that no other whatever, with a like Oppoſition, could have gained the Credit they have done: And the Miſery, Grief and Calamity of this People, if this Affair is broken up will be unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I would therefore humbly propoſe, whether in this Caſe, if any Amendments are wanting the better to render this a Publick Good, it would not be beſt it ſhould be done by a Law, to which all Men would heartily agree. rather than by abſolute Authority to ſuppreſs this Undertaking now carried to ſuch a Length as that many Thouſands of innocent well diſpoſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt be thrown into the greateſt Confuſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides (which is much worſe) the whole Province falling again into thoſe melancholly Circumſtances, which by the Scarcity of Money, they have been of late labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under.</p>
