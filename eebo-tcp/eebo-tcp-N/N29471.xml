            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE Declare, that notwithstanding our several Pressures and Grievances these many years under a wicked Arbitrary Power exercised by our Late Popish Governour <hi>Dongan,</hi> and several of his wicked Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Pentionaries, especially now under Lieutenant Governour <hi>Nicholson:</hi> We were resolved to expect with great patience, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from <hi>England,</hi> expecting to have part of that blessed and glorious Deliverance procuted under God, by his Royal Highness, <hi>William Henry,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> but when we challenged our Liberty, Property, and the Laws, we were cajolled and terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of our reason, but at last some being threatned by the said Lieutenant Governour <hi>Nicholson,</hi> and with a Pistol presented against the Corporal, and said to the Lieutenant <hi>Cuyler,</hi> that he would set the City on fire, for doing our Loyal Duty. We have thought fit for our Conservation, and fear, to be lyable to answer for the Life of every Protestant that might have perished, and every House burnt or destroyed, if we had remained lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Security; and also seeing daily Arrive from several parts Officers and Souldiers, who were entertained by the said Lieutenant Governour <hi>Nicholson</hi> in the Fort, besides his several Souldiers, of which there was a number of Papists, contrary to the Law of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> by which New-comers, some of the Burgers being threatned of some Design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them in few days, we thought Delay dangerous, so we have unanimously Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to live no longer in such a danger, but to secure the Fort better, which we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God; with success without Resistance and blood-shed effected: And we Declare to be entirely and openly opposite to Papists and their Religion, and therefore expecting Orders from <hi>England,</hi> we shall Keep and Guard surely and faithfully the said Fort in the behalf of the Power that now Governeth in <hi>England,</hi> to surrender to the Person of the Protestant Religion, that shall be Nominated, or Sent by the Power above-said.</p>
            <p>These are our most sincere Intententions, that we are glad to manifest, as well to the Power abovesaid, that God hath pleased to submit us to, as to other persons, to avoid their Reproaches, that they could otherwise unjustly lay upon the abovesaid Inhabitants.</p>

<pb facs="unknown:039248_0002_1013F9CEA6749AC0"/>
that the Corporal of the Kings Souldiers in Pay in the said Fort would not suffer him to place a Sentinel there: And that afterwards, the Lieutenant Governour, Captain <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholson</hi> the then Commander in Chief, returning to the Fort, sent for him the said Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to come to him in his Chamber in the said Fort, which he the said Deponent did, and desired his Corporal <hi>Hendrick Jacobs</hi> to go along with him, because he the said Corporal could speak better <hi>English,</hi> and that as soon as the said Deponent was come up into the said Chamber, he called for his said Corporal, who followed him to come into the Chamber; which he did, and that as soon as the said Lieutenant Governour saw the said Corporal, he rose up in a passion, and said to the said Corporal, You Racal, what do you here, with that the said Corporal returned answer, that he came to be Interpreter to him the said Deponent; whereupon he the said Lieutenant Governour, took down a Pistol that hung by the wall, and threatned to shoot him the said Corporal, and drove him out of the Room, and that afterwards the said Deponent remaining still in the said Room alone with the said Lieutenant Governour, the said Lieutenant Governour told him the said Deponent, that there were so many Rogues in the Town, that he was not sure of his life, nor to walk the streets, and that he the said Lieutenant Governour farther said, that before it should longer go after this manner, he would set the Town on Fire, and further saith not.</p>
