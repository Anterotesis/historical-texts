            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

dealing,</hi> as he ſhould have done. The Compaſſion of God unto His Poor, Frail, Diſtreſſed Servant on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was wonderful! Had the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Abimelek</hi> to Marry this Lady, been accompliſhed, he had been plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a Criminal <hi>Adultery;</hi> A Crime whereof, as much a <hi>Pagan</hi> as he was, he yet own'd, <hi>It would have been a Great Sin upon him, and upon his Government.</hi> But while the Sin was yet only intended, and under the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviating Circumſtance of, <hi>A miſtake of the Perſon</hi> too, God ſmote <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek</hi> with a Fit of Illneſs, and his <hi>Court</hi> alſo with <hi>Plagues</hi> which had in them ſomething Extraordinary. While he was in much concern about theſe things, God in a <hi>Dream</hi> informed him of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> why theſe <hi>Plagues</hi> were come, &amp; of the way to remove them. In the XXXIII Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> you have a large Paragraph, concerning a <hi>Dream</hi> wherein <hi>God withdraws a man from his purpoſe;</hi> And I ſuſpect, that this Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Abimelek</hi> might be therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001626_0021_0FB3E0C56B88F560"/>
unto. The only Clauſe of the Hiſtory, now to be inſiſted on, is, that Paſſage in the Speech of God, unto the <hi>Awakened Soul</hi> of the Prince now in a <hi>Dream,</hi> wherein He <hi>ſpoke once, yea, twice unto him;</hi> He ſays, <hi>I with-held thee from Sinning against me.</hi> It is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as a Singular <hi>Kindnſs,</hi> a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Kindneſs</hi> of God unto him. The <hi>Trouble</hi> that he ſuffered, was it ſeems a vaſt <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> in that it <hi>with-held him from Sinning,</hi> againſt the Glorious God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, in the Text I told you of, <hi>To keep back his Soul from the Pit, and his Life from periſhing by the Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The DOCTRINE then before us, will be this;</p>

                     <head>The most Gracious God, in an excellent manner diſplays his Grace towards the Sinful Children of Men, in with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from Sinning againſt him.</head>

a preſervation, that, my Brethren, we cannot be too Thankful for.</p>
                     <p>Two things now demand a moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Conſideration with us; Firſt the <hi>Method,</hi> and then the <hi>Mercy,</hi> of this Happineſs, <hi>I with-held thee from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I. The <hi>Method</hi> of our Good God, in <hi>With-holding us from Sinning against him;</hi> This is various, and curious, and has many Wonders in it. We will take the Surprizing Subject into our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt; Our Good God <hi>With-holds</hi> the <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Occaſions</hi> of <hi>Sin;</hi> This is one <hi>Method</hi> in which <hi>He with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds us from Sinning againſt him</hi> There is an Army of <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Leader, for which cauſe they all go under the ſingle Name of, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> or, <hi>The Devil.</hi> The Deſign of theſe <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> is to Tempt us unto <hi>Sin,</hi> that ſo they may by their <hi>Temptations</hi> bring us under <hi>their Condemnation.</hi> Our <hi>Tempter,</hi> the <hi>Devil, goes about,</hi> ſeeking
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001626_0023_0FB3E0C865891D98"/>
whom he may Deceive into Sin, &amp; by Deceiving <hi>Devour</hi> them. As our Lord ſaid, Luk. XXII. 31. <hi>Simon, Simon, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you:</hi> So may it more or leſs be ſaid, about every man in the World; <hi>Sinner, Sinner, Satan the Tempter hath deſired, that he may have thee, to Tempt thee unto ſome undoing Wickedneſs.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Satan</hi> muſt have the permiſſion of God for it, before he can fall upon us. But now our God very often does not permit <hi>Satan,</hi> to Tempt us with ſuch Fury, and ſuch Succeſs, as he would otherwiſe aſſault us withal. Our God has the Tempter in a <hi>Chain;</hi> He holds in the <hi>Ty-'Dog.</hi> He <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds</hi> the <hi>Tempter</hi> from Enſnaring of us, and thereby He <hi>witholds</hi> us from falling into the <hi>Snare of the Wicked.</hi> There are <hi>People ſet upon miſchief.</hi> 'Tis very ſtrange that they do no more. 'Tis becauſe God <hi>Chains up the Devil,</hi> and won't let him ſuggeſt unto them, what they may do. Our <hi>Indians</hi> had elſe done a thouſand times more miſchief,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001626_0024_0FB3E0CAFA27F468"/>
than they have, to our Plantations. This <hi>World</hi> is alſo full of thoſe Things, which are the <hi>Occaſions,</hi> the <hi>Incentives,</hi> the <hi>Inducements</hi> of <hi>Sin.</hi> The <hi>Stumbling Block: of Iniquity</hi> do even fill the World. But our God <hi>with-holds us from Sin,</hi> by <hi>with-holding</hi> from us, thoſe things that would <hi>provoke</hi> us to Sin. He takes the <hi>Stumbling-blocks</hi> out of our way, &amp; <hi>ſo witholds</hi> us from Falling into Sin upon them. Our God <hi>witholds</hi> us from the exorbitant Out-breakings of the <hi>Luſt of the Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Lust of the Eye,</hi> and the <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> by <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding</hi> from us the Objects, that are the <hi>Fuel</hi> of them. We ſay, <hi>'Tis oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that makes a Thief.</hi> Our God <hi>witholds</hi> many a man from many a <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>Employments,</hi> &amp; ſome <hi>Companions,</hi> which He <hi>witholds</hi> from them, Verily, they would be drawn into abundance of Sin, more than they are.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>Diverting</hi> of us from Sin, by the Good Hand of God, this is one <hi>Method</hi> uſed by our Good God in <hi>witholding</hi> us from Sin. We ſhould Sin more than we do, but our God <hi>witholds</hi> us, by finding ſomething elſe for us to do. One gave this agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Account<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> how he kept his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; <hi>The Devil don't find me at Lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to do what he would have me to do.</hi> Infuriated <hi>Saul</hi> would have Embrued his hands in the Blood of a Servant of God, but <hi>God call'd him off!</hi> We read, 1 Sam. XXIII. 27. <hi>There came a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger unto Saul, ſaying, Haſte thee, and come away:</hi>—You know for what. Many ſuch a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> comes unto us from God, that calls us another way, when we are juſt upon ſome ſinful perpetrations. The <hi>Flood</hi> ſeems to have been as notable, as General, an Example of this Obſervation. The
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001626_0026_0FB3E0CDAC287180"/>
                        <hi>Curſe</hi> of the <hi>Flood,</hi> is in this turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> on the World. The more fructifying mould of the Earth, has been ſo damnified by the <hi>Flood,</hi> that men live now with more Difficulty than they did before. No man that knows the Heart of man, will deny, that a <hi>Flood of Wickedneſs</hi> is prevented in the World, by mens being ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily taken up how to Live in the World. What <hi>infinite Wickedneſs</hi> would men be hatching every where, if they had nothing elſe to do! If the World had nothing but <hi>Fruitful Plains</hi> in it, it would ſoon be an Entire <hi>Sodom,</hi> and fit for nothing but a <hi>Conflagration.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our God <hi>witholds</hi> us from <hi>Sin,</hi> when he <hi>Compels</hi> us to <hi>Work.</hi> For the moſt part, our God plunges us into ſuch indigent Circumſtances, that the moſt of our <hi>Thought,</hi> and our <hi>Time,</hi> goes to the <hi>Earning of our Bread.</hi> By Engaging us in our daily <hi>Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> without which we and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies would ſtarve, Our God <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds us from Sinning againſt Him.</hi> And
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001626_0027_0FB3E0CF25531590"/>
ſometimes when our <hi>Vocations</hi> are not enough to Engroſs our Care, and <hi>withold us from Sin,</hi> our <hi>Vexations</hi> muſt; God finds out for us <hi>Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> that ſhall. One man is hamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a <hi>Malady;</hi> another man is Embroiled with ſuch an <hi>Enemy;</hi> a third man is taken up with ſuch an <hi>Inconvenience.</hi> Why ſo; The Voice of the All-wiſe God unto us in theſe things is, <hi>Thus I witheld thee from Sinning against me!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly; <hi>Interest, Intereſt;</hi> That is a Surpriſing <hi>Method</hi> of God; That is a ſtrong ſort of a <hi>Curb,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our God <hi>Witholds us from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt Him.</hi> The Metal which the <hi>Curb</hi> is uſually made of, is well known in the World. We ſay, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt will not Ly;</hi> tho' it will often make men do it. Every man is <hi>True</hi> to that, which he takes to be his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</hi> This is a moſt Exquiſite <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Heaven,</hi> as I may call it, in the Government of the World. <hi>Humane Society,</hi> would be Damaged, yea, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001626_0028_0FB3E0D0A4DF7FB8"/>
if ſome Sins were not become very <hi>odious,</hi> which yet men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally enough prone unto; It is <hi>Interest</hi> that has made them <hi>Odious;</hi> men feel 'tis for their <hi>Interest</hi> that they ſhould be ſo. God makes the Tranſgreſſors feel that word; Hab. II. 9, 10. <hi>Wo to him that Coveteth an Evil Covetouſneſs; Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thy ſelf.</hi> God makes men ſee, that by ſuch and ſuch Sins, they ſhall bring a Miſchief on themſelves; This <hi>witholds them from Sinning againſt Him!</hi> There is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Generation of men, who go under the Name of <hi>Deists.</hi> Theſe Dangerous Wretches pretend unto a kind of <hi>Moral Vertue;</hi> Their <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> is this; A man expects the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities</hi> of his Neighbours; his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be inſupportable ſhould his Neighbours count him unworthy of their <hi>Civilities.</hi> Now, that a man may not Loſe the <hi>Civilities</hi> of others, he muſt then treat them with <hi>Civilities.</hi> Theſe are all the <hi>Bonds of a Good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,</hi> that theſe Baptiſed Infidels
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001626_0029_0FB3E0D3AD483960"/>
are ſenſible of. This is all, that keeps the Dangerous <hi>Monsters,</hi> from Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Lying, and Murder. Our God <hi>witholds men from Sin,</hi> by making them ſee, that their Neighbours will elſe <hi>withold</hi> their <hi>Civilities</hi> from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tis the Hope of <hi>Gain,</hi> by their ſhow of ſome <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> that witholds many men from the Groſſeſt Efforts of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly. There is the Method of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> Our God <hi>witholds us from Sin,</hi> by the Controul of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which He has placed as His <hi>Deputy</hi> in our Souls. Men durſt not Sin as they would, becauſe of what the <hi>Candle of the Lord</hi> ſhows unto them; they can't Sin except they <hi>put</hi> out <hi>this Candle.</hi> A <hi>Conſcience</hi> which tells them, That they who <hi>do ſuch things are worthy of Death;</hi> The <hi>Conſcience</hi> which cauſes a Wicked man, to do what no <hi>other man</hi> could bring him to; Act. XXIV. 25. <hi>To Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> at the Thoughts of a <hi>Judgment to come.</hi> That ſtands in the way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man, like an <hi>Angel</hi> with a Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001626_0030_0FB3E0D527D50968"/>
Sword, and ſtops him, when his <hi>Way is perverſe before the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And our God, by ordering a <hi>Good Education</hi> for us, keeps our <hi>Conſcience</hi> in a more <hi>Wakeful</hi> and <hi>Active</hi> Plight; ſo that we cannot get over the <hi>Checks</hi> which it gives unto us. This <hi>Light within,</hi> tho' it be ſo darkened that it is not a <hi>ſufficient Guide unto Life,</hi> yet it ſhows us, many <hi>Fair</hi> Things, and like a <hi>Fire</hi> it ſcalds us if we do any <hi>Foul</hi> ones. The Supream Governour of the World holds the World in order by this <hi>Golden Engine,</hi> &amp; <hi>witholds</hi> men from very much of the Diſorder which elſe they would ruſh into. Many a man would Murder his Parents, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his own Wife, Debauch his Neighbours, Blaſpheme God, Burn down the Town, and run a muck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, if ſome <hi>Conſcience</hi> did not <hi>withold men from Sinning</hi> at ſuch a rate of Outrageous Madneſs. The men who proclaim it, that they have ſhaken off the Regards of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and ſuppreſſed &amp; ſmothered
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001626_0031_0FB3E0D6AABE5E18"/>

II. A Leſſon of Wondrous <hi>Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is to be now taught unto thoſe, whom God has <hi>Witheld from Sinning</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him. Sirs, You are <hi>Thankful,</hi> no doubt, that you have been <hi>Witheld</hi> from Things that would have brought <hi>Sickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> upon you, or Things that would have wounded you with incureable <hi>Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;</hi> That you have been <hi>Witheld</hi> from <hi>Wants</hi> and <hi>Straits,</hi> by which your <hi>Lives</hi> would have been Embittered; That you have been <hi>Witheld</hi> from <hi>grievous Deaths,</hi> by frightful Accidents which have threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened them. You are very much to Blame, if you are not very <hi>Thankful</hi> for ſuch Deliverances; <hi>Unholy,</hi> if <hi>Unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!</hi> But are you <hi>Thankful</hi> that you have been <hi>Witheld from Sinning</hi> againſt the Glorious GOD? This, O Redeemed Ones, This is a greater Cauſe for <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> than any of the reſt. It may be, ſome of you have been all your Dayes hitherto upheld, and <hi>witheld</hi> from doing any Thing, of a <hi>Scandalous</hi> Aſpect; Like the Young man in the Goſpel, You have been <hi>kept from your Youth up,</hi> from every Thing that may be called, <hi>Scandalous.</hi> Oh! Be very Thankful, for ſo rare a <hi>Mercy;</hi> ſo rich a <hi>Mercy!</hi> Or, if not ſo,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001626_0044_0FB3E0EAE211CD40"/>
yet you have been <hi>witheld</hi> from ſuch <hi>Scandals</hi> as you have ſeen <hi>Others</hi> fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. God has not Left you to make your ſelves <hi>Prodigies</hi> of Sin; God has not hang'd you up in Chains, among the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his Wrath;</hi> Others no worſe by Nature than you, have been ſo. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in <hi>This,</hi> you have Ground of <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi> Tis a <hi>Mercy</hi> of God; And a meer <hi>Mercy</hi> it is! Yea, My Hearers, I believe there are very few of you, but what may call to mind, that you have been at ſome Time or other, juſt upon the point of doing ſome very <hi>horrible Thing!</hi> You have been very violently puſh'd on, to do ſome <hi>horrible Thing,</hi> which if it had been <hi>done,</hi> you had been the moſt <hi>Undone</hi> Things in the World; <hi>Undone for Both Worlds!</hi> You may make that Report; Pſal. LXXIII. 2. <hi>As for me, my Feet were almoſt gone, my ſteps had will-nigh, ſlipt.</hi> But God ſtept in, and ſaved you. O fall down before the Lord, and thankfully admire ſo obliging a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> and ſay, <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul; I bleſs thee, O my God, for thou haſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my Soul, in delivering my Feet from the Falls I have been ſo near unto!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will make Two Remarks on the Gratitude which is now called for. The
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001626_0045_0FB3E0EC603D18F8"/>
One is this; In this thing it may ſo fall out, that you may give a ſhining Demonſtration of your <hi>Sincerity</hi> before the Lord. It may be, 'tis by ſome ſore and ſharp <hi>Affliction</hi> upon you, that God has <hi>Witheld you from Sinning againſt Him.</hi> Well, Can you now ſo far heartily give Thanks to God for this <hi>Affliction;</hi> and can you heartily ſay, <hi>Lord, I bleſs thee, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt rather, bind me in Affliction and Iron, and bring down my Heart with Labour, then let me run Looſe in the broad way that Leads unto Deſtruction!</hi> He was a Saint of God, who could ſay; Pſal. CXIX. 67, 71. <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray; but now I have kept thy Word. It is good for me, that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> O Thou Sin-hating Soul; This would be a mark of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> that would have no leſs than on <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Token of Salvation</hi> in it. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this; You muſt not fall into a Dream, that a <hi>Negative Religion,</hi> will be enough to ſecure your Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Many men, becauſe they have been <hi>Witheld</hi> from ſuch Things as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others are chargeable withal, they fancy they have <hi>Religion</hi> enough. They
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001626_0046_0FB3E0EDE7D5E428"/>
can ſay, <hi>I am not as other men, or as this Publican,</hi> and they fancy here is <hi>Religion</hi> enough to put them in Good Terms with Heaven. A very Grand Miſtake! You read; Matth. III. 10. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Tree that brings not forth Good Fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the Fire.</hi> Tis not enough, that you <hi>bring not forth Evil Fruit;</hi> You muſt <hi>bring forth Good Fruit;</hi> and by a Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Work of God upon you, be made <hi>Good Trees</hi> in order to it; You muſt not only be <hi>Witholden</hi> from <hi>Sin,</hi> but alſo be <hi>Converted</hi> from <hi>Sin;</hi> elſe you go into a <hi>Fire</hi> to be trembled at! Not only <hi>Sins of Commiſſion,</hi> but alſo <hi>Sins of Omiſſion,</hi> will expoſe you to it.</p>
                     <p>III. Certainly, it becomes us to do what we can, that <hi>Others</hi> as well as <hi>Our ſelves,</hi> may be <hi>Witheld</hi> from <hi>Sinning</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Glorious God. This is very plain; If the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God be great, in <hi>Witholding men from Sinning</hi> againſt Him, Then they who Seduce or Invite others to Sin, are the worſt <hi>Enemies</hi> they can have in the world. Yea, 'tis a <hi>Mercy</hi> to be <hi>Delivered from ſuch Unreaſonable men;</hi> to be kept out of the <hi>Paths</hi> of ſuch <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers!</hi> I will firſt ſay this; <hi>My Son,

Do ſo ſtill; and preſent before God, the <hi>Blood</hi> of a dear JESUS, for the Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your <hi>Bloody Murder,</hi> and of all the Sins, which have ſo provoked the Holy One, that He has not <hi>witheld</hi> you from it. That <hi>Blood</hi> is an <hi>Open Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> yea, <hi>Open</hi> for a <hi>Menaſſeh,</hi> and for a <hi>Murderer!</hi> A Country-man of yours, Executed for <hi>Murder,</hi> after his Flight unto that Soul-cleanſing Blood, went chearfully to his Execution; and often uſed thoſe words; <hi>God is a Great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver! God is a Great Forgiver!</hi> Verily, A Repenting <hi>David</hi> will find Him ſo.</p>
                     <p>I will inform the <hi>Auditory.</hi> This poor Young man tells me; He uſes all his <hi>power</hi> to turn unto God; but he finds he has no <hi>power,</hi> in himſelf; He looks up to God for <hi>power,</hi> and owns himſelf <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi> that God ſhould give it him. He tells me, He ſees his <hi>Heart</hi> full of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> and his <hi>Life</hi> all <hi>Iniquity;</hi> but he looks on all Sin as moſt <hi>odious,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>an Offence unto God.</hi> He tells me, That a <hi>Saviour</hi> appears to him, the <hi>beſt thine</hi> in the word; &amp; an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in Him worth a thouſand worlds. He tells me, That he deſires the <hi>Saviour</hi> to <hi>Reconcile.</hi> God unto him, and alſo to <hi>humble</hi> him,

and give a <hi>New Heart</hi> unto him, &amp; fill his Heart with the <hi>Love of God.</hi> He tells me, That the <hi>Hope</hi> he has of <hi>Mercy</hi> from God, <hi>breaks his Heart</hi> for him; &amp; makes him think, <hi>What he ſhall do for God.</hi> Particularly, He deſires, that his <hi>Sins</hi> may be <hi>known</hi> to all the World; &amp; that all the World may be warned from him, and <hi>witheld</hi> from Sinning againſt God. If all this be <hi>Hearty,</hi> 'tis well. <hi>Repentance</hi> in Diſtreſs, is often ſo <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,</hi> that, <hi>Young man,</hi> you cannot be too jealous of your own <hi>Heart,</hi> in yours.

ſay; <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> in a <hi>Woman,</hi> was as Criminal among them as <hi>Adultery.</hi> But now, it is ſaid; That there are <hi>Women</hi> in this Place who are no Strangers to the Sin, and Trade of <hi>Exceſſive Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi> The <hi>Town</hi> has had cauſe to know the Truth of this; Ah! Miſerable Women: The <hi>Blemiſh</hi> of their Sex: And ſuch as the Countrey may call, as one did his Daughter, the <hi>Ulcers</hi> of it! I can tell the Name of a Pious Woman, who was unjuſtly ſuſpected of being in Drink. That Handmaid of the Lord, in her Vindication cried out, <hi>No, I ſhould be a Daughter of Beliel, if I ſhould be guilty of ſuch a thing.</hi> To them who cannot ſo well Vindicate themſelves as <hi>Hannah</hi> could, I will ſay; <hi>How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy Strong Drink from thee!</hi> If thou art a <hi>Woman of a ſorrowful Spirit,</hi> inſtead of pouring in <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> Oh! Much rather, <hi>pour out thy Soul unto the Lord.</hi>

There are two or three things to be obſerved in the words. 1. The hainous Guilt of Murder. 2. That Deliverance from it is to be earneſtly ſought of God. 3. That God muſt have the Glory of ſuch Preſervation and Deliverance.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>That Murder is a Sin of a very hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and heavy guilt.</hi> So the <hi>Text</hi> ſpeaks of it; <hi>Blood-guiltineſs,</hi> or the guilt of <hi>Blood.</hi> A deep <hi>Stain,</hi> &amp; a deep <hi>Wound;</hi> whereby the Conſcience is gaſhed and defiled.</p>
                  <p>I will only look into the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and obſerve to you how it is forbidden and condemned therein. It cries from the Ground, and brings down Vengeance from Heaven. <hi>Cain</hi> was the firſt <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi> after the <hi>Devil,</hi> who was ſo from the beginning. <hi>He was of that Wicked One, and ſlew his Brother.</hi> Then God the Soveraign Judge ſaid to him; <hi>What haſt thou done? the voice of thy brothers blood crieth to me from the Ground; and now thou art curſed from the Earth, which has open'd her mouth to receive thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood from thy hand,</hi> Gen. 4. 10, 11. <q>Murder is a Crying Sin; it cries in the dying words of <hi>Zachariah, The Lord look upon it and require it:</hi> Or in thoſe

                  <p>Let no man think that this looks <hi>Cruel</hi> or <hi>Inhumane:</hi> The Juſtice of God has ſo fix'd it; Yea, his tender <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> to Mankind do account for this His Righteous Law and Judgment.

                  <p>No <hi>Humanity</hi> or Law of Mercy will allow us to deſire or endeavour the ſaving the life of him that is Convict of Murder.

                  <p>And as to <hi>Humane Society,</hi> the Sin of Murder ſtrikes at the very <hi>Being,</hi> and all the <hi>Comforts</hi> hereof.

                  <p>There were <hi>two</hi> things in the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> that were high Expreſſions of the Hainous Nature of <hi>Man-ſlaughter</hi> in the Account of God: The <hi>one</hi> was, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001626_0091_0FB3E13461F1BA50"/>
he that kill'd a man by <hi>Accident or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares</hi> was obliged to flee to ſome <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> where he muſt remain in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> from his own Houſe and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and in a kind of <hi>Priſon</hi> there, until the death of the <hi>High Prieſt.</hi> By which it is certain that God meant to teach us to conceive a dread and horror of the Guilt of Blood; in that tho' the Fact were not <hi>Voluntary,</hi> nor done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly; tho' it were but <hi>Chance-med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and <hi>Homicide per Infortunium,</hi> yet that the Man-ſlayer muſt incur ſo much danger, inconvenience and confinement. The <hi>other</hi> Argument of the Criminalneſs of Murder was, that if a <hi>Brute Creature</hi> happened at any time to kill a man, it was to be ſlain by the Hand of <hi>Juſtice, Exod.</hi> 21. 28, 29. <hi>If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, then the ox ſhall be ſurely ſtoned, and his fleſh ſhall not be eaten: but the owner of the ox ſhall be quit. But if the ox were wont to puſh with his horn in time paſt, and it hath been teſtified to his Owner: and he hath not kept him in: but that he hath killed a man or a woman, the ox ſhall be ſtoned, and his Owner alſo ſhall be put to Death.</hi> Here was another high Inſtance of Gods Care of the Life of Man, and of his Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>II.

1. <hi>There is Deliverance from Blood-guiltineſs to be obtained from God.</hi> And that of two ſorts. 1. To be <hi>kept</hi> from the Bloody Guilt. 2. The <hi>Pardon and Forgiveneſs</hi> of it when contracted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We may by the Divine Reſtraining Grace be kept from the Commiſſion of the Sin of Murder;</hi> and this is a <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Deliverance</hi> from Blood-guiltineſs. We are thro' Grace all of us (I truſt) one only excepted, free of this Guilt; and ever ſhall be ſo. But then it is <hi>God that has</hi> kept, prevented and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from it; and He muſt <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after</hi> keep us, or we ſhall fall into it. For we are <hi>Incident</hi> to it thro' the <hi>horrid Corruption</hi> that is in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the very beſt of us are by no means our own <hi>Keepers.</hi> There is no Sin, but what the <hi>vile and curſed nature</hi> of man is prone to, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; and the ſame vile Nature is <hi>common</hi> to us all. <hi>Eſau</hi> had Murder in his heart, when he came out againſt his Brother <hi>Jacob;</hi> and ſo had <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren, when they caſt him into the <hi>Pit;</hi> but God kept them however from it. GOD left <hi>David</hi> to fall into it, to ſhew him the wickedneſs that was in his heart. GOD left <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001626_0096_0FB3DF0E999CA018"/>
Joab</hi> and <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> to fall into it, on one temptation or another. Are we <hi>Better</hi> by Nature than they? No, but God has kept us from their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Reſtrained us when tempted. When the Prophet of the Lord told <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> of the Murders, Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Barbarities which he would in time commit againſt <hi>Iſrael;</hi> He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with deteſtation, <hi>But what? is thy Servant a Dog, that he ſhould do this great thing?</hi> ſuch abhorred &amp; enormous wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs: Yet he did it afterward; like a dog he <hi>rent</hi> and <hi>tore</hi> and <hi>devoured;</hi> He prov'd as much a <hi>brute</hi> and beaſt of <hi>prey,</hi> how impoſſible ſoever he before-hand tho't it of himſelf. And indeed the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Paſſions,</hi> &amp; <hi>Wraths</hi> of men are ſo <hi>violent;</hi> that it is a <hi>wonder</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Reſtraining Grace, &amp; a marvellous <hi>Inſtance</hi> of the Power and Providence of God that there are not many <hi>Murders</hi> to one committed in the World.

                  <p>We ſee a <hi>Miſerable Perſon</hi> preſent, whom God has left to the great Sin of Murder, while you and I are kept from it? <hi>but who maketh thee to differ?</hi> Art thou <hi>better</hi> than he?

But God has had <hi>Mercy on thee,</hi> &amp; not ſuffered thee to <hi>act</hi> thy own curſed <hi>Will.</hi> O <hi>adore</hi> the Soveraign Providence of God! <hi>Behold, the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Severity of God!</hi> to him that is fallen, <hi>Severity,</hi> but to thee <hi>Goodneſs!</hi> Is he a greater Sinner, than ſome of us? <hi>I tell thee nay, but except you repent, you ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>

                  <p>Other <hi>great Sins</hi> do expoſe and lead to this of <hi>Murder;</hi> by <hi>debauching,</hi> harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſearing the Conſcience; and by <hi>provoking</hi> God to give people up to their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
