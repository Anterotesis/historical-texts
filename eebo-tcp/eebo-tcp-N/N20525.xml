            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IN the Pariſh of Greenfield, in the Town of Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, in Connecticut, there is a pleaſant and beautiful eminence, called Greenfield Hill; at the diſtance of three miles from Long-Island Sound. On this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, there is a ſmall but handſome Village, a Church, Academy, &amp;c. all of them alluded to in the following Poem. From the higheſt part of the eminence, the eye is preſented with an extenſive and delightful proſpect of the ſurrounding Country, and of the Sound. On this height, the Writer is ſuppoſed to ſtand. The First object, there offering itſelf to his view, is the Landſcape; which is accordingly made the governing ſubject of the Firſt Part of the Poem. The flouriſhing and happy condition of the Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants very naturally ſuggeſted itſelf next; and became of courſe, the ſubject of the Second Part. The Town of Fairfield, lying in full view, and, not long before the Poem was begun, and in a great meaſure written out, burnt by a party of Britiſh Troops, under the command of Governor Tryon, furniſhed the theme of the Third Part. A Field, called the
<pb n="06" facs="unknown:026925_0004_0FD2301CF015BCF8"/>
Pequod Swamp, in which, moſt of the warriors of that nation, who ſurvived the invaſion of their country by Capt. Maſon, were deſtroyed, lying about three miles from the eminence abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and on the margin of the Sound, ſuggested not unnaturally, the ſubject of the Fourth Part.</p>
            <p>As the writer is the Miniſter of Greenfield, he cannot be ſuppoſed to be unintereſted in the welfare of his Pariſhioners. To excite their attention to the truths and duties of Religion (an object in ſuch a ſituation, inſtinctively riſing to his view,) is the deſign of the Fifth Part; And to promote in them juſt ſentiments and uſeful conduct, for the preſent life, (an object cloſely connected with the preceding one) of the Sixth.</p>
            <p>Many of the ſubjects, mentioned in the Poem, and ſuggested by the general ſtate of this Country, eaſily led a contemplative mind to look forward, and call up to view its probable ſituation at a diſtant approaching period. The ſolid foundations, which appear to be laid for the future greatneſs and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the American Republic, offered very pleaſing views of this ſubject to a Poet; and of theſe the writer has, in the Seventh Part of the Work, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to avail himſelf.</p>
            <p>To contribute to the innocent amuſement of his countrymen, and to their improvement in manners, and in oeconomical, political, and moral ſentiments, is
<pb n="07" facs="unknown:026925_0005_0FD265120C099AA0"/>
the object which the writer wiſhes to accompliſh. As he is firmly perſuaded, that his countrymen are furniſhed by Providence with as extenſive and advantageous means of proſperity, as the world has hitherto ſeen, ſo he thinks it the duty and the intereſt of every citizen, to promote it, by all the means in his power. Poetry appears to him to be one, among the probable means of advancing this purpoſe. "Allow me to make the Songs of a nation," ſaid a wiſe man, "and who will may make their Laws." Poetry may not, perhaps, produce greater effects in promoting the proſperity of mankind, than philoſophy; <note n="*" place="bottom">See Lowth's Lectures on Heb. Po.</note> but the effects which it produces, are far from being ſmall. Where truth requires little illuſtration, and only needs to be ſet in a ſtrong and affecting light, Poetry appears to be as advantageous an inſtrument of making uſeful impreſſions, as can be eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. It will be read by many perſons, who would ſcarcely look at a logical diſcuſſion; by moſt readers it will be more deeply felt, and more laſtingly remembered; and, to ſay the leaſt, it will, in the preſent caſe, be an unuſual, and for that reaſon may be a forcible method of treating ſeveral ſubjects, handled in this Poem.</p>
            <p>When the writer began the work, he had no deſign of publiſhing it; aiming merely to amuſe his own mind, and to gain a temporary relief from the
<pb n="08" facs="unknown:026925_0006_0FD23020D0D70130"/>
preſſure of melancholy. Hence it was dropped, at an early period; when other avocations, or amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments preſented themſelves. The greater part of it was written ſeven years ago. Additions have been made to it, at different periods, from that time to the preſent—This will account for the dates of ſeveral things mentioned in it, which would otherwiſe ſeem to be improperly connected.</p>
            <p>Originally the writer deſigned to imitate, in the ſeveral parts, the manner of as many Britiſh Poets; but finding himſelf too much occupied, when he projected the publication, to purſue that deſign, he relinquiſhed it. The little appearance of ſuch a deſign, ſtill remaining, was the reſult of diſtant and general recollection. Much, of that nature, he has rejected, and all he would have rejected, had not even that rejection demanded more time than he could afford for ſuch a purpoſe. Theſe facts will, he hopes, apologize to the reader, for the mixed manner which he may, at times, obſerve in the performance.</p>

THE ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN the beginning of July 1779, the Britiſh, under the command of Sir George Collyer, and Governor Tryon, plundered New-Haven. Thence they ſailed to Fairfield, plundered, and burned it. Eighty-five dwelling houſes, two churches, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome court houſe, ſeveral ſchool houſeſ, together with a great number of barns, out-houſes, &amp;c. were conſumed by the fire. Many other houſes were ſet on fire; but were extinguiſhed by the returning inhabitants. The diſtreſs, occaſioned by this act of wanton barbarity, is inconceivable; and the name of Governor Tryon will, on account of it, be remembered with the moſt finiſhed deteſtation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From l. 1, to l. 283, the ſtory is related. The reader is then addreſſed with a repreſentation of the happineſs deſtroyed at Fairfield, and with an account of the prevalence of war, in ancient, and in modern times; its nature and its effects on the morals and happineſs of mankind. This addreſs extends to l, 547, and is ſucceeded by an Addreſs to the Hero, returning victorious from war. He is firſt preſented with a picture of the miſeries of war, on the land; and is then conducted to the ſhore, to take a ſurvey of maritime war.—Death—Speech of Death—Motives to abſtain from war—and Concluſion.</hi>

One of their number loitering behind the reſt, was diſcovered by the Engliſh troops, then commanded by Captain Stoughton, of the Maſſachuſetts; and was compelled to diſcloſe their retreat. One hundred of them, it is ſaid, ſurrendered. The reſt, bravely reſolving to live and die together, were attacked, and chiefly deſtroyed <note n="*" place="bottom">See Neale's Hiſt. N.

THE ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SUBJECT introduced. Deſcription of a happy village in New England. Character of the Clergyman. He gives his laſt advice, and bleſſing, to his Pariſhioners—recites his paſt, affectionate and faithful labours for their ſalvation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to cloſe them with his laſt exhortation—eſtimates the pleaſures of ſin, and the value of the preſent life, and urges them to ſeek eternal life—informs them, that two endleſs journeys lie before them—of virtue, which guides to happineſs; and of ſin, which terminates in miſery—and deſcribes the nature of both. As means of ſalvation, be exhorts them to read the Bible, with diligence and care; to frequent public worſhip; to eſtabliſh family religion, in their houſes: religiouſly to educate their children; and to abound in all the duties of charity. He further informs them, that all things are labouring to promote this great purpoſe; recites to them the affectionate invitations of the Redeemer; and repreſents his own future happineſs, as increaſed by their ſalvation. Concluſion.</hi>

            <head>NOTES TO PART I.</head>
            <p>LINE 42. The pariſh of Greenfield conſiſts of about thirteen ſquare miles. On this little tract were found, at the time of the late cenſus, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fourteen hundred inhabitants: a population as great, as that of Britain, if the accounts which I have ſeen, of the extent and population of that country, are juſt. The people of Greenfield are almoſt all Farmers, and have no advantages for ſupport, beſides thoſe which are common to N. England in general. Thus without any peculiar aſſiſtance from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, or manufacturing, an immenſe population can exiſt on the mere labours of the huſbandman. The people of Greenfield, alſo, very generally abound in the neceſſaries and comforts of life. Such are the effects of an equal diviſion of property, and of the cultivation of lands by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors.</p>
            <p>L. 85. No country has been more unjuſtly or contemptibly ſlandered, than New England.</p>
            <p>L. 94. [Firms.] I have ventured to uſe this word, as a verb. It appeared to me better to expreſs the idea intended, than any other word, which I could recollect.</p>
            <p>L. 177. A remarkable proof of the mildneſs of manners, in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, exiſted during the late war. The inhabitants were at leaſt as much divided, and as directly oppoſed, both in opinion and conduct, as thoſe of France; and through a much longer period. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>January</hi> 1, 1793.</note> Yet not one perſon was put to death by the hand of violence, and but one by the hand of civil juſtice, during an eight years war, and in a country containing a million of inhabitants.</p>
            <p>L. 215. The State of Connecticut exhibits the moſt uniform and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed manners, to be found in New England; and thoſe, which may, with the greateſt propriety, be called the national manners of that country.</p>
            <p>L. 223. The happineſs of the inhabitants of Connecticut appears, like their manners, morals, and government, to exceed any thing, of which the Eaſtern continent could ever boaſt. A thorough and impartial deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopement of the ſtate of ſociety, in Connecticut, and a complete inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſources of its happineſs, would probably throw more light on the true methods of promoting the intereſts of mankind, than all the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of philoſophy, which have been written. The cauſes, which have already produced happineſs, will ever produce it. To facts alone, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:026925_0156_0FD26646171B15B8"/> 
ought we to reſort, if we would obtain this important knowledge. Theories are uſually mere dreams; fitted to amuſe, not to inſtruct; and Philoſophers, at leaſt political ones, are uſually mere Theoriſts. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of the early Coloniſts of New England ſaw farther into political ſubjects, thoſe at leaſt, which are of great importance to human happineſs, than all the Philoſophers, who have written ſince the world began.</p>
            <p>L 225. Nothing can be more viſionary, than many modern Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic opinions, concerning government. All human ſyſtems, reſpecting practical ſubjects, unleſs derived from facts, will ever be viſionary, and deſerve to be cla<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed with ſubſtantial forms, ſubtil matter, and atomic ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to exertion. Man is wholly unable, by mere contemplation, to bring into his view a number of principles ſufficient to conſtitute a theory, which can conſiſt with practice. One would imagine, that the univerſal fate of hypothetical philoſophy muſt long ſince have taught ingenious men this obvious truth; but the pleasure of making, and defending, ſyſtems, is ſo great, that ſuch men are ſtill employed in building air-caſtles, and in ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly expecting to inhabit them.</p>
            <p>L. 234. If gentlemen, who are natives of Europe, ſhould think this paragraph harſh, or unfounded, the writer requeſts them ſo far to turn their attention to the ſeveral facts, mentioned in it, as to ſatisfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether the aſcription be juſt, or erroneous. The natives of Great Britain, particularly, will find, in diſtinguiſhed writers of that country, deſcriptions of Britiſh ſociety, warranting all, that is aſſerted in this poem: deſcriptions confirmed, ſo far, at leaſt, as the author's acquaintance has extended, by thoſe Americans, who have travelled into Britain. The <hi>Tuſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> one of the moſt ſenſible and valuable performances, in the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is alone a ſufficient juſtification of no ſmall part of what is here declared.</p>
            <p>L. 247. It is, perhaps, not to be wondered at, that the ſtate of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, lately exiſting in France, ſhould be followed by extenſive and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous infidelity; but that ſuch a ſpeech as that ſaid to be uttered, Dec. 1792, by Citizen Dupont, ſhould have been ſpoken by any man, on any occaſion, and before any audience, would hardly have been believed, unleſs publiſhed with high authentication. That it ſhould have been uttered by a man, characterized as a man of weight and influence, is ſtill more aſtoniſhing: and that it ſhould have been received, by the Legiſlative Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of a great Nation, with applauſe, is a Tact, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it ſhould, unhappily, for the honour of human nature, be banded to poſterity, will probably be regarded rather as a Provencal legend, than as a reality. Of the like contemptible character are the later declarations of Citizen La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croix, on the petition of the Quakers and Anabaptiſts; in which are the following words. "The Conſtitution is my Goſpel, and Liberty is my God. I know no other" Theſe gentlemen appear ambitious of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valling the character of Aretine, on whoſe tomb this inſcription is ſaid to have been written.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Here lies Aretine,</l>
               <l>Who ſpoke evil of every one,</l>
               <l>But his God;</l>
               <l>And in this he muſt be excuſed,</l>
               <l>Becauſe he did not know him.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>L. 248. I have ſeen a memorial, ſaid to be preſented to his Britiſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council, of London;
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:026925_0157_0FD26629A85539D0"/>
in which they declare, that within ten years, 4,800 perſons had, in that city, been convicted of felony. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>In the Lent circuit</hi> (1786) 286 <hi>perſons were capitally convicted in England; and from</hi> 960 <hi>to</hi> 1000 <hi>convicts are now annually transported from that country.</hi>
               </note> In New England, which contains more inhabitants than London, it is to be questioned, whether, in any ten years, ſince it was ſettled by the Engliſh, there have been ten persons convicted of felony. A partial account, for this enormous diſproportion, may be found in the mildneſs of the laws of New England, which are far leſs ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary, than thoſe of Great Britain. It may alſo be juſtly obſerved, that London is a city of enormous wealth, and enormous poverty, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral receptacle of ſharpers and villains from the whole Britiſh empire; as well as from ſeveral other countries. But it is alſo to be remembered, that a great proportion of the felons, convicted in New England, are natives of Europe. It is probable that the ſubject cannot be explained in any manner, which will not involve, as its principal cauſes, the very great difference, in the reſpective places, to be found in the univerſality of happineſs, and in the purity of morals.</p>
            <p>L. 267. [See every heart, &amp;c.] The faſhions of Europe, eſpecially of Britain and France, ſuit neither the climate, the convenience, the policy, the property<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the character, of this country. The changes of climate in this country require modes of dreſſing very different from thoſe, which are healthful in France and England. The Americans are generally people of buſineſs, and, of courſe, muſt be greatly and continually incommoded by an adoption of many foreign faſhions. Our policy naturally teaches us to reject all ſervile imitation of the manners of other countries; and all conſtant imitation is attended with ſervility. The dignified character of free republicans ought to lead them to deſpiſe a perpetual change in the figure of dreſs; to-aim only at ſuch modes as are convenient, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in them; to ſhew their independence, in the choice of their own modes, and their ingenuity in the invention of them; and to manifeſt a total ſuperiority to the miſerable frippery of artificial ſociety. In the mean time, our pecuniary circumſtances would be advantageouſly conſulted, by the adoption of dreſs, in all reſpects ſuch as might well conſiſt with our general mediocrity of wealth. The Friends appear to ſhew much good ſenſe on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>L. 279. War has exiſted, in ſome, or other, of the countries of Europe, 75 years, out of the 92, which have elapſed, ſince the beginning of the preſent century; a century boaſted of, as the moſt enlightened, refined, and humane, within the knowledge of mankind. The cauſes of theſe wars have; alſo; been generally ſuch; as ought to cover the authors of them with deep and perpetual infamy.</p>
            <p>L. 296. Few objects more demand the attention of men of influence, in this country, than the eſtabliſhment of national manners. That much may be done, for this purpoſe, will not, I preſume, be queſtioned, There are but two, or three countries, in the United States, in which the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have any thing like a general uniformity: the low country of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, the low country of South Carolina, and New England. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Virginia and South Carolina cannot be eaſily continued, without the continuance of the Negro ſlavery; an event, which can ſcarcely be expected. The manners of New England appear to be rapidly ſpreading through the American republic; the natives of that country being generally
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:026925_0158_0FD2664762992D80"/>
even more tenacious of their manners, when abroad, than when at home. When the enterprize, induſtry, oeconomy, morals, and happineſs, of New England, eſpecially of Connecticut, are attentively conſidered, the patriotic mind will perhaps find much more reaſon to rejoice in this proſpect, than to regret it.</p>
            <p>L. 297. [Think whence this weal aroſe.] The peculiar proſperity of New England in general, and particularly of Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut, undoubtedly ariſes from the equal diviſion of property, the univerſal eſtabliſhment of ſchools, and their peculiar manner of ſupporting the goſpel.</p>

            <head>NOTES TO PART II.</head>
            <p>LINE 1. This part of the poem, though appropriated to the pariſh of Greenfield, may be conſidered as a general deſcription of the towns and villages of New England; thoſe only excepted, which are either commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, new, or ſituated on a barren ſoil. Moroſe and gloomy perſons, and perhaps ſome others, may think the deſcription too highly coloured. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of moderation and candour may poſſibly think otherwiſe. In its full extent, the writer ſuppoſes it applicable to the beſt inhabitants only; but he believes the number of theſe to be great: to others he thinks it partially applicable. Poetical repreſentations are uſually eſteemed flattering; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly this is as little ſo, as moſt of them. The inhabitants of New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, notwithſtanding ſome modern inſtances of declension, are, at leaſt in the Writer's opinion, a ſingular example of virtue and happineſs.</p>
            <p>It will be eaſily diſcovered by the reader, that this part of the poem is deſigned to illuſtrate the effects of the ſtate of property, which is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part to that, ſo beautifully exhibited by Dr. Goldſmith, in the Deſerted Village. That excellent writer, in a moſt intereſting manner, diſplays the wretched condition of the many, where enormous wealth, ſplendour, and luxury, conſtitute the ſtate of the few. In this imperfect attempt, the writer wiſhed to exhibit the bleſſings, which flow from an equal diviſion of property, and a general competence.</p>
            <p>Wherever an <hi>equal diviſion of property</hi> is mentioned, in the Work, the Reader is requeſted to remember, that that ſtate of things only is intended, in which every citizen is ſecured in the avails of his induſtry and prudence, and in which property deſcends, by law, in equal ſhares, to the proprietor's children.</p>

            <p>L. 237. If we conſider how few inducements the blacks have to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, or worthy efforts, we ſhall more wonder, that there are, among them, ſo many, than that there are ſo few, examples of ingenuity or amiableneſs.</p>

That inferiors, in ſubordination, are bound to obey all, even the unjuſt and immoral commands of their ſuperiors, and that the inferior is; in this conduct, juſtifiable, and the ſuperior alone guilty, is ſtill not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently aſſerted, and therefore probably believed. When it ſhall be right to do evil, that good may come, when crimes and virtuous actions, with the guilt, and the merit, of them ſhall become transferable, when man ſhall ceaſe to be accountable to his MAKER, and when GOD ſhall no more rule, with rightful authority, over his own creatures, this doctrine will probably reſt on a more ſolid baſis.</p>
            <p>L. 181. None of the numerous and horrid evils of war is more wanton, more uſeleſs, and more indicative of the worſt character, than burning. No nation, by which it is either allowed, or done, ought to make a claim to humanity, or civilization.</p>

Two churches, 135 dwelling houſes, with a proportional number of other buildings, were deſtroyed, at Norwalk. Eight other towns, in the United States, experienced the ſame fate; and while immenſe evil was done to the inhabitants, no benefit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued, as none plainly could accrue, to their enemies.</p>
            <p>L. 365. It is probable, that more of human labour, ingenuity, and property has been expended in the various buſineſs of deſtruction, than in all the arts, by which peace and happineſs have been promoted.</p>
            <p>L. 405. Every perſon, acquainted with the hiſtory of the Romans, knows that the temple of Janus was ſhut, whenever they were in a ſtate of peace, and that this happened but twice, during the firſt 750 years of their national exiſtence. Mankind in general have been engaged in war, with almoſt as little intermiſſion.</p>
            <p>It would be worth the labour of ſome friend to mankind, to preſent the public with a complete view of the time, during which war has exiſted in Europe, ſince the deſtruction of the Roman empire; the number of nations concerned in each war; the ſums expended; the debts incurred; the ſoldiers, ſailors, and citizens, deſtroyed; the cities towns, and villages, burnt, plundered, and ruined; the miſeries, known to be ſuffered; the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable cauſes of the reſpective wars; and the gain reſulting to the reſpective combatants. Thoſe, who have acceſs to large libraries would probably find, in them, much of the information, neceſſary to a deſign of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

               <pb n="176" facs="unknown:026925_0162_0FD2664CF8F008D8"/>
L. 487. The injury, done by war, to the morals of a country, is inferior to none of the evils, which it ſuffers. A century is inſufficient to repair the moral waſte of a ſhort war.</p>
            <p>L. 553. [Go then, ah go.] It is probable, that whenever mankind ſhall ceaſe to make war, this moſt deſirable event will ariſe from the general oppoſition, made to war, by the common voice. Hence the peculiar im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of diffuſing this oppoſition, as widely as poſſible, eſpecially by education. If parents, ſchool-maſters, and clergymen, would unite their efforts, for this moſt benevolent and glorious purpoſe, the effects of ſuch an union, on the riſing generation, would probably exceed the moſt ſanguine hopes.</p>
            <p>L. 601. Some of the fixed ſtars are, from evident alterations in their appearance, called changeable ſtars. The ſtar, Aegol, or Meduſa's head, as a remarkable one; and changes, from the firſt, to the fourth magnitude.</p>
            <p>L. 659. The cuſtom of privateering is one of the reliques of Gothic barbarity. No good reaſon can be given, why commiſſions, to plunder and deſtroy houſes, ſhould not be given to private perſons, as well as to plunder and deſtroy veſſels; to rob on the land, as well as on the ſea; and why ſuch perſons, as reſiſted, ſhould not be put to death, in the one caſe, as well as in the other. Cuſtom, it is preſumed, is the only ground of any difference of opinion, with regard to the caſes propoſed. All privateering is robbery, and murder; and the government, which ſanctions privateering, is guilty of authorizing theſe horrid crimes. Nor can the merchant, who is the proprietor, be excuſed from his ſhare in the guilt.</p>

            <p>L. 307. The greateſt obſtacle to chriſtianizing the Indians is now, as it has uſually been, their rivetted perſuaſion, that the Britiſh Coloniſts, in all their correſpondence with them, have aimed at their own benefit, not at the benefit of the Indians; at the acquiſition of their lands, not at the ſalvation of their ſouls: a perſuaſion founded on too unequivocal and ſhameful proof. So long as thoſe, who trade with them, are allowed to poiſon them by all the means of corruption, virtuous men can only regret their miſerable condition. It is to be hoped, that the late act of Congreſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating our correſpondence with the Indians, together with ſeveral other humane and juſt meaſures of the ſame nature, meaſures which reflect the higheſt honour on that Body, will, in a good degree, remove theſe evils.</p>

L. 289. [The firſt of May.] The day, on which accounts are uſually adjuſted, and pecuniary obligations diſcharged, in the ſtate of New-York.</p>
            <p>L. 297. For more than twenty years, the writer of this poem has been employed in the buſineſs of education, and, in that time, has had, in a greater or leſs degree, the ſuperintendence of almoſt a thouſand young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of both ſexes. Almoſt all the ſentiments here expreſſed, concerning the inſtruction, government, and habituation, of children, he has ſeen often proved to be juſt, through the whole courſe of this extenſive expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. He is induced to theſe obſervations by a full, experimental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the entirely theoretical and viſionary nature of ſeveral modern opinions on the ſubject; opinions, publiſhed by men, of genius indeed, but wholly inexperienced in education; men who educate children on paper, as a geometrician circumnavigates the globe, in half a dozen ſpherical triangles. On ſome future occaſion, he may, perhaps, take the liberty to offer to the public ſome further ſentiments, on this copions and very inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting subject. In the mean time, he believes, that theſe may be ſafely adopted by ſuch, as have not acquired more extenſive information, and for ſuch only are they deſigned.</p>
            <p>L. 447. No principle of action will uſually be of any ſervice to children, unleſs it be made habitual.</p>
            <p>L. 451. I believe, that there are very few children, who might not be rendered amiable and worthy, if their parents would begin their efforts in ſeaſon, and continue them ſteadily, without yielding to either ſloth, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
            <p>L. 471. In moſt places in New England, the pariſh bell is rung, at 9 o'clock, in the evening: a cuſtom, which has more influence in promoting good order, than a ſlight obſerver would imagine.</p>
            <p>L. 531. There are many ſocial libraries in Connecticut; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is faſt increaſing. This is viſibly one of the beſt means of diffuſing knowledge. If the proprietors of each would tax themſelves a ſmall ſuch yearly, they would ſoon be able to procure a ſufficient number of books, to anſwer every valuable purpoſe of ſuch an inſtitution.</p>
            <p>L. 567. I once knew a farmer, who ſteadily did what was called a good day's-work, and yet employed ſeveral hours, every day, in reading.</p>

In his Rape of the Look, there are ſeveral lines plainly indelicate, and ſome groſsly obſcene. In his Eloiſa to Abelard, the ſentiments are, in ſome inſtances, groſs and noxious. Yet theſe are his firſt performances. His Moral Eſſays (particularly the ſecond) treſpaſs, at times, againſt truth, juſtice and decency. The ſame is too often true of his satires. The Dunciad is, in ſeveral places, a ſeverer ſatire on the author, than on the objects of his reſentment: not to mention ſeveral of his ſmaller imitations of other poets, and the hideous volume, publiſhed as a ſupplement to his acknowledged works.</p>

It is not a little injurious to the honour of human nature, that the elegant arts of Poetry, Painting, and Muſic, have, in Europe, been ſo often proſtituted to the celebration of vile characters, to the diſplay of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and ſentiments groſs and pernicious, and to the commemoration of facts, which deeply ſtain the name of man.</p>
            <p>L. 535. Infidel philoſophers frequently impeach, and affect to deſpiſe, the evidence of teſtimony. Yet their own reaſonings are generally attended with evidence, and moſt uſually founded on evidence, which, in clearneſs and ſtrength, is far inferior to that of teſtimony: a great part of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents being mere and trifling hypotheſes.</p>
            <p>L. 565. Warton, in his Eſſay on the genius and writings of Pope, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that mediocrity is the ſituation, moſt favourable to the exertions of genius. It is alſo the ſituation, evidently moſt friendly to national, and individual, virtue and happineſs.</p>
            <p>L. 583. There is ſomething ſingularly unhappy in the attempts of the Americans to imitate the burthenſome oſtentation of Europe. Americans are not, and probably will not ſoon be, ſufficiently acquainted with the round of European form, and etiquette, to adopt it with either ſkill, or grace. At the ſame time, we have not, and, without entailments, never ſhall in any great number of inſtances have, wealth ſufficient to ſupport the neceſſary expenſe.</p>
            <p>Common Senſe, Philoſophy, and Religion, alike condemn ſuch manners, in every inſtance, and view them, as the painful efforts of folly to lift itſelf into reſpectability. The plain manners of Republicans, incomparably leſſ burthenſome, and more graceful and pleaſing, are our own native manners: ſuch manners, as made the Gaul eſteem the Roman ſenate an aſſembly of gods; and the courtier Cineas conſider the citizens of Rome, as a collection of kings.</p>
            <p>Sensible travellers, whoſe manners are generally viewed as more finiſhed, and pleaſing, than any other, appear uſually to acquire a contempt, and diſuſe, of ceremony, and to adopt a plainer behaviour, than moſt other men of breeding. A perſevering adoption of plain manners, by men of influence, would give them a general and laſting ſanction; and prove of more real benefit to the preſent, and future, inhabitants of America, than renowned victories, or immenſe acquiſitions of territory.</p>
            <p>It may, perhaps, be ſaid, as it often has been ſaid, though with neither diſcernment, nor truth, that parade is neceſſary to give energy to law, and dignity to government. It may be anſwered, that no laws have greater energy, and no government was ever more reſpected, than thoſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut have uſually been, for more than 150 years. Yet in Connecticut, parade is unknown in practice, and despised by the universal opinion.—The truth is, people of mere common sense, and uneducated to ceremony, always deſpile it: it's introduction, therefore, is always owing to the vanity, and weakneſs, of men in ſuperior ſtations, or ranks, of life.</p>
            <p>L. 597. There is reaſon to believe, that the women, in New England, in all that renders the female character reſpectable, and lovely, are inferior to none, in the world. They blend the useful, and the pleaſing, the refined, and the excellent, into a most delightful, and dignified union; and
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:026925_0169_0FD26634E84CF0B8"/>
well deſerve, from the other ſex, that high regard, and polite attention, which form a very reſpectable branch of our national manners.</p>
            <p>L. 657. One of the greateſt improvements, which the preſent age has made, in the progreſs of ſociety, is the public diminution of military glory, and the elevation of character, acquired by benevolence. Thus Howard is a name more celebrated, than Caeſar, or Marlborough.</p>
