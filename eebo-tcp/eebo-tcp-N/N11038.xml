            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Friends, and Fellow-Countrymen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>LET me conjure you by all you hold dear, here and hereafter, by all the ties of nature and juſtice, to rouſe in defence of your perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted brethern and fellow ſubjects in America, who daily fall innocent victims to lawleſs power: let me intreat you to rouſe in defence of your rights and liberties; thoſe rights and liberties which heaven gave, and for which your fathers bravely fought, and gloriouſly fell, to preſerve themſelves and their poſterity free; be aſſured if bleeding America can be reduced to ſlavery, all the boaſted privileges of Engliſhmen muſt fall with her: let me therefore beſeech you to oppoſe with uplifted hands, and ſtreatched out arms, the cruel, bloody, &amp; unnatural Tyranny of George the third, and his diabolical Tory minions: Perdition, deſtruction, and all the miſeries of a tortured death, attend the wretch, who calls
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:013988_0002_0F9258099E8EB160"/>himſelf an Engliſhman, and yet can tamely ſee his brother, or fellow ſubject, periſh through wanton cruelty, oppreſſion or the ſword.</p>
            <p>No tyrant was ever more deſpotic and cruel than the preſent Sovereign, who diſgraces the ſeat of royalty in the Britiſh empire; no Court ever more corrupt than his, and yet, O my countrymen, to this mercileſs and deſpotic tyrant, and to his wicked and corrupt miniſtry, you ſacrifice your rights, and yield a peaceable ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>Conſider the gloomy, the dreadful proſpect before you, the plains of America are running with the blood of the inhabitants, her eſſence of the Engliſh conſtitution deſtroyed, and nothing but the form, the mere ſhadow of it remains; all the dear bought liberties, purchaſed and ſealed with the blood of your forefathers, wreſted from you by the polluted hands of an abandoned ſet of miſcreants, ſupported and defended by a royal tyrant; and a dark cloud of ſlavery, like a riſing tempeſt; overſpreads the land, it approaches ſwiftly, and at this moment threatens our deſtruction; it is therefore high time you ſhould be rouſed and awakened to a ſenſe of your danger, and by an appeal to heaven, by a glorious reſiſtance, provide for your common ſafety.</p>
            <p>This is the only way, we have no other, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ruin that threatens us, if we are inattentive or inactive at this time, our chains will be faſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetted, and liberty muſt expire; your petitions and remonſtrances have been ſpurned by the King, and you have now no remedy left but that of entering
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:013988_0003_0F92580A50A26C40"/>into an ASSOCIATION in defence of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rights, and the rights of America. They have ſet you a noble example, an example worthy of Britons, an example which you are bound by all the principles of juſtice and ſelf-preſervation to follow: he muſt be blind that is not convinced of this, and he is an abandoned wretch, an enemy to mankind, who will not perſue the road.</p>
            <p>Upon your virtue and reſolution at this juncture, depends the ſalvation of England and America; it is now in your power to prevent the farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of deſpotiſm, the butchery of your fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countrymen, and yourſelves from ſlavery and ruin.</p>
            <p>When the humble ſupplications of an oppreſſed people are treated with contempt, and a deaf ear turned to their complaints, when their rights are daily invaded, their property unlawfully wreſted from them, and their blood inhumanly ſhed, it is incumbent on them, it is a duty they owe to God and their country, to take the field and reſiſt their oppreſſors, to ſhew themſelves brave, when bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is required, and dare to be reſolute in the hour of danger. Remember, my fellow countrymen, our predeceſſors led the way, the Americans have followed their noble example, and we are bound to follow them. Where would have been Liberty and Property, if it had not been for the virtue, bravery, and reſolution of our anceſtors? They ſtood forth in the glorious cauſe, and many of them ſecured it to poſterity with their blood. Shall we then, tamely ſubmit to have thoſe privileges for which they fought and fell, raviſhed from us by a
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:013988_0004_0F9258F58CDF49C0"/>lawleſs tribe of men, who call themſelves Senators or Miniſters, and who taking advantage of their Prince, are laying waſte their country, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſolation through the land? Shall it be ſaid in after times, that the year One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Seventy Five, was leſs glorious than that of Sixteen Hundred and Eighty Eight; and that as the age grew more and more enlightened, it become more and more puſillanimous. Forbid it Heaven!</p>
            <p>Let me intreat you O! Engliſhmen, to rouſe from that ſtate of ſupineneſs in which you have ſo long lain; open your eyes to the danger that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds you, and ſtand forth the defenders of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican virtue and public liberty. Havoc is now the cry at St. James's, and the dogs of war are let looſe to tear out the vitals of our brethern; Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca through the abandoned cruelty of an accurſed adminiſtration, and an unrelenting King, is become a field of blood, overſpread with deſolation and ſlaughter. It is in your power to put an end to this horrid, unnatural civil war, it muſt owe its extinction or continuance to you, if you are virtuous, brave, and reſolute, the lives, liberties, and properties of your fellow ſubjects, may be preſerved, and your country ſaved from deſtruction; if on the contrary, you ſhould be irreſolute and puſillanimous at this time, (unworthy the name of Engliſhmen) thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, many thouſand lives muſt be loſt; the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of England will be no more, and your proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty taken from you at the will and pleaſure of the King and his miniſters.</p>
            <p>It can only be from the virtue and united efforts of
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:013988_0005_0F9258F5C26330D8"/>England and America, that the conſtitution of Great-Britain, and all our invaluable privileges can be preſerved; ſhould you remain quiet ſpectators of the preſent inhuman Maſſacrees, and deſtructive meaſures, you will deſerve the worſt of ſlavery, and the crueleſt puniſhment ever inflicted on a people.</p>
            <p>If you have any honour, if you have any virtue, or any bravery, you will now ſtand forth and reſiſt the tyrants, you will demand the heads of thoſe men, who adviſed thoſe ſanguinary, fatal, and ruinous meaſures; you will declare to the world, you will not conſent to arbitrary invaſions of your liberties, arbitrary diſpenſing with the laws, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary governing by an army; that you owe no ſubmiſſion to a King, beyond the bounds of law; that your lives, liberties, and eſtates, ſhall not be diſpoſed of at his pleaſure, and that you are bound by the laws of God and man, to reſiſt a tyrant; that you will oppoſe all unjuſt violence, and thoſe who attempt the life of the conſtitution, as the great enemies of their country; this has been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in all ages, and all nations determine, that when Kings invade the lives, liberties, or properties of their ſubjects, that tear up the foundation of public freedom, and the ſacred conſtitution of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may be reſiſted, either by calling in and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with foreign aſſiſtance, or by taking arms in defence of the law and common liberty; this is what was declared at the Revolution, and this is the foundation upon which the people took arms in the time of Charles the firſt.</p>
            <p>The axe is now at the root of the tree; the
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:013988_0006_0F9258F6803A8860"/>overthrow of the Conſtitution is the great deſign of the King and his miniſters, the open and avowed enemies to the rights of mankind, who have already ſufficiently proved to the world, that they mean the ſubverſion of the univerſal right of Chriſtians and ſubjects. Let thoſe, my countrymen, who plead for tyrants, ſubmit to their power; but let us eſteem liberty, religion, and property, equally with our lives, every man's birthright by nature; no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ever received a legal authority to abridge or take it away; nor has God veſted any ſingle or confederated power in any hands to deſtroy it; and it is in defence of theſe glorious priviledges, theſe common rights, I have written this paper, and to preſerve them unviolated by the polluted hands of lawleſs tyrants, I would lay down my life, for life is a burthen in any other ſtate but that of freedom.</p>
            <p>It is notoriouſly known, notwithſtanding all the royal and miniſterial falſhoods which have been, and are daily advanced, to our diſgrace, it is known that we do not enjoy, undiminiſhed, one ſingle priviledge purchaſed by the blood of our anceſtors, and confirmed to us by Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights. Every man then, who remains paſſive at this time, is an enemy and a traitor to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I looſe all kind of patience when I reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the melancholy ſituation of England and Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and the villainous principles of thoſe men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by the ſovereign with the management of the affairs of this once great, free, and powerful kingdom, I am fired with a juſt indignation againſt the authors of our misfortunes; and if I appear too warm, I hope it will be imputed to my zeal in the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:013988_0007_0F9258FB1F1EFAE0"/>public cauſe, and not to any malice or reſentment, againſt individuals, for I here declare to have none, but I moſt ſincerely wiſh to ſtop the further effuſion of human blood, and would willingly ſacrifice my life, could I reſcue my country from the hands of particides and traitors, and from that deſtruction which now threatens it.</p>

               <hi>The neceſſity, utility, and national advantage of a political paper in defence of the natural rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind at this important aera, muſt appear greater than at the laſt glorious Revolution, We now ſee, and with infinite concern, the King and Miniſtry, the Lords and Commons, all united, and firmly reſolved, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing meaſures, which (without a noble oppoſition from the people) muſt end in the deſtruction of the laws, rights, and liberties, of the whole Britiſh empire, in England and America. It is therefore only neceſſary to ſay, this paper will be carried on by two gentlemen of literary abilities, alike enemies to the arbitrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of ONE, or a purchaſed majority of FIVE HUNDRED and FIFTY EIGHT TYRANTS, to whom they, and they hope, their fellow ſubjects, never will ſubmit.</hi>
