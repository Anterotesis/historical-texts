            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

justly question his Memory, seeing when I called him to bear witness to things he had heard spoken but some few days or weeks past, he hath said, <hi>He could not remember them, his Memory being weak, and he had rather forget than remember such things.</hi> He did also further charge me, <hi>That he heard me say, I believed I should be moved of God to preach the Doctrine of the Revolutions,</hi> as he termed it; but what Revolutions I meant, he did not tell; for there are many Revolutions, and of many sorts; The which I do not remember I ever said to him; and as he may understand the Revolutions, his so charging me may be an utter Falshood and Slander; for there are some sorts of Revolutions relating to the Souls of men, that cannot be denyed, if we own the <hi>Resurrection of the dead,</hi> according to Scripture, and our conveyance and descent out of the loyns of our Ancestors up to <hi>Adam,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures; see <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 26. <hi>Hosea</hi> 12.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9, 10. and the word <hi>Revolution,</hi> is the true English of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Gilgal,</hi> mentioned <hi>Josh.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Ezck.</hi> 10.13. and this with respect to men (see the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and Margen of the English Bible; also, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Te<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I declared, That I did not remember that ever I owned my self to be the Author of that Book, or that I said, I did believe, that I should be moved of God to preach the Revolutions; but on the contrary, seeing I do not remember it, and my Memory is as good as his, if not better, I did and do hold it to be rashly and foolishly <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> can I think that ever I said such a thing, because I never made the Opinion of the Revolutions, as delivered in that Book, or as vulgarly held by its Alserters, a matter of my Faith, or as any divine Opening; besides, his varying the Charge, as Witnesses can prove, saying first, <hi>I knew not but I might be moved, &amp;c.</hi> and last saying, <hi>I believed I should be moved, &amp;c.</hi> which differ widely, and make the whole justly incredible. But he did so earnestly assert them, that he said, <hi>As God was in Heaven it was true;</hi> which some of us that heard him, were greatly offended with, judging it to be an Oath, as that Oath or manner of Swearing under the Law, <hi>As the Lord liveth,</hi> Jer. 5. 2. And I said to him, this is more than Yea or Nay, which Christ hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to keep unto in all our Communications, for whatsoever is
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000609_0003_0FA96140668B5710"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, cometh of Evil; and many of us have suffered much in Old <hi>England</hi> for refusing to swear in any case, even before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. However, let it be considered, whether it be not a Breach of all common Civility or Morality among men, to make Publick a thing secretly spoken (if the thing had been spoke by me, as he affirmeth) that he thought might tend to my Prejudice; nor doth it excuse him, to say, <hi>I lately told some-what he spoke to me in private;</hi> for that was such a thing he might have spoke to any, and did not tend to his, or any mans Prejudice, and was no secrecy. And whether his asserting a thing without any Proof, but what we take to be a very great Oath, will be any sufficient Witness or Evidence, in point of common Justice among men? for if this be allowed, not only mens Fame and Reputation, but Property, Liberty and Life itself lieth at stake to be taken away most unjustly.</p>
            <p>But to answer directly to his Charge; I do say, after the best Recollection of my Memory that I can make, after so many Years past, I do not remember that I said to him, I was the Author of that Book, and I know not how he can justly think, considering these very Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custances he alledgeth, and some other Circumstances whereof he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant, unless he hath forgotten the whole; for I told him, that divers Persons were concerned in that Book, called, <hi>The Two Hundred Queries,</hi> and after what manner. Besides, another Person hath in Print divers Years ago owned that Book; and why then should he charge me with that which another hath owned. The most he can justly alledge, Is, <hi>That I said a considerable part of the Matter of that Book, which I had from another, I put into Writing;</hi> which will not prove me to be the Author; for I oft put into writing other mens words, even such as are Adversaries; and many do write for others that whereof they are not the Authors. But I further say, I never justly could, nor do own my self to be the Author of that Book (how far I might be concerned otherwise in it, in any part or in the writing of a great part of the Matter of it, is not material nor necessary for me to determine, for others were concerned; and he who accuseth me of a thing which he cannot prove by outward Evidence, by so doing rather proveth himself a false Accuser, and showeth both his own Folly and Prejudice against me: And I say yet further, as no man living can prove me to be the Author of that Book, so I had not the least hand in the Printing it; for it was printed altogether without
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000609_0004_0FA961410AA72470"/>
my Consent and Approbation. And the Defaults (whether in the Transcribing, or in the Printing it,) are so many, that it hath quite altered the sence of the Queries in many places, and made others of them Non-sensical; and there are things in it for which I am no wise accountable, and which I never did own, or do own to be mine; yet I cannot disown or blame the whole, but make a distinction; for there are things queried in that Book, that are no wise unbecoming the best Christians, and which mention nothing of the Revolutions, so called nor doth imply them, except by such remote seeming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, which one may as readily deny, as another may affirm, and they have no more necessary connexion with the Revolutions, than the Scriptures have, that are cited in them; and I am not convinced, that it is a Trespass to query things that call not into Question any one Article of the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> But further, to clear the matter, I do affirm, that I never said to any, nor did I ever conclude in my thoughts, that the Doctrine of the Revolutions, as they are commonly understood, or as delivered in that Book, was the matter of my Faith, or were things inwardly revealed or opened to me by the Spirit of Truth, as I am free to say concerning all things of my <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> which I both believe and profess; nor have I ever had any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, Strife or Contention with any man about the Revolutions, so called, and I have been very shy and backward, either to lend or recommend the said Book. But it is one thing what a man may suppose to be a probable Opinion, or rational Hypothesis (either as touching the Doctrine of the Revolutions, of which there are many <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> asserted by Authors, or as touching any other Doctrine in Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy or Physick) and it is far another thing what a man asserts to be his Christian Faith, grounded upon the inward Evidence and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Gods Spirit in the Heart.</p>
            <p>But as to my real sence of the Opinion of that called the Revolutions, which do generally relate to Times past (and not with the least cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to any one perticular Person to the time to come) ever since the Death of Christ. If any hold any such Opinion or Doctrine of them (as I know none that do,) that doth teach, <hi>That men may delay their Repentance, or living a good Life, in hope that they shall live again after Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I do sincerely declare, I have always abhorred any such Doctrine, and judged it Wicked and Abominable, and still I do so judge, and hope so to do while I live; and I have upon many

                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That to entertain any such hope, to live again in order to Repent, and live a good Life, after a man has neglected the present Opportunity wherein to Repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this present Life, is as Wicked as it is vain; for <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation teacheth us to deny Ungodliness and Worlaly Lusts, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the Soul is out of the Body, or in hope to live again in a mortal Body; for <hi>NOW is the accepted Time, NOW is the Day of Salvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 2. <hi>And it is the last Time,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> hath declared, <hi>1 John 2. 18.</hi> And also <hi>Paul,</hi> saying, <hi>Rom. 13.11. And that knowing the Time, that NOW it is high Time to awake out of sleep, &amp;c. let us therefore east off the Works of Darkness, and put on the Armour of Light, for the Times of Ignorance God wincked at, but NOW com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all men every where to Repent,</hi> Acts 17. 30. And as <hi>John</hi> said, Mat. 3. 10. <hi>And NOW also the Ax is laid to the Root of the Trees, therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the Fire.</hi> And therefore if any hold such Doctrine of Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, that putteth men upon delaying their Repentance, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to live a good Life, in hope to live again after Death, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and Amend, as I have alwayes abhorred it, so I hope I shall alwayes do, and bear my faithful Testimony against it.</p>
            <p>And whereas the said Person hath accused me before divers Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>That my manner of Preaching the Faith of Christ Crucified and Raised again, its being necessary to make men Christians and Sons of God of the Free Woman, and Children of the New-Covenant, doth infer my holding of the Revolutions, to wit, that all pious</hi> Gentiles, <hi>dying without all hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ crucified and raised again preached to them, must of necessity live again in a mortal Body, in order to hear that Doctrine outwardly preached to them, or then be damned.</hi> The which Alternative I Possitively deny. And by this his Accusation, he hath shown what a Changeling he is, from better to worse, in so finding fault with my Doctrine for Preaching or Printing the necessity of this Faith to Salvation, which he hath so frequently hold forth himself &amp; owned and approved in my books. And I propose it to the serious Consideration of all sincere <hi>Christians,</hi> Whether this Difficulty (how much so ever

<hi>Christianity,</hi> therefore <hi>Gentilism</hi> is the more profitable, &amp; doth more facilitate mens Perfection, who are under it, even as an Artist that can perfect his work with fewer and less chargeable Tools &amp; Instruments, is the most perfect, and is worthy of most praise; but because all the Precepts of <hi>Christianity</hi> are spiritual, and given us by God and Christ, to bring us to that spiritual Perfection that the Law, either of <hi>Judaism</hi> or <hi>Gentilism</hi> simply considered, could not do, the Law being weak, through the Flesh, and so could not make perfect; therefore it is, that on that very account <hi>Christianity</hi> is the most excellent Dispensation, both for its Spirituality, and giving more plenty of Precepts than <hi>Gentilism</hi> did or doth; for as <hi>Christianity</hi> hath more plenty of Precepts that are highly spiritual, and tending to a more high and spiritual Perfection than <hi>Gentilism,</hi> so it hath more plenty of divine Grace and of Life, to enable them who are under it, to perform them, whereby they attain to the Perfection designed.

As for <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> his calling <hi>Socrates</hi> a Christian, <hi>Socrates</hi> might have had the Faith of Christ, according to the Substance of it, then but obscurely revealed, and so might <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Hate,</hi> who conversed with <hi>Jews;</hi> for the least measure of the Light of Christ, in every true Christian, to whom the Gospel Day of Christ is dawned, doth most necessarily draw and lead the Soul's Faith, Love and Devotion to the Man Christ without them, and to God the Father, as dwelling in him most abundantly and gloriously, that so God out of Christ, our alone Mediator, may continually supply us, as out of a most rich Treasury and Store-house, with all new and fresh Supplies, Aids, and Assistances of his divine Grace, Light, Life and Spirit, to serve him acceptably, and to enjoy the indwelling of God the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit in our own Hearts and Vessels, daily more and more abundantly, as our Faith, Love and Devotion is thus daily and continually exercised upon him. Nor is there any real-danger, by so believing, or by so preaching, to draw the Minds of People from the Gift of Christ in them (this at most is but the Abuse or evil Use of this Doctrine, as the best of Doctrines have been and may be abused, which all ought to watch against) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the real, proper and necessary direct tendency of such Doctrine, rightly improved, is to bring People still more and more to the Gift of Christ in themselves, and to the more abundant enjoyment of him, as the Scripture Testimony, and the Experience of Thousands and ten Thousands do sufficiently confirm. But such who preach Faith only in the Light within, calling that Light Christ, as they have learned by hear-say or reading, and yet are ignorant of that great Mystery of Christ without us, they neither know Christ within, nor believe in him, as such; for though Christ the true Light, be in all
