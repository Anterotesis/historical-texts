         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE end of the inſtitution, maintenance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of government, is to ſecure the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the body-politic; to protect it; and to furniſh the individuals who compoſe it, with the power of enjoying, in ſafety and tranquility, their natural rights, and the bleſſings of life: And whenever theſe great objects are not obtained, the people have a right to alter the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to take meaſures neceſſary for their ſafety, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and happineſs.</p>
               <p>THE body-politic is formed by a voluntary aſſociation of individuals: It is a ſocial compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all ſhall be governed by certain laws for the common good.

                  <note place="margin">Art. I.</note>ALL men are born free and equal, and have certain natural eſſential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing, and protecting property; in fine, that of ſeeking and obtaining their ſafety and happineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">II. IT is the right as well as the duty of all men in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, publicly, and at ſtated ſeaſons, to worſhip the SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREME BEING, the great creator and preſerver of the univerſe. And no ſubject ſhall be hurt, moleſted, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, in his perſon, liberty, or eſtate, for worſhiping GOD in the manner and ſeaſon moſt agreeable to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of his own conſcience; or for his religious profeſſion or ſentiments; provided he doth not diſturb the public peace, or obſtruct others in their religious worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">III. As the happineſs of a people, and the good order and preſervation of civil government, eſſentially depend upon piety, religion and morality; and as theſe cannot be generally diffuſed through a community, but by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the public worſhip of GOD, and of public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in piety, religion and morality: Therefore, to promote their happineſs, and to ſecure the good order and preſervation of their government, the people of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth have a right to inveſt their legiſlature with power to authorize and require, and the legiſlature ſhall, from time to time, authorize and require, the ſeveral towns, pariſhes, precincts and other bodies politic, or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſocieties, to make ſuitable proviſion, at their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, for the inſtitution of the public worſhip of GOD,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016845_0006_0F9EBEC78E1D1D08"/>
and for the ſupport and maintenance of public proteſtant teachers of piety, religion and morality, in all caſes where ſuch proviſion ſhall not be made voluntarily.</p>
               <p>AND the people of this Commonwealth have alſo a right to, and do, inveſt their legiſlature with authority to enjoin upon all the ſubjects an attendance upon the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the public teachers aforeſaid, at ſtated times and ſeaſons, if there be any on whoſe inſtructions they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly and conveniently attend.</p>
               <p>PROVIDED notwithſtanding, that the ſeveral towns, pariſhes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious ſocieties, ſhall, at all times, have the excluſive right of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their public teachers, and of contracting with them for their ſupport and maintenance</p>
               <p>AND all monies paid by the ſubject to the ſupport of public worſhip, and of the public teachers aforeſaid, ſhall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the ſupport of the public teacher or teachers of his own religious ſect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, provided there be any on whoſe inſtructions he attends; otherwiſe it may be paid towards the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the teacher or teachers of the pariſh or precinct in which the ſaid monies are raiſed.</p>
               <p>AND every denomination of chriſtians, demeaning themſelves peaceably, and as good ſubjects of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, ſhall be equally under the protection of the law: And no ſubordination of any one ſect or denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another ſhall ever be eſtabliſhed by law.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. THE people of this Commonwealth have the ſole and excluſive right of governing themſelves as a free, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and independent ſtate; and do, and forever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall, exerciſe and enjoy every power, juriſdiction, and right which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them expreſly delegated to the United States of America in Congreſs aſſembled.</p>
               <p n="5">V. ALL power reſiding originally in the people, and being derived from them, the ſeveral magiſtrates and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016845_0007_0F9EBEC7FB14B9B0"/>
of government, veſted with authority, whether legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, executive, or judicial, are their ſubſtitutes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and are at all times accountable to them.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. NO man, nor corporation, or aſſociation of men, have any other title to obtain advantages, or particular and excluſive privileges, diſtinct from thoſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, than what ariſes from the conſideration of ſervices rendered to the public; and this title being in nature nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereditary, nor tranſmiſſible to children, or deſcendents, or relations by blood, the idea of a man born a magiſtrate, lawgiver, or judge, is abſurd and unnatural.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. GOVERNMENT is inſtituted for the common good; for the protection, ſafety, proſperity and happineſs of the people; and not for the profit, honor, or private intereſt of any one man, family or claſs of men: Therefore the people alone have an inconteſtible, unalienable, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſible tight to inſtitute government; and to reform, alter, or totally charge the ſame, when their protection, ſafety, proſperity and happineſs require it.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. IN order to prevent thoſe, who are veſted with authority, from becoming oppreſſors, the people have a right, at ſuch periods and in ſuch manner as they ſhall eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh by their frame of government, to cauſe the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> public officers to return to private life; and to fill up vacant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by certain and regular elections and appointments.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. ALL elections ought to be free and all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Commonwealth, having ſuch qualifications as they ſhall eſtabliſh by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected, for public employments.</p>
               <p n="10">X EACH individual of the ſociety has a right to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according to ſtanding laws. He is obliged, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to contribute his ſhare to the expence of this protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to give his perſonal ſervice, or an equivalent, when neceſſary: But no part of the property of any individual, can, with juſtice, be taken from him, or applied to public
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016845_0008_0F9EBEC9758176C8"/>
uſes, without his own conſent, or that of the repreſentative body of the people: In fine, the people of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth are not controulable by any other laws, than thoſe to which their conſtitutional repreſentative body have given their conſent. And whenever the public exigencies require, that the property of any individual ſhould be appropriated to public uſes, he ſhall receive a reaſonable compenſation therefor.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. EVERY ſubject of the Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recourſe to the laws for all injuries or wrongs which he may receive in his perſon, property, or character. He ought to obtain right and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice freely, and without being obliged to purchaſe it; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, and without any denial; promptly, and without delay; conformably to the laws.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. NO ſubject ſhall be held to anſwer for any crime or offence, until the ſame is fully and plainly, ſubſtantially and formally, deſcribed to him; or be compelled to accuſe, or furniſh evidence againſt himſelf. And every ſubject ſhall have a right to produce all proofs, that may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him; to meet the witneſſes againſt him face to face, and to be fully heard in his defence by himſelf, or his council, at his election. And no ſubject ſhall be arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, impriſoned, deſpoiled, or deprived of his property, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or eſtate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</p>
               <p>AND the legiſlature ſhall not make any law, that ſhall ſubject any perſon to a capital or infamous puniſhment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting for the government of the army and navy, without trial by jury.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. IN criminal proſecutions, the verification of facts in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greateſt ſecurities of the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. EVERY ſubject has a right to be ſecure from all unreaſonable ſearches, and ſeizures, of his perſon, his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, his papers, and all his poſſeſſions. All warrants, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016845_0009_0F9EBECCADDE85F0"/>
are contrary to this right, if the cauſe or foundation of them be not previouſly ſupported by oath or affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to make ſearch in ſuſpected places, or to arreſt one or more ſuſpected perſons, or to ſeize their property, be not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſpecial deſignation of the perſons or objects of ſearch, arreſt, or ſeizure: and no warrant ought to be iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued but in caſes, and with the formalities, preſcribed by the laws.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. IN all controverſies concerning property, and in all ſuits between two or more perſons, except in caſes in which it has heretofore been otherways uſed and practiced, the parties have a right to a trial by a jury; and this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of procedure ſhall be held ſacred, unleſs, in cauſes ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the high-ſeas, and ſuch as relate to mariners wagers, the legiſlature ſhall hereafter find it neceſſary to alter it.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. THE liberty of the preſs is eſſential to the ſecurity of freedom in a ſtate: it ought not, therefore, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in this Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. THE people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as in time of peace armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without the conſent of the legiſlature; and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary power ſhall always be held in an exact ſubordination to the civil authority and be governed by it.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. A FREQUENT recurrence to the fundamental principles of the conſtitution, and a conſtant adherence to thoſe of piety, juſtice, moderation, temperance, induſtry, and frugality, are abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government: The people ought, conſequently, to have a particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to all thoſe principles, in the choice of their officers and repreſentatives: And they have a right to require of their law-givers and magiſtrates, an exact and conſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of them, in the formation and execution of the laws neceſſary for the good adminiſtration of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016845_0010_0F9EBECD86F2EE40"/>XIX. THE people have a right, in an orderly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, to aſſemble to conſult upon the common good: give inſtructions to their repreſentatives; and to requeſt of the legiſlative body, by the way of addreſſes, petitions, or remonſtrances, redreſs of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they ſuffer.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. THE power of ſuſpending the laws, or the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laws, ought never to be exerciſed but by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, or by authority derived from it, to be exerciſed in ſuch particular caſes only as the legiſlature ſhall expreſly provide for.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. THE freedom of deliberation, ſpeech and debate, in either houſe of the legiſlature, is ſo eſſential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation or proſecution, action or complaint, in any other court or place whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. THE legiſlature ought frequently to aſſemble for the redreſs of grievances, for correcting, ſtrengthening, and confirming the laws and for making new laws, as the common good may require.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. NO ſubſidy, charge, tax, impoſt, or duties, ought to be eſtabliſhed, fixed, laid, or levied under any pretext whatſoever, without the conſent of the people, or their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives in the legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. LAWS made to puniſh for actions done before the exiſtence of ſuch laws, and which have not been declared crimes by proceding laws, are unjuſt, expreſſive, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the fundamental principles of a free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. NO ſubject ought, in any caſe, or in any time to be declared guilty of treaſon or felony by the legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. NO magiſtrate or court of law, ſhall demand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive bail or ſureties, impoſe exceſſive fines, or inflict cruel or unuſual puniſhments.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. IN time of peace no ſoldier ought to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in any houſe without the conſent of the owner; and in time of war ſuch quarters ought not to be made but by the civil magiſtrate, in a manner ordeined by the legiſlature.</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:016845_0011_0F9EBECE3B7DF718"/>XXVIII. NO perſon can in any caſe be ſubjected to law-martial, or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except thoſe employed in the army or navy, and except the militia in actual ſervice, but by authority of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. IT is eſſential to the preſervation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and adminiſtration of juſtice. It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as free, impartial and independent as the lot of humanity will admit. It is therefore not only the beſt policy, but for the ſecurity of the rights of the people, and of every citizen, that the judges of the ſupreme judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial court ſhould hold their offices as long as they behave themſelves well; and that they ſhould have honorable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries aſcertained and eſtabliſhed by ſtanding laws.</p>
               <p n="30">XXX. IN the government of this Commonwealth, the legiſlative department ſhall never exerciſe the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: The executive ſhall never exerciſe the legiſlative and judicial powers, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them: The judicial ſhall never exerciſe the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men.</p>
