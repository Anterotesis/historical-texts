            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE Words are placed at the Concluſion of our bleſſed Saviour's Sermon on the Mount; and contain the Judgment or Opinion of his Hearers, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:005554_0004_1018669B8B187FF8"/>As he was the Founder of our holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it cannot be diſputed, but that he beſt knew, what Doctrines were fitteſt to be taught; and what was the beſt Method of propagating them. —In ſhort, he beſt knew what was the moſt uſeful, the moſt inſtructive and edifying Way of Preaching. And as our Text gives the higheſt Character of this Sermon; when it affirms, that <hi>they all (i. e.</hi> his Hearers) <hi>were aſtoniſh'd at his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi>; and that he taught ſo as never Man did before him. I purpoſe to take Occaſion from it, of examining what is the beſt and moſt proper Way of teaching and inſtructing Men in the Knowledge of the Goſpel.— In ſhort, I deſign to examine what is and ought to be accounted the beſt and moſt edifying Way of Preaching.</p>
            <p>And the Neceſſity of a Diſcourſe upon this Subject, is very manifeſt; for beſides the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005554_0005_1018669D4AF6B3A0"/>
many Terms of Reproach and Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that are caſt upon our Preaching, by thoſe whoſe Intereſt it is to draw away Hearers; amuſing them with artful Terms of much-ſeeming Sound, but no real Significance: Such as <hi>legal Preaching, carnal Inſtruction, preaching Morality,</hi> and the like.—I ſay, beſides this Evil, it is a ſad and melancholy Truth, that among thoſe who are ſteady Attendants upon the divine Worſhip, we do not always find that Increaſe of Piety and Godlineſs, that reliſh of a divine Life; that holy and exemplary Behaviour, which one would think theſe Means of Grace are fitted to produce.</p>
            <p>And becauſe Men are willing the Fault ſhould reſt any where, rather than with themſelves; ſome are ready to attribute their Unfruitfulneſs to their Teachers.—The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons they hear, are not moving and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate; they don't raiſe in them thoſe earneſt Deſires and Longings after Chriſt, which they want to be poſſeſſed of. They hear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a great deal of ſmooth Reaſoning, many Perſuaſives to Duty, and many earneſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſives from Vice; they have Rules laid down for the Conduct of their Lives, and thoſe earneſtly enough recommended. But
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005554_0006_1018669F3787D9D0"/>
there is ſomething they fancy ſtill wanting, they don't well know what it is; but they ſuppoſe they ſhould hear more of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>Faith,</hi> of <hi>his Righteouſneſs being imputed to us for Righteouſneſs</hi>; that is, in plain Terms, they want to be aſſured that Chriſt has ſo done every Thing for them, as to have left nothing for them to do.—Thus alſo, the <hi>Terrors of the Law</hi> are much neglected, tho' neceſſary to the Awakening and Conviction of Sinners.&amp;Something or other of this Kind they imagine, and are told would be more <hi>affecting,</hi> would ſtir them up more, and have a better Influence upon them.</p>
            <p>This therefore deſerves to be enquired into, Whether informing the Minds or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Hearers, in the great Truths and Duties of the Goſpel; and endeavouring to convince their Judgments of the Importance of theſe Duties, and of the Neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and practicing them; and of their avoiding every Thing that is inconſiſtent or contrary to them? be not the moſt edifying Way of Preaching?.—I ſhall endeavour in ſhort, to prove, that this is the only Goſpel Preaching; and that to talk of any other Way or Method (unleſs alſo they pretend to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005554_0007_101866A31469FF78"/>
Inſpiration) is highly wicked, and tends only to amuſe People with a Set of obſcure and difficult Terms and Phraſes, without meaning.</p>
            <p>And that we may not be miſled in an Enquiry of ſo much Importance, it is proper that we throw aſide all human Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Matter; and have Recourſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Fountain Head, the Standard of Truth and Error; I mean the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.—And as no human Authority ought to have any Weight in this Argument; ſo I ſhall object againſt any pretended <hi>Experiences</hi> that this or that Way of Preaching is more or leſs Edifying: For theſe Things may miſlead or deceive us; becauſe it would be ſetting up one Man's <hi>Experience</hi> in Oppoſition to another's.</p>
            <p>The only Thing that ought to have Weight with us, is the Scripture. And becauſe there is not any where an expreſs Precept about preaching, ſtating and defining what we are obliged to underſtand by it; we are left to collect the true Notion of it, from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; firſt of our bleſſed Saviour and then from the Sermons of his Apoſtles; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly from the Diſcourſes of that moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and juſtly admired Preacher, St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005554_0008_101866A95A750688"/>I. And Firſt, let us conſider the Example of our bleſſed Saviour's Preaching, as it is exhibited to us in this Sermon; of which mention is made in my Text. For tho' he taught upon many other Occaſions both in publick and private; yet we have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat publick Sermon of his, beſides this which is here recorded.</p>
            <p>And the firſt Thing remarkable in this Sermon, is, that it is adapted to his Hearers, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> his Diſciples. For tho' there was a mixt Multitude, that now heard him; yet his Diſcourſe was chiefly directed to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. This we learn from the 5th Chap. 1.2. <hi>And ſeeing the Multitudes, he went up into a Mountain; and when he was ſet, his Diſciples came unto him; and he opened his Mouth, and taught them, ſaying, bleſſed are the Poor in Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.—Now his Diſciples having already received him as their Maſter; having already liſted themſelves his Followers; he gives them ſuch divine Directions as might go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Lives, and make it evident that they did not receive his Religion in vain. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly this whole Sermon is made up of the moſt admirable Precepts for the Conduct of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:005554_0009_101866ACC0967F58"/>The firſt Thing that he recommends to them, is <hi>Poverty of Spirit,</hi> or a meek and humble Diſpoſition of Mind; next he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes to <hi>Patience under Afflictions</hi>; then ſets forth the <hi>Reward of Meekneſs</hi>; after this, he perſuades them to <hi>ſeek earneſtly after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>; then to acquire a <hi>merciful Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And as hitherto he had recommended Purity of Life, he next inſiſts upon Purity of Heart likewiſe; and the promoting <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> among one another. And as he had before exhorted to Patience under the Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which God ſees fit to exerciſe Men withal; ſo now he points out the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for ſuſtaining the Injuries they receive from one another.—From hence he proceeds to recommend a <hi>circumſpect Behaviour</hi>; and then inſiſts upon their obſerving the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>: But becauſe the Phariſees had by their Traditions, explained away the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Meaning and Intention of them, he makes a moſt exact and noble Expoſition of the Law; and then cloſes up this Part of his Diſcourſe with an Exhortation to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>—And the whole Sum of his Diſcourſe in the two next Chapters, is nothing elſe but an Exhortation to the Practice of ſeveral
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005554_0010_101866AE600F17A0"/>
moral Duties; ſuch as <hi>Alms,</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Faſting, forgiveneſs of Enemies, Mortification</hi> to the World, to abſtain from <hi>raſh Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and to become not only <hi>hearers,</hi> but <hi>doers of the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Sum and Subſtance of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Sermon; in which you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that our Saviour does not threaten them with <hi>the Terrors of the Law</hi>; nor was there any need he ſhould; for this Diſcourſe being chiefly directed to his own Diſciples, who had already eſcaped the Bondage of the Law, to have threatned them with the Severity of that Diſpenſation, would have been to turn them over again to their antient Bondage and Subjection. Law, ſays the Apoſtle, was <hi>our Schoolmaſter to bring us to Chriſt</hi>; but having entertain'd and embrac'd his Religion, <hi>we are no longer under a Schoolmaſter; but are all the Children of God, by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> For <hi>as many as are baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 3.24 to 27th verſe.—Neither is there any Thing here mentioned about <hi>Faith</hi>; for this alſo they had already declared, by leaving all to follow him.</p>
            <p>The Truth is this.—Theſe Men having
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005554_0011_101866B01B6C5ED8"/>
already made Profeſſion of Chriſt, and yielded up themſelves to become his hearty and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Followers; and being received by him as Members of his Body, or of that Church, which he came to eſtabliſh, and whereof he himſelf is the Head, did not need a Diſcourſe about Faith, nor an Exhortation about com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, ſo much as proper Inſtructions in Regard to their Conduct and Behaviour as Chriſtians. They wanted ſuitable Rules of Inſtruction, how they might live and act up to the Dignity of that holy Profeſſion they had made; what Duties were incumbent upon them, in Conſequence of this their Chriſtian Profeſſion; what Impediments they were likely to meet with; and what was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Method to remove them; or with what Temper and Diſpoſition they ought to ſuſtain them.—Theſe were Points more immediately neceſſary to be opened and explained to Chriſtians, to Men who had already embraced the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And accordingly we find our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour condeſcended to teach them theſe <hi>moral Duties.</hi> He did not flatter them with a Notion that their <hi>cloſing with him,</hi> or <hi>getting an Intereſt in him,</hi> exempted them from

               <hi>moral Duties</hi>; but taught, that their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to him was increas'd with their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and that they became the Teſt and Evidence of their Diſcipleſhip.—<hi>If ye love me</hi> (ſays he) <hi>keep my Commandments.</hi> And again, <hi>He that keepeth my Commandments, he it is that loveth me.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſures, that <hi>he who keepeth his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour's whole Sermon is indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely compoſed of ſuch Points of Doctrine, as ſome by Way of Diſparagement, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to call <hi>moral Preaching,</hi> and <hi>legal Inſtruction.</hi> But ſurely thoſe Men who had the Happineſs to hear him, had quite different Notions about Preaching, from theſe People. They, we read, were in Raptures; were fill'd with Admiration; were even aſtoniſh'd at
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005554_0013_101866B68F6A0B80"/>
his Doctrine. Even the unconverted Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude plainly ſaw the Excellence of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. That noble Majeſty, and unaffected Simplicity of Expreſſion, ſurpriſed and charmed them. They perceived the Doctrine came from God. They were convinced that a divine Authority attended him; becauſe the Precepts he taught were worthy of God; and had a direct and natural Tendency to promote the Happineſs of Men.</p>
            <p>Upon other Occaſions, when our Saviour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately applied himſelf to thoſe who were Strangers to his Religion: He exhorts them to <hi>come unto him,</hi> to <hi>believe in him,</hi> and in his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that they <hi>might have Life. Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt. Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me.</hi> Matt. 11.29. <hi>He that cometh unto me</hi> (ſays he to thoſe who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him for the Loaves) <hi>ſhall never hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and he that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> John 6.35.— And ſo Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance were the Subject of the very firſt Sermon he made, as we learn from the 4th of St. Matt. 17. <hi>From that time Jeſus began to preach, and to ſay, Repent, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is at Hand.</hi>—He made a wide
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005554_0014_101866BBE472FA78"/>
Difference in his preaching, when he directed himſelf to the unconverted Heathen World, from thoſe Applications which were addreſſed to ſuch as had already received him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced his Religion. The former he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to put away their old Sins and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to receive him for their Saviour, and take his Directions for their Way to Heaven. And therefore Repentance of their former wicked Life, and Faith in Chriſt, were the only proper neceſſery Doctrines to be incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated upon ſuch Men as theſe.—But for thoſe who had already received him by Faith, and who profeſt their Dependance on him as a Mediator and Guide, quite other Doctrine was neceſſary. And therefore to theſe he preached the Doctrine of New Obedience; exhorted them to live ſuitably to their holy Calling, by practiſing the Duties of a holy, righteous, and godly Life; and not only to he innocent and unblameable themſelves; but according to their Power and Ability, to promote the general Welfare and Happineſs of all Mankind.</p>
            <p>Thus I have examined the Nature of our bleſſed Saviour's Preaching.—I proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005554_0015_101866BDFB04A098"/>II. To enquire, Whether his Apoſtles did not teach the ſame Doctrine?</p>
            <p>Now, in Anſwer to this Enquiry, we muſt conſider their Preaching under two diſtinct Periods. The firſt beginning from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Aſcenſion; and the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt conſequent upon it. And the other from the Settlement of Churches, Bodies, and Societies of Chriſtians, after the Religion of Jeſus had made ſome Progreſs in the World.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Periods ſeems to be chiefly taken up in bringing Men over to the Chriſtian Faith. And accordingly the Points of Doctrine chiefly inſiſted on, were theſe, <hi>Chriſt crucified, Jeſus and the Reſurrection, Faith and Repentance, putting on Chriſt,</hi> being <hi>baptized into Chriſt,</hi> and the like: All which, and a great Number of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of like Nature; of which their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Exhortations were full, do import neither more nor leſs than this: That the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt had made Attonement for the Sins of Mankind; that he had now opened a new and noble Way of reconciling Men to God. And in order that they might become Partakers of theſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005554_0016_101866C2210AE878"/>
great Bleſſings, it was neceſſary that they ſhould turn from their Idols and Vanities; and the Jews from their ſervile Dependance upon the Law; and believing thoſe Things which were ſpoken of Jeſus, they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for their Saviour, embrace his Religion, and ſubmit to his Conduct and Diſcipline.—Here is no mention of Duties; theſe are reſerved for the ſecond Period, when they come to addreſs to them as Chriſtians.— And indeed nothing could be more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than to exhort them to cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Chriſtian Profeſſion, before they call upon them to practiſe the Duties of it. They muſt firſt own Chriſt for their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, from whom Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands may reaſonably be expected. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Apoſtles all along inſiſt upon the Reaſon they had to acknowledge <hi>this ſame Jeſus which was crucified, and roſe again from the Dead,</hi> to be the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or Saviour of the World; becauſe all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies which went before, concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> were literally fulfilled, or accompliſh'd in him. <hi>Through this Man</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Acts 13 38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>is preached unto you, the Forgiveneſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005554_0017_101866C86FDE0358"/>
of Sins. And by him all that believe are juſtified from all Things from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes.</p>
            <p>Thus Faith and Repentance are the chief Subjects of the Apoſtles Doctrine, during this firſt Period of their Miniſtry; and while they were employ'd in bringing Men over to embrace the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>But if we examine the ſecond Period of their Labours, which they exercis'd towards thoſe who were already Chriſtians, who had profeſs'd their Faith in Chriſt, and had been received into his Church by Baptiſm; we ſhall find that they entirely chang'd their Applications: They no longer now inſiſt upon Faith but Practice: The Duties that we owe to God, to ourſelves, and to one another, are the chief Subjects of their Diſcourſes, in all their Epiſtles to the Chriſtian Churches. They now addreſs to them as Men who had already received the Chriſtian Faith; and therefore exhort them to ſhew forth the Fruits of it in a Chriſtian Converſation.</p>
            <p>Thus St. <hi>James</hi> in his Epiſtle to the twelve Tribes, earneſtly recommends the Duties of a Chriſtian Life; ſuch as Charity, and Prayer, and Thankſgiving, and Patience under
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005554_0018_101866CA2C2C9BE8"/>
Afflictions; and warns them againſt the Vices of Pride and Intemperance, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and raſh Judgment. And becauſe ſome of them had entertain'd that wild Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Sufficiency of Faith, without a ſuitable Practice, he largely handles this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the ſecond Chapter; ſhewing that the Faith of the Goſpel, without performing the Duties of it, will never ſave a Man.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts his Chriſtian Converts, to <note n="(d)" place="bottom">2 Eph <hi>Pet.</hi> chap. 1.5 and following Verſes.</note> 
               <hi>add to their Faith, Virtue, Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godlineſs, Brotherly Kindneſs, Charity;</hi> and aſſures them, that <hi>he who lacketh theſe Things,</hi> is blind, and has forgot his Chriſtian Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>But St. <hi>Paul</hi> is clearer in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>; where he clearly diſtinguiſhes the Principles that are proper to be taught and inſiſted on, with ſuch as have not yet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Chriſtian Religion; ſuch as Faith, and Repentance, and Baptiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the like, from thoſe which are proper to be offer'd to ſuch as are already Chriſtians. The former he compares to <hi>Milk,</hi> which is ſuitable he ſays, to an immature Eſtate and the latter to <hi>ſtrong Meat,</hi> which is adapted to riper

            </p>
            <p>And indeed, not theſe only, but all the Apoſtles employ a great Part of their Epiſtles, in recommending to their ſeveral Converts, to act up to the Profeſſion they had taken upon them; and adorn the Goſpel they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to believe, by living an innocent, good, and uſeful Life: Or in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Phraſe, to <hi>walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith they were called; worthy of God who had called them to his Kingdom and Glory; worthy of the Lord unto all-pleaſing; being fruitful in every good Work, and increaſing in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſuch as had not heard of Chriſt, or been let into the Knowledge of the Goſpel, the neceſſary fundamental Points of Faith and Repentance, were propos'd. The Apoſtles labour'd to convince them that God had choſen this Method of bringing about the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005554_0021_101866D21096B058"/>
Salvation of Mankind.—That he had ſent his Son into the World, who took upon him human Fleſh for this very End and Purpoſe. —And that this Jeſus was he, the very <hi>Meſſiah</hi> thus appointed; in whom theſe Things were to be accompliſhed. And for Proof of this, they produce the Miracles he wrought, the Doctrine he propos'd, the Propheſies long ſince pronounced; and which exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd to point out this very Perſon, and were literally fulfill'd in him; that <hi>thus and thus it was written,</hi> and <hi>thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe again from the Dead.</hi>— And as a Conſequence of all this, they tell the People that it is highly reaſonable, they ſhould lay aſide their former wicked and idolatrous Practices, and place their Hope, their Faith and Obedience in him, as the only Saviour and Mediator between God and Man.—And if any one who had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Chriſtian Faith, began to grow remiſs and careleſs of their Lives, they call upon ſuch Men to remember the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they had made; the Evidences upon which they believed; the Mercy of God in accepting them into Covenant in and through Jeſus Chriſt; and not to forfeit theſe great
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005554_0022_101866D418A182F0"/>
Bleſſings and Advantages thro' the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, or the Suggeſtions of evil Men; but to hold faſt their Profeſſion by Steadfaſtneſs and Perſeverance to the End.</p>
            <p>And if we would imitate the Pattern which our bleſſed Maſter, and theſe his Apoſtles have laid before us; we ſhould make a like Difference in our Addreſſes to theſe different Sorts of Men. When we have Heathen and Infidels to deal withal, we ſhould recommend the Faith and Religion of Chriſt, as the only Way to Salvation: And when we preach to Chriſtians, we muſt ſhow them the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which their holy Profeſſion lays upon them. Not ſpend Time in exhorting them to believe; for this their very Profeſſion ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes they do already; but to preſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to live as becomes Chriſtians; to be found in the Practice of all moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or, in other Words, <hi>to perfect Holineſs in the Fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this ſurely is a moſt reaſonable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Firſt of all to direct ſuch as are loſt and bewilder'd, to the right Way; and then to give them proper Directions to continue in it, till they arrive at their Journey's End. Faith in Chriſt is the lending Principle that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005554_0023_101866D8E3A16A08"/>
enters Men who are loſt and bewilder'd in their Sins and Corruptions, into the Path-Way of Heaven; but being enter'd in the right Way, it would be moſt abſurd to exhort them to be ſtill ſeeking it. They ſhould be encouraged to perſevere, to go on, till they reach their Journey's End. 'Tis true they ſhould be caution'd againſt loſing their Way; that is, they ſhould be exhorted to take good Heed that their Faith do not fail, do not prove weak and wavering at any Difficulties they meet with; and ſo cauſe them to looſe their right Way, to renounce or apoſtatiſe from their Profeſſion.—But then it will be equally Dangerous to ſtand ſtill. They are not to imagine, that having got into the Path-Way of Heaven, they may ſet up their Reſt, they are in a ſafe Condition, and have no more to do, but to truſt in the Goodneſs and Safety of the Way: No, certainly the Way will never carry them to Heaven, unleſs they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and perſevere in it.—They muſt therefore be found in the Practice of all holy Duties; which is the Exerciſe of a Chriſtian, and the only ſure Proof and Evidence of his Progreſs in a ſpiritual Life. <note n="(i)" place="bottom">

            <p>But now if any one ſhould miſunderſtand me after all, and imagine that I leave ſcarce any thing for Faith to do in the Chriſtian Scheme; that I aſſign to it no other uſe than that of a Door only, to let us into the Chriſtian Religion, and then lay it aſide as of no further Service.—I anſwer, that this is widely to miſtake my Meaning and Deſign.—What I aim at, is to ſhow the Weakneſs and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005554_0025_101866E248B25950"/>
Abſurdity of calling upon Chriſtians to <hi>come to Chriſt,</hi> by a naked, barren, and ineffectual Faith, as if that would ſave them, without a ſerious Endeavour to obey his Commands. I would moreover be underſtood, to eſtabliſh both theſe in their reſpective Place and Order. Faith ſtands foremoſt in the Rank of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Graces; for no Man can <hi>come to God,</hi> unleſs he firſt <hi>believe that he is</hi>; nay, one Step further, <hi>unleſs</hi> alſo <hi>he believe that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe that diligently ſeek him.</hi>—But then after this comes Practice.—And now as every Man profeſſes this Faith in Baptiſm, when he firſt enters into the Chriſtian Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, (for this is one neceſſary Condition of the Covenant, <hi>Believe and be baptized. What hinders me,</hi> ſaid the Eunuch to St. <hi>Philip, what hinders me to be baptized?</hi> Why, <hi>if thou believeſt with all thy Heart,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>thou mayeſt?)</hi> I charitably believe that ſuch an one has Faith, till I hear he renounces it again; and therefore I do not exhort him <hi>to believe,</hi> and <hi>to put on Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>to come to Chriſt</hi>; but I exhort him to act up to his Belief; to live ſo as one who believes in Chriſt ought to live; and as the Goſpel of Chriſt requires he ſhould live, if ever he expect Salvation,</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:005554_0026_101866E4118C6A98"/>If it ſhould ſtill be aſk'd, Whether Faith be not a proper Subject to be inſiſted on among Chriſtians? I anſwer, Yes, by all Means; 'tis one of the moſt important Subjects they can be entertained with. Not to exhort them to believe; for this we mull ſuppoſe they do already in ſome good Meaſure; but to exerciſe and encreaſe their Faith.—Faith has various Meaſures and Degrees. There is ſuch a Thing as a ſtrong and a weak Faith; and generally in Proportion to the Strength or Weakneſs of a Chriſtian's Faith, ſo will his Obedience be.—If (for Inſtance) a Man firmly believe a future State of Rewards and Puniſhments; they are Things of ſo much Importance, and do ſo very nearly concern him, that they will almoſt neceſſarily have a great Influence upon his Conduct: But weak Degrees or Meaſures of Faith, will have proportionally weak Effects. And the Apoſtles commonly make uſe of Faith in this Senſe, when they addreſs themſelves to Chriſtians, calling upon them to <hi>grow,</hi> to <hi>increaſe,</hi> to <hi>be ſtrong in the Faith,</hi> to uſe it as a <hi>Shield</hi>; that is, to excerciſe and improve it; and ſundry Expreſſions of like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

            <p>Thus I have largely conſider'd the Nature of our bleſſed Saviour's preaching, and that of his Apoſtles; and have endeavoured to ſhow that the general Drift and Deſign of their Diſcourſes was practical; preſſing and inculcating upon Men every moral Duty, as of abſolute Neceſſity to make them good Chriſtians.</p>

in accommodating this Doctrine to their Hearers.</p>
            <p>And here we ſhall ſurely find, that they made uſe of no Affectation, no obſcure Phraſes, no big ſwelling and pompous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, no frightful Exclamations, no Sounds without Senſe or Meaning, purely to effect and move the Paſſions, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening the Underſtanding, or informing the Judgment; but the whole Drift and Deſign of their Diſcourſes, were calculated to ſerve theſe two great Ends: Firſt to make them wiſer, in order alſo, ſecondly, to make them better Men.—To this Purpoſe their Diſcourſes are plain, and natural, entirely unaffected, always conſiſting of ſuch Phraſes and Expreſſions as flow from the Nature of the Subject; containing ſound Reaſon and nervous Argument, ſuch as is fitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a reaſonable Creature; backed with ſuitable Motives and Perſuaſions to influence their Wills to comply with what their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could not but approve. <note n="(m)" place="bottom">The Language of our bleſſed Saviour, tho' plain and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, is however in many Places, very ſublime; not only in thoſe which St <hi>John</hi> relates, where almoſt every Thing is ſenſibly divine; but in his moſt familiar Diſcourſes.— The Apoſtles wrote in the ſame Manner; with this Difference, that J. Ch. being Maſter of his Doctrine, delivers it calmly. He ſays juſt what he pleaſes; and ſpeaks with the utmoſt Eaſineſs of the heavenly Kingdom and Glory as of his Father's Houſe. All thoſe exalted Things that aſtoniſh us, were natural and familiar to him. He is born there; and only tells us what he ſaw; as he himſelf declares. On the Contrary, the Apoſtles ſometimes ſunk under the Weight of the Truths that were revealed to them.—Hence flow'd Digreſſions, Tranſpoſition of Thought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—But notwithſtanding theſe little Diſorders of their Stile, every Thing in it is natural, noble, lively, and moving.

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005554_0029_101866EA8FF1E4D8"/>
Method of our Saviour and his Apoſtles; and this was treating Men like reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.—They propos'd the moſt weighty Truths to the Underſtanding; confirm'd by ſuch Proof and Evidence as was ſufficient to convince the Mind: They uſed the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and moſt perſuaſive <note n="(n)" place="bottom">The Apoſtles did not ſtudy the vain Pomp and trifling Ornaments of the Heathen Orators. They did not fall into the ſubtil Reaſonings of the Philoſophers, who made all depend upon thoſe airy Speculations; in which they loſt themſelves. They only preach'd Jeſus Chriſt, with all the force and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Simplicity of the Scripture Language. Vide <hi>Cambray</hi>'s <hi>Dial P.</hi> 148.</note> Eloquence to induce them to embrace theſe Truths; and then left them at Liberty to receive or reject their Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles did not uſe the Method which ſome now call Affecting: That is a furious Application to the Paſſions only, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005554_0030_101866F147369690"/>
not to the Underſtanding; whereby Men are ſtupifyed inſtead of being enlightned: <note n="(o)" place="bottom">'Tis the falſe Eloquence I contend againſt.—Some zealous Preachers, under Pretence of apoſtolical Simplicity, do not effectually ſtudy either the Doctrine of Scripture, or the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Manner of Perſuaſion we are taught there. Imagine they need only bawl, and ſpeak often of Hell and the Devil.— 'Tis from the Scripture he ſhould learn to make powerful Impreſſions. There he may learn to make his Diſcourſes plain and popular, without loſing their Force and Dignity. For want of this, the Preacher oftentimes does but ſtun and frighten People; ſo that they remember but few clear Notions; and even the Impreſſions of Terror they receiv'd, are not laſting. This is too ofter a Cloak for Ignorance: And at beſt, is ſuch an unedifying Manner of Addreſs, as cannot be acceptable either to God or Man. Nothing can excuſe ſuch homely Preachers, but the Sincerity of their Intentions. <hi>Ibid P.</hi> 162.</note> But having planted the Seed, the good Word of God in their Minds, left it to the Grace of God, and their own Ingenuity, to bring forth Fruit unto Perfection. They did not in the modern Phraſe, preſume to convert; that they look'd upon as the Work of God's holy Spirit; but only to convince Men. They undertook to <hi>plant</hi>; they carefully <hi>water'd</hi> what they had thus planted; and then hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly waited till <hi>God</hi> ſhould give the <hi>Increaſe.</hi>— They propos'd the moſt important Truths: they exhorted the People to receive that Truth into good and honeſt Hearts; and aſſur'd them, that thus propos'd, and thus receiv'd, God's holy Spirit would nouriſh it up unto
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005554_0031_101866F4A2D06638"/>
Eternal Life.—The Apoſtles <hi>ingrafted the Word</hi>; the People who received that <hi>ingrafted Word with Meekneſs,</hi> found it able to <hi>ſave their Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governor <hi>Felix,</hi> a very wicked Man, did not entertain him with a Set of figurative Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; ſuch as <hi>cloſing with Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>roling himſelf upon Chriſt</hi>; but he ſoberly and earneſtly recommended to him, the Beauty and Neceſſity of <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> founded upon the very weighty Motive of a <hi>future Judgment</hi>; and this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication made the Man tremble, as he had abundant Reaſon: But then he trembled as a Man ought to do, who reflects upon his wicked Life, and how he ſtands expoſed to the Juſtice of God; and not as Children do, who ſuddenly take affright, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they have any reaſonable Ground for their Apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Methods by which the Apoſtles endeavoured to plant and cultivate our holy Faith and Religion; and they were cloſely followed and copied after, in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of thoſe great and good Men, who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Guidance and Conduct of the

Primitive Church. Their Perſuaſions are enforced with powerful Reaſoning, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Motives, not cloath'd with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of falſe Eloquence, nor addreſs'd to the Paſſions of Men only; but chiefly to their Judgment and Underſtandings.<note n="(p)" place="bottom">
                  <p>The Ornaments of ſpeaking, are much degenerated from their original Uſefulneſs. They were at firſt no doubt, an admirable Inſtrument in the Hands of wiſe Men; when they were only employed to deſcribe Goodneſs, Honeſty, Obedience, in larger, fairer, and more moving Images.—But now they are generally chang'd to worſe Uſes. They make the Fancy diſguſt the beſt Things, if they come ſound and unadorn'd. They are in open Defiance againſt Reaſon; profeſſing not to hold much Correſpondence with that; but with its Slaves, the Paſſions.

            <p>And if we would rightly divide the Word of Truth, we muſt undoubtedly copy after theſe great Originals. We muſt exhort, we muſt perſuade, muſt labour to convince Men of the Neceſſity of believing the Goſpel, and of yielding a ſtrict Obedience to the Laws of it. And we muſt enforce and recommend this Doctrine from the Reaſonableneſs, the Beauty, the Neceſſity of it; but above all, from the important Motives of eternal Rewards and Puniſhments, which will be ſure to attend their Neglect or Compliance. And in order to this good End, we muſt point out to them
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005554_0033_101866FC8B23D268"/>
the particular Duties of the Chriſtian Life, and the ſeveral Sins and Temptations that will beſet them in their Chriſtian Courſe; ſhewing them the Reaſonableneſs and Neceſſity of the one, and the Unreaſonableneſs and extream Danger of the other.—Such were the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Apoſtle's Preaching. Such was their Method who ſucceeded them in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church. And ſuch alſo, doubtleſs, ſhould be ours.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is no other conſiſtent Method can be uſed, ſince Inſpiration and Miracles have ceaſed. For we cannot ſpeak immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Heart; 'tis God's Prerogative to influence that; and they are wretched Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors who pretend to it. And ſhould we addreſs to the Paſſions only, it would be a ſhameful betraying of our Truſt.—Our chief Province therefore is with the Underſtanding. This we may inform, this we may enlighten, this we may inſtruct and convince. The Will alſo may urge and perſuade, by ſuitable Motives, Encouragements, Exhortations. The Affections alſo we may move by proper Repreſentations: But this is all we can do. We can't convert; that is the Work of God's holy Spirit. We can't force the Will, this the Grace of God muſt gently incline. And
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005554_0034_101866FF8CEC3A40"/>
whether the Spirit of God will work theſe Effects within Men, depend upon their own humble Deſires and Endeavours. We may preach the ſincere Word of God; we may inſtruct the Mind, inform the Judgment, and inlighten the Underſtanding; and having done this, we can do no more: The Reſt we muſt leave to God and to ourſelves. But if to this, Men will join an honeſt upright Heart, if they will receive the Word with Meekneſs, if they will endeavour to bend their Will to an humble Reception and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what is thus taught, the Influences of God's holy Spirit, will never be wanting to render theſe our humble and mutual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and endeavours effectual to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Upon the Whole, from what has been all along ſaid, I think it plainly appears, that they who of late have ſo zealouſly undertaken the Revival of Religion amongſt us, have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Doctrine, Method, or Language, copy'd after the Example of our bleſſed Saviour or his Apoſtles, in their Preaching; but in the Room of that native Simplicity and Eloquence with which the Scriptures of the New Teſtament abound, have ſubſtituted a boiſterous Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Paſſions, cloathed in dark unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Forms, and figurative Expreſſions;

                  <p>—There are two Extremes to be avoided; the frigid Stile and the Boyiſh: The former renders a Diſcourſe dry and inſipid, by a languor and flatneſs of Expreſſion; the latter ungrateful and ſhocking, by a ſwelling of Loftineſs and affected Amplification: It abounds with too violent Exaggerations and too laborious Figures</p>

               </note> and which therefore, as they are given us without Explication, can be eſteem'd but as ſpeaking to the Air.—Some weak and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious People have been pleaſed indeed to term it an awakening Method of Preaching; by which, if they mean their Attention is awakened, I readily grant it; but ſure it will never awaken any Man's Reaſon, ſo as to make wiſer; much leſs will it make him wiſe unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be aſk'd, Why Men profit no more under the preſent Adminiſtration of the Goſpel, and thoſe Means which God affords to build us up in Holineſs unto Life Eternal?—I anſwer; the Fault is not in the Means; but in the Neglect of applying them in a hearty, ſerious and affectionate Manner.—While Men are looking abroad, they ſhould be ſeeking at home for the true Reaſon of their Unfruitfulneſs.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005554_0036_10186704C7606998"/>
And inſtead of ſeeking new Ways and Means of Edification, they ſhould be perſuaded to let thoſe they enjoy, have their proper and natural Influence.</p>
            <p>And what renders the Caſe extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, is, that there are never wanting ſuch, whoſe Intereſt it is to teach and cheriſh theſe miſconceived Opinions; and who endeavour to confirm Men in charging the Fault of their Barrenneſs upon the Profeſſion they embrace, the Guide they follow, the Inſtructions they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the Prayers they join in, or the like. Now nothing ſtrikes in better with Men's corrupt Inclinations than this; for they are willing the Fault ſhould reſt any where, rather than with themſelves; And being not fond of much Pains, are ready to hearken to ſuch as offer to lighten their Burden, and promiſe them Heaven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Labour or Trouble; without ſo much as the Pains of growing wiſer or better.</p>
            <p>This, it muſt be confeſs'd, is a melancholly Conſideration.—Yet we, my Brethren, who have the Honour to ſerve at the Altar, have no Reaſon to deſpond, or to be diſheartned at theſe Difficulties. The Reproaches of unreaſonable or miſtaken Men, are Things we are taught to expect, from the Examples of thoſe great and good Men who are gone before us, who in
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005554_0037_10186709A0AD6AE0"/>
their Generation alſo endured the ſame Sight of Afflictions; had their Miniſtry traduc'd, and all their pious Labours miſrepreſented and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly defam'd. And in truth, by how much the more Regular and Diſcreetly they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, by ſo much the Greater was the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition they met with.—And tho' nothing can afford us greater Satisfaction of Mind, than to ſee the Intereſts of Religion, and the Kingdom of Chriſt eſtabliſh'd, or gaining Ground in the Hearts of Men; yet ſhould we by no means be diſcouraged, tho' our Labours often fail of that Succeſs we hoped to reap from them. We are taught with Meekneſs and Patience to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs our Souls under theſe Diſappointments, and to wait God's good time to render theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſucceſsful.—While we are contending with the perverſe Oppoſition of a wicked and corrupt World, and endeavouring to captivate Mankind to the Obedience of Chriſt, can it be thought ſtrange, that the Powers of Darkneſs ſhould ariſe againſt us? 'Tis doubtleſs what we ought to expect, and ſhould therefore never be unprepar'd for.—'Tis our Duty to be doing all we can, never to faint or grow weary; but beg and intercede with God perpetually, for ſtill greater Degrees of his Grace, that we may be enabled to go on in this ſpiritual Warfare,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005554_0038_1018670CC72A2AE0"/>
conquering and to conquer.—When our Duty lies thus plainly before us, he muſt ſurely be a very weak or unſteady Man, who can be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from it, by the Oppoſitions of Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the Miſrepreſentations of miſtaken Zeal. It muſt indeed be confeſs'd, that to preſerve a ſteady, regular, uniform Conduct, is a very difficult Thing. To feel all our own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and Infirmities, and be obliged at the ſame Time to contend with the Perverſeneſs of other People, is doubtleſs a very difficult Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and ſuch, as without a large Portion of the divine Aſſiſtance, we ſhall very ill diſcharge. —Whereas to give a looſe to Ambition or Pride, to a licentious unbounded Character, is very agreeable to our corrupt Nature, and not difficult to excel in. It muſt not therefore be thought ſtrange, if thoſe who deſpair to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd in the orderly regular Way, which the Authority of God and Man have mark'd out to them, ſhould deſpiſe and caſt off theſe Reſtraints, which confine their ambitious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſhould give an unbounded Scope to their lawleſs Deſires.</p>
            <p>It has been the Glory of our Church always to oppoſe itſelf to ſuch Exceſſes, whether they ariſe from Superſtition or from an oppoſite Character, from Weakneſs of Underſtanding,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005554_0039_1018670E4BBC2E50"/>
or from Perverſeneſs of Will. And we have Reaſon to bleſs God, that thoſe who ſerve at her Altars, have generally been ſo modeſt, as to be content with that excellent Proviſion, and the Wiſdom of thoſe Rules which ſhe has preſcribed to their Conduct.—And doubtleſs it would contribute much to the Succeſs of our Miniſtry, and to our Conſolation in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it, if you my Brethren of the Laity, would pay the ſame Deference and Regard to the Preſcriptions of our Church; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to diſcountenance all Diſorders, and whatever has a Tendency to overthrow the Peace and Unity of the Church.—It is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs your Duty to try all Things; but having found out that which is wiſe and good, ye will do well to hold it faſt; and not ſpend your whole Lives in ſeeking after new Things, or in giving ear to very one, who ſhall be ſo vain and preſumptuous as to tell ye that ye are wrong.—A wavering unſettled Diſpoſition of Mind, is ſurely of as ill Conſequence as an obſtinate untractable Inflexibility: As one ſhuts out all Light from the Underſtanding, ſo the other confounds, by the various and contrary Refractions of its Rays.—A Medium in this, as in all other Caſes, is the true Center of Repoſe.—It is a very eaſy Thing to beſtow
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005554_0040_1018671143D65878"/>
ill Names upon the beſt Things; but as ye muſt be ſuppoſed to underſtand the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof ye have profeſt yourſelves Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it will diſcover a great Degree ef Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at leaſt, to give ſo much as an Ear to thoſe who would draw ye off from this, till they have agreed upon ſomething to ſubſtitute in its Stead.—If ye ſteadfaſtly continue in the Things ye have learned, till that time comes, ye will be in no great Danger of a Change.</p>
            <p>Would ye be perſuaded to ſet about pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing your future Intereſt, with the ſame Caution and Zeal which ye beſtow upon your temporal Concerns, ye would not be liable to be practiſed on by ignorant or by deſigning Men; but would ſoon arrive at ſuch Degrees of humble Confidence in God, as would afford you much Comfort here, and end in the Fulneſs of Joy hereafter.</p>
            <p>Which God Almighty grant may be the Portion of us all, for the Sake of his Son Jeſus Chriſt: To whom with the Holy Ghoſt, be Glory, Honour, and Power, now, and forevermore. AMEN.</p>
