            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Writer of the following Dramatic Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, imagines that no apology will be neceſſary for it's publication: The tranſactions referred to, were ſingular and important, and deſerve to be known and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, by every friend to his country, throughout the United States; for whether it is believed or not, yet it is an indubitable truth, that that State or Kingdom is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, with a rapid ſtep, to its final diſſolution, wherein ſuch execrable villainies are connived at, and ſuch eminent patriotiſm diſapproved of, as are diſplayed in the following pages.</p>
            <p>It is expected that the Performance will be conſidered as a true and impartial hiſtory of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, and not as a work of fancy: The Writer choſe this dreſs, as it ſuited his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of repreſenting things after the real life, better than any other; and the materials he was furniſhed with, being principally depoſitions given under oath, were more eaſily digeſted into it verbatim; and he can aſſure the world, that from this, and other ſources equally certain, he obtained ſuch a clear and poſitive knowledge of the whole affair, that he thinks he can ſafely vouch for the truth and juſtneſs of every material circumſtance in the portrait; and that he can, under proper advantages, bring ſatisfactory proof for their ſupport: He therefore claims no merit, nor demerit, further than the bare collation, and hopes to be ſecured from any ſevere reflections of the critical reader, upon the language, the characters or the drama. That every inhabitant of the United States may always for the future, receive his juſt deſerts, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion no more be given, for complaints of a ſimilar kind, is the ſincere wiſh of</p>

            <l>But here our author far exceeds the reſt,</l>
            <l>He dwelt unnoticed in the villian's breaſt,</l>

            <l>Sprung forth, increas'd, and ripen'd for the deed;</l>
            <l>While Satan, pouring in th' invenom'd gall,</l>
            <l>Conducted, guided, and aſſiſted all.</l>
            <l>Far diſtant ſince, before the world began,</l>

            <l>Satan, that firſt old vile arch traitor, fell,</l>

            <l>The great Supreme, in vengeance, quick prepar'd,</l>
            <l>A fi'ry priſon;—treaſon's juſt reward:</l>
            <l>And thunders rolling from th' Almighty's throne,</l>
            <l>To hell's dark centre, drove the traitors down:</l>

                  <p>It cannot be expected, that we ſhall do all at once; —we muſt do every thing we can, and leave the reſt to Providence:—The firſt thing to be done, is to circulate as much counterfeit money as poſſible:—Money, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, is the ſinews of war;—it is a hinge on which all their movements turn;—and we all know that <hi>America</hi> has none, but are ſenſible at the ſame time that their paper currency, has been a ſubſtitute for it, and has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all the purpoſes of ſolid coin:—Now to deſtroy the credit of this, is to baffle them in their only reſource.</p>

                  <p>Oh!

                  <p>That's the eaſieſt part of the whole:—The bare Idea of hard money, is ſo bewitching to Men, who have ſo long been deſtitute of it, that the conſideration of a trifling ſum in proſpect, will induce the hotteſt Whig in the State, to abandon his principles, deſert the cauſe of his Country, and join heartily with us, in ſubverting it's Independency.</p>

                     <p>My dear friends, we have all great reaſon to rejoice, and be very thankful, that we've got through with thoſe difficulties ſo well as we have;—but I'm much afraid that the troubles won't end here:—<hi>Frankly,</hi> and one or two of his friends, who have been faithful to him, are much chagrin'd, and exaſperated, at their diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I doubt they have friends enough to procure an over-hawling of the affair, which would yet be attended with dreadful conſequences; we muſt, therefore, have a meeting immediately, at your houſe, Mr. <hi>Gibber,</hi> to talk the matter over, and lay the foundation of ſome new plans.</p>

                     <speaker>Gibb.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Plunk.</speaker>
                     <p>You'll attend, Mr. <hi>Fidfaddy,</hi> and give notice to all true friends.</p>

            <head>EPILOGUE, To be Spoken by Mrs. <hi>GIBBER.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>I'VE often heard it repreſented,</l>
            <l>That women cannot be contented,</l>
            <l>Unleſs at liberty to gabble,</l>
            <l>And imitate a Yankee rabble;</l>
            <l>Or the mix'd rumbling of a mill;</l>
            <l>Or waggons clatt'ring down a hill:</l>
            <l>In ſuch wild var'egated clamours,</l>
            <l>There's much of ſcandal, much of amours.</l>
            <l>With much of nonſenſe, and defaming,</l>
            <l>And much not worth, nor fit the naming;</l>
            <l>And to keep up the noiſy clatter,</l>
            <l>We're often forc'd, for want of matter,</l>
            <l>Our greateſt ſecrets to reveal,</l>
            <l>And blab out things we ſhould conceal,</l>
            <l>Betray the cauſe we have eſpous'd,</l>
            <l>And get our Huſbands foundly ſous'd:</l>
            <l>But if you've ſeen the play to night,</l>
            <l>You'll ſwear, that all was ſaid in ſpite,</l>
            <l>And that af'rall theſe plaguy jokes,</l>
            <l>We women ſtill are clever folks,</l>
            <l>Are always wiſe, and good and kind,</l>
            <l>No miſchief dwells within our mind;</l>
            <l>Think much, talk little, ſoftly too,</l>
            <l>We tell no tales, are chaſte and true:</l>
            <l>When an event has taken place,</l>
            <l>We knew it well before it was.</l>
            <l>And can declare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when things we ſee,</l>
            <l>We told exactly how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey'd be;</l>
            <l>We are, like turtle doves, moſt harmleſs,</l>
            <l>Ne'er breed confuſion in our fam'lies,</l>
            <l>Nor raiſe diſorders in the State,</l>
            <l>Nor vent our malice, ſpleen, or hate:</l>
            <l>Shou'd you ſuppoſe 'twere otherwiſe,</l>
            <l>'Tis a deception of your eyes;</l>
            <l>And if you ever find intrigues,</l>
            <l>'Tis fate has plan'd them, or the Whigs:</l>

               <pb facs="unknown:017918_0086_0FA37BD303216058"/>No Tory, male or female's found,</l>
            <l>Obſcurely working under ground,</l>
            <l>Or ever once his cauſe forſook,</l>
            <l>Or e'er trod back the ſtep he'd took;</l>
            <l>But Whigs, thoſe inconſiſtent elves,</l>
            <l>Will mob us firſt, and then themſelves;</l>
            <l>Contrive deep plans to undermine us;</l>
            <l>But quickly change their minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and join us;</l>
            <l>Fight all the Reg'lars in <hi>New-York,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yet help them onward in their work;</l>
            <l>Give them their money, and proviſion,</l>
            <l>And ſink the Country to perdition:</l>
            <l>So if the land is overturn'd,</l>
            <l>Themſelves all kill'd, their towns all burn'd,</l>
            <l>With not a houſe, or ſoul upon it,</l>
