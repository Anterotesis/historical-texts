            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Jehovah is our Judge —
<note n="†" place="bottom">The Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is mentioned three times in the Original.</note> GOD is this, and much more to his People: He ſuſtains theſe Offices for them in an Eminent and Tranſcendent manner. And theſe words may in a particular manner refer to the Second Perſon in the Godhead, to whom the Father hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all Judgment, and exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour. I ſhall ſpeak to them under a fourfold Conſideration as they lie in the Text.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Verb</hi> is obſerv'd to ſignify to Judge, to paſs Sentence, and to execute Judgment. The Power of a Judge is Executive, and his Buſineſs is to take care that the Laws be duly Executed. As the Word is uſed in Scripture, and applyed to GOD, it ſignifieth his plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cauſe of his People, and delivering them out of the hands of them that oppreſs them. GOD is the Judge of all Men, and hath appointed a Day in which he will Judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath Ordained. But then this is the peculiar Privilege of the People of GOD, that their<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002957_0006_0FE6A564428464D8"/>Lord is their Judge. Thus it is promiſed, Deut. 32.36. <hi>The Lord ſhall judge his People.</hi> Heb. 12.22. Ye are come unto Mount Zion, to GOD the <hi>Judge of all.</hi> And indeed theſe words of our Text may look forward as far as the laſt and general Judgment. The Servants of GOD commit their cauſe unto him, and he doth and will appear to doe them Juſtice againſt their oppreſſours. They have a gracious and favourable acceſs to GOD's Judgment Seat, and it is their ſtrong Conſolation that all Judgment is committed to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their Head and Redeemer: Having their Perſons juſtified thro' his Righteouſneſs, and being ſanctified by his Spirit; They may ſay, Job 13.18, 19. <hi>I know I ſhall be juſtified. Who is he that will plead with me?</hi> Here to ſhew what may be implied in GOD's being the Judge of his People. We may ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THIS may imply, <hi>That GOD appoints and orders out to them the Judgments inflicted on them in this Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD in his Providence chaſtiſeth his People for their Iniquities in this Life; but then he Corrects them with <hi>Judgment.</hi> He ſometimes makes uſe even of wicked Men, as the Rod of his Anger in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; however he ſets bounds to their Rage. There's a vaſt difference between the Judgments GOD brings on his People, and on impenitent Sinners, as to the ground of them, and their final Iſſue. GOD loveth his People while he chaſtens them; he deſigns their Good by their Afflictions, and gives them reaſon to ſay, It is good for them that they have been afflicted. 1 Cor. 11.32. <hi>When we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>GOD will acquit his People, and declare their Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN this World their Judgment is often taken away. Their Right is turned away before the moſt High, and their Cauſe perverted. Many a time have they been miſrepreſented accus'd and condemn'd unjuſtly;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002957_0007_0FE6A5AAF8A870B8"/>but GOD will admit their Appeal, and reverſe theſe Judgments. Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right? Moſt certainly he will. The great Day will be the Revelation of the Judgment of GOD, when all ſhall be able to diſcern between the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the Wicked, and be obliged to own, <hi>There is a GOD who judgeth in the Earth.</hi> For then will he give to his People the <hi>white Stone</hi> in the moſt Publick manner, and pronounce them Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before the whole World. Their Judgment ſhall be brought forth as the light, and their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as the Noon-day. Pſal. 96.10. — <hi>He ſhall judge the people righteouſly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As their Judge, <hi>GOD will give his People a glorious Reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Lord JESUS CHRIST who hath purchas'd the recompence of Reward by his perfect Obedience in doing and ſuffering the Will of GOD, makes that gracious Promiſe, <hi>Be thou ſaithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 2.10.</note>. The SON OF GOD will Reward his People according to their Works, tho' all be of free Grace. Some Rewards he gives his Diſciples upon Earth as an Earneſt: There are temporal and ſpiritual Bleſſings, which they now receive, and in the great Day of Judgment they ſhall receive a Crown of Righteouſneſs. 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give at that Day; and not to me only; but to all them that love his appearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. IT may imply, <hi>That GOD will execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on their implacable Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VENGEANCE is the LORD'S, and he will repay it. 2 Theſ. 1.6. <hi>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you,</hi> GOD hath often appear'd for his People in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he hath executed on their Enemies.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002957_0008_0FE6A571610B03D0"/>Thus he appear'd as the Judge of his People when he over-threw <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Hoſt in the Red-Sea. Thus did he appear when he rais'd up <hi>Judges</hi> who were Inſtruments in his hand of delivering his People, and deſtroying their Enemies. Thus will CHRIST appear when he ſhall deſtroy <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> by the Brightneſs of his Coming. And thus in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner, when he ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming Fire, taking Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them that know not his Name, and obey not his Goſpel
<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſ 1.8, 9.</note>. For then ſhall <hi>thoſe Enemies of GOD and his People,</hi> be <hi>puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>USE 2. LEARN, <hi>That it is a very dangerous thing falſely to Accuſe, and wrongfully Condemn the People of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT hath been common for them to have things laid to their Charge they are not guilty of. The Chriſtians were a <hi>Sect every where ſpoken againſt,</hi> Acts 28.22. They are often dreſs'd up in Bear-skins that they may be baited. But Wo to ſuch as do in this way hinder them from doing or receiving Good: For GOD will plead their Cauſe in the Day of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. And dreadful, very dreadful will their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation be who ſhall then be found guilty of this crying Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>THIS ſhould Comfort GOD's People under all the Reproaches &amp; Evils they are loaded with in this World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHO is he that Condemneth, it is GOD that Juſtifieth? They may indeed for the preſent be under great difficulties upon this account.

               <p>BUT now, GOD is in a more appropriate ſenſe a Law-giver to his People, in that he gives them his <hi>written Word,</hi> and writes his Laws in their Hearts by his Spirit. Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his judgments unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any nation.</hi> GOD's ancient People received from him the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> Exod. 20. Deut. 32.2. <hi>The Lord came from mount Sinai — from his right hand went a fiery Law for them —. It was delivered out of the midſt of the fire.</hi> The <hi>Ceremonial Law;</hi> containing the Ordinances of GOD's Worſhip appropriated to the Church State under that Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Eph. 2.15. <hi>He aboliſh'd in his fleſh the law of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contain'd in ordinances.</hi> And now our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR as the only Head of his Church, and Lord of his own Houſe, hath appointed thoſe Laws and Ordinances whereby he will have his profeſſing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple govern'd to the End of the World. Mat. 28.10, 20. <hi>Go ye teach all Nations — Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you</hi> —. He hath given the moſt excellent Rules for regulating his People both with reſpect to their inward and outward Man. And theſe bind the Conſcience; for they are His, who is the Lord of Conſcience.</p>

               <p>DISOBEDIENCE to the Laws of GOD, our Maker and Sovereign, muſt needs be a great Evil. This brought Diſorder and Confuſion into the World at firſt. The Sins of the Heathen are provoking to

How much more heinous muſt be the Sin of thoſe who have the written Word of GOD, GOD Articl'd againſt his People of old that he had <hi>written to them the great things of his Law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing,</hi> Hoſ. 8.12.

               <p>THEY were all by Nature under the Dominion of Sin, and Tyranny of Satan, who Rules in the Hearts of the Children of Diſobedience. Having rebelled againſt their rightful Lord, they became the Slaves of this Uſurper. But now our Lord JESUS CHRIST caſts down Satan from his uſurped Throne, and ſets up his Kingdom in the Hearts of his People, 2 Gor. 10.4, 5. <hi>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty thro' God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi> He hath reconciled them that were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in their Minds by wicked Works
<note n="†" place="bottom">Col. 1.21.</note>, bound the ſtrong one, and ſpoil'd him of his goods. When He pleaſeth, in his majeſty he rides proſperouſly becauſe of truth and righteouſneſs: His arrows of Conviction are ſharp in the Hearts of his Enemies, and they fall down under him, being ſubdued to the obedience of Faith.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THEY that belong to his viſible Kingdom, own him as their King, and ſwear Allegiance to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> by which their ſolemn Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to be his faithful and obedient Subjects, are ſign'd &amp; ſeal'd. And true Believers ſwear with all their hearts. CHRIST is their Head and LORD by their own voluntary Choice and free Election: for he inclines their Hearts to accept of him by his victorious Power &amp; Grace. When his Spirit comes upon them, they ſay, Thine we are, O Son of <hi>David,</hi> and on thy ſide. <hi>O Lord our God, other Lords have had domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name,</hi> Iſa. 26.13.

Let the Title of earthly Princes be ever ſo Juſt, yet ſometimes their People are Rebellious, and will not do the Homage which is their due. But when the Lord JESUS CHRIST takes to himſelf his great Power and Reigns, there's a mighty Change made on the Hearts of his Subjects, ſo that they bow down and ſubmit to his equal Scepter, and that with a willing Mind.</p>

               <p>HE is the Lord of this ſpiritual Houſe. Heb. 3.6. <hi>But Chriſt as a Son over his own Houſe: whoſe Houſe are we</hi> —.

<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 51.7.</note>.

               <p>THE words of our Text, as we have heard, may be applied to him, tho' not excluding the other Perſons, the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, which Three are One GOD. Certainly then, our Saviour appears to be very

Indeed in the Execution of his Office he died once; but then in our Nature he roſe a Conqueror on the Third Day, having aboliſhed Death, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high. Let us then realize the Glory of this Divine Perſon, who is our Judge and Law-giver, King and Saviour, and glorify him as GOD; for this is the Father's deſign in inveſting his Son with theſe great Offices.

               <p>THE Scriptures of Truth ſpeak of <hi>Kings</hi> as the <hi>Breath of their Subjects noſtrils</hi>

Upon ſo great an Occaſion as this, they may well take up that Lamentation, Lam. 5.16, 17. <hi>The Crown is fallen</hi> —. For this our Heart is faint, our Eyes are dim. And it hath been the commendable Practice of GOD's profeſſing People to Lament the Fall of ſuch whom GOD had ſet at their Head, in the Civil Government.

                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">It deſerves a thankful Remark, that thro' the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD, the Peace was ſo far brought forward before His Majeſty's Death.</note>. LORD, We are dumb &amp; open not our Mouths becauſe thou haſt done it. Job 9.12. <hi>Behold he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will ſay unto him, what doeſt thou?</hi> Let us then duly reſent this awful <hi>Blow</hi> of GOD's hand, and relent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. Let us Weep over this Great Man; for the <hi>Beauty</hi> of Iſrael, the <hi>Mighty</hi> is fallen.

But I preſume not to draw his <hi>Character;</hi> an attempt too great and high for me. My main deſign is to make a <hi>Religious Improvement</hi> of this ſurpriſing Providence: Hath GOD remov'd our KING in this <hi>Critical Juncture,</hi> when Affairs ſtill look with a dubious Aſpect, when the Eyes of ſo many were upon him, and his People might be ready to ſay, under his ſhadow we ſhall live. Let us then <hi>Ceaſe from Man whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils.</hi> The Lord now ſpeaks once, yea twice, in his Word and by his Providence, and his Voice to us is that, Pſal. 146.3, 4. <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002957_0025_0FE6A5C7603F10E0"/>periſh.</hi> Iſa. 2.22. Ceaſe ye from Man, whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils: <hi>for wherein is he to be accounted of.</hi> All Nations before GOD are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſs then nothing and vanity. GOD holds the breath of the moſt Mighty Princes in his hand, and can ſtop it in a Moment. And while they Live they can be no more to us than he is pleaſed to make them. In vain is Salvation hoped for from theſe Hills — in the Lord our GOD is the Salvation of his People. And therefore while we give them that honor which is their dne. We muſt <hi>look off</hi> from them, not truſting in an Arm of Fleſh. And on the contrary, <hi>We ſhould look to our Glorious Lord, who is King in Zion, and place our truſt in him.</hi> This is our Support that the Lord Omnipotent reigns. The Great GOD our Saviour teſtifieth, Rev. 1.18. <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive forever more,</hi> Amen; and have the Keys of Hell

               </p>
               <p>IN a word, <hi>Let Civil Rulers realize their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi> and Act under this view that they muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be call'd to give up their Account to GOD the Judge of all.
