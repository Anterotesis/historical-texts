            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ELECTION SERMON.</head>
            <p>I THINK myſelf happy that, after reiterated invitations from this honourable Court, I am at length permitted by divine providence, though under peculiar difficulties, and in the decline of life, to appear in this place, and ſpeak on this public occaſion, when the principal officers of government are to be appointed to their ſeveral departments, according to the ſuffrages of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I will endeavor to give due honor to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the people, while I declare, with ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart and honeſt freedom, the admonitions which the great Lord of the univerſe gives; and offer my beſt thoughts as to the general adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of public affairs, and the way to ſecure the proſperity and happineſs of a nation.</p>
            <p>There is a remarkable paragraph in the ſacred writings, which may be very well accommodated to my preſent purpoſe, and merits particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. You have it in</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:021192_0005_0FB2AF424A2CD008"/>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>DEUTERONOMY, IV, 5—8.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <p>Behold, I have taught you ſtatutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye ſhould do ſo in the land whither ye go to poſſeſs it. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and your underſtanding in the ſight of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who ſhall hear all theſe ſtatutes, and ſay, ſurely this great nation is a wiſe and underſtanding peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for what nation is there ſo great, which hath God ſo nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? and what nation is there ſo great, which hath ſtatutes and judgments ſo righteous as all this law which I ſet before you this day.</p>
            </q>
            <p>HERE Moſes recommends to Iſrael the ſtrict obſervance of all the laws which he had delivered to them by God's command, relating both to their civil polity and religion, as the ſure way to raiſe their reputation high among all nations as a wiſe and underſtanding people; becauſe no other nation was bleſſed with ſuch excellent nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal laws, or the advantage of applying to the oracle of the living God, and praying to him in all difficulties, with aſſurance that all their requeſts would be anſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:021192_0006_0FB2AF43D11F3978"/>As to every thing excellent in their conſtitution of government, except what was peculiar to them as a nation ſeparated to God from the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the Iſraelites may be conſidered as a pattern to the world in all ages; and from them we may learn what will exalt our character, and what will depreſs and bring us to ruin.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore look over their conſtitution and laws, enquire into their practice, and obſerve how their proſperity and fame depended on their ſtrict obſervance of the divine commands both as to their government and religion.</p>
            <p>They had both a civil and military eſtabliſhment under divine direction, and a complete body of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial laws drawn up and delivered to them by Moſes in God's name. They had alſo a form of religious worſhip, by the ſame authority, minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſcribed, deſigned to preſerve among them the knowledge of the great Creator of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and teach them to love and ſerve him; while idolatry prevailed through the reſt of the world: and this religion contained not only a public ritual, but a perfect, though very conciſe, ſyſtem of morals, comprehended in ten commands, which require the perfection of godlineſs, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and rectitude of conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:021192_0007_0FB2AF4556447080"/>When firſt the Iſraelites came out from the bondage of Egypt, they were a multitude without any other order than what had been kept up, very feebly, under the ancient patriarchal authority. They were ſuddenly collected into a body under the conduct of Moſes, without any proper nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or military regulation. Yet in the ſhort ſpace of about three months after they had paſſed the red ſea, they were reduced into ſuch civil and military order, blended together by the advice of Jethro, as was well adapted to their circumſtances in the wilderneſs while deſtitute of property. Able men were choſen out of all their tribes, and made cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and rulers of thouſands, hundreds, fifties and tens: and theſe commanded them as military of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and acted as judges in matters of common controverſy.</p>
            <p>But the great thing wanting was a permanent conſtitution, which might keep the people peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and obedient while in the deſert, and after they had gained poſſeſſion of the promiſed land. Therefore, upon the complaint of Moſes that the burden of government was too heavy for him, God commanded him to bring ſeventy men, choſen from among the elders and officers, and preſent them at the tabernacle; and there he endued
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021192_0008_0FB2AF4795EBB1C0"/>
them with the ſame ſpirit which was in Moſes, that they might bear the burden with him. Thus a Senate was evidently conſtituted, as neceſſary for the future government of the nation, under a chief commander. And as to the choice of this Senate, doubtleſs the people were conſulted, who appear to have had a voice in all public affairs from time to time, the whole congregation being called together on all important occaſions: the government therefore was a proper republic.</p>
            <p>And beſide this general eſtabliſhment, every tribe had elders and a prince according to the patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal order, with which Moſes did not interfere; and theſe had an acknowledged right to meet and conſult together, and with the conſent of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation do whatever was neceſſary to preſerve good order, and promote the common intereſt of the tribe. So that the government of each tribe was very ſimilar to the general government. There was a Preſident and Senate at the head of each, and the people aſſembled and gave their voice in all great matters: for in thoſe ages the people in all republics were entirely unacquainted with the way of appointing delegates to act for them, which is a very excellent modern improvement in the management of republics.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:021192_0009_0FB2AF49124BF5C0"/>Moreover, to compleat the eſtabliſhment of civil government, courts were to be appointed in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry walled city, after their ſettlement in Canaan, and elders moſt diſtinguiſhed for wiſdom and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity were to be made judges, ready always to ſit and decide the common controverſies within their reſpective juriſdictions. The people had a right likewiſe to appoint ſuch other officers as they might think neceſſary for the more effectual execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice, according to that order given in DEUT. 16.18, 19.—<q>Judges and officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy tribes; and they ſhall judge the people with juſt judgment: thou ſhalt not wreſt judgment; thou ſhalt not reſpect perſons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wiſe, and pervert the words of the righteous.</q>—But from theſe courts an appeal was allowed in weighty cauſes to higher courts appointed over the whole tribe, and in very great and difficult caſes to the ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the general Senate and chief magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>A government, thus ſettled on republican prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, required laws; without which it muſt have degenerated immediately into ariſtocracy, or abſolute monarchy. But God did not leave a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wholly unſkilled in legiſlation, to make laws
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021192_0010_0FB2AF4A8784D9B8"/>
for themſelves: he took this important matter wholly into his own hands, and beſide the moral laws of the two tables, which directed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as individuals, gave them by Moſes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete code of judicial laws. They were not nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous indeed, but conciſe and plain, and eaſily appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to almoſt every controverſy which might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe between man and man, and every criminal caſe which might require the judgment of the court. Of theſe ſome were peculiarly adapted to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional form, as divided into tribes and families al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be kept diſtinct; others were eſpecially ſuited to the peculiar nature of the government as a theocraſy, God himſelf being eminently their king, and manifeſting himſelf among them in a viſible manner, by the cloud of glory in the tabernacle and temple. This was the reaſon why blaſphemy, and all obſtinate diſobedience to his laws, were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as high treaſon, and puniſhed with death; eſpecially idolatry, as being a crime againſt the fundamental principles of the conſtitution. But far the greater part of the judicial laws were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the plain immutable principles of reaſon, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and ſocial virtue; ſuch as are always neceſſary for civil ſociety. Life and property were well guarded, and puniſhments were equitably adapted to the nature of every crime: in particular,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021192_0011_0FB2AF4DCF5F93D0"/>
murder ſtands foremoſt among capital crimes, and is defined with ſuch preciſion, and ſo clearly diſtinguiſhed from all caſes of accidental and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigned killing, that the innocent were in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of puniſhment, and the guilty could not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. And if we ſtill pay regard to this divine law, which is evidently founded on reaſon and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the modern diſtinction of manſlaughter muſt be rejected as a popiſh invention, contrived and added in times when ſuperſtition reigned and claimed a power above all laws. Theſe laws were ſufficient for a nation which had but little commerce abroad; eſpecially as the oracle of Jehovah might be conſulted in all caſes of a very extraordinary nature.</p>
            <p>Let us now conſider the national worſhip which God eſtabliſhed among his people; on which their obedience to the moral law very much depended: for unleſs they paid conſtant reverence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to their God, agreeable to his nature and will, they would ſoon break looſe from all other obligations to morality.</p>
            <p>Now as to their ritual; however contemptible, and even ridiculous, it may ſeem to men whoſe ideas are all modern, and who proudly contemn
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021192_0012_0FB2AF5403F025F0"/>
divine revelation; and notwithſtanding it is now abrogated by a far more glorious revelation of grace and truth by Jeſus Chriſt; no religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution could be more perfectly accommodated to thoſe early ages of the world, and the ſituation of the Iſraelites in the midſt of idolaters, or better prepare the way for the truth and mercy of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. In thoſe ages the minds of men were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cultivated to receive that religion which is ſpiritual and ſimple, detached from ſenſible objects, and deſtitute of worldly grandeur. Other nations worſhipped their gods with an endleſs variety of ſuperſtitious rites, a multitude of coſtly ſacrifices, and all kinds of external pomp, which they fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would be acceptable to deities to whom they attributed the imperfections and even the worſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men. Their worſhip gratified all the ſenſes, was accommodated to every paſſion and luſt, and indulgent to groſs immoralities; it not only cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated vulgar minds, but bound the greateſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, politicians, and philoſophers, faſt in the chains of ſuperſtition. Therefore it was neceſſary that the worſhip of the true God ſhould not be deſtitute of that ſplendour which, in thoſe ages, ſtruck the minds of men with awe and reverence. Without ſome magnificence the beſt religion would have appeared contemptible in the view of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021192_0013_0FB2AF577AC7B2F0"/>
world; and the Iſraelites themſelves, dazzled with the pageantry of idols, would almoſt inevitably have been captivated; as, notwithſtanding every guard which could be placed about them, we find the faſhion of the reſt of the world had ſurpriſing power over them. But the ceremonies of worſhip which God commanded his people to obſerve, were not, like thoſe of the heathen, inhuman, frantic, obſcene, varied a thouſand ways according to the different characters of their gods; no, but by infinite wiſdom they were calculated to promote the knowledge of the divine perfections, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the laws of righteouſneſs, and give the moſt encouraging hope in the goodneſs and mercy of God. The ritual of the Iſraelites was rational, ſober, uniform, plainly intended to exhibit the majeſty, purity, and mercy of the eternal king; to humble men before him under a continual ſenſe of guilt; and to aſſure true penitents of free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don by virtue of the appointed ſacrifices, which were types of that one ſacrifice which Chriſt has offered for the ſins of the world. And to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their worſhip more ſtriking in their own view; and in the eyes of the world, their tabernacle and temple, their prieſthood with its ornaments, their ſolemn aſſemblies and great feſtivals, were decent
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021192_0014_0FB2AF58CA8BEBB0"/>
and magnificent beyond every thing ſeen among the nations around.</p>
            <p>How unexampled was this quick progreſs of the Iſraelites, from abject ſlavery, ignorance, and almoſt total want of order, to a national eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment perfected in all its parts far beyond all other kingdoms and States! from a mere mob, to a well regulated nation, under a government and laws far ſuperior to what any other nation could boaſt!</p>
            <p>It was a long time after the law of Moſes was given before the reſt of the world knew any thing of government by law. Where kings reigned their will was a law. Where popular governments were formed, the capricious humour of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ordered every thing juſt according to preſent circumſtances; or their ſenators and judges were left to act according to their beſt diſcretion. It was ſix hundred years after Moſes before the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, the moſt famous of the Grecian republics, received a very imperfect, and in ſome particulars very abſurd code of laws from Lycurgus. After this feeble attempt of legiſlation, three hundred years more elapſed before Solon appeared and gave laws to Athens, though a city long famous for
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021192_0015_0FB2AF5A4E8170A0"/>
arms, arts, eloquence, and philoſophy. And it was about five hundred years from the firſt founding of the celebrated Roman empire, and nearly three hundred years after Solon, before the firſt laws of that empire were imported from Greece in twelve tables, by ten embaſſadors ſent there for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But even when that empire had attained the ſummit of glory, and legiſlation was carried to great perfection, however well adapted to a government ſo extenſive and complicate their laws might be, they were far from being worthy to be compared with the laws of Iſrael, as to the ſecurity of life, liberty, property, and public morals: and as to their religion, which was from the beginning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with the ſtate, inſtead of receiving any greater perfection from the increaſe of knowledge, wealth and power, it only became a more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant congeries of ridiculous and deteſtable ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions. Moreover; when the Roman empire was overwhelmed and deſtroyed by an inundation of barbarous nations, and many kingdoms were erected in Europe out of its ruins by the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, laws were extinct under the feudal ſyſtem; the will of the barons was a law for their vaſſals; and but a few centuries have paſt ſince kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to introduce law into their courts of juſtice.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021192_0016_0FB2AF5BCAD6CBA8"/>
And now, though legiſlation has been carried to ſuch perfection in Great Britain, that land of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and liberty, yet in a political and judicial view the laws of that kingdom may be charged with many great faults, which ought not to be copied: particularly, the tediouſneſs, voluminous bulk, intricacy, barbarous language, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain operation of many of them as to equity, ought to be avoided by legiſlators who wiſh for an eaſy and ſpeedy courſe of juſtice among a free people. And perhaps our own courts might be ſo reformed as to prevent caſes of inconſiderable value, and eaſy deciſion, from riſing through all the ſtages of the law. Againſt theſe imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons good proviſion was made in the law of Moſes, and it might be much for our advantage to pay greater attention to that example.</p>
            <p>Upon a review of what has been ſaid, muſt it not appear quite unaccountable, that the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites ſhould ſo ſpeedily attain to ſuch an height of good policy and legiſlation, beyond all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Are we not conſtrained to acknowlege an immediate interpoſition and direction of heaven? Had the unexperienced multitude been left to themſelves to draw up a ſyſtem of civil and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021192_0017_0FB2AF5DA5762A08"/>
government for themſelves, it would have been entirely beyond their abilities to comprehend ſo complicated a ſubject; they muſt have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted innumerable miſtakes, in attempting to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and eſtabliſh it; they would have been in danger of jarring opinions, tumults, and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; and probably before the deſign could be effected, diſcouragement and confuſion would have forced them to ſurrender into the hands of deſpotiſm. But their God provided every thing neceſſary for their happineſs, and nothing more was left to their own wiſdom than to ſubmit to his authority, and adhere ſtrictly to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: by this, their reputation among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would have been equal to the excellency of their laws.</p>
            <p>But now you may ſay,—Why then were they not univerſally celebrated? Why did not princes and politicians from all parts of the world viſit them, to learn maxims of polity from ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated a nation? Why did not philoſophers come, and enquire into that ſyſtem of religion and morality which carried virtue to ſuch an heigth of perfection? Surely a nation, of which all the parts were ſo firmly cemented, muſt be ſtrong and formidable: a people, who enjoyed the moſt rational liberty, and yet were under the moſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021192_0018_0FB2AF5ECBDA58F8"/>
voluntary and abſolute ſubjection to authority, free from all the convulſions and revolutions which frequently ariſe from the raging folly of the populace, muſt become famous: a wiſe and impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, according to the moſt excellent laws, by which all were kept in perfect ſecurity and peace, could not but be admired: and the commerce of a people, whoſe morals were governed by the beſt precepts, whoſe word might be truſted, who practiſed no kind of fraud, and whoſe behaviour was always benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſober, prudent, and ſincere, muſt be highly valued by the world. Whereas on the contrary, the Iſraelites were often weak, diſtreſſed, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally deſpiſed and hated by all their neighbours. —The plain anſwer to this objection is—They never adhered in practice either to the principles of their civil polity or religion: but on their practice depended the proſperity and honor of the nation. They received their law from God, but they did not keep it. They neglected their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, corrupted their religion, and grew diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in their morals, and in ſuch a ſituation no nation under heaven can proſper.</p>
            <p>Let us view their ſtate, in the firſt place, under the judges. Tho' the national ſenate was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021192_0019_0FB2AF60926C6E40"/>
for the aſſiſtance of Moſes as captain-general and judge of the nation, and this was a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation that in all ſucceeding times ſuch a ſenate was neceſſary for the aſſiſtance of the ſupreme ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: yet after Joſhua and the elders of his time were dead, it does not appear that they took the leaſt care to fill their places. They left all the affairs of the nation to chance, or extraordinary providence, and had no chief commander, except when God in compaſſion to them in their troubles raiſed up judges for their deliverance. And as they ſuffered the general government to drop, we may well think them as careleſs of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the particular tribes. In each tribe, as we have obſerved, a government ought to have been kept up ſimilar to the national authority, by the elders and prince of the tribe. But we find this remark repeatedly made in the book of Judges— <q>
                  <hi>In thoſe days there was no king in Iſrael, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes</hi>
               </q>— that is in plain terms, there was no authority any where, but every man was left to act as he pleaſed. No wonder therefore if they were weak in council and war, and expoſed on every ſide to the inſults of their neighbours, being unable to unite in their own defence. This neglect of government was wholly inexcuſable: for however they might plead,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021192_0020_0FB2AF6939AB8CC0"/>
that Moſes, and Joſhua, and the ſeventy elders, were of God's immediate appointment, and that they had no warrant to fill up their places; they could not but know they had an undoubted right to provide for their own welfare, eſpecially when there was ſo plain an intimation that the ſame government was to be continued. If they were at a loſs what to do, they had the greateſt Oracle in the world among them, and they ought to have enquired of God, their king, how to proceed and what perſons to chooſe. Nay, they were ſome times ſenſible enough of their right to appoint a chief commander, and even to make the command hereditary, as appears by the addreſs to Gideon— <q>
                  <hi>Rule thou over us; both thou, and thy ſon, and thy ſon's ſon alſo;</hi>
               </q>—by the choice which the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemites made of Abimelech to be their king; and by Jephtha's bargain with the Gileadites to be their head and captain, if he fought for them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ammonites. By all this we may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee that the general neglect of government is to be charged as the fault of the people.</p>
            <p>And now we cannot wonder if courts of juſtice ceaſed, when the higher powers of government were wanting. Theſe courts, which ſhould have
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021192_0021_0FB2AF6D0B83EBF8"/>
been continued in every walled city, dwindled way and came to nothing; crimes were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, and the moſt abominable vices ſpread their infection through all ranks. No law was executed to deter men from murders, robberies, rapes, or any other kind of wickedneſs. This is evident by the caſe of the Levite whoſe concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine was abuſed to death by the mob of Benjamites at Gibeah: the city in general diſcovered no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to do juſtice upon the offenders; there were no judges near, to whom complaint might be made; nay, it ſeems the whole tribe were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to abett the crime rather than puniſh it; nor was there any authority in the nation to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the matter; and therefore the Levite was obliged to take a method, ſhocking to huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in order to excite the indignation of the other tribes, and bring their forces againſt the Benjamites to their deſtruction.</p>
            <p>We have alſo good reaſon to think the military affairs of the nation were not in a much better ſtate than the civil. They could not wholly omit the care of their militia, becauſe they were continually expoſed to wars in their own defence. It was neceſſary to provide officers, and keep up ſome degree of diſcipline; but they were very defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021192_0022_0FB2AF6F52B01A78"/>
in this reſpect, eſpecially as to ſuperior command. In almoſt every battle, againſt the moſt contemptible of their neighbours, they were unſucceſsful; and were ravaged, plundered, and brought under tribute by all in their turns, and delivered only when God mercifully interpoſed by raiſing up a General in an extraordinary way. On an alarm, inſtead of forming a regular army, they ſeem to have ran together ſuddenly from all quarters, without order, as if to ſtop a conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Such diſunited undirected force was never able to ſuſtain a heavy attack, but gave every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader an eaſy victory.</p>
            <p>But that which was the main ſource of all their diſorder and miſery, was—their neglecting and corrupting that religion which God commanded. As long as thoſe elders lived, who were with Joſhua, and had ſeen all the great works of the Lord which he did for Iſrael, the people adhered to the worſhip of the true God as preſcribed in the law: but when they were dead, the impreſſions which had been made by miracles wore off, as is natural; and they grew regardleſs of the worſhip of the ſanctuary, gave ſcope to their own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and ſoon made a mixture of all the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and idolatries of the heathen with the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021192_0023_0FB2AF70C9C505B8"/>
worſhip of Jehovah. They kept up no method of religious inſtruction; and as they grew more and more ignorant, they thought it too inconvenient to travel ſo often from all parts of the country, to offer ſacrifices at the tabernacle, though it was very centrally placed at Shiloh, not much more than eighty miles diſtant from the remoteſt towns; but every man choſe to worſhip nearer home: and ſo they made groves, and built altars for themſelves, and ſoon ſet up images of Baal, Aſhteroth, and other genteel deities which their neighbours wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. By theſe idols, however, they pretended to worſhip the true God, and brought ſacrifices after their own hearts; for they imagined that all kinds of religion came much to the ſame thing, and whether preciſely agreeable to the command or not, would be acceptable, if they were ſincere. Thus Micah made images, and procured a prieſt in his own houſe, which the children of Dan after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards took away, and fixed in their new conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed city, in the northern bounds of Canaan, where this idolatry continued until the ten tribes were carried into captivity; and Joaſh, the father of Gideon, had a grove, and an altar of Baal, for his own family; likewiſe Gideon himſelf, though highly honoured of God in being the deliverer of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021192_0024_0FB2AF724B5F2DB8"/>
Iſrael from the Midianites, made an ephod, which was ſoon the occaſion of ſuperſtitious worſhip, and drew him and the people from attending at the tabernacle.</p>
            <p>Now by the foregoing view of the general ſtate of the nation during the time of the judges, we may plainly ſee the reaſon why, inſtead of riſing to fame by the perfection of their polity, religion, and morals, their character ſunk into contempt. But let us ſee whether they conducted better after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, under their kings.</p>
            <p>It was their crime to demand ſuch a king as was like the kings of other nations, <hi>i. e.</hi> a king with the ſame abſolute power, to command all according to his own pleaſure. In this view God only was their king, and the head of the nation was only to be his vicegerent. Therefore as they had implicitly rejected the divine government, God gave them a king in his anger; the conſequence of which was, the total loſs of their republican form of government, and ſad experience of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of deſpotic power. Indeed their religious eſtabliſhment, which had been very much impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the days of the judges, was reſtored, and brought to its greateſt glory, by David the moſt pious, and Solomon the wiſeſt of kings; and dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021192_0025_0FB2AF74176E98A0"/>
their reigns, the nation gained the heigth of grandeur; but no national ſenate was appointed, and the power of the kings continued to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic, and ſo the days of their proſperity were ſoon over. As ſoon as Rehoboam aſcended the throne he openly avowed the moſt deſpotic principles, ſo that ten tribes revolted, and made Jeroboam their king. Jeroboam, out of policy, to prevent a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union with Judah by means of the temple worſhip, placed two calves at the extremities of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and perſuaded the people to worſhip God by them inſtead of going to Jeruſalem: and this falſe worſhip, together with a multitude of other idolatries introduced by this means, was the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ten tribes, until they were captivated by the king of Aſſyria, and diſperſed and loſt among the nations. Nor did Rehoboam pay greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the law of Moſes; for he built high-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and made images and groves on every high hill and under every green tree, and did according to all the abominations of the heathen; and in conſequence of this, every kind of vice, and even ſodomy, prevailed in the land. From this time the propenſity of the people to idolatry increaſed, ſo that they readily followed the examples of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding bad kings, and it became a very difficult taſk for the beſt to make an effectual reformation.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021192_0026_0FB2AF7553C28478"/>
Nor is it to be wondered at that falſe religion ſo eaſily gained ground; for the people grew very ignorant: no care was taken to inſtruct them, in their ſeveral cities, in the law of God; but, being without teachers, they were very little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their own religious inſtitutions.— <hi>For this reaſon when good king Jehoſhaphat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon a reformation in church and ſtate, after having taken a circuit thro' his kingdom to</hi> 
               <q>bring the people back to the Lord God of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he ſent out ſome of his principal officers, with prieſts and levites, to teach the people in the cities of Judah; and theſe carried the book of the law with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught them that religion which God commanded by Moſes.</q> 
               <hi>It likewiſe appears by what immediately follows this account of his proceedings, that there had been a long omiſſion of the adminiſtration of juſtice in the cities; that no courts had been kept up by preceeding kings, or ſuch as were corrupt, in which the judges paid little regard to law and equity: for the king</hi> 
               <q>ſet judges in the land, throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city, and ſaid unto the judges, take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for man but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment:— wherefore now let the fear of Lord be upon you, take
<pb facs="unknown:021192_0027_0FB2AF770B7935C8"/>
heed and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons, nor taking of gifts.</q> Repeated attempts were made by the few pious kings, to put a ſtop to the corruption of religion and morals; but all in vain; the people relapſed again and again into ignorance, idolatry, and wickedneſs: their vices had increaſed to the utmoſt degree of enormity in Jeremiah's time; and their complicated crimes at length brought upon them deſolation and a long captivity.</p>
            <p>And now let us juſt take a glance at their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate after the captivity in Babylon. When they returned to their own land they endeavored to conform their religion and government to the moſaic ſtandard; idolatry was entirely purged out; they diſcovered great zeal for the law of their God and the inſtituted worſhip; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a general ſenate of ſeventy elders, called by them the Sanhedrin, with a ſupreme magiſtrate at the head, for the government of the nation; and while their pious zeal continued they grew and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered. But, according to the common courſe of things in the world, religion ſoon degenerated into mere formality, without proper regard to its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal intention, and became only a ſhadow of that delivered to their fathers; the affairs of ſtate were
<pb facs="unknown:021192_0028_0FB2AF788E59DFB8"/>
badly adminiſtered, and the higheſt honors were gained by favor, bribery, or violence; hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy was ſubſtituted in the room of the true fear of God, and the practice of righteouſneſs; all the vices natural to mankind daily increaſed; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they filled up the meaſure of their ſins by crucifying the Lord of Glory, and rejecting his goſpel, for which they have been made monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the divine diſpleaſure unto this day.</p>
            <p>Therefore upon the whole view we ſee, that the Iſraelites never attained to that fame and dignity among the nations which their conſtitution encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them to expect, becauſe they took little care to practice agreably to the good ſtatutes and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given them by Moſes. Their conſtitution both of government and religion was excellent in writing, but was never exemplified in fact.</p>

I have preſented you with the portrait of a nation, highly favoured by Heaven with civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious inſtitutions, who yet, by not improving their advantages, forfeited their bleſſings, and brought contempt and deſtruction on themſelves. If I am not miſtaken, inſtead of the twelve tribes of Iſrael, we may ſubſtitute the thirteen States of the American union, and ſee this application plainly offering itſelf, viz.—That as God in the courſe of his kind providence hath given you an excellent conſtitution of government, founded on the moſt rational, equitable, and liberal principles, by which all that liberty is ſecured which a people can reaſonably claim, and you are impowered to make righteous laws for promoting public order and good morals; and as he has moreover given you by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, who is far ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to Moſes, a complete revelation of his will, and a perfect ſyſtem of true religion, plainly delivered in the ſacred writings; it will be your wiſdom in the eyes of the nations, and your true intereſt and happineſs, to conform your practice in the ſtricteſt manner to the excellent principles of your government, adhere faithfully to the doctrines and commands of the goſpel, and practice every public and private virtue. By this you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in numbers, wealth, and power, and obtain
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:021192_0030_0FB2AF8429D1E308"/>
reputation and dignity among the nations: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, the contrary conduct will make you poor, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed, and contemptible.—</p>
               <p>The God of heaven hath not indeed viſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the glory of his majeſty and power before our eyes, as he came down in the ſight of Iſrael on the burning mount; nor has he written with his own finger the laws of our civil polity: but the ſignal interpoſitions of divine providence, in ſaving us from the vengeance of a powerful irritated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which we were unavoidably ſeparated by their inadmiſſible claim of abſolute parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power over us; in giving us a WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON to be captain-general of our armies; in carrying us through the various diſtreſſing ſcenes of war and deſolation, and making us twice triumphant over numerous armies, ſurrounded and captivated in the midſt of their career; and finally giving us peace, with a large territory, and acknowledged independence; all theſe laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall little ſhort of real miracles, and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly charter of liberty for theſe United-States. And when we reflect, how wonderfully the order of theſe ſtates was preſerved when government was diſſolved, or ſupported only by feeble props; with how much ſobriety, wiſdom, and unanimity they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021192_0031_0FB2AF869BCAEDE0"/>
and received the diverſified yet ſimilar conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the different ſtates; with what prudence, fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, patience, and ſucceſs, the Congreſs have manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the general government, under the great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a very imperfect and impotent confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we cannot but acknowledge that God hath graciouſly patronized our cauſe, and taken us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſpecial care, as he did his ancient covenant people.</p>
               <p>Or we may conſider the hand of God in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther view. Wiſdom is the gift of God, and ſocial happineſs depends on his providencial govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therefore, if theſe ſtates have framed their conſtitutions with ſuperior wiſdom, and ſecured their natural rights, and all the advantages of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, with greater precaution than other nations, we may with good reaſon affirm that God hath given us our government; that he hath taught us good ſtatutes and judgments, tending to make us great and reſpectable in the view of the world. Only one thing more remains to complete his favor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us; which is, the eſtabliſhment of a general government, as happily formed as our particular conſtitutions, for the perfect union of theſe ſtates. Without this, all that we glory in is loſt; but if this ſhould be effected, we may ſay with the greateſt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:021192_0032_0FB2AF8811CA8120"/>
joy,—<hi>"God hath done great things for us."</hi>—The general form of ſuch a conſtitution hath already been drawn up, and preſented to the people, by a convention of the wiſeſt and moſt celebrated pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots in the land: eight of the ſtates have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and accepted it, with full teſtimonies of joy: and if it paſſes the ſcrutiny of the whole, and recommends itſelf to be univerſally adopted, we ſhall have abundant reaſon to offer elevated thankſgivings to the ſupreme Ruler of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe for a government completed under his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection<note n="*" place="bottom">Soon after this Sermon was delivered, the Convention of the State of New-Hampſhire, met according to adjournment, and on the twenty-firſt day of June accepted the propoſed general Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government. This being the ninth State which has acceded to this form of national Union, it will be carried into effect; and there is no reaſon to doubt of the ſpeedy acceſſion of all the other States, which are now debating on the important queſtion. May all rejoice in the Lord, who has formed us into a nation, and honour him as our Judge, Lawgiver, and King, who hath ſaved us, and will ſave us from all enemies and fears, if we thankfully receive and rightly improve his great mercies.</note>.</p>
               <p>Now our part is to make a wiſe improvement of what God grants us, and not neglect or deſpiſe our diſtinguiſhing privileges: for the beſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, badly managed, will ſoon fall, and be changed into anarchy or tyranny. Without conſtant care of your families, you will have bad ſervants,

and your eſtates will be waſted. So we muſt pay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attention to the great family, if we deſire to be a free and happy people.</p>
               <p>The power in all our republics is acknowleged to originate in the people: it is delegated by them to every magiſtrate and officer; and to the people all in authority are accountable, if they deviate from their duty, and abuſe their power. Even the man, who may be advanced to the chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of theſe United States, according to the propoſed conſtitution; whoſe office reſembles that of a king in other nations, which has always been thought ſo ſacred that they have had no conception of bringing a king before the bar of juſtice; even he depends on the choice of the people for his temporary and limited power, and will be liable to impeachment, trial, and diſgrace for any groſs miſconduct. On the people, therefore, of theſe United-States it depends whether wiſe men, or fools, good or bad men, ſhall govern them; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall have righteous laws, a faithful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of government, and permanent good order, peace, and liberty; or, on the contrary, feel inſupportable burdens, and ſee all their affairs run to confuſion and ruin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:021192_0034_0FB2AF8B09B94200"/>Therefore, I will now lift up my voice, and cry aloud to the people; to the people of this State in particular, whom I will conſider as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by their repreſentatives and rulers, and the congregation here collected from various towns.— RISE! RISE to fame among all nations, as a wiſe and underſtanding people! political life and death are ſet before you; be a free, numerous, well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and happy people! The way has been plainly ſet before you; if you purſue it, your proſperity is ſure; but if not, diſtreſs and ruin will overtake you.</p>
               <p>Preſerve your government with the utmoſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and ſolicitude, for it is the remarkable gift of heaven. From year to year be careful in the choice of your repreſentatives, and all the higher powers of government. Fix your eyes upon men of good underſtanding, and known honeſty; men of knowledge, improved by experience; men who fear God, and hate covetouſneſs; who love truth and righteouſneſs, and ſincerely wiſh the public welfare. Beware of ſuch as are cunning ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than wiſe; who prefer their own intereſt to every thing; whoſe judgment is partial, or fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle; and whom you would not willingly truſt with your own private intereſts. When meetings
<pb facs="unknown:021192_0035_0FB2AF8CE4634EC0"/>
are called for the choice of your rulers, do not careleſsly neglect them, or give your votes with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, juſt as any party may perſuade, or a ſordid treat tempt you; but act with ſerious deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration and judgment, as in a moſt important matter, and let the faithful of the land ſerve you. Let not men openly irreligious and immoral be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your legiſlators; for how can you expect good laws to be made by men who have no fear of God before their eyes, and who boldly trample on the authority of his commands? And will not the example of their impiety and immorality de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the efficacy of the beſt laws which can be made in favour of religion and virtue? If the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative body are corrupt, you will ſoon have bad men for Counſellors, corrupt Judges, unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified Juſtices, and officers in every department who will diſhonor their ſtations; the conſequence of which will be murmurs and complaints from every quarter.—Let a ſuperior character point out the man who is to be your head; for much depends on his inſpection and care of public affairs and the influence of his judgment, advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, although his power is circumſcribed: in this choice therefore be always on your guard againſt parties, and the methods taken to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt for unworthy men, and let diſtinguiſhed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb facs="unknown:021192_0036_0FB2AF8E119B4748"/>
always determine your vote.—And when all places in government are filled with the beſt men you can find, behave yourſelves as good ſubjects; obey the laws; cheerfully ſubmit to ſuch tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as the neceſſities of the public call for; give tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtom to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, and honor to whom honor, as the goſpel commands you. Never give countenance to turbulent men, who wiſh to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh themſelves, and riſe to power, by form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing combinations and exciting inſurrections againſt government: for this can never be the right way to redreſs real grievances, ſince you may not only prefer complaints and petitions to the court, but have the very authority, which you think has been miſuſed, in your own power, and may very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place it in other hands. How happy was it for this ſtate, that the inſurrection, attempted here two years ago, was ſo ſeaſonably and with ſo little difficulty ſuppreſſed, when the neighbouring ſtate was brought into ſuch a difficult and critical ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation by the diſtracted populace, and has now ſcarcely recovered from that violent political pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſm.</p>
               <p>I call upon you alſo to ſupport ſchools in all your towns, that the riſing generation may not
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021192_0037_0FB2AF908B7BB280"/>
grow up in ignorance. Grudge not any expence proportionate to your abilities. It is a debt you owe to your children, and that God to whom they belong; a neceſſary evidence of your regard for their preſent and future happineſs, and of your concern to tranſmit the bleſſings you yourſelves enjoy to future generations. The human mind without early and continual cultivation grows wild and ſavage: knowledge muſt be inſtilled as its capacities gradually enlarge, or it cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand and extend its ſphere of activity. Without inſtruction men can have no knowledge but what comes from their own obſervation and experience, and it will be a long time before they can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted even with things moſt neceſſary for the ſupport and comfort of the preſent life. Leave your children untaught to read, write, cypher, &amp;c. teach them no trade, or huſbandry; let them grow up wholly without care; and they will be more fit for a ſavage than civil life, and whatever inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance you may think to leave them will be of no advantage. But, on the contrary, train them up in the fear of God, in an acquaintance with his word, and all ſuch uſeful knowledge as your abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities will allow, and they will ſoon know how to provide for themſelves, perhaps may take care
<pb facs="unknown:021192_0038_0FB2AF948F3B8558"/>
of their aged parents, and fill the various ſtations in life with honor and advantage. Look round and ſee the growing youth: they are to ſucceed in your ſtead; government and religion muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by them; from among theſe will ſhortly riſe up our legiſlators, judges, miniſters of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and officers of every rank. Can you think of this, and not promote ſchools, academies, and colleges? Can you leave the youth uninſtructed in any thing which may prepare them to act their part well in the world? Will you ſuffer ignorance to ſpread its horrid gloom over the land? An ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people will eaſily receive idolatry for their religion, and muſt bow their necks to the tyrant's yoke, becauſe they are incapable of uſing rational liberty. Will you then conſign over your poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to fooliſh and abominable ſuperſtitions inſtead of religion, and to be the ſlaves of deſpotiſm, when a ſmall proportion of the produce of your labours will make them wiſe, free, and happy?</p>
               <p>Will you hear me patiently a little farther, while I ſay one thing more of very great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which I dare not ſuppreſs.—I call upon you to preſerve the knowledge of God in the land, and attend to the revelation written to us from heaven. If you neglect or renounce that religion
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:021192_0039_0FB2AF964DEF0058"/>
taught and commanded in the holy ſcriptures, think no more of freedom, peace, and happineſs; the judgments of heaven will perſue you. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not a vain thing for you becauſe it is your life: it has been the glory and defence of New-England from the infancy of the ſettlements; let it be alſo our glory and protection. I mean no other religion than what is divinely preſcribed, which God himſelf has delivered to us with equal evidence of his authority, and even ſuperior to that given to Iſrael, and which he has as ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to receive and obſerve. The holy ſcriptures are given as the only rule of our faith, worſhip and obedience, and if we are guided by this perfect rule, we ſhall keep the way of truth and righteouſneſs, and obtain the heavenly glory. We are now no more at liberty to draw up ſchemes of religion for ourſelves, according to our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful reaſonings and vain imaginations, or to comply with the traditions and commands of men, or fall in with the refinements of human wiſdom and the faſhionable ſentiments of the world, than Iſrael was to ſubſtitute modes of ſerving God dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what he had expreſsly required. We muſt believe what the Son of God, who made the worlds, and was ſent by the Father with a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mercy to mankind, has declared to us. He
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:021192_0040_0FB2AF983AF7CB70"/>
died to redeem men from the ſervitude of ſin, and reconcile them to God that they may be raiſed to life eternal; and he is appointed to be like a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Moſes, the captain of our ſalvation to conduct us to heaven: to him therefore we muſt hearken in all things. The principal doctrines of his goſpel are quite ſimple, plain and important. He teaches us that the commands of God reach to the inward thoughts, principles, and affections of the heart, as well as the outward conduct, and are as pure and perfect as the divine nature;—that according to the laws of his moral government all men uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally are ſinners, and muſt repent in order to obtain mercy;—that remiſſion of ſins is obtained only by believing on his name, and through his blood ſhed for us on the croſs;—that his diſciples muſt receive his word, and obey whatſoever he hath commanded, endeavoring to be holy in all manner of converſation and avoid all the vices and corruptions of the world; that there will be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead both of the juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; and a day of ſolemn judgment, when all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt give an account of their conduct in this world, and receive their ſentence from him whom the Father hath conſtituted to be the judge; and that in conſequence of their ſentence mankind will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part into very oppoſite ſtates; the wicked into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment, and the righteous into life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021192_0041_0FB2AF99684B1BF8"/>
the preſent viſible ſyſtem of nature being then diſſolved in flames.—In the belief of theſe plain truths, and that worſhip and obedience connected with them, the religion of chriſtians conſiſts. As to worſhip, no multiplied forms, and punctilious ceremonies are preſcribed, which only ſerve to throw a veil over the mind; no certain modes are made neceſſary; but we muſt worſhip God, who is a ſpirit, in ſpirit and in truth, by prayer and praiſe, with love and fear, hope and joy. For ſuch worſhip chriſtians are united into ſocieties called churches; and are required to aſſemble every Lord's day, that they may glorify God with one heart and voice, and be inſtructed and edified by his word, and the two only ordinances of baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper; which are very ſimple, but well adapted to the nature and deſign of our religion.</p>
               <p>The chriſtian religion, therefore, is confined to no particular nation, ſect, or denomination; but is deſigned to call all men to repentance and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life; to encourage their hope in the mercy of God, thro' the only mediator Jeſus Chriſt; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to the moſt cheerful, perſevering obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and comfort them, under all the labours and ſorrows of the world, and the natural dread of death, with the aſſurance of a glorious immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. This religion may be believed and practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021192_0042_0FB2AF9D9E90FF38"/>
ſo as to anſwer the main purpoſes of it, under the various forms in which chriſtian churches now appear: juſt as the principal ends of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be obtained under the various conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have taken place in different nations, however one may be much more eligible than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>Therefore, regard not men who are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally crying up their own ſect, and employing their utmoſt zeal and art to proſelyte men to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: they aim to ſtrengthen themſelves by your numbers and purſes, more than to ſave your ſouls. If any ſay, lo here is Chriſt! or lo there! go not after them: for wherever his word abides, there is Chriſt; in and by his word he is already with us, and dwells in the hearts of believers. Liſten to no enthuſiaſts, who inſtead of enlightening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found your underſtandings; and ſubſtitute folly, nonſenſe, and hypocritical grimace, in the room of a clear manifeſtation of truth and conformity of heart and life to the goſpel. Take heed of imbib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the licentious principles of men who affect to render all religion doubtful, by perſuading you that every kind of religion is equally acceptable to God if a man is but ſincere in it; for this renders revelation uſeleſs. Beware of receiving new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which militate with the plain and obvious meaning of the word of Chriſt, however they may
<pb facs="unknown:021192_0043_0FB2AF9FD460B878"/>
pretend to be clearer diſcoveries of truth, and more comfortable and beneficial to mankind: but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the written word, taken in the moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, without forced allegories, whimſical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, or torturing criticiſms; eſpecially hold faſt thoſe doctrines which meet your eye in almoſt every page of the new teſtament. Read and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate in the word of God day and night, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently attend on the public miniſtrations which Chriſt hath appointed in his church; and conſider <hi>that</hi> as a true church where the truth as it is in Jeſus is preached, and his plain inſtitutions obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whatever the particular form or denomination may be, avoiding all contentions and uncharitable ſeparations. Be earneſt to procure miniſters, who preach the uncorrupted doctrines of the goſpel, in all your towns: let none of your pariſhes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue vacant thro' indifference, negligence, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; and never withhold from faithful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters a comfortable ſupport. When we look round and ſee ſo many churches deſtitute of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, contenting themſelves in the total neglect of all divine inſtitutions, have we not reaſon to fear that God is departing from us? And if our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is given up, all the liberty we boaſt of will ſoon be gone; a profane and wicked people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope for divine bleſſings, but it may be eaſily foretold that <hi>'evil will befall them in the latter days.'</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:021192_0044_0FB2AFA0D62A9B38"/>While I thus earneſtly exhort you to religion, it muſt be underſtood as equally an exhortation to every branch of morality; for without this all religion is vain. That excellent ſentence of the wiſe king ought forever to be in our minds— <hi>"Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation, but ſin is the reproach of any people."</hi>—Sobriety, good order, honeſty, fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, induſtry, frugality, and the like virtues muſt prevail; public crimes againſt perſon or property muſt be reſtrained and puniſhed; or a people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be happy. Therefore let all maintain recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of conduct, and practiſe every thing virtuous and praiſe-worthy among their neighbours, and be juſt and true in all their intercourſe and commerce. Unite in aſſiſting the government in the execution of all good laws: and let all the members of the body politic conſider that their own happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the welfare of the whole.</p>
               <p>My ſubject hath lead me into this long and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt addreſs to the people. But it ſuggeſts ſome things which may properly be addreſſed to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Court. Will you hear me patiently, while with the utmoſt reſpect, I ſay a few words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the wiſe reflections of your own minds.</p>
               <p>You will conſider that you aſſemble from time to time as fathers of the large family, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on you to take care of its general welfare, and that no local views ought to govern you, nor
<pb facs="unknown:021192_0045_0FB2AFA25197E800"/>
partial inſtructions of your conſtituents bind you to act contrary to the clear conviction of your own minds. You will be cautious of forming parties for any ſelfiſh purpoſes, and of being too haſty in determining important matters, or too ſlow in your proceedings when buſineſs is urgent. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to form a wiſe judgment of every thing that comes before you, you are ſenſible of the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of examining things to the bottom, attending patiently to every argument on both ſides, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcience, rather than any friend, what ought to be done. Like frugal houſholders you will ſave all unneceſſary expences, and take good care of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; but not ſuffer the faithful ſervants of the State to be ſo ſtinted in their reward as to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them from their duty. Lay no grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on the people beyond their abilities; but take the earlieſt, eaſieſt, and moſt righteous methods to reduce and pay off the public debt, unhappily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in all the perplexities occaſioned by bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs emiſſions of depreciating paper notes. Be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, yet frugal, in grants of money, according to the exigencies of the public. Let no laws be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which good order, and the proper adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of government and juſtice require; but make no law which eſtabliſheth iniquity. And may I propoſe it, as worthy of your conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome reformation may not be neceſſary as to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:021192_0046_0FB2AFA3CA574720"/>
proceſſes in our courts of juſtice: whether appeals from court to court are not allowed beyond reaſon and equity, in the plaineſt caſes, and of too trivial value: by which ſome of our courts are made mere vehicles, juſtice is delayed, and the law made unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily expenſive, tedious and vexatious; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome method may not be thought of to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the judgment of cauſes in lower or higher courts in proportion to their value and importance. I beg leave to ſay one word as to religion. With reſpect to articles of faith or modes of worſhip, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil authority have no right to eſtabliſh religion. The people ought to chooſe their own miniſters, and their own denomination, as our laws now permit them; but as far as religion is connected with the morals of the people, and their improvement in knowledge, it becomes of great importance to the ſtate; and legiſlators may well conſider it as part of their concern for the public welfare, to make proviſion that all the towns may be furniſhed with good teachers, that they may be impowered to make valid contracts, and that the fulfilment of ſuch contracts ſhould be ſecured againſt the fickle hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of men, who are always ready to ſhift from ſect to ſect, or make diviſions in pariſhes that they may get free from all legal obligations to their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Perhaps a little addition to the law alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in force in this ſtate might ſufficiently ſecure the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:021192_0047_0FB2AFA54E170E40"/>
continuance of religious inſtruction, enlarge rather than diminiſh liberty of conſcience, and prevent envyings, contentions, and crumbling into parties. Will you permit me now to pray in behalf of the people, that all the departments of government may be conſtantly filled with the wiſeſt and beſt men; that his excellency the Preſident may have the aſſiſtance of an able and faithful Council; that the adminiſtration of juſtice may be in the hands of judges and juſtices well qualified for their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who will not take bribes, or in any manner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert judgment; in a word, that the conſtitution eſtabliſhed may in every reſpect be well ſupported by your care, and that the people may know the bleſſings of good government by the union of your counſels, and the wiſdom of your proceedings.— May the Almighty King of kings always be in the midſt of you, direct and aſſiſt you, impreſs your hearts with his fear, and grant preſent and future bleſſings in reward of your fidelity.</p>
               <p>And now if I have delivered words of truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to my text; and pointed out the ſure way to be a proſperous and happy people; may theſe things ſink deep into your hearts, and be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the divine bleſſing! May the general go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of theſe United States, when eſtabliſhed, appear to be the beſt which the nations have yet known, and be exalted by uncorrupted religion and morals! And may the everlaſting goſpel diffuſe its Heavenly light, and ſpread Righteouſneſs, Liberty, and Peace, thro' the whole world. AMEN.</p>
