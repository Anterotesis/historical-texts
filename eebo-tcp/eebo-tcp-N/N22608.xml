            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE following Sermons, I think I may ſay, were given me by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and according to my preſent light, are agreeable to the form of ſound words delivered to us in the lively oracles of God. They contain the ſum and ſubſtance, I will not ſay, word for word, of what was delivered from the pulpit; for, as I had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in America, Scotland, and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb facs="unknown:029886_0006_0FE2BE32E15AAA70"/>
to preach upon the ſame ſubjects, I was obliged, according to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and aſſiſtance given me from above, to enlarge, or make excurſions, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the people's circumſtances among whom I was preaching the kingdom of God. I had no leiſure or freedom to commit any of them to writing, but during my laſt voyage from America to England; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> do I expect to find leiſure to write down any freſh diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, till it ſhall pleaſe God that I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark again. May the Spirit of God, who delights out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings to perfect praiſe, bleſs

            <head>THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JEREMIAH xxiii. 6.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHOEVER is acquainted with the nature of mankind in general, or the propenſity of his own heart in particular, muſt acknowledge that ſelf-righteouſneſs is the laſt idol that is rooted out of the heart.—Being once born under a covenant of works, it is natural for us all to have recourſe to a covenant of works for our everlaſting ſalvation. And we have contracted ſuch a deviliſh pride by our fall from God, that we would, if not wholly, yet in part at leaſt, glory in being the cauſe of our own ſalvation. We cry out againſt Popery, and that very juſtly; but we are all Papiſts, at leaſt I am ſure we are all Arminians by nature; and therefore, no wonder ſo many natural men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that ſcheme. It is true, we diſclaim the doctrine of merit, are aſhamed directly to ſay we deſerve any good at the hands of God; therefore as the apoſtle excellently well obſerves, we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, we fetch a circuit, to eſtabliſh a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own, and, like the phariſees of old,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029886_0009_0FE2BE4375BCBE90"/>
will not wholly ſubmit to that righteouſneſs, which is of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>This is the ſoreſt, though alas! the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon evil that was ever yet ſeen under the ſun. An evil, that in any age, eſpecially in theſe dregs of time wherein we live, cannot ſufficiently be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt—For as it is with the people, ſo it is with the prieſts; and it is to be feared, even in thoſe places where once the truth, as it is in Jeſus, was eminently preached, many miniſters are ſo ſadly degenerated from their pious anceſtors, that the doctrines of grace, eſpecially the perſonal all-ſufficient righteouſneſs of Jeſus, is but too ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, too ſlightly mentioned. Hence the love of many waxeth cold; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have too often thought was it poſſible, that this ſingle conſideration would be ſufficient to raiſe our venerable forefathers again from their graves; who would thunder in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ars their fatal error.</p>
            <p>The righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is one of thoſe great myſteries which the angels deſire to <hi>look into,</hi> and ſeems to be one of the firſt leſſons that God taught men after the fall. For what were the coats that God made to put on our firſt parents, but types of the application of the merits or righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to believers hearts? We are told, that thoſe coats were made of ſkins of beaſts, and as beaſts were not then food for men, we may fairly infer, that thoſe beaſts were ſlain in ſacrifice, in commemoration of the great ſacrifice Jeſus Chriſt thereafter to be offered. And the ſkins of thoſe beaſts thus ſlain, being put on Adam and Eve, they were thereby taught <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow their nakedneſs was to be covered with the righteouſneſs of the Lamb of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:029886_0010_0FE2BEE238FF5AB8"/>
This is it which is meant, when we are told A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham believed on the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs. In ſhort, this is it of which the law and all the prophets have ſpoken, eſpecially Jeremiah in the words of the text—<hi>The Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi>—</p>

            <p>And if any Arians or Socinians are drawn by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to hear what the babler has to ſay, let them be aſhamed of denying the divinity of that Lord that has bought poor ſinners by his precious blood. For the Perſon mentioned in the text under the character of <hi>Lord,</hi> is Jeſus Chriſt.—<hi>Behold,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto David a righteous branch, a King ſhall reign and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

If ſo, if there were no other text in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029886_0011_0FE2BE488F02C9E8"/>
to prove the divinity of Chriſt, that is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For if the word <hi>Lord</hi> may properly belong to Jeſus Chriſt. He muſt be God. For as you have it in the margins of your Bibles, the word <hi>Lord</hi> is in the original <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial title of God himſelf. Come then, ye Arians, kiſs the Son of God, bow down before him, and honour him, even as you honour the Father, Learn of the angels thoſe morning ſtars, and worſhip him as truly God.—For otherwiſe you are as much idolaters, as thoſe that worſhip the Virgin Mary. And as for you Socinians, who ſay Chriſt was a mere man, and yet profeſs that he was your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, according to your own principles you are accurſed. For, if Chriſt be a mere man, then he is only an arm of fleſh.—And it is written, <hi>Curſed is he that truſteth on an arm of fleſh.</hi>—But I would hope there are no ſuch monſters here. At leaſt, that after theſe conſiderations, they would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of broaching ſuch monſtrous abſurdities any more.—For it is plain, that by the word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> we are to underſtand the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who here takes to himſelf the title of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and therefore muſt be very God of very God, or, as the apoſtle devoutly expreſſes it, God <hi>bleſſed for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How the Lord is to be <hi>man's righteouſneſs</hi> comes next to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>And that is, in one word, by <hi>imputation.</hi>—For it pleaſed God, after he had made all things <hi>by the word of his power,</hi> to create man after his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. And ſo infinite was the condeſcenſion of the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, that although he might have inſiſted on the everlaſting obedience of him and his poſterity, yet he was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to oblige himſelf, by a covenant or agreement
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029886_0012_0FE2BEECB98DE6E8"/>
made with his own creatures, upon condition of an unſinning obedience, to give them immortality and eternal life.—For when it is ſaid, <hi>the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> we may fairly infer, ſo long as he continued obedient, and did not eat thereof, he ſhould ſurely live.—The 3d of Geneſis gives us a full, but mournful account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how our firſt parents broke this covenant, and thereby ſtood in need of a better righteouſneſs than their own, in order to procure their future acceptance with God. For what muſt they do? They were as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a covenant of works, as ever. And, though after their diſobedience they were without ſtrength, yet they were obliged not only to do, but continue to do all things, and that too in the moſt perfect manner which the Lord had required of them.—And not only ſo, but to make ſatisfaction to God's infinitely offended juſtice, for the breach they had already been guilty of.—Here then opens the amazing ſcene of divine philanthropy—I mean God's love to man—For behold, what man could not do, Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of his Father's love, undertakes to do for him. And that God might be juſt in juſtifying the ungodly, though he was in the form of God, and therefore thought it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God, yet he took upon him the form of a ſervant, even human nature.—In that nature he obeyed, and thereby fulfilled the whole moral law in our ſtead—And alſo died a painful death upon the croſs, and thereby became a curſe for, or inſtead of, thoſe whom the Father had given him. As God, he ſatisfied at the ſame time that he obeyed, and ſuffered as man; and being God and man, in one perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wrought out a full, perfect and ſufficient righteouſneſs for all to whom it was to be imputed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:029886_0013_0FE2BE544D032188"/>
Here then we ſee the meaning of the word <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> It implies the active, as well as paſſive obedience of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. We general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when talking of the merits of Chriſt, only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the latter, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>—his death; whereas the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>viz.</hi> his life and active obedience is equally neceſſary. Chriſt is not ſuch a Saviour as becomes us, unleſs we join both together.—Chriſt not only died, but lived; not only ſuffered, but obeyed, for or inſtead of poor ſinners. And both theſe jointly make up that complete righteouſneſs which is to be imputed to us, as the diſobedience of our firſt parents was made ours by <hi>imputation.</hi> In this ſenſe, and no other, are we to underſtand that parallel which St. Paul draws in the 5th of the Romans, between the firſt and ſecond Adam. This is what he elſewhere terms our <hi>being made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> This is the ſenſe wherein the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet would have us to underſtand the words of the text; therefore chap. xxx. ver. 16. <hi>She, i. e.</hi> the church itſelf ſhall be called (having this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to her) the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi>—A paſſage, I think, worthy the profoundeſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all the ſons and daughters of Abraham.</p>
            <p>Many are the objections which the proud hearts of fallen men are continually urging againſt this wholeſome, this divine, this ſoul-ſaving doctrine. I come now in the third place, to anſwer ſome few of thoſe which I think the moſt conſiderable.</p>
            <p>And firſt, they ſay, becauſe they would appear friends to morality, <q>That the doctrine of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs is deſtructive of good works, and leads to licentiouſneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And who pray are the perſons that generally urge this objection? Are they men full of faith, and men really concerned for good works? No, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029886_0014_0FE2BEF18AEEB8A8"/>
few exceptions there may be, if there be any at all, its notorious, they are generally men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. The beſt title I can give them is, that of prophane mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts, or moraliſts falſely ſo called. For I appeal to the experience of the preſent, as well as paſt ages, if iniquity did and does not moſt abound where the doctrine of Chriſt's whole perſonal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is moſt cried down, and moſt ſeldom mentioned.—Arminian being Antichriſtian princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, always did, and always will lead to Antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian practices. And never was there a reformation brought about in the church, but by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs.—This, as that man of God, Luther calls it, is <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulus Stantis aut Cadentis Eccleſiae,</hi> the article by which the church ſtands or falls.—And though the preachers of this doctrine are generally branded by thoſe on the other ſide with the approbrious names of Antinomians, deceivers, and what not! yet, I believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the truth of the doctrine on both ſides was to be judged of by the lives of the preachers and profeſſors of it, their's on our ſide the queſtion, would have the advantage every way.</p>
            <p>Its true, this, as well as every other doctrine of grace, may be abuſed. And perhaps the unchriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian walk of ſome, who have talked of Chriſt's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs, juſtification by faith, and the like, and yet never felt it imputed to their own ſouls, has given the enemies of the Lord thus cauſe to blaſpheme. But this is a very unſafe, as well as very unfair way of arguing.—The only queſtion ſhould be, Whether or no this doctrine of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs does itſelf cut off the occaſion of good works, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ead to licentiouſneſs? No, in no wiſe. It excludes works indeed from being any
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029886_0015_0FE2BE58F07D8F18"/>
cauſe of our juſtification in the ſight of God.—But it requires good works as a proof of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this righteouſneſs imputed to us, and as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative evidence of our juſtification in the ſight of men. And then how can the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs, be a doctrine leading to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs?</p>
            <p>Its all calumny.—St. Paul introduces an infidel making this objection in his epiſtle to the Romans.—And none but infidels, that never felt the power of Chriſt's reſurrection upon their ſouls, will urge it over again.—And therefore, notwithſtanding this objection, with the prophet in the text we may boldly ſay, <hi>The Lord is our righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Satan (and no wonder that his ſervants im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate him) often <hi>transforms himſelf into an angel of light.</hi> And therefore (ſuch perverſe things will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and Arminianiſm make men ſpeak) in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to dreſs their objections in the beſt colours.—Some urge, <q>that our Saviour preached on ſuch doctrine—that in his ſermon upon the Mount, He mentions only morality;</q> and conſequently the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs falls whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ground.—</p>
            <p>But ſurely the men, who urge this objection, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have not read, or never underſtood our Lord's bleſſed diſcourſe, wherein the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs is ſo plainly taught, that he that runs, if he has eyes that ſee, may read.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Lord does recommend morality and good works (as all faithful miniſters will do) and clears the moral law from the many corrupt gloſſes put upon it by the letter-learned Phariſees.—But then, before he comes to this, its remarkable, he talks of inward piety, ſuch as poverty of ſpirit, meekneſs, holy mourning, purity of heart,—eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029886_0016_0FE2BEFD77668A78"/>
hungering and thirſting after righteouſneſs, and then recommend good works, as an evidence of our having his righteouſneſs imputed to us, and theſe graces and divine tempers wrought in our hearts.—<q>Let your light (that is, the divine light I before have been mentioning) ſhine before men, in a holy life, that they ſeeing our good works, may glorify your Father which is in heaven.</q>—And then immediately adds, <q>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the <hi>moral</hi> law—I came not to deſtroy, to take away the force of it as a rule of life, but to fulfil, to obey it in its whole lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and give the complete ſenſe of it.</q>—And then he goes on to ſhew, how exceeding broad the moral law is. So that our Lord, inſtead of diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an imputed righteouſneſs in his ſermon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mount, not only confirms it, but alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the foregoing objection urged againſt it, by making good works a proof and evidence of its being imputed to our ſouls.—He therefore that has ears to hear, let him hear what the prophet ſays in the words of the text—<hi>The Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as Satan not only quoted ſcripture, but alſo backed one temptation with it after another, when he attacked Chriſt's perſon in the wilderneſs; ſo his children generally take the ſame method in treating his doctrine. And therefore they urge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother objection againſt the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs, from the example of the young man in the goſpel.</p>
            <p>We may ſtate it thus:—<q>The evangeliſt St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mark, ſay they, chap. x. mentions a young man that came to Chriſt, running and aſking him what he ſhould do to in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> eternal life? Chriſt, ſay they, referred him to the commandments, to know what he muſt do to inherit eternal life. It
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029886_0017_0FE2BE61D9FE76F8"/>
is plain therefore, works were to be partly at leaſt, the cauſe of his juſtification; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs is unſcriptural.</q>—This is the objection in its full ſtrength; and little ſtrength in all its fulneſs. For, was I to prove the neceſſity of an imputed righteouſneſs, I ſcarce know how I could bring a better inſtance to make it good.</p>
            <p>Let us take a more intimate view of this young man, and our Lord's behaviour towards him, Mark x. 17. the evangeliſt tells us, <q>That when Chriſt was gone forth into the way, there came one running (it ſhould ſeem it was ſome nobleman, a rarity indeed, to ſee ſuch a one running to Chriſt!) and not only ſo, but he kneeled to him (though perhaps many of his rank ſcarce knew the time when they kneeled to Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, ſaving, Good Maſter, what ſhall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?</hi>
               </q>—Then Jeſus, to ſee whether or not he believed him to be what he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was, truly, properly God, ſaid unto him, <hi>Why calleſt thou me Good? There is none good, but one, that is God.</hi>—And that he might directly anſwer his queſtion; ſays he, <hi>Thou knoweſt the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Do not commit adultery, Do not bear falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Defraud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Honour thy father and mother.</hi>—This, I ſay, was a direct anſwer to his queſtion; namely, that eternal life was not to be attained by his doings.—For our Lord, by referring him to the commandments, did not (as the objecters inſinuate) in the leaſt hint, that his morality would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to the favour and mercy of God.—But he intended thereby to make the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to bring him to himſelf; that the young man, ſeeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> broken every one of theſe commandments, might thereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:029886_0018_0FE2BF021BF93D58"/>
the inſufficiency of his own, and conſequently the abſolute neceſſity of looking out for a better righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, whereon he might depend for eternal life.</p>
            <p>This was what our Lord deſigned.—The young man being ſelf-righteous, and willing to juſtify himſelf, ſaid, <hi>All theſe have I obſerved from my youth.</hi> But had he known himſelf, he would have confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>All theſe have I broke from my youth.</hi>—For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he had not actually committed adultery, had he never luſted after a woman in his heart? What if he had not really killed another; had he never been angry without a cauſe, or ſpoken unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly with his lips? If ſo, by breaking one of the leaſt commandments in the leaſt degree, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came liable to the curſe of God: For <hi>curſed is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> (ſaith the law) <hi>that continueth not to do all things that are written in this book.</hi>"—And therefore, as I obſerved before, our Lord was ſo far from ſpeaking againſt, that he treated the young man in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, on purpoſe to convince him of the neceſſity of an imputed righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But perhaps they will reply, it is ſaid, <hi>Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him loved him.</hi> And what then? This he might do with a human love, and at the ſame time this young man have no intereſt in his blood.—Thus Chriſt is ſaid to wonder—to weep over Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and ſay—<hi>Oh that thou hadſt</hi> KNOWN, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſuch like paſſages are to be referred only to his human nature. And there is a great deal of difference between the love wherewith Chriſt loved this young man, and that wherewith he loved Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Lazarus, and their ſiſter Martha.—To illuſtrate this by a compariſon.—A miniſter of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſeeing many amiable diſpoſitions, ſuch as readineſs to hear the word, and decent behaviour
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029886_0019_0FE2BE668B49C928"/>
at public worſhip, a life outwardly ſpotleſs in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, cannot but ſo far love them. But then there is much difference betwixt that love which a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter feels for ſuch, and that divine love, that union and ſympathy of ſoul, which he feels for thoſe that he is ſatisfied are really born again of God.—Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to our Lord's caſe, as a faint illuſtration of it—Conſider what has been ſaid upon the young man's caſe in general, and then, if before you were fond of this objection, inſtead of triumphing with him, you will go ſorrowful away.—Our Saviour's reply to him, more and more convinces us of the truth of the prophet's aſſertion in the text, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Lord is our righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a fourth and grand objection yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and that is taken from the 25th chapter of St. Matthew, <q>where our Lord is deſcribed, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding people with eternal life, becauſe they fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and ſuch like.—Their works therefore were a cauſe of their juſtification; conſequently, the doctrine of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs is not agreeable to ſcripture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This I confeſs is the moſt plauſible objection that is brought againſt the doctrine inſiſted on from the text. And in order that we may anſwer it in as clear and brief a manner as may be, we confeſs with the article of the church of England, <q>that albeit good works do not juſtify us, yet they will follow after juſtification, as fruits of it; and tho' they can claim no reward in themſelves, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they ſpring from faith in Chriſt, and a renewed ſoul, they ſhall receive a reward <hi>of grace,</hi> though not <hi>of debt;</hi> and conſequently, the more we abound in ſuch good works, the greater will be our reward when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come to judgment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:029886_0020_0FE2BF09F8A78E28"/>
Take theſe conſiderations along with us, and they will help us much to anſwer the objection now before us.—For thus St. Matthew—<hi>Then ſhall the King ſay to them on the right hand, Come ye bleſſed children of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.—For I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat. I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink. I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in. Naked, and ye clothed me. I was ſick, and ye viſited me I was in priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi> 
               <q>I will therefore reward you, becauſe you have done theſe things out of love to me, and hereby have evidenced yourſelves to be my true diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</q>—And that the people did not depend on theſe good actions for their juſtification in the fight of God, is evident. <hi>For when ſaw we thee an hungry,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and fed thee? or thirſty, and gave thee drink? When ſaw we thee a ſtranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and clothed thee? Or when ſaw we thee ſick, or in priſon, and came unto thee?</hi>—Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and queſtions quite improper for perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on their own righteouſneſs for acceptance and acquitance in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>But when they reply again this.—In the latter part of the chapter, ſay they, It is plain that Jeſus Chriſt rejects and damns the others for not doing theſe things. And therefore if he damns thoſe for not doing, he ſaves thoſe for doing; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs is good for nothing.</p>
            <p>But that is no conſequence at all—For God may juſtly damn any man for omitting the leaſt duty of the moral law, and yet in himſelf is not obliged to give any one any reward, ſuppoſing he has done all that he can. We are unprofitable ſervants, we have done not near ſo much as it was our duty to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029886_0021_0FE2BE6EA255E6D8"/>
do, muſt be the language of the moſt holy ſouls living; and therefore from, or in ourſelves, cannot be juſtified in the ſight of God.—This was the frame of the devout ſouls juſt now referred to—Senſible of this, they were ſo far from depending on their works for juſtification in the ſight of God, that they were filled, as it were, with a holy bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to think our Lord ſhould condeſcend to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much more to reward them for their poor works of faith and labours of love. I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their hearts would riſe with a holy indignation againſt thoſe, who urge this paſſage as an objection againſt the aſſertion of the prophet in the words of the text, that the <hi>Lord is our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I think we have fairly anſwered theſe grand objections, which are generally urged againſt the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs.—Was I to ſtop here, I think I might ſay, we are made more than conquerors, through him that loved us.—But there is a way of arguing which I have always admired, becauſe I have thought always very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſhewing the abſurdities that will follow from denying any particular propoſition in diſpute.</p>
            <p>This is the next thing that was propoſed,—<q>And n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And firſt, if we deny this doctrine, we turn the truth, I mean the word of God, as much as we can into a lie, and utterly ſubvert all thoſe places of ſcripture, which ſay, <hi>That we are ſaved by grace; that it is not of works, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029886_0022_0FE2BF0F6E7AF8B8"/>
perſonal righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt be not the ſole cauſe of my acceptance with God, if any work done by or foreſeen in me, was in the leaſt to be joined with it, or looked upon by God as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, impulſive cauſe of acquitting my ſoul from guilt, then I have ſomewhat whereof I may glory in myſelf. Now boaſting is excluded in the great work of our redemption. But that cannot be, if we are enemies to the doctrine of an imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.—It would be endleſs to enumerate how many texts of ſcripture muſt be falſe, if this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine be not true. Let it ſuffice to affirm in the general, that if we deny an imputed righteouſneſs, we may as well deny a divine revelation all at once. For it is the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end of the book of God.—We muſt either diſbelieve that, or believe what the prophet hath ſpoken in the text, <hi>That the Lord is our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther.—I obſerved at the beginning of this diſcourſe, that we are all Arminians and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts by nature;—for, as one obſerves, Arminian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm is the back way to Popery. And here I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture further to affirm, <q>That if we deny the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of an imputed righteouſneſs, whatever we may ſtyle our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Sirs, What think you?—Suppoſe I was to come and tell you, that you muſt intercede with ſaints, for them to intercede with God for you—would you not then ſay, I was juſtly reputed a Popiſh miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary by ſome, and deſervedly thruſt out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>es by others?—I ſuppoſe you would.—And why? Becauſe you would ſay, the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt was ſufficient of itſelf, without the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029886_0023_0FE2BE7587EAC778"/>
interceſſion of ſaints, and that it was blaſphemous to join theirs with his, as though it was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe I went a little more round about, and told you, that the death of Chriſt was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, without our death being added to it; that you muſt die as well as Chriſt, join your death with his, and then it would be ſufficient.—Might you not then, with a holy indignation, throw duſt in the air, and juſtly call me a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etter forth of ſtrange doctrines? And now then, if it be not only abſurd, but blaſphemous, to join the interceſſion of ſaints, with the interceſſion of Chriſt, as though his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion was not ſufficient, or our death with the death of Chriſt, as though his death was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; judge ye, if it be not equally abſurd, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually blaſphemous, to join our obedience, either wholly or in part, with the obedience of Chriſt, as if that was not ſufficient. And if ſo, what abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities will follow the denying that the Lord, both as to his active and paſſive obedience, is our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs?</p>
            <p>One more abſurdity I ſhall mention, that will follow from the denying this doctrine, and I have done.</p>
            <p>I remember a ſtory of a certain prelate, who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many arguments in vain urged to convince the earl of Rocheſter of the inviſible realities of another world, took his leave of his lordſhip with ſome ſuch words as theſe:—<q>Well, my lord, ſays he, if there be no hell, I am ſafe;—but, if there ſhould be ſuch a thing, my lord, as hell, what will become of you?</q> I apply this to thoſe that oppoſe the doctrine now inſiſted on. If there be no ſuch thing as the doctrine of an imputed righteouſneſs, thoſe that hold it, and bring forth fruit unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029886_0024_0FE2BF175E169360"/>
are ſafe. But if there be ſuch a thing (as there certainly is) what will become of you that deny it, is no difficult matter to determine.—You<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> portion muſt be in a lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone for ever and ever, ſince you will rely upon your works, by your works you ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e judged.—They ſhall be weighed in the balance of the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary.—They will be found wanting—By your works therefore ſhall you be condemned; and you, being out of Chriſt, ſhall find God to your poor, wretched ſouls, a conſuming fire.</p>
            <p>The great Stoddard, of Northampton, in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England, has therefore well entitled a book which he wrote (and which I would take this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to recommend) <q>The ſafety of appearing in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</q>—For why ſhould I lean upon a broken reed, when I can have the rock of ages to ſtand upon, that never can be moved?</p>
            <p>And now before I come to a more particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, give me leave, in the apoſtle's language, triumphantly to cry out, Where is the ſcribe? where the diſputer? where is the reaſoning infidel of this generation? Can any thing appear more reaſonable, even according to your own way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, than the doctrine here laid down? Have you not felt a convincing power to go along with the word? Why then will you not believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo he may become the Lord your righteouſneſs.</p>

As I have often told you, ſo I tell you again, an unapplied Chriſt, is no Chriſt at all.—Can you then, with believing Thomas, cry out, <hi>My Lord and my God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Is Chriſt your ſanctification, as well as your outward righteouſneſs? For the word righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the text, not only implies Chriſt's perſonal righteouſneſs imputed to us, but alſo holineſs of heart wrought in us—Theſe two God has joined together.—He never did, He never does, He nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will put them aſunder.—If you are juſtified by the BLOOD, you are alſo ſanctified by the Spirit of the Lord. Can you then in this ſenſe ſay, the Lord our righteouſneſs? Were you ever made to abhor yourſelves for your actual and original ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to loath your own righteouſneſs (or, as the prophet beautifully expreſſes it, your righteouſneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) as filthy rags?

to reach out the arm of faith, and embrace the bleſſed Jeſus in your ſouls, ſo that you could ſay, <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his?</hi> If ſo, fear not, whoever you are—hail, all hail! you happy ſouls! The Lord, the Lord Chriſt, the everlaſting God is your righteouſneſs.—Chriſt has juſtified you, who is he that condemneth you? Chriſt has died for you, nay rather is riſen again, and ever liveth to make interceſſion for you.—Being now juſtified by his grace, you have peace with God, and ſhall e're long be with Jeſus in glory, reaping everlaſting and unſpeakable redemption both in body and ſoul.—For there is no condemnation to thoſe that are really in Chriſt Jeſus. Whether Paul or Apollos, or life or death, all is yours, if you are Chriſt's, for Chriſt is God's!—Oh, my brethren, my heart is enlarged towards you!—Oh, think of the love of Chriſt in dying for you!—If the Lord be your righteouſneſs, let the righteouſneſs of your Lord be continually in your mouth. Talk of, oh talk of and recommend the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, when you lie down, and when you riſe up, at your going out and at your coming in!—Think of the greatneſs of the gift, as well as of the giver!—Shew to all the world in whom you have believed! Let all by your fruits know, that the Lord is your righteouſneſs, and that you are waiting for your Lord from heaven!—Oh, ſtudy to be holy, even as he who has called you, and waſhed you in his own blood, is holy!—Let not the righteouſneſs of the Lord be evil ſpoken of through you.—Let not Jeſus be wounded in the houſe of his friends; but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt day by day.—Oh, think of his dying love! Let that love conſtrain you to

obedience! Having much forgiven, love much. Be always aſking, what ſhall I do, to expreſs my gratitude to the Lord, for giving me his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?

Why is the Lord my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? Why is he become my ſalvation, who have ſo often deſerved damnation at his hands?</p>
            <p>Oh, my friends, I truſt I feel ſomewhat of a ſenſe of God's diſtinguiſhing love upon my heart! there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt divert a little from congratulating you to invite poor chriſtleſs ſinners to come to him, and accept of his righteouſneſs, that they may have life.</p>
            <p>Alas, my heart almoſt bleeds! What a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of precious ſouls are now before me! How ſhortly muſt all be uſhered into eternity—And yet, O cutting thought! was God now to require all your ſouls, how few, comparatively ſpeaking, could really ſay, the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And think you, O ſinners, that you will be able to ſtand in the day of judgment, if Chriſt be not your righteouſneſs! No, that alone is the wedding-garment in which you muſt appear.—Oh, chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſinners, I am diſtreſſed for you!—The deſires of my ſoul are enlarged.—Oh, that this may be an accepted time! Oh, that the Lord may be your righteouſneſs! For whither would you flee, if death ſhould find you naked?—Indeed there is no hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelves from his preſence.—The pitiful fig-leaves of your own righteouſneſs will not cover your nakedneſs, when God ſhall call you to ſtand before him.—Adam found them ineffectual, and ſo wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If you are out of Chriſt, if Chriſt be not your righteouſneſs, Chriſt himſelf ſhall pronounce you damned.—And can you bear to think of being damned by Chriſt? Can you bear to hear the Lord Jeſus ſay unto you, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels?</hi> Can you live, think you, in everlaſting burnings? Is your fleſh braſs, and your bones iron? What if they are, hell-fire, that fire prepared for the devil and his angels, will heat them through and through! And can you bear to depart from Chriſt? Oh, that heart-piercing thought!—Aſk thoſe holy ſouls, who are at any time bewailing an abſent God, who walk in darkneſs, and ſee no light, though but a few days or hours; aſk them, what it is to loſe a ſight and preſence of Chriſt?—See how they ſeek him ſorrowing, and go mourning after him all the day long! And if it is ſo dreadful to loſe the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible preſence of Chriſt only for a day, what muſt it be to be baniſhed from him to all eternity!—But thus it muſt be, if Chriſt be not your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.—For God's juſtice muſt be ſatisfied; and unleſs Chriſt's righteouſneſs is imputed and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you here, you muſt be ſatisfying the divine juſtice in hell torments eternally hereafter.—Nay, as I ſaid before, Chriſt himſelf, the God of love, ſhall condemn you to that place of torment.—And oh, how cutting is that thought! Methinks I ſee poor, trembling, chriſtleſs wretches, ſtanding before the bar of God, crying out, Lord, if we muſt be damned, let ſome angel, or ſome archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel pronounce the damn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Beg of God to give you faith; and if the Lord give you that, you will by it receive Chriſt, with his righteouſneſs, and his all. You need not fear the greatneſs or number of your ſins—For are you ſinners? ſo am I. Are you the chief of ſinners? ſo am I. Are you backſliding ſinners? ſo am I. And yet the Lord (for ever adored be his rich, free, and ſovereign grace) the Lord is my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.—Come then, O young men, who (as I acted once myſelf) are playing the prodigal, and wandring away afar off from your heavenly father's houſe, come home, come home, and leave your ſwines trough—Feed no longer on the huſks of ſenſual delights.—For Chriſt's ſake, ariſe and come home!

oh flee for your lives! Be not afraid.—All things are poſſible with God. If you come, though it be at the eleventh hour, Chriſt Jeſus will in no wiſe caſt you out. Oh, ſeek then for the Lord to be your righteouſneſs, and beſeech him to let you know how it is that a man may be born again when he is old!—But I muſt not forget the lambs of the flock.—To feed them was one of my Lord's laſt commands.—I know he will be angry with me, if I do not tell them, that the Lord may be their righteouſneſs; and that of ſuch is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.—Come then, ye little children, come to Chriſt; the Lord Chriſt ſhall be your righteouſneſs.—Do not think, that you are too young to be converted.—Perhaps many of you may be nine or ten years old, and yet cannot ſay, the Lord is our righteouſneſs; which many have ſaid, though younger than you.—Come then, while you are young.—Perhaps you may not live to be old.—Do not ſtay for other people. If your fathers and mothers will not come to Chriſt, do you come without them.—Let children lead them, and ſhew them how the Lord may he their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.—Our Lord Jeſus loved little children.

            <p>WHEN I read to you theſe words, I may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs you in the language of the holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to the ſhepherds, that were watching their flocks by night. <hi>Behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy.</hi>—For this is the firſt promiſe that was made of a Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the apoſtate race of Adam. We generally look for Chriſt only in the New Teſtament; but Chriſtianity, in one ſenſe, is very near as old as the creation.—It is wonderful to obſerve, how gradually God revealed his Son to mankind. He began with the promiſe in the text, and this the elect lived upon till the time of Abraham—To him God made further diſcoveries of his eternal counſel concerning man's redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Afterwards, at ſundry times, and in divers manners, God ſpake to the fathers by the prophets, till at length the Lord Jeſus himſelf was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fleſh, and came and tabernacled among us.</p>
            <p>This firſt promiſe muſt certainly be but dark to our firſt parents, in compariſon of that ſight we enjoy.—And yet, dark as it was, we may aſſure

ourſelves they built upon it their hopes of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation, and by that faith were ſaved.</p>
            <p>How they came to ſtand in need of this prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe, and what is the extent and meaning of it, I intend God willing, to make the ſubject matter of your preſent meditation.</p>
            <p>The fall of man is written in too legible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters not to be underſtood—Thoſe that deny it, by their denying prove it. The very heathens confeſſed and bewailed it.—They could ſee the ſtreams of corruption running through the whole race of mankind, but could not trace them to the fountain head. Before God gave a revelation of his Son, man was a riddl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to himſelf—And Moſes unfolds more in this one chapter (out of which the text is taken) than all mankind could have been capable of finding out of themſelves, though they had ſtudied to all eternity.</p>
            <p>In the foregoing chapter, he had given us a full account, how God ſpoke the world into being; and eſpecially how he formed man of the duſt of the earth, and breathed into him the breath of life, ſo that he became a living ſoul. A counſel of the Trinity was called concerning the formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this lovely creature. The reſult of that council was, <hi>Let us make man in our image after our likeneſs.—So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him.</hi>—Moſes remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably repeats the words, that we might take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of our divine original.—Never was ſo much expreſſed in ſo few words.—None but a man inſpired could have done ſo. But it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that though Moſes mentions our being made in the image of God, yet he mentions it but twice, and that, as it were, in a tranſient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as though he would have ſaid, "Man was
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029886_0035_0FE2BF4111804150"/>
made in honour, God made him upright, <hi>in the image of God male and female created he them.</hi> But man ſo ſoon fell, and became like the beaſts that periſh, nay; like the devil himſelf, that it is ſcarce worth mentioning."</p>
            <p>How ſoon man fell after he was created, is not told us, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore, to fix any time, is to be wiſe above what is written.—And, I think, they who-ſuppoſe that man fell the ſame day in which he was made, have no ſufficient ground for their opinion.—The many things which are crouded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the former chapter, ſuch as the formation of Adam's wife, his giving names to the beaſts, and his being put into the garden which God had planted, I think require a longer ſpace of time than a day to be tranſacted in—However, all agree in this, "Man ſtood not long." How long, or how ſhort a while, I will not take upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.—It more concerns us to enquire, how he came to fall from his ſtedfaſtneſs, and what was the riſe and progreſs of the temptation which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over him.—The account given us in this chapter concerning it, is very full, and it may do us much ſervice under God, to make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the ſerpent,</hi> ſays the ſacred hiſtorian, <hi>was more ſubtile than any beaſt of the field which the Lord God had made, and he ſaid unto the woman, yea, hath God ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though this was a real ſerpent, yet he that ſpoke was no other than the devil; from hence, perhaps, called the old ſerpent, becauſe he took poſſeſſion of the ſerpent when he came to beguile our firſt parents.—The devil envied the happineſs of man, who was made, as ſome think, to ſupply the place of fallen angels.—God made man upright, and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029886_0036_0FE2BE9D28B7DBD0"/>
with full power to ſtand if he would—He was juſt, therefore, in ſuffering him to be tempted—If he fell he had no one to blame except himſelf.—But how muſt Satan effect his fall?—He cannot do it by his power, he attempts it therefore by policy—He takes poſſeſſion of a ſerpent, which was more ſubtil than all the beaſts of the field, which the Lord God had made; ſo that men that are full of ſubtility, but have no piety, are only machines for the devil to work upon, juſt as he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he ſaid unto the Woman.</hi>—Here is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his ſubtility—He ſays unto the woman, the weaker veſſel, and when ſhe was alone from her huſband, and therefore was more liable to be overcome—<hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the garden?</hi> Theſe words are certainly ſpoken in anſwer to ſomething which the devil ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw or heard—In all probability, the woman was now near the tree of knowledge of good and evil. (For we ſhall find her, by and by, plucking an apple from it) perhaps ſhe might be looking at, and wondering what there was in that tree more than the others, that ſhe and her huſband ſhould be forbidden to taſte of it—Satan ſeeing this, and covering to draw her into a parley with him (for if the devil can perſuade us not to reſiſt, but to commune with him, he hath gained a great point) he ſays, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the garden?</hi>—The firſt thing he does, is to perſuade her if poſſible, to entertain hard thoughts of God—This is his general way of dealing with God's children—"Yea, ſays he, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the garden? What! hath God planted a garden and placed you in the midſt of it only to teaze and perplex you? hath he planted a garden, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029886_0037_0FE2BF45DA73FCE8"/>
yet forbid you making uſe of any of the fruits of it all?" It was impoſſible for him to aſk a more enſnaring queſtion, in order to gain his end: For Eve, was here ſeemingly obliged to anſwer, and vindicate God's goodneſs. And therefore,—</p>
            <p>Ver. 2. The woman ſaid unto the Serpent, <hi>We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But,</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>Of the fruit of the tree which is in the midſt of the garden, God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it, leſt ye die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former part of the anſwer was good, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, God has not forbid us eating of every tree of the garden. No, we may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden (and it ſhould ſeem even of the tree of life, which was as a ſacrament to man in a ſtate of innocence) there is only one tree in the midſt of the garden, of which God hath ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it, leſt ye die." Here ſhe begins to warp, and ſin begins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in her heart.—Already ſhe has contracted ſome of the ſerpent's poiſon, by talking with him, which ſhe ought not to have done at all. For we might eaſily ſuppoſe, that it could be no good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that could put ſuch a queſtion unto her, and infinuate ſuch diſhonourable thoughts of God.—She ſhould therefore have fled from him, and not ſtood to have parleyed with him at all.—Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the ill effects of it appear—ſhe begins to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the divine threatening.—God hath ſaid, the <hi>Day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> or, <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou ſhalt die.</hi>—But Eve ſays, ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it leſt ye die.—We may be aſſured we are fallen into, and begin to fill by temptation, when we begin to think God
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029886_0038_0FE2BEA4DF598340"/>
will not be ſo good as his word, in reſpect to the execution of his threatnings denounced againſt ſin.—Satan knew this, and therefore artfully ſaid unto the woman, ver. 4. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die,</hi> in an inſinuating manner, "Ye ſhall not ſurely die—ſurely, God will not be ſo cruel as to damn you only for eating an apple, it cannot be."—Alas! how many does Satan lead captive at his will, by flattering them that they ſhall not ſurely die, that hell torments will not be eternal—that God is all mercy; that he therefore will not puniſh a few years ſin with an eternity of miſery.—But Eve found God as good as his word, and ſo will all they that go on in ſin, under a falſe hope that they ſhall not ſurely die.</p>
            <p>We may alſo underſtand the words ſpoken poſitively, and this is agreeable to what follows—<hi>You ſhall not ſurely die</hi>—"It is all a deluſion, a mere mere bugbear, to keep you in a ſervile ſubjection."</p>
            <p>For, ver. 4. <hi>God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then ſhall your eyes be opened, and ye ſhall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What child of God can expect to eſcape ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when God himſelf was thus ſlandered even in paradiſe? Surely the underſtanding of Eve muſt have been, in ſome meaſure, blinded, or ſhe would not have ſuffered the tempter to ſpeak ſuch perverſe things.—In what odious colours is God here repreſented! <hi>God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, ye ſhall be as gods</hi> (equal with God.) So that the grand temptation was, that they ſhould be hereafter under no controul, equal, if not ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to God, that made them, knowing good and evil.—Eve could not t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll what Satan meant by this; but, to be ſure, ſhe underſtood it of ſome great privilege which they were to enjoy.—And
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029886_0039_0FE2BF4D5D7755C0"/>
thus Satan now points out a way, which ſeems right to ſinners, but does not tell them the end of that way is death.</p>
            <p>To give ſtrength and force to this temptation, in all probability, Satan, or the ſerpent, at this time, plucked an apple from the tree, and ate it before Eve, by which Eve might be induced to think, that the ſagacity and power of ſpeech, which the ſerpent had above the other beaſts, muſt be owing, in a great meaſure, to his eating that fruit; and, therefore, if he received ſo much improvement, ſhe might alſo expect a like bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from it. All this, I think, is clear; for, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I do not ſee with what propriety it could be ſaid, <hi>when the woman ſaw that it was good for food.</hi> How could ſhe know it was good for food, unleſs ſhe had ſeen the ſerpent feed upon it?</p>
            <p>Satan now begins to get ground apace—Luſt had conceived in her heart; ſhortly it will bring forth ſin—Sin being conceived brings forth death. Ver. 6. <hi>And when the woman ſaw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eyes, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe, ſhe took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave alſo unto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and he did eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our ſenſes are the landing ports of our ſpiritual enemies.—How needful is that reſolution of holy Job, <hi>I have made a covenant with mine eyes.</hi> When Eve began to gaze on the forbidden fruit with her eyes, ſhe ſoon began to long after it with her heart.—When ſhe ſaw that it was good for food, and pleaſant to the eyes (here was the luſt of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh, and luſt of the eye) but, above all, a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe, wiſer than God would have her be, nay as wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e as God himſelf; ſhe took of the fruit thereof, and gave alſo unto
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029886_0040_0FE2BEA9A4522438"/>
her huſband with her, and he did eat—As ſoon as ever ſhe ſinned herſelf, ſhe turned tempter to her huſband—its dreadful, when thoſe, who ſhould be help-mates for each other in the great work of their ſalvation, are only promoters of each others damnation—But thus it is. If we ourſelves are good, we ſhall excite others to goodneſs; if we do evil, we ſhall entice others to do evil alſo.—There is a cloſe connection between doing and teaching. How needful then is it for us all to take heed that we do not ſin any way ourſelves, left we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come factors for the devil, and enſnare perhaps our neareſt and deareſt relations? <hi>She gave alſo unto her huſband with her, and he did eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas! what a complication of crimes was there in this one ſingle act of ſin!—Here is an utter diſbelief of God's threatning—The utmoſt ingrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude to their Maker, who had ſo lately planted this garden and placed them in is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and comprehenſive character.—Here is the utmoſt neglect of their poſterity, who they knew were to ſtand or fall with them—Here was the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pride of heart—They wanted to be equal with God—Here is the utmoſt contempt put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his threatning and his law—The devil is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited and obeyed before him, and all this only to ſatisfy their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al appetite. Never was a crime of ſuch a complicated nature, committed by any here below—Nothing but the devil's apoſtacy and rebellion could equal it.</p>
            <p>And what are the conſequences of their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?—Are their eyes opened?—Yes, their eyes are opened—But, alas! it is only to ſee their own nakedneſs. For, we are told, ver. 7. <hi>that the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.</hi>—Naked of God, naked of every
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029886_0041_0FE2BF52F087EB70"/>
thing that was holy and good—and deſtitute of the divine image, which they before enjoyed.—They might rightly now be termed <hi>

                  </gap>chabod;</hi> for the glory of the Lord departed from them—Oh! how low did theſe ſons of the morning then fall! out of God into themſelves; from being partakers of the divine nature, into the nature of the devil and the beaſt—Well, therefore, might they know that they were naked, not only in body but in ſoul.—</p>
            <p>And how do they behave now they are naked? Do they fly to God for pardon?—Do they ſeek to him for a robe to cover their nakedneſs?—No. They are now dead to God, earthly, ſenſual, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh—And, therefore, inſtead of applying to God for mercy, they <hi>ſewed,</hi> or <hi>platted fig leaves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and made themſelves apron,</hi> or things to gird about them. This is a lively repreſentation of all natural men—We ſee that we are naked—We in ſome meaſure, confeſs it, but, inſtead of looking up to God for ſuccour, we patch up a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own (as our firſt parents platted fig leaves together) hoping to cover our nakedneſs by that. But our righteouſneſs will not ſtand the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of God's judgment: It will do us no more ſervice than the fig leaves did Adam and Eve—that is, none at all.</p>
            <p>For, ver. 8. <hi>They heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the trees of the garden, in the cool of the day; and Adam and his wife</hi> (notwithſtanding their fig leaves) <hi>hid themſelves from the preſence of the Lord God, among the trees of the garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They heard the voice of the Lord God, or the word of the Lord God, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the Word that was with God, and the Word that was God.</hi> They heard him walking in the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029886_0042_0FE2BEB368EA74F0"/>
trees of the garden, in the <hi>cool of the day.</hi>—A ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, perhaps, when Adam and Eve uſed to go, in an eſpecial manner, and offer up an evening ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praiſe and thankſgiving—The <hi>cool of the day.</hi> Perhaps, the ſin was committed early in the morning, or an noon—But God would not come upon them immediately—He ſtaid till the cool of the day. For, if we would effectually reprove o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we ſhould not do it, when they are warmed with paſſion, but wait till the cool of the day.—</p>
            <p>But what an alteration is here!—Inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing at the voice of their Beloved—inſtead of meeting him with open arms, and enlarged hearts, as before, they hide themſelves in the trees of the garden—Alas, what a fooliſh attempt was this?—Surely, they muſt be naked, otherwiſe how could they think of hiding themſelves from God?—Whither could they flee from his preſence?—But, by their fall, they had contracted an enmity againſt God: They now hated, and were afraid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, their Maker.—And is not this our caſe by nature? aſſuredly it is. We labour to cover our nakedneſs with the fig leaves of our own righteouſneſs—We hide ourſelves from God as long as we can, and will not come, and never ſhould come, did not the Father prevent, draw, and ſweetly conſtrain us by his grace, as he here prevented Adam.</p>
            <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And the Lord God called unto Adam, and ſaid unto him, Adam, where art thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"The Lord God called unto Adam"—(for otherwiſe Adam would never have called unto the Lord God) and ſaid, "<hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi>—How is it, that thou comeſt not to pay thy devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as uſual?"—Chriſtians, remember the Lord keeps an account when you fail coming to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029886_0043_0FE2BF5BB0AA05E8"/>
—Whenever, therefore, you are tempted to withhold your attendance, let each of you fancy you heard the Lord God calling unto you, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "O man, O woman, where art thou?"—It may be underſtood in another and better ſenſe—<hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> What a condition is thy poor ſoul in? This is the firſt thing that the Lord aſks, and convinces a ſinner of, when he prevents, and calls him effectually by his grace—He alſo calls him by name: For unleſs God ſpeaks to us in particular, and we know where we are, how poor, how miſerable, how blind, how naked, we ſhall never value the redemption wrought out for us by the death and obedience of the dear Lord Jeſus—<hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And he ſaid, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid.</hi> See what cowards ſin makes us—If we knew no ſin, we ſhould know no fear. <hi>Becauſe I was naked, and I hid myſelf:</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>And he ſaid, Who told thee that thou waſt naked? Haſt thou eaten of the tree, whereof I</hi> (thy Maker and lawgiver) <hi>commanded thee, that thou ſhouldſt not eat?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God knew very well that Adam was naked, and that he had eaten of the forbidden fruit—But God would know it from Adam's own mouth.—Thus God knows all our neceſſities before we aſk, but yet inſiſts upon our aſking for his grace, and confeſſing our ſins. For, by ſuch acts, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our dependence upon God, take ſhame to ourſelves, and thereby give glory to his great name. Ver. 12. <hi>And the man ſaid, the woman which thou gaveſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

unwilling he is to lay the blame upon, or take ſhame to himſelf. This anſwer is full of inſolence towards God, enmity againſt his wiſe, and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in reſpect to himſelf.

But, as God, notwithſtanding, puniſhed Adam for hearkening to the voice of his wife, ſo he will puniſh thoſe who hearken to the dictates of their corrupt inclinations—For God compels no man to ſin. Adam might have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſolicitations of his wife, if he would.—And ſo, if we look up to God we ſhould find grace to help in the time of need—The devil and our own hearts tempt, but they cannot force us to conſent, without the concurrence of our own wills. So that our damnation is of ourſelves, as it will evidently appear at the great day, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all mens' preſent impudent replies againſt God—As Adam ſpeaks inſolently in reſpect to God, ſo he ſpeaks with enmity againſt his wife—The woman, or <hi>this woman, ſhe gave me</hi>—He lays all the fault upon her, and ſpeaks of her with much contempt—He does not ſay, my wife, my dear wife, but <hi>this woman.</hi> For ſin diſunites the moſt united hearts.

in ſome degree, on this ſide the grave—<hi>The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</hi> What a diſingenuous ſpeech was here!

            <p>Before I proceed to the explanation of this verſe, I cannot but take notice of one great miſtake, which the author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man</hi> is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, in making this verſe contain a covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Adam, as though God perſonally treated with Adam, as before the fall. For, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſecond covenant, in his preface concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caring for the ſoul, ſays he, "This ſecond covenant was made with Adam, and us in him, preſently after the fall, and is contained in theſe words—Gen. iii. 15. where God declares <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpent's head;</hi> and this was made up, as the firſt was, of ſome mercies to be afforded by God, and ſome duties to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us."—This is exceeding falſe divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—For theſe words are not ſpoken to Adam—they are directed only to the ſerpent—Adam and Eve ſtood by as criminals, and God could not treat with them, becauſe they had broken his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And it is ſo far from being a covenant, wherein "ſome mercies are to be afforded by God, and ſome duties to be performed by us," that here is not a word looking that way—It is
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029886_0049_0FE2BF6E71F84838"/>
only a declaration of a free gift of ſalvation through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord—God the Father, and God the Son, had entered into a covenant concerning the ſalvation of the elect from all eternity; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God the Father promiſed, that if the Son would offer his ſoul a ſacrifice for ſin, he ſhould ſee his ſeed. Now this is an open revelation of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret covenant, and therefore God ſpeaks in the moſt poſitive terms, <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel</hi>—The firſt Adam God had treated with before—He proved falſe—God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſecure the ſecond covenant from being broken, puts it into the hands of the ſecond Adam, the Lord from heaven—Adam, after the fall, ſtood no longer as our repreſentative—He and Eve were only private perſons, as we are, and were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hold on the declaration of mercy contained in this promiſe by faith (as they really did) and by that they were ſaved—I do not ſay, but we are to believe and obey, if we are everlaſtingly ſaved—Faith and obedience are conditions, if we only mean that they in order go before our ſalvation; but I deny that theſe are propoſed by God to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, or that God treats with him in this promiſe, as he did before the fall under the covenant of works. For, how could that be, when Adam and Eve were now priſoners at the bar, without ſtrength to perform any conditions at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—The truth is this—God as a reward of Chriſt's ſufferings, prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed to give the elect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is, by no means, an unneceſſary diſtinction. It is a matter of great importance—For want of knowing this, people have been ſo long miſled—They have been taught that they muſt do ſo and ſo, as though they were under a covenant of works, and then for DOING this, they ſhould be ſaved.—This is plainly the whole drift of the book wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intitled, <hi>The Whole Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> of Man</hi>—Whereas, on the contrary, people ſhould be taught, that the Lord Jeſus was the ſecond Adam, with whom the Father entered into covenant for fallen man—That they can now do nothing of or for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhould therefore come to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him to give them faith, by which they ſhall be enabled to lay hold on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and that faith they will ſhew forth by their works, out of love and gratitude to the ever bleſſed Jeſus, their moſt glorious Redeemer, for what he has done for their ſouls: this is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent ſcriptural ſcheme; without holding this, we muſt run into one of theſe two bad extremes, I mean Antinomianiſm on the one hand, or Armin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianiſm on the other—From both which may the good Lord deliver us!—</p>
            <p>But to proceed: By the <hi>ſeed of the woman,</hi> we are here to underſtand the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who, though very God of very God, was for us men and our ſalvation, to have a body prepared for him by the Holy Ghoſt, and to be born of a woman, who never knew man, and by his obedience and death, make an atonement for man's tranſgreſſion, and bring in an everlaſting righteouſneſs, work in them a new nature, and thereby bruiſe the ſerpent's head, <hi>i. e.</hi> deſtroy his power and dominion over

            <p>It is not to be doubted but Adam and Eve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this promiſe in this ſenſe; for its plain, in the latter part of the chapter, ſacrifices were inſtituted—For, from whence ſhould thoſe ſkins come, but from beaſts ſlain for ſacrifice, of which God made them coats?—We find alſo Abel, as well as Cain, offering ſacrifice in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and the apoſtle tells us, he did it <hi>by faith,</hi> no doubt in this promiſe—And Eve, when Cain was born, ſaid, <hi>I have gotten a man from the</hi> LORD, or (as Mr. Henry obſerves) it may be rendered, <hi>I have gotten a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſiah.—Some further ſuppoſe, that Eve was the firſt believer, and therefore they tranſlate it thus; the <hi>ſeed,</hi> not of THEE, but of THIS <hi>woman,</hi> which magnifies the grace of God ſo much the more, that ſhe, who was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, ſhould be the firſt partaker of redemption—Adam be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved alſo, and was ſaved—For, unto Adam and his wife, did the Lord God make coats of ſkins, and cloathed THEM, which was a remarkable type of their being cloathed with the righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This promiſe was literally fulfilled in the perſon of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt—Satan bruiſed his heel, when he tempted him for forty days together in the wilderneſs—He bruiſed his heel, when he raiſed up ſtrong perſecution againſt him, during the time of his public miniſtry—He, in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, bruiſed his heel, when our Lord complained that his <hi>ſoul was exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029886_0052_0FE2BED2D8749EC0"/>
even unto death, and he ſweat great drops of blood falling upon the ground,</hi> when praying in the garden. He bruiſed his heel, when he put it into the heart of Judas to betray him:—And he bruiſed him yet moſt of all, when his emiſſaries nailed him to an accurſed tree, and our Lord cried out, <hi>My God, my God! Why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>—Yet, in all this, the bleſſed Jeſus, the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, bruiſed his accurſed head—For, in that he was tempted, he was able to <hi>ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</hi> By <hi>his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> The chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of our peace was upon him. By dying, he deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.—He thereby ſpoiled principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers, and made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them upon the croſs.—</p>
            <p>This promiſe has been, is, and will be fulfilled in the elect of God conſidered collectively, as well before as after the coming of our Lord in the fleſh—For they may be called <hi>the ſeed of the woman.</hi> Marvel not, that <hi>all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi>—In this promiſe there is an eternal enmity put between the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the ſerpent. So that thoſe that are born after the fleſh, cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute thoſe that are born after the Spirit. This enmity ſhewed itſelf ſoon after this promiſe was revealed, in Cain's bruiſing the heel of Abel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It continued in the church through all the ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt came in the fleſh, as the hiſtory of the Bible, and the 11th chapter of the Hebrews plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew—It raged exceedingly after our Lord's aſcenſion, witneſs the acts of the apoſtles, and the hiſtory of the primitive Chriſtians.—It now rages, and will continue to rage, and ſhew itſelf, in a greater or leſs degree, to the end of time. But let
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:029886_0053_0FE2BF7AA63DA858"/>
not this diſmay us! For, in all this, the ſeed of the woman is more than conqueror, and bruiſes the ſerpent's head—Thus the Iſraelites, the more they were oppreſſed, the more they encreaſed.—Thus it was with the apoſtles—Thus it was with their immediate followers. So that Tertullian compares the church in his time to a mowed field, the more frequently it is cut, the more it grows. The blood of the martyrs was always the ſeed of the church. And I have often ſat down with wonder and delight, and admire how God has made the very ſchemes, which his enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived in order to hinder, the moſt effectual means to propagate his goſpel—The devil has had ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſucceſs in perſecution, that if I did not know, that he and his children, according to this verſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not but perſecute, I ſhould think he would count it his ſtrength to ſit ſtill. What did he get by perſecuting the martyrs in queen Mary's time? Was not the grace of God exceedingly glorified in their ſupport? What did he get by perſecuting the good old Puritans? Did it not prove the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, of New England?—Or to come nearer to our own times, What hath he got by putting us out of the ſynagogues? Hath not the word of God, ſince that, mightily prevailed? My dear hearers, you muſt excuſe me for enlarging on this head. God fills my ſoul generally, when I come to this topic. I can ſay with Luther, "If it were not for perſecution, I ſhould not underſtand the ſcripture." If Satan ſhould be yet ſuffered to bruiſe my heel further, and his ſervants ſhould thruſt me into priſon, I doubt not, but even that would only tend to the more effectual bruiſing of his head. I remember a ſaying of the then lord Chancellor to the pious Bradford: "Thou haſt
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029886_0054_0FE2BEDD97339728"/>
done more hurt, ſaid he, by thy exhortations in private in priſon, than thou didſt in preaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou waſt put in," or words to this effect. The promiſe of the text is my dally ſupport.—<hi>I will put enmity between thy ſeed and her ſeed: it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Further: This promiſe is alſo fulfilled, not only in the church in general, but in every individual believer in particular—In every believer there are two ſeeds, the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the ſerpent—The fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh—It is with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, when quickened with grace in his heart, as it was with Rebeccah, when ſhe had conceived Eſau and Jacob in her womb! She felt a ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, and began to be uneaſy—<hi>If it be ſo,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>why am I thus?</hi>—Thus grace and nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> (if I may ſo ſpeak) in the womb of a believer's heart—But, as it was there ſaid, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger; ſo it is here—grace in the end ſhall get the better of nature—The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent's head. Many of you, perhaps, that have believed in Chriſt, may find ſome particular corruption yet ſtrong, ſo ſtrong, that you are ſometimes ready to cry out with David, <hi>I ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WHEN our Lord Jeſus was pleaſed to take upon himſelf the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and go about preaching the kingdom of God, he took all opportunities in public, and more eſpecially in private, to caution his diſciples againſt ſeeking great things for themſelves; and alſo to forwarn them of the many diſtreſſes, afflictions, and perſecutions which they muſt expect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and go through for his name's ſake. The great St. Paul, therefore, the author of this epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in this, as in all other things, following the ſteps of his bleſſed Maſter, takes particular care, among other apoſtolical admonitions, to warn young Timothy of the difficulties he muſt expect to meet with in the courſe of his miniſtry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "This know alſo," (ſays he, verſe firſt of this chapter) "that in the laſt days perilous times ſhall come.

And then, to encourage Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>othy yet the more, he propounds to him his own example: "But thou haſt fully known my doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, manner of life, purpoſe, faith, long-ſuffering, charity, patience, perſecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lyſtra; what perſecutions I endured; But out of them all the Lord delivered me."

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We ſhall apply the whole.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> Let us conſider what it is to live god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt Jeſus: this ſuppoſes, that we are made the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt, that we are born again, and are made one with Chriſt by a living faith, and a vital union even as Jeſus Chriſt and the Father are one. Unleſs we are thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and transformed by the renewing of our minds, we cannot properly be ſaid to be in Chriſt, much leſs to live godly in him. To be in Chriſt merely by baptiſm, and an outward profeſſion; is not to be in him in the ſtrict ſenſe of the word: No; they that are in Chriſt Jeſus, are new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; old things are paſſed away, and all things are become new in their hearts. Their life is hid with Chriſt in God; their ſouls daily feed on the inviſible realities of another world. To live godly in Chriſt, is to make the divine will, and not our own, the ſole principle of all our thoughts, words and actions; ſo that, whether we eat or drink, or whatſoever we do, we do all to the glory of God. Thoſe who live godly in Chriſt, may not ſo much be ſaid to live, as Chriſt to live in them: he is their alpha and omega, their firſt and laſt, their beginning and end. They are led by his Spirit, as a child is led by the hand of its Father; and are willing to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he leads them. They hear, know, and obey his voice.—Their affections are ſet on things above. Their
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029886_0060_0FE2BF939F5A94B0"/>
hopes are full of immortality; their citizenſhip is in heaven. Being born again of God, they habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually live to, and daily walk with God. They are pure in heart; and, from a principle of faith in Chriſt, are holy in all manner of converſation and godlineſs.</p>
            <p>This is to live godly in Chriſt Jeſus: and hence we may eaſily learn, why ſo few ſuffer perſecution? becauſe ſo few live godly in Chriſt Jeſus. You may attend on outward duties; you may live morally in Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> you may do (as they term it) no one any harm, and avoid perſecution: but they that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is the meaning of the word <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> and how many kinds there are of it, I come now to conſider.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>perſecution</hi> is derived from a Greek word ſignifying to <hi>purſue,</hi> and generally implies, "purſuing a perſon for the ſake of his goodneſs, or God's good will to him." The firſt kind of it, is that of the heart. We have an early exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this in that wicked one Cain, who, becauſe the Lord had reſpect to Abel and his offering, and not to him and his offering, was very wroth, his countenance fell, and at length he cruelly ſlew his envied brother. Thus the Phariſees hated and perſecuted our Lord long before they laid hold on him: and our Lord mentions being inwardly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of men, as one kind of perſecution his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were to undergo. This heart-enmity (if I may ſo term it) is the root of all other kinds of perſecution, and is in ſome degree or other, to be found in the ſoul of every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unregenerated man; and numbers are guilty of this perſecution, who never have it in their power to perſecute any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:029886_0061_0FE2C02C574AD078"/>
way. Nay, numbers would be carried out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to put in practice all other degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, was not the name of perſecution become odious among mankind, and did they not hereby run the hazard of loſing their reputation. Alas! how many at the great day, whom we know not now, will be convicted and condemned, that all their life harboured a ſecret evil will againſt Zion! They may now ſcreen it before men; but God ſeeth the enmity of their hearts, and will judge them as perſecutors at the great and terrible day of judgment!</p>
            <p>A ſecond degree of perſecution is that of the tongue; out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh. Many I ſuppoſe think it no harm to ſhoot out arrows, even bitter words, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the diſciples of the Lord: they ſcatter the fire-brands, arrows, and death, ſaying, "Are we not in ſport?" But, however they may eſteem it, in God's account evil-ſpeaking is a high degree of perſecution. Thus Iſhmael's mocking Iſaac in the Old, is termed perſecuting him in the New Teſtament. Bleſſed are ye, ſays our Lord, when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſely for my name's ſake. From whence we may gather, that reviling and ſpeaking all manner of evil falſely for Chriſt's ſake, is a high degree of perſecution. For a good name, ſays the wiſe man, is better than precious ointment, and to many is dearer than life itſelf. It is a great breach of the ſixth command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſlander any one; but to ſpeak evil of and ſlander the diſciples of Chriſt, merely becauſe they are his diſciples, muſt be highly provoking in the ſight of God; and ſuch who are guilty of it (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029886_0062_0FE2BF9B4A7BC6E0"/>
repentance) will find that Jeſus Chriſt will call them to an account, and puniſh them for all their ungodly and hard ſpeeches in a lake of fire and brimſtone. This ſhall be their portion to drink.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt kind of perſecution, is that which expreſſes itſelf in actions; as when wicked men ſeparate the children of God from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; <hi>bleſſed are ye,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>when they ſhall ſeparate you from their company:</hi> or expoſe them to church-cenſures. <hi>They ſhall put you out of their ſynagogues;</hi> threatening and prohibiting them from making an open profeſſion of his religion or worſhip; or interdicting miniſters for preaching his word, as the high prieſts threatened the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and forbad them <hi>any more to ſpeak in the name of Jeſus;</hi> and <hi>Paul breathed out threatenings and ſlaughter againſt the diſciples of the Lord:</hi> Or when they call them into courts; <hi>you ſhall be called before governors,</hi> ſays our Lord: Or when they fine, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon, or puniſh them, by confiſcation of goods, cruel ſcourging, and, laſtly, death itſelf.</p>
            <p>It would be impoſſible to enumerate in what various ſhapes perſecution as appeared. It is a many-headed monſter, inſatiable as hell, cruel as the grave; and, what is worſe, it generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears under the cloak of religion. But cruel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable, and horrid as it is, they that live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt expect to ſuffer and encounter with it in all its forms.</p>
            <p>This is what we are to make good under our next general head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why is it that godly men muſt expect to ſuffer perſecution? And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This appears from the whole ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur of our Lord's doctrine. We will begin with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029886_0063_0FE2C031D8018200"/>
ſermon on the Mount. <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are they who are perſecuted for righteouſneſs' ſake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</hi> So that, if our Lord ſpoke truth, we are not ſo bleſſed as to have an intereſt in the kingdom of heaven, unleſs we are or have been <hi>perſecuted for righteouſneſs' ſake.</hi> Nay, our Lord (it is remarkable) employs three verſes in this beatitude, and only one in each of the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; not only to ſhew that it was a thing which men (as men) are unwilling to believe, but alſo the neceſſary conſequence of it upon our being Chriſtians. This is likewiſe evident from all thoſe paſſages, wherein our Lord informs us, that he came upon the earth, not to ſend peace but a ſword; and that the father-in-law ſhall be againſt the mother-in-law, and that a man's foes ſhall be thoſe of his houſehold. Paſſages, which, though confined by falſe prophets to the firſt, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded will be verified by the experience of all true Chriſtians in this, and every age of the church. It would be endleſs to recount all the places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Lord forewarns his diſciples that they ſhould be called before rulers, and thruſt out of ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, nay, that the time would come, wherein men ſhould think they did God ſervice to kill them. For this reaſon he ſo frequently declared, that unleſs a man <hi>forſake all that he had, and even hated life itſelf, he could not be his diſciple.</hi> And therefore it is worthy our obſervation, that in that remarkable paſſage, wherein our Lord makes ſuch an extenſive promiſe to thoſe who <hi>left all for him,</hi> he cautiouſly inſerts perſecution. <hi>And Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>As this is proved from our Lord's doctrine, ſo it is no leſs evident from his life. Follow him from the manger to the croſs, and ſee whether any perſecution was like that which the Son of God the Lord of glory, underwent whilſt here on earth. How was he hated by wicked men? How often would that hatred have excited them to take hold of him, had it not been for fear of the people? How was he reviled, counted and called a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a wine bibber, a Samaritan, nay, a devil, and, in one word, had all manner of evil ſpoken againſt him falſely? What contradiction of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did he endure againſt himſelf? How did men ſeparate from his company, and were aſhamed to walk with him openly? Inſomuch that he once ſaid to his own diſciples, <hi>Will you alſo go away?</hi> Again, how was he ſtoned, thruſt out of the ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agogues, arraigned as a deceiver of the people, a ſeditious and peſtilent fellow, an enemy to Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ar, and as ſuch ſcourged, blindfolded, ſpit upon, and at length condemned, and nailed to an accurſed tree? Thus was the Maſter perſecuted; thus did the Lord ſuffer; and the ſervant is not above his maſter, nor the diſciple above his Lord: <hi>If they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, i. e.</hi> ſuffer as he did. For all theſe things our
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029886_0065_0FE2C0372B088678"/>
Lord has ſet us an example, that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps: and therefore, God forbid that any who would live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould henceforward expect to eſcape ſuffering perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But farther: Not only our Lord's example, but the example of all the ſaints that ever lived, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrates the truth of the apoſtle's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in the text. How ſoon was Abel made a martyr for his religion? How was Iſaac mocked by the ſon of the bond-woman! And what a large catalogue of ſuffering Old Teſtament ſaints, have we recorded in the eleventh chapter of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews! Read the Acts of the apoſtles, and ſee how the Chriſtians were threatened, ſtoned, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, ſcourged, and perſecuted even unto death. Examine church-hiſtory in after-ages, and you will find the murder of the innocents by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, was but an earneſt of the innocent blood which ſhould be ſhed for the name of Jeſus. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the experience of ſaints now living on earth; and if it were poſſible to conſult the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, I am perſuaded each would concur with the apoſtle in aſſerting, that <hi>all who will live godly-in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can it be otherwiſe in the very nature of things? Ever ſince the fall, there has been an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable enmity between the feed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the ſeed of the ſerpent. Wicked men hate God, and therefore, cannot but hate thoſe who are like him: they hate to be reformed, and therefore muſt hate and perſecute thoſe who, by a contrary behaviour, teſtify of them, that their deeds are evil. Beſides, pride of heart leads men to perſecute the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. If they commend them, they are afraid of being aſked,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029886_0066_0FE2BFA7971341D0"/>
"Why do you not follow them?" And therefore becauſe they dare not imitate, though they may ſometimes be even forced to approve their way, yet pride and envy make them turn perſecutors. Hence it is, that as it was formerly, ſo it is now, and ſo will it be to the end of time; he that is born after the fleſh, the natural man, does and will perſecute him that is born after the Spirit, the regenerate man. Becauſe Chriſtians are not of the world, but Chriſt hath choſen them out of the world, therefore the world will hate them. If it be objected againſt this doctrine, "that we now live in a Chriſtian world, and therefore muſt not expect ſuch perſecution as formerly;" I anſwer, "All are not Chriſtians that are called ſo; and, till the heart is changed, the enmity againſt God (which is the root of all perſecution) remains," and conſequently Chriſtians, falſely ſo called, will perſecute as well as others. I obſerved therefore, in the beginning of this diſcourſe, that Paul men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thoſe that had a form of religion, as perſons of whom Timothy had need be chiefly aware: for, as our Lord and his apoſtles were moſtly perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their countrymen the Jews, ſo we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the like uſage from the formaliſts of our own nation, the Phariſees, who ſeem to be religious. For the moſt horrid and barbarous perſecutions have been carried on by thoſe who have called themſelves Chriſtians; witneſs the days of queen Mary; and the fines, baniſhments, and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the children of God in the laſt century, and the bitter irreconcileable hatred that appears in thouſands who call themſelves Chriſtians, even in the preſent days wherein we live.</p>
            <p>Perſons who argue againſt perſecution now, are not ſufficiently ſenſible of the bitter enmity of the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029886_0067_0FE2C03DD9686CD0"/>
heart of every unregenerate man againſt God. For my own part, I am ſo far from wondering that Chriſtians are perſecuted, that I wonder our ſtreets do not run with the blood of the ſaints: was men's power equal to their wills, ſuch a horrid ſpectacle would ſoon appear. But,</p>
            <p>Perſecution is neceſſary in reſpect to the godly themſelves. If we have not all manner of evil ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of us, how can we know whether we love contempt, and ſeek only that honour which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from above? If we have not perſecutors, how can our paſſive graces be kept in exerciſe? How can many Chriſtian precepts be put into practice? How can we love, pray for, and do good to thoſe who deſpitefully uſe us? How can we overcome evil with good? In ſhort, how can we know we love God better than life itſelf? St. Paul was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of all this, and therefore ſo poſitively and peremptorily aſſerts, that all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</p>
            <p>Not that I affirm, "All are perſecuted in a like "degree." No: This would be contrary both to ſcripture and experience. But though all Chriſtians are not really called to ſuffer every kind of perſecution, yet all Chriſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Chriſtians or not. Were you ever perſecuted for righteouſneſs' ſake? If not, you never yet lived godly in Chriſt our Lord. Whatever you may ſay to the contrary, the inſpired apoſtle, in the words of the text (the truth of which, I think, I have ſufficiently proved) poſitively aſſerts, that "all that will live godly in him, ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution." Not that all who are perſecuted are real Chriſtians; for many ſometimes ſuffer, and are perſecuted on other accounts than for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake. The great queſtion therefore is, "Whether you are ever perſecuted for living god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?" You may boaſt (as perhaps you may think) of your great prudence and ſagacity, (and indeed theſe are excellent things) and glory becauſe you have not run ſuch lengths and made yourſelves ſo ſingular, and liable to ſuch contempt, as ſome others have. But, alas! this is not a mark of your being a Chriſtian, but of a Laodicean ſpirit, neither hot nor cold, and ſit only to be ſpewed out of the mouth of God. That which you call prudence, is often only cowardice, dreadful hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, pride of heart, which makes you dread con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and afraid to give up your reputation for God. You are aſhamed of Chriſt and his goſpel, and in all probability, was he to appear a ſecond time upon earth, in words as well as works, you would deny him. Awake therefore, all ye that live only formally in Chriſt Jeſus, and no longer ſeek that honour which cometh of man.—I do not deſire to court you, but I entreat you to live godly, and fear not contempt for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt. Beg of God to give you his Holy Spirit, that you may ſee through, and diſcover the latent hypocriſy of your hearts, and no longer deceive your own ſouls. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you cannot reconcile two irreconcileable
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:029886_0069_0FE2C0429D9C4E98"/>
differences, God and Mammon, the friendſhip of this world, with the favour of God. Know you not who hath told you, that the "friendſhip of this world is enmity with God?" If therefore you are in friendſhip with the world, notwithſtanding all your ſpecious pretences to piety, you are at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God: you are only heart-hypocrites, and, "What is the hope of the hypocrite, when God ſhall take away his ſoul?" Let the words of the text ſound an alarm in your ears—Oh let them ſink deep into your hearts; "yea, and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the words of the text, I would take occaſion to ſpeak to thoſe "who are about to liſt themſelves under the banner of Chriſt's croſs." What ſay you? Are you reſolved to live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, notwithſtanding the conſequence will be, that you muſt ſuffer perſecution? You are beginning to build, but have you taken our Lord's advice, to ſit down firſt and count the coſt? Have you well weighed with yourſelves that weighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, "he that loveth father or mother more than ME, is not worthy of ME;" and again, "Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a man forſake all that he hath, he cannot be my diſciple?" Perhaps ſome of you have great poſſeſſions; will not you go away ſorrowful, if Chriſt ſhould require you to ſell all that you have! Others of you again, may be kinſmen, or ſome way related, or under obligations to the high prieſts, or other great perſonages, who may be perſecuting the church of Chriſt: what ſay you? Will you, with Moſes, rather chooſe to "ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon?" Perhaps you may ſay, "My friends will not oppoſe me." That is
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029886_0070_0FE2BFB4024CBAD8"/>
more than you know: in all probability your chief enemies will be thoſe of your own houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. If therefore they ſhould oppoſe you, are you willing naked to follow a naked Chriſt? and to wander about in ſheep-ſkins, and goat-ſkins, in dens and caves of the earth, being afflicted, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, tormented, rather than not be Chriſt's diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? You are now all following with zeal, as Ruth and Orpah did Naomi, and may weep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the word; but are not your tears crocodile's tears? And when difficulties come, will you not go back from following your Lord, as Orpah de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from following Naomi; Have you really the root of grace in your hearts? Or, are you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtony-ground hearers? You receive the word with joy; but, when perſecution ariſes becauſe of of the word, will you not be immediately offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Be not angry with me for putting theſe queſtions to you. I am jealous over you, but it is with a godly jealouſy; For, alas! how many have put their hands to the plough, and afterwards have ſhamefully looked back? I only deal with you, as our Lord did with the perſon that ſaid, "Lord I will follow thee whitherſoever thou wilt. The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of man, ſays he, hath not where to lay his head." What ſay you? Are you willing to endure hardneſs, and thereby approve yourſelves good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt! You now come on foot out of the towns and villages to hear the word, and receive me as a meſſenger of God: But will you not by and by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

met with many unhappy ſouls, who have drawn back unto perdition, and have afterwards account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me their enemy, for dealing faithfully with them; though once, if it were poſſible, they would have plucked out their own eyes, and have given them unto me. Sit down therefore, I beſeech you, and ſeriouſly count the coſt, and aſk your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again and again, whether you count all things but dung and droſs, and are willing to ſuffer the loſs of all things, ſo that you may win Chriſt, and be found in him: for you may aſſure yourſelves, the apoſtle hath not ſpoken in vain, "All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The text ſpeaks to you that are pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſuffering for the truth's ſake: "Rejoice and be exceeding glad; great ſhall be your reward in heaven." For to you it is given not only to believe, but alſo to ſuffer, and perhaps remarkably too, for the ſake of Jeſus! This is a mark of your diſciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, an evidence that you do live godly in Chriſt Jeſus. Fear not therefore, neither be diſmayed. Oh, be not weary and ſaint in your minds! Jeſus, your Lord, your life, cometh and his reward is with him. Though all men forſake you, yet will not he: No; the Spirit of Chriſt and of glory ſhall reſt upon you. In patience therefore, poſſeſs your ſouls. Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Be in nothing terrified by your adverſaries: on their part Chriſt is evil ſpoken of; on your part he is glorified. Be not aſhamed of your glory, ſince others can glory in their ſhame. Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery tria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, wherewith you are or may be tried. The devil rages, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he hath but a ſhort time to reign. He or his emiſſaries have no more power than what is
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029886_0072_0FE2BFB8A0062E60"/>
given them from above; God ſets them their bounds, which they cannot paſs; and the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; no one ſhall ſet upon you to hurt you, without your heavenly Father's knowledge. Do your earthly friends and parents forſake you? Are you caſt out of the ſynagogues? The Lord ſhall reveal himſelf to you, as to the man that was born blind. Jeſus Chriſt ſhall take you up. If they carry you to priſon, and load you with chains, ſo that the iron enter into your ſouls, even there ſhall Chriſt ſend an angel from heaven to ſtrengthen you, and enable you with Paul and Silas, to ſing praiſes at midnight. Are you threatened to be thrown into a den of lions, or caſt into a burning fiery furnace, becauſe you will not bow down and worſhip the beaſt? Fear not; the God whom you ſerve, is able to deliver you: Or, if he ſhould ſuffer the flames to devour your bodies, they would only ſerve as ſo many fiery chariots, to carry your ſouls to God. Thus it was with the martyrs of old; ſo that one, when he was burning, cried out, "Come, you Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, if you want a miracle, here, behold one! This bed of flames is to me a bed of down." Thus it was with almoſt all that ſuffered in former times; For Jeſus, notwithſtanding he withdrew his own divinity from himſelf, yet has always lifted up the light of his countenance upon the ſouls of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaints. "Fear not therefore thoſe that can kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do: but fear him only, who is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell." <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Out of all the Lord delivered him—Out of all the Lord will deliver us, and cauſe us hereafter to ſit down with him on thrones, when he comes to judge the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>I could proceed, but I am conſcious in this part of my diſcourſe, I ought more particularly to ſpeak to myſelf, knowing that Satan has deſired to have me, that he may <hi>ſift me as wheat.</hi> I know I muſt (How can it be avoided?) ſuffer great things for Chriſt's Name ſake—Without a ſpirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we may eaſily diſcern the ſigns of the times.

            <p>If you have a mind therefore to fill up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your iniquities, go on, perſecute and deſpiſe the diſciples of the Lord: but know, that, for all theſe things, God ſhall bring you into judgment.

A ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient confutation, I think, of their error, who lightly eſteem the Old Teſtament ſaints, and would not have them mentioned to Chriſtians, as perſons whoſe faith and patience we are called upon more immediately to follow. If this was true, the apoſtle would never have produced ſuch a cloud
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029886_0077_0FE2BFC55B74F9F8"/>
of witneſſes out of the Old Teſtament, to excite the Chriſtians of the firſt, and conſequently pureſt age of the church, to continue ſteadfaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in the profeſſion of their faith. Amidſt this catalogue of ſaints, methinks, the patriarch Abraham ſhines the brighteſt, and differs from the others, as one ſtar differeth from another ſtar in glory; for he ſhone with ſuch diſtinguiſhed luſtre, that he was called the <hi>friend of God,</hi> the <hi>father of the faithful;</hi> and thoſe who believe on Chriſt, are ſaid to be ſons and daughters of, and to be bleſſed with, faithful Abraham. Many trials of his faith did God ſend this great and good man, after he had commanded him to get out from his country, and from his kindred, unto a land which he ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>God did tempt Abraham</hi>—But can the ſcripture contradict itſelf? Does not St. James tell us, <hi>That God tempts no man?</hi> And God does tempt no man to evil, or on purpoſe to draw him into ſin. For when a man is thus tempted, he is drawn away of his own heart's luſt, and enticed—But in another ſenſe God may be ſaid to tempt—I mean to try his ſervants, and in this ſenſe we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that paſſage of St. Matthew, where we are told, that <hi>Jeſus was led by the Spirit</hi> (the good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) <hi>into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the devil</hi>—And our Lord, in that excellent form of prayer which he has been pleaſed to preſcribe us, does not require us to pray, that we may not abſolutely be led into temptation, but delivered from the evil of it—Whereby we may plainly infer, that God ſees it fit ſometimes to lead us into temptation, that is, to bring us into ſuch circumſtances as will try our ſaith, and other Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>How God was pleaſed to reveal his will at this time to his faithful ſervant, whether by the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah, or Divine appearance, or by a ſmall ſtill voice, as he ſpoke to Elijah, or by a whiſper, like that of the Spirit to Philip, when he commanded him to join himſelf to the Eunuch's chariot, we are not told, nor is it material to inquire.

Being reconciled to God by the death and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt, which he rejoiced in, and ſaw by faith afar off; he did not, like guilty Adam, ſeek the trees of the garden to hide himſelf from, but takes pleaſure in converſing with God, and talketh with him, as a man talketh with his friend. O that CHRIST-leſs ſinners knew what it is to have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son! They would envy the happineſs of ſaints, and count it all joy to be termed enthuſiaſts and fools for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
            <p>But what does God ſay unto Abraham; Ver. 2. "Take now thy ſon, thine only ſon Iſaac, whom thou loveſt, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I ſhall tell thee of."</p>
            <p>Every word deſerves our particular obſervation. Whatever he was to do, he muſt do it now, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, without conferring with fleſh and blood. But what muſt he do? <hi>Take now thy ſon.</hi> Had God ſaid, take now a firſtling, or choiceſt lamb or beaſt of thy flock, and offer it up for a burnt-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, it would not have appeared ſo ghaſtly; but for God to ſay, "Take now thy ſon, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him up for a burnt-offering," one would have imagined, was enough to ſtagger the ſtrongeſt faith. But this is not all: It muſt not only be a ſon, but <hi>thine only ſon Iſaac, whom thou loveſt.</hi> If it muſt be a ſon, and not a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſt, that muſt be offered, why will not Iſhmael do, the ſon of the bond-woman? No, it muſt be his <hi>only ſon,</hi> the heir of all, his Iſaac, by interpretation <hi>laughter,</hi> the ſon of his old age, in whom his ſoul delighed;
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029886_0080_0FE2C0672E33D9B0"/>
               <hi>whom thou loveſt,</hi> ſays God, in whoſe life his own was wrapped up: And this ſon, this only ſon, this Iſaac, the ſon of his love, muſt be taken now, even now without delay, and be offered up by his own father, for a burnt offering, upon one of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the which God would tell him.</p>
            <p>Well might the apoſtle, ſpeaking of this man of God, ſay, that <hi>againſt hope he believed in hope, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd, being ſtrong in faith, gave glory to God:</hi> For, had he not been bleſſed with faith which man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before had, he muſt have refuſed to comply with this ſevere command. For how many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might nature ſuggeſt, to prove that ſuch a command could never come from God, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf from obeying it? "What! (might the good man have ſaid) butcher my child! it is contrary to the very law of nature: Much more to butcher my dear ſon Iſaac, in whoſe ſeed God himſelf has aſſured me, that all the families of the earth ſhall be bleſſed. But ſuppoſing I could give up my own affections, and be willing to part with him, though I love him ſo dearly, yet, if I murder him, what will become of God's promiſe? Beſides I am now like a city built upon a hill; I ſhine as a light in the world, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation: How then ſhall I cauſe God's name to be blaſphemed, how ſhall I become a by-word among the heathen, if they hear that I have committed a crime which they abhor! But, above all, what will Sarah my wife ſay? How can I ever return to her again, after I have imbrued my hands in my dear child's blood? O that God would pardon me in this thing, or take my life in the place of my ſon's!" Thus, I ſay, Abraham might have argued, and that too ſeemingly with great reaſon, againſt complying with the divine
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029886_0081_0FE2BFD273BDFCA8"/>
command. But, as before by faith he conſidered not the deadneſs of Sarah's womb, when ſhe was paſt age, but believed on him, who ſaid, "Sarah thy wife ſhall bear thee a ſon indeed;" ſo now being convinced that the ſame God ſpoke to, and commanded him to offer up that ſon, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God was able to raiſe him from the dead, without delay he obeys the heavenly call.</p>
            <p>O that unbelievers would learn of faithful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and believe whatever is revealed from God, though they cannot fully comprehend it! Abraham knew God commanded him to offer up his ſon, and therefore believed, notwithſtanding carnal reaſoning might ſuggeſt many objections. We have ſufficient teſtimony, that God has ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us by his Son; why ſhould we not alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though many things in the New Teſtament are above our reaſon? For, where reaſon ends, faith begins. And, however infidels may ſtyle themſelves reaſoners, of all men they are the moſt unreaſonable: For is it not contrary to all reaſon, to meaſure an infinite by a finite underſtanding, or think to find out the myſteries of godlineſs to perfection?</p>
            <p>But to return to the patriarch Abraham: We obſerved before what plauſible objections he might have made; but he anſwered not a ſingle word: No, without replying againſt his Maker, we are told, ver. 3. that "Abraham roſe up early in the morning, and ſaddled his aſs, and took two of his young men with him, and Iſaac his ſon, and clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and roſe up and went unto the place of which God had told him."</p>
            <p>From this verſe we may gather, that God ſpoke to Abraham in a dream, or viſion of the night: For it is ſaid, he <hi>roſe up early.</hi> Perhaps it was
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029886_0082_0FE2C06FF262D1A8"/>
near the fourth watch of the night, juſt before break of day, when God ſaid, <hi>Take now thy ſon;</hi> and Abraham riſes up early to do ſo; as I doubt not but he uſed to riſe early to offer up his morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving. It is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en remarked of people in the Old Teſtament, that they roſe early in the morning; and particularly of our Lord in the New, that he roſe a great while before day to pray. The morning befriends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; and if people cannot uſe ſo much ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial as to riſe early to pray, I know not how they will be able to die at a ſtake (if called to it) for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The humility, as well as piety of the patriarch, is obſervable: He ſaddled his own aſs (great men ſhould be humble;) and to ſhew his ſincerity, though he took two of his young men with him, and Iſaac his ſon, yet he keeps his deſign as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from them all: Nay, he does not ſo much as tell Sarah his wife: For he knew not but ſhe might be a ſnare unto him in this affair; and, as R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ekah afterwards, on another occaſion, adviſed Jacob to flee, ſo Sarah alſo might perſuade Iſaac to hide himſelf; or the young men, had they known of it, might have forced him away, as in after-ages the ſoldiers reſcued Jonathan out of the hands of Soul. But Abraham ſought no ſuch eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and therefore, like an Iſraelite indeed, in whom there was no guile, he himſelf reſolutely "clave the wood for the burnt-offering, roſe up and went unto the place of which God had told him." In the ſecond verſe, God commanded him to offer up his ſon upon one of the mountains which he would tell him of. He commanded him to offer his ſon up, but would not then directly tell him the place where: This was to keep him
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029886_0083_0FE2BFDB81FB04E0"/>
dependent and watching unto prayer: For there's nothing like being kept waiting upon God; and, if we do, aſſuredly God will reveal himſelf unto us yet further in his own time. Let us practiſe what we know, follow providence ſo far as we can ſee already; and what we know not, what we ſee not as yet, let us only be found in the way of duty, and the Lord will reveal even that unto us. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham knew not directly where he was to offer up his ſon; but he riſes up and ſets forward, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now God ſhews him; and he went to the place of which God had told him. Let us go and do likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Ver. 4. Then on the third day, Abraham lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> up his eyes, and ſaw the place afar off.</p>
            <p>So that the place, of which God had told him, was no leſs than three days journey diſtant from the place where God firſt appeared to him, and commanded him to take his ſon. Was not this to try his faith, and to let him ſee that what he did, was not merely from a ſudden pang of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a matter of choice and deliberation? But who can tell what the aged patriarch felt during theſe three days? Strong as he was in faith, I am perſuaded his bowels often yearned over his dear ſon Iſaac. Methinks I ſee the good old man walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his dear child in his hand, and now and then looking upon him, loving him, and then turning aſide to weep. And perhaps, ſometimes he ſtays a little behind to pour out his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; for he had no mortal to tell his caſe to. Then, methinks, I ſee him join his ſon and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants again, and talking to them of the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the kingdom of God, as they walked by the way. At length, on the third day, he lift up his eyes and ſaw the place afar off. And, to
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029886_0084_0FE2C07512C9CC98"/>
ſhew that he was yet ſincerely reſolved to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover the Lord required of him, he even now will not diſcover his deſign to his ſervants, but ſaid, ver. 5. to his young men (as we ſhould ſay to our worldly thoughts when about to tread the courts of the Lord's houſe) "abide you here with the aſs; and I and the lad will go up yonder and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and come again to you." This was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon for their ſtaying behind; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it being their maſter's cuſtom to go frequently to worſhip, they could have no ſuſpicion of what he was going about. And by Abraham's ſaying, that he and the lad would come again, I am apt to think he believed God would raiſe him from the dead, if ſo be he permitted him to offer his child up for a burnt-offering. However that be, he is yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to obey God to the uttermoſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Ver. 6. "Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Iſaac his ſon; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and they went both of them together." Little did Iſaac think that he was to be offered on that very wood which he was carrying upon his ſhoulders; and therefore, ver. 7. Iſaac innocently, and with a holy freedom (for good men ſhould not keep their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at too great a diſtance) ſpake unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham his father, and ſaid, My father; and he (with equal affection and holy condeſcenſion) ſaid, Here am I, my ſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And to ſhew how careful Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham had been (as all Chriſtian parents ought to be) to inſtruct his Iſaac how to ſacrifice to God, like a youth trained up in the way wherein he ſhould go; Iſaac ſaid, Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering? How beautiful is early piety! How amiable, to
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029886_0085_0FE2BFE033E59D30"/>
hear young people aſk queſtions about ſacrificing to God in an acceptable way! Iſaac knew very well that a lamb was wanting, and that a lamb was neceſſary for a proper ſacrifice: Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering? Young men and maidens, learn of him.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, it is plain, Iſaac knew nothing of his father's deſign: But I believe, by what his father ſaid in anſwer to his queſtion, that now was the time Abraham revealed it unto him.</p>
            <p>Verſe 8. "And Abraham ſaid, my ſon, God will provide himſelf a lamb for a burnt-offering." Some think that Abraham by faith ſaw the Lord Jeſus afar off, and here ſpake prophetically of that Lamb of God already ſlain in decree, and hereafter to be actually offered up for ſinners. This was a lamb of God's providing indeed (we dared not have thought of it) to ſatisfy his own juſtice, and to render him juſt in juſtifying the ungodly. What is all our fire and wood, the beſt preparation and performances we can make or preſent unleſs God had provided himſelf this Lamb for a burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? He could not away with them. The words will well bear this interpretation. But, whatever Abraham might intend. I cannot but think he here made an application, and acquainted his ſon of God's dealing with his ſoul; and at length, with tears in his eyes, and the utmoſt affection in his heart, cried out, "Thou art to be the lamb, my ſon; God has commanded me to provide thee for a burnt offering, and to offer thee upon a mountain which we are now aſcending." And, as it appears from a ſubſequent verſe, Iſaac, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it was the divine will, made no reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at all; for it is ſaid, "they went both of them together;" and again, verſe 9, when we are
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029886_0086_0FE2C07DCA634958"/>
told that Abraham bound Iſaac, we do not hear of his complaining or endeavouring to eſcape, which he might have done, being (as ſome think) near thirty years of age, and it is plain, capable enough for carrying wood enough for a burnt-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. But he was partaker of the like precious faith with his aged father, and therefore is as will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be offered, as Abraham is to offer him: and ſo they went both of them together.</p>
            <p>Verſe 6. At length "they came to the place of which God had told Abraham. He built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Iſaac his ſon, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."</p>
            <p>And here let us pauſe awhile, and by faith take a view of the place where the father has laid him. I doubt not but the bleſſed angels hovered round the altar and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ang, Glory be to God in the higheſt, for giving ſuch faith to man. Come, all ye ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted parents, who know what it is to look over a dying child: Fancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you ſaw the altar erected before you, and the wood laid in order, and the beloved Iſaac bound upon it: Fancy that you ſaw the aged parent ſtanding by weeping (for why may we not ſuppoſe that Abraham wept, ſince Jeſus himſelf wept at the grave of Lazarus?) O what pious, endearing expreſſions paſſed now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately between the father and the ſon! Joſephus records a pathetic ſpeech made by each, whether genuine I know not but methinks I ſee the tears trickle down the patriarch Abraham's cheeks; and out of the abundance of the heart, he cries, Adieu, adieu, my ſon; the Lord gave thee to me, and the Lord calls thee away; bleſſed be the name of the Lord: adieu, my Iſaac, my only ſon, whom I love as my own ſoul; adieu, adieu. I ſee Iſaac
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029886_0087_0FE2BFE95C9D4588"/>
at the ſame time meekly reſigning himſelf into his heavenly Father's hands, and praying to the Moſt High to ſtrengthen his earthly parent to ſtrike the ſtroke. But why do I attempt to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe what either ſon or father felt? It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: we may indeed form ſome faint idea of, but ſhall never fully comprehend it, till we come and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it down with them in the kingdom of heaven, and hear them tell the pleaſing ſtory over again—Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, O Lord, that bleſſed time! O let thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come!</p>
            <p>And now, ver. 10. The fatal blow is going to be given. "And Abraham ſtretched forth his hand, and took the knife to ſlay his ſon." But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do you not think he intended to turn away his head, when he gave the blow? Nay, why may we not ſuppoſe he ſometimes drew his hand in, after it was ſtretched out, willing to take another laſt farewel of his beloved Iſaac, and deſirous to defer it a little, though reſolved at laſt to ſtrike home? Be that as it will, his arm is now ſtretched out, the knife is in his hand, and he is about to put it to his dear ſon's throat.</p>
            <p>But ſing, O heavens! and rejoice, O earth! Man's extremity is God's opportunity: for behold, juſt as the knife, in all probability, was near his throat, ver. 11. "the angel of the Lord, (or rather, the Lord of angels, Jeſus Chriſt, the angel of the everlaſting covenant) called unto him (probably in a very audible manner) from heaven, and ſaid, Abraham, Abraham.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (The word is doubled, to engage his attention; and perhaps the ſuddenneſs of the call made him draw back his hand, juſt as he was going to ſtrike his ſon) And Abraham ſaid, Here am I."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:029886_0088_0FE2C082A1FFDF68"/>
And he ſaid, verſe 12. "Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now know I that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not withheld thy ſon, thine only ſon from me."</p>
            <p>Here then it was that Abraham received his ſon Iſaac from the dead in a figure. He was in effect offered upon the altar, and God looked upon him as offered and given unto him. Now it was that Abraham's faith, being tried, was found more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than gold purified ſeven times in the fire. Now as a reward of grace, though not of debt, for this ſignal act of obedience, by an oath, God gives and confirms the promiſe, "that in his ſeed all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed," verſe 17, 18. With what comfort may we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the good old man and his ſon went down from the mount, and returned unto the young men! With what joy we imagine he went home, and related all that had paſſed to Sarah! And above all, with what triumph is he exulting now in the paradiſe of God, and adoring rich, free, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing, electing, everlaſting love, which alone made him to differ from the reſt of mankind, and rendered him worthy of that title which he will have ſo long as the ſun and the moon endure: "The father of the faithful!"</p>
            <p>But let us now draw our eyes from the creature, and do what Abraham, if he was preſent, would direct to; I mean, fix them on the Creator, God bleſſed for evermore.</p>
            <p>I ſee your hearts affected, I ſee your eyes weep, (and indeed, who can refrain weeping at the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a ſtory?) But, behold, I ſhew you a myſtery hid under the ſacrifice of Abraham's only ſon, which, unleſs your hearts are hardened, muſt

I would willingly hope you even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent me here, and are ready to ſay, "it is the love of God, in giving Jeſus Chriſt to die for our ſins. Yes, that is it." And yet perhaps you find your hearts at the mentioning of this, not ſo much affected. Let this convince you, that we are fallen creatures, and that we do not love God or Chriſt as we ought to do: for, if you admire Abraham offering up his Iſaac, how much more ought you to extol, magnify, and adore the love of God, who ſo loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son, Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, "that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life?"

Do you admire Iſaac ſo freely conſenting to die, though a creature, and therefore obliged to go when God called? O do not forget to admire infinitely more the dear Lord Jeſus, that promiſed ſeed, who willingly ſaid, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> you ſaw the altar, and the wood laid in order, and Iſaac laid bound on the altar? Look up by faith, behold the bleſſed Jeſus, our all glorious Immanuel, not bound, but nailed on an accurſed tree: ſee how he hangs, crowned with thorns, and had in deriſion of all that are round about him: ſee how the thorns pierce him, and how the blood in purple ſtreams trickles down his ſacred temples! Hark how the God of nature groans! See how he bows his head, and at length humanity gives up the ghoſt! Iſaac is ſaved, but Jeſus, the God of Iſaac, dies; a ram is offered up in Iſaac's room, but Jeſus has no ſubſtitute; Jeſus muſt bleed, Jeſus muſt die: God the Father provided this Lamb for himſelf from all eternity. He muſt be offered in time, or man muſt be damned for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And now where are all your tears? Shall I ſay, refrain your voice from weeping? No, rather let me exhort you to look to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom you have pierced, and mourn, as a woman mourneth

for her firſt-born: for we have been the betrayers, we have been the murderers of this Lord of glory; and ſhall we not bewail thoſe ſins, which brought the bleſſed Jeſus to the accurſed tree?

            <p>From hence we may learn the nature of true juſtifying faith. Whoever underſtands and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the truth as it is in Jeſus, muſt acknowledge, that ſalvation is God's free gift, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is our righteouſneſs; and if we are accepted with God, it muſt be only in and through the perſonal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the active and paſſive obedience of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his beloved Son. This righteouſneſs muſt be imputed, or counted over to us, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by faith to our hearts, or elſe we can in no wiſe be juſtified in God's ſight: and that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a ſinner is enabled to lay hold on Chriſt's righteouſneſs by faith, he is freely juſtified from all his ſins, and ſhall never enter into condemnation, notwithſtanding he was a fire brand of hell before. Thus it was that Abraham was juſtified before he did any good work: he was enabled to believe on the Lord Chriſt; it was accounted to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

with God: good works have nothing to do with our juſtification in his ſight. We are juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by faith alone, as faith the article of our church; agreeable to which the apoſtle Paul ſays, "By grace ye are ſaved, through faith; and that not of yourſelves; it is the gift of God." Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding good works have their proper place: they juſtify our faith, though not our perſons; they follow it, and evidence our juſtification in the ſight of men. Hence it is that the apoſtle James aſks, was not Abraham juſtified by works (allud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no doubt to the ſtory on which we have been diſcourſing) that is, did he not prove he was in a juſtified ſtate, becauſe his faith was productive of good works? This declarative juſtification in the ſight of men, is what is directly to be underſtood in the words of the text: "Now know I," ſays God, "that thou feareſt me, ſince thou haſt not withheld thy ſon, thine only ſon from me." Not but that God knew it before; but this is ſpoken in condeſcenſion to our weak capacities, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews, that his offering up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Hence then you may learn, whether you are bleſſed with, and are ſons and daughters of faithful Abraham. You ſay you believe; you talk of free grace, and free juſtification: you do well; the devils alſo believe and tremble. But has the faith which you pretend to, influenced your hearts, renewed your ſouls, and, like Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's, worked by love? Are your affections, like his, ſet on things above? Are you heavenly-minded, and, like him, do you confeſs yourſelves ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth? In ſhort, has
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029886_0093_0FE2BFFB68044EF8"/>
your faith enabled you to overcome the world, and ſtrengthened you to give up your Iſaacs, your laughter, your moſt beloved luſts, friends, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and profits for God? If ſo, take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it; for juſtly may you ſay, "We know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, that we do fear and love God, or rather are loved of him." But if you are only talking believers, have only a faith of the head, and never felt the power of it in your hearts, however you may bolſter yourſelves up, and ſay, "we have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham for our father, or Chriſt is our Saviour;" unleſs you get a faith of the heart, a faith working by love, you ſhall never ſit with Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, or Jeſus Chriſt in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
            <p>But I muſt draw one more inference, and with that I ſhall conclude.</p>
            <p>Learn, O ſaints! from what has been ſaid, to ſit looſe to all your worldly comforts; and ſtand ready prepared to part with every thing, when God ſhall require it at your hand. Some of you perhaps may have friends, who are to you as your own ſouls, and others may have children, in whoſe lives your own lives are bound up: all I believe have their Iſaacs, their particular delights of ſome kind or other. Labour, for Chriſt's ſake, labour, ye ſons and daughters of Abraham, to reſign them, daily in affection to God, that, when he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you really to ſacrifice them, you may not confer with fleſh and blood, any more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>IT is an undoubted truth, however it may ſeem a paradox to natural men, that "whoſoever will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." And therefore it is very remarkable, that our bleſſed Lord, in his glorious ſermon on the Mount, after he had been pronouncing thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who were poor in ſpirit, meek, pure in heart, and ſuch like, immediately adds (and ſpends no leſs than three verſes in this beatitude) "Bleſſed are they who are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake." No one ever was, or ever will be endowed with the forementioned graces in any degree, but he will be perſecuted for it in a meaſure. There is an ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And if we are not of the world, but ſhew by our fruits that we are of the number of thoſe whom Jeſus Chriſt has choſen out of the world, for that very reaſon the world will hate us. As this is true of every particular Chriſtian, ſo it is true of every Chriſtian church in general. For ſome years paſt we have heard but little of a public perſecution: why! Becauſe but little of the power of godlineſs has prevailed amongſt all denominations. The ſtrong

man armed has had full poſſeſſion of moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors' hearts, and therefore he has let them reſt in a falſe peace. But we may aſſure ourſelves, when Jeſus Chriſt begins to gather in his elect in any remarkable manner, and opens an effectual door for preaching the everlaſting goſpel, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will flame out, and Satan and his emiſſaries will do their utmoſt (though all in vain) to ſtop the work of God. Thus it was in the firſt ages; thus it is in our days, and thus it will be till time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, and Chriſtian churches muſt then expect enemies. Our chief concern ſhould be, to learn how to behave towards them in a Chriſtian manner: for unleſs we take good heed to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we ſhall embitter our ſpirits, and act unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the followers of the Lord, "who, when he was reviled, reviled not again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, threatened not; and, as a lamb before his ſhearers is dumb; ſo opened he not his mouth." But what motive ſhall w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> make uſe of to bring ourſelves to this bleſſed Lamb-like temper? Next to the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hearts, I know of no conſideration more conducive to teach us long-ſuffering towards our moſt bitter perſecutors; than this, "That, for all that we know to the contrary, ſome of thoſe very perſons, who are now perſecuting, may be choſen from all eternity by God, and hereafter called in time, to edify and build up the church of Chriſt."</p>
            <p>The perſecutor Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mentioned in the words of the text (and whoſe converſion God willing, I propoſe to treat on in the following diſcourſe) is a noble inſtance of this kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:029886_0097_0FE2C00A104D37C0"/>
I ſay, a perſecutor, and that a bloody one: for ſee how he is introduced in the beginning of this chapter; "and Saul yet breathing out threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſlaughter againſt the diſciples of our Lord, went unto the high prieſt, and deſired of him let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Damaſcus to the ſynagogues, that if he found any of THIS WAY, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem."</p>
            <p>"And Saul yet breathing out." This implies that he had been a perſecutor before. To prove which, we need only look back to the ſeventh chapter, where we ſhall find him ſo very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably active at Stephen's death, that the "wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whoſe name was Saul." He ſeems, though young to be in ſome authority. Perhaps, for his zeal againſt the Chriſtians, he was preferred in the church, and was allowed to ſit in the great council or ſanhedrim; for we are told, chap. viii. ver. I. "That Saul was conſenting unto his death;" and again, at ver. 3. he is brought in as exceeding all in his oppoſition; for thus ſpeaks the evangeliſt, "as for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every houſe, and haling men and women, committed them to priſon." One would have imagined, that this ſhould have ſatisfied; at leaſt abated the fury of this young zealot. No: being exceedingly mad againſt them, as he himſelf informs Agrippa, and having made havock of all in Jeruſalem, he now is reſolved to perſecute the diſciples of the Lord, even to ſtrange cities; and therefore yet breathing out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening. "Breathing out." The words are very emphatical, and expreſſive of his bitter enmity. It was a natural to him now to threaten the
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:029886_0098_0FE2C099E6B52248"/>
Chriſtians, as it was for him to breathe: he could ſcarce ſpeak, but it was ſome threatenings againſt them. Nay, he not only breathed out threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but ſlaughters alſo (and thoſe who threaten, would alſo ſlaughter, if it were in their power) againſt the diſciples of the Lord. Inſatiable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as hell, finding he could not refute or ſtop the Chriſtians by force of argument, he is reſolved to do it by force of arms; and therefore went to the high prieſt (for there never was a perſecution yet without a high prieſt at the head of it) and deſired of him letters, iſſued out of his ſpiritual court, to the ſynagogues or eccleſiaſtical courts at Damaſcus, giving him authority, "that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem"—I ſuppoſe to be arraigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the high prieſt's court. Obſerve how he ſpeaks of the Chriſtians. Luke, who wrote the Acts, calls them diſciples of the Lord, and Saul ſtyles them men and women of this way. I doubt not but he repreſented them as a company of upſtart enthuſiaſts, that had lately gotten into a new method or way of living; that would not be content with the temple-ſervice, but they muſt he righteous over-much, and have their private meetings or conventicles; and break bread, as they called it, from houſe to houſe, to the great diſturbance of the eſtabliſhed clergy, and to the utter ſubverſion of all order and decency. I do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear that the high prieſt makes any objection: No, he was as willing to grant letters, as Saul was to aſk them; and wonderfully pleaſed within himſelf, to find he had ſuch an active zealot to employ againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="unknown:029886_0099_0FE2C01128A12B38"/>
Well then, a judicial proceſs is immediately iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out, with the high prieſt's ſeal affixed to it. And now methinks I ſee the young perſecutor finely equipped, and pleaſing himſelf with thoughts how triumphantly he ſhould ride back with the men and women of this way, dragging after him to Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>What a condition may we imagine the poor diſciples at Damaſcus were in at this time! No doubt they had heard of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul's impriſoning and making havock of the ſaints at Jeruſalem, and we may well ſuppoſe were appriſed of his deſign againſt them. I am perſuaded this was a growing, becauſe a trying time with theſe dear people. O how did they wreſtle with God in prayer, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him either to deliver them from, or give them grace ſufficient to enable them to bear up under the fury of their perſecutors? The high prieſt doubtleſs with the reſt of his reverend brethren, flattered themſelves, that they ſhould now put an effectual ſtop to this growing hereſy, and waited with impatience for Saul's return.</p>
            <p>But, "He that ſitteth in heaven laughs them to ſcorn, the Lord has them in deriſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>" And therefore, ver. 3. "As Saul journeyed, and came even near unto Damaſcus," perhaps to the very gates (our Lord permitting this, to try the faith of his diſciples, and more conſpicuouſly to baffle the deſigns of his enemies) "ſuddenly at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, as he acquaints Agrippa) there ſhined round about him a light from heaven," a light brighter than the ſun; "and he fell to the earth (why not into hell?) and heard a voice ſaying unto him, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?" The word is doubled, Saul, Saul: like that of our Lord to Martha; Martha, Martha; or the prophet, O
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:029886_0100_0FE2C0A146FBBC28"/>
earth, earth, earth! Perhaps theſe words came like thunder to his ſoul. That they were ſpoken audibly, we are aſſured from verſe 7. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions heard the voice. Our Lord now arreſts the perſecuting zealot, calling him by name; for the word never does us good, till we find it ſpoken to us in particular. "Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou ME?" Put the emphaſis upon the word <hi>why,</hi> what evil have I done? Put it upon the word <hi>perſecuteſt,</hi> why perſecuteſt! I ſuppoſe Saul thought he was not perſecuting; no, he was only putting the laws of the eccleſiaſtical court into execution; but Jeſus, whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire, ſaw through the hypocriſy of his heart, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his ſpecious pretences, all this proceeded from a perſecuting ſpirit, and ſecret enmity of heart againſt God; and therefore ſays, "Why perſecuteſt thou ME?" Put the emphaſis upon the word ME, "Why perſecuteſt thou me?" Alas! Saul was not perſecuting Chriſt, was he? He was only taking care to prevent innovations in the church, and bringing a company of enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts to juſtice, who otherwiſe would overturn the eſtabliſhed conſtitution. But Jeſus ſays, "Why perſecuteſt thou me?" For what is done to Chriſt's diſciples, he takes as done to himſelf, whether it be good or whether it be evil. He that touches Chriſt's diſciples, touches the apple of his eye; and they that perſecute the followers of our Lord would perſecute our Lord himſelf, was he again to come and tabernacle among us.</p>
            <p>I do not find that Saul gives any reaſon why he did perſecute; no, he was ſtruck dumb; as every perſecutor will be, when Jeſus Chriſt puts this ſame queſtion to them at the terrible day of judgment. But being pricked at the heart, no
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:029886_0101_0FE2C015C8571DD8"/>
doubt with a ſenſe not only of this, but of all his other offences againſt the great God, he ſaid, ver. 5. "Who art thou, Lord?" See how ſoon God can change the heart and voice of his moſt bitter enemies. Not many days ago, Saul was not only blaſpheming Chriſt himſelf, but, as much as in him lay, compelling others to blaſpheme alſo: But now, he who before was an impoſtor, is called "Lord; who art thou, Lord?" This admirably points out the way in which God's Spirit works upon the heart: It firſt powerfully convinces of ſin, and of our damnable ſtate; and then puts us upon inquiring after Jeſus Chriſt. Saul being ſtruck to the ground, or pricked to the heart, cries out after Jeſus, "Who art thou, Lord?" As many of you that were never ſo far made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your damnable ſtate, as to be made feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eek after Jeſus Chriſt, were never yet truly convicted by, much leſs converted to, God. May the Lord, who ſtruck Saul, effectually now ſtrike all my Chriſt-leſs hearers, and ſet them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inquiring after Jeſus as their ALL in ALL! Saul ſaid, "Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord ſaid, I am Jeſus, whom thou perſecuteſt." Nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did any one inquire truly after Jeſus Chriſt, but Chriſt made a ſaving diſcovery of himſelf to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul. It ſhould ſeem, our Lord appeared to him in perſon; for Ananias, afterwards ſays, "the Lord who appeared to thee in the way which thou cameſt;" though this may only imply Chriſt's meeting him in the way; it is not much matter: It is plain Chriſt here ſpeaks to him, and ſays "I am Jeſus, whom thou perſecuteſt." It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, how our Lord takes to himſelf the name of Jeſus; for it is a name in which he delights: I am Jeſus, a Saviour of my people; both from the
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029886_0102_0FE2C0A5E2354360"/>
guilt and power of their ſins; a "Jeſus, whom thou perſecuteſt." This ſeems to be ſpoken to convince Saul more and more of his ſin: and I doubt not, but every word was ſharper than a two-edged ſword, and came like ſo many daggers to his heart: O, how did theſe words affect him! a Jeſus! a Saviour! and yet I am perſecuting him! This ſtrikes him with horror; but then the word Jeſus, though he was a perſecutor, might give him ſome hope. However, our dear Lord, to convince Saul that he was to be ſaved by grace, and that he was not afraid of his power and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, tells him, "It is hard for thee to kick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the pricks." As much as to ſay, though he was perſecuting, yet he could not overthrow the church of Chriſt: For he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it as King upon his holy hill of Zion; the malice of men or devils ſhould never be able to prevail againſt him.</p>
            <p>Ver. 6. And he "trembling and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" Thoſe, who think Saul had a diſcovery of Jeſus made to his heart before, think that this queſtion is the reſult of his faith, and that he now deſires to know what he ſhall do, out of gratitude, for what the Lord had done for his ſoul; in this ſenſe it may be underſtood,<note n="*" place="bottom">See my Sermon on, <hi>What think ye of Chriſt?</hi>
               </note> and I have made uſe of it as an inſtance to prove, that faith will work by love; but perhaps it may be more agreeable to the context, if we ſuppoſe that Saul had only ſome diſtant diſcovery of Chriſt made to him, and not a full aſſurance of faith: For we are told, "he trembling and aſtoniſhed," trembling at the thoughts of his perſecuting a Jeſus, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his own vileneſs, and the infinite condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:029886_0103_0FE2C01BDC5DA860"/>
of this Jeſus, cries out, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" Perſons under ſoul-trouble, and ſore conviction, would be glad to do any thing, or comply on any terms, to get peace with God. "Ariſe ſays our Lord) and go into the city, and it ſhall be told thee what thou ſhalt do."</p>
            <p>And here we will leave Saul a while, and ſee what is become of his companions. But what ſhall we ſay? God is a ſovereign agent; his ſacred Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bloweth when and where it liſteth; "He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy." Saul is taken, but, as far as we know to the contrary, his fellow-travellers are left to periſh in their ſins; For we are told, ver. 7. "That the men who journeyed with him ſtood, indeed ſpeechleſs, and hearing a confuſed voice," for ſo the word ſignifies, and muſt be ſo interpreted, in order to reconcile it with chap. xxii. ver. 9. where Saul giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe men, tells Agrippa, "They heard not the voice of him that ſpake to me." They heard a voice, a confuſed noiſe, but not the articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late voice of him that ſpake to Saul, and therefore remained unconverted. For what are all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, all, even the moſt extraordinary diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of providence, without Chriſt ſpeaks to the ſoul in them? Thus it is now under the word preached: many, like Saul's companions, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſtruck with the out-goings of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the ſanctuary, that they even ſtand ſpeechleſs; they hear the preacher's voice, but not the voice of the Son of God, who, perhaps at the ſame time is ſpeaking effectually to many other hearts; this I have known often; and what ſhall we ſay to theſe things? O the depth of the ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereignty of God! It is paſt finding out. Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I deſire to adore what I cannot comprehend. "Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

            <p>But to return to Saul: the Lord bids him ariſe and go into the city; and we are told, ver. 8. that "Saul aroſe from the earth; and when his eyes were opened," (he was ſo overpowered with the greatneſs of the light that ſhone upon them) that "he ſaw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damaſcus," that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry city which was to be the place of his executing or impriſoning the diſciples of the Lord. "And he was three days without fight, and neither did eat nor drink." But who can tell what horrors of conſcience, what convulſion of ſoul, what deep and pungent convictions of ſin he underwent dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe three long days? It was this took away his appetite (for who can eat or drink when under a ſenſe of the wrath of God for ſin?) and, being to be greatly employed hereafter, he muſt be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled now; therefore the Lord leaves him three days groaning under the ſpirit of bondage, and buffetted, no doubt, with the fiery darts of the devil, that, being tempted like unto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, he might be able hereafter, to ſuccour thoſe that were tempted. Had Saul applied to any of the blind guides of the Jewiſh church under theſe circumſtances, they would have ſaid, he was mad, or going beſide himſelf; as many carnal teachers and blind Phariſees now deal with, and ſo more and more diſtreſs poor ſouls labouring under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening convictions of their damnable ſtate.

               </gap>ight, and neither did eat nor drink.</p>
            <p>But will the Lord leave his poor ſervant in this diſtreſs? No: his Jeſus (though Saul perſecuted him) promiſed (and he will perform) that it "ſhould be told him what he muſt do. And there was a certain diſciple at Damaſcus, named Ananias, and unto him, ſaid the Lord in a viſion, Ananias; and he ſaid, Behold, I am here, Lord." What a holy familiarity is there between Jeſus Chriſt and regenerate ſouls! Ananias had been uſed to ſuch love-viſits, and therefore knew the voice of his beloved. The Lord ſays, Ananias; Ananias ſays, "Behold, I am here, Lord." Thus it is that Chriſt now, as well as formerly, often talks with his children at ſundry times, and after divers manners, as a man talketh with his friend. But what has the Lord to ſay to Ananias?</p>
            <p>Verſe 11. "And the Lord ſaid unto him, ariſe, and go into the ſtreet, which is called Streight, and inquire in the houſe of Judas, for one called Saul of Tarſus;" (ſee here for your comfort, O children of the moſt high God, what notice Jeſus Chriſt takes of the ſtreet, and the houſe where his own dear ſervants lodge) "for behold, he prayeth;" but why is this uſhered in with the word <hi>behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> What, was it ſuch a wonder to hear that Saul was
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029886_0106_0FE2C14D02460800"/>
praying? Why, Saul was a Phariſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no doubt, faſted and made long prayers and, ſince we are told that he profited above ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his equals, I doubt not but he was taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of for his gift in prayer; and yet it ſeems, that before theſe three days, Saul never prayed in his life; and why? Becauſe, before theſe three days, he never felt himſelf a condemned creature: he was alive in his own opinion, becauſe without a knowledge of the ſpiritual meaning of the law; he felt not a want of, and therefore, before now, cried not after a Jeſus, and conſequently, though he might have ſaid, or made a prayer, as many Phariſees do now-a-days, he never prayed a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but now, behold! he prayed indeed; and this was urged as one reaſon why he was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. None of God's children, as one obſerves, comes into the world ſtill-born; prayer is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry breath of the new creature: and therefore, if we are prayerleſs, we are Chriſt-leſs; if we never had the ſpirit of ſupplication, it is a ſad ſign that we never had the ſpirit of grace in our ſouls: and you may be aſſured you never did pray, unleſs you have felt yourſelves ſinners, and ſeen the want of Jeſus to be your Saviour. May the Lord, whom I ſerve in the goſpel of his dear Son, prick you all to the heart, and may it be ſaid of you all as it was of Saul, Behold, they pray!</p>
            <p>The Lord goes on to encourage Ananias to go to Saul: ſays he, verſe 12. "For he hath ſeen in a viſion a man named Ananias, coming i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his ſight." So that though Chriſt converted Saul immediately by himſelf, yet he will carry on the work, thus begun, by a miniſter. Happy they, who under ſoul troubles have ſuch experienced
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:029886_0107_0FE2C0BA151DEA10"/>
guides, and as well acquainted with Jeſus Chriſt as Ananias was: you that have ſuch, make much of and be thankful for them; and you who have them not, truſt in God; he will carry on his own work without them.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, Ananias was a good man; but ſhall I commend him for his anſwer to our Lord? I commend him not: for ſays he, verſe 13, "Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy ſaints at Jeruſalem: and here he hath authority from the chief prieſts to bind all that call upon thy name." I fear this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer proceeded from ſome relics of ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as infidelity, that lay undiſcovered in the heart of Ananias. "Ariſe (ſaid our Lord) and go into the ſtreet, which is called Streight, and inquire in the houſe of Judas, for one called Saul of Tarſus; for behold he prayeth!" One would think this was ſufficient to ſatisfy him: but ſays Ananias, "Lord I have heard by many of this man" (he ſeems to ſpeak of him with much contempt; for even good men are apt to think too contemptuouſly of thoſe who are yet in their ſins) "how much evil he hath done to thy ſaints in Jeruſalem: and here, he hath authority from the chief prieſts, to bind all that call upon thy name." And what then, Ananias? Is any thing too hard for the Lord? Who made thee to differ? Could not he who converted thee, convert him alſo! Surely Ananias here forgets himſelf, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fears, left this man, who had authority from the chief prieſts to bind all that call upon Chriſt's name, ſhould bind him alſo, if he went unto him; but the Lord ſilences all objections, with a "Go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hy way, for he is a choſen veſſel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:029886_0108_0FE2C153276ECD88"/>
children of Iſrael. For I will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for my name's ſake." Here God ſtops his mouth immediately, by aſſerting his ſovereignty, and preaching to him the doctrine of election. And the frequent converſion of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſinners to God, to me is one great proof, among a thouſand others, of that precious, but too much exploded, and ſadly miſrepreſented doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of God's electing love; for whence is it that ſuch are taken, while thouſands not near ſo vile, die ſenſeleſs and ſtupid? All the anſwer that can be given, is, "They are choſen veſſels, Go thy way (lays God) for he is a choſen veſſel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Iſrael: for I will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for my name's ſake." Obſerve what a cloſe connection there is between doing and ſuffering for Chriſt. If any of my brethren in the miniſtry are preſent, let them hear what preferment we muſt expect, if we are called out to work remarkably for God: not great prebendaries or biſhoprics, but great ſufferings for our Lord's name ſake; theſe are the fruits of our labour; and he that will not contentedly ſuffer great things for preaching Chriſt, is not worthy of him. Suffering will be found to be the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, when we are called to give an account of our miniſtry at the great day.</p>
            <p>I do not hear that Ananias quarrelled with God concerning the doctrine of election: no; O that all good men would, in this, learn of him! "He went his way, and entered into the houſe; and put his hands on him, and ſaid, Brother Saul;" juſt now it was this man; now it is Brother Saul: It is no matter what a man has been, if he be now
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:029886_0109_0FE2C0BF63A0E920"/>
a Chriſtian; the ſame ſhould be our brother, our ſiſter, and mother: God blots out every convert's tranſgreſſions as with a thick cloud, and ſo ſhould we; the more vile a man has been, the more ſhould we love him when believing in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt will be more glorified on his behalf. I doubt not, but Ananias was wonderfully delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear that ſo remarkable a perſecutor was brought home to God! I am perſuaded he felt his ſoul immediately united to him by love, and therefore addreſſes him not with, "Thou perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, Thou murderer, that cameſt to butcher me and my friends; but, brother Saul." It is remarkable that the primitive Chriſtians much uſed the word brother and brethren; I know it is a term now much in reproach; but thoſe who deſpiſe it, I believe would be glad to be of our brotherhood, when they ſee us ſitting at the right hand of the Majeſty on high. "Brother Saul, the Lord (even Jeſus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou cameſt) hath ſent me, that thou mighteſt receive thy ſight, and be filled with the Holy Ghoſt." At this time, we may ſuppoſe, he laid his hands upon him. See the conſequences.</p>
            <p>Ver. 18. "Immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been ſcales, and he received ſight forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;" not only bodily, but ſpiritual ſight; he emerged as it were into a new world; he ſaw, and felt too, things unutterable: he felt a union of ſoul with God; he received the ſpirit of adoption; he could now, with a full aſſurance of faith, cry, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> Now was he filled with the Holy Ghoſt; and had the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart; now were the days of his mourning ended; now was Chriſt formed in his ſoul; now he could give men and devils the challenge, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:029886_0110_0FE2C1594D735048"/>
that Chriſt had juſtified him; now he ſaw the excellences of Chriſt, and eſteemed him the faireſt among ten thouſand.—You only know how to ſympathize with the apoſtle in his joy, who, after a long night of bondage, have been ſet free by the Spirit, and have received joy in the Holy Ghoſt. May all that are now mourning, as Saul was, be comforted in like manner!</p>
            <p>The ſcales then are now removed from the eyes of Saul's mind; Ananias has done that for him, under God: he muſt now do another office—bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize him, and ſo receive him into the viſible church of Chriſt; a good proof to me of the neceſſity of baptiſm where it may be had: for I find here, as well as elſewhere, that baptiſm is adminiſtered ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to thoſe who had received the Holy Ghoſt; Saul was convinced of this, and therefore aroſe and was baptized; and now it is time for him to recruit the outward man, which, by three days abſtinence and ſpiritual conflicts, had been much impaired: we are therefore told (verſe 19) "when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived meat, he was ſtrengthened."</p>
            <p>But O, with what comfort did the apoſtle now eat his food! I am ſure it was with ſingleneſs, I am perſuaded alſo with gladneſs of heart; and why? He knew that he was reconciled to God; and, for my own part, did I not know how blind and flinty our hearts are by nature, I ſhould won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how any one could eat even his common food with any ſatisfaction, who has not ſome well-grounded hope of his being reconciled to God. Our Lord intimates thus much to us: for in his glorious prayer, after he has taught us to pray for our daily bread, immediately adds that petition, "forgive us our treſpaſſes;" as though our daily
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029886_0111_0FE2C0C71D5425F0"/>
bread would do us no ſervice, unleſs we were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of having the forgiveneſs of our ſins.</p>
            <p>To proceed: Saul hath received meat, and is ſtrengthened; and whither will he go now? To ſee the brethren; "then was Saul certain days with the diſciples that were at Damaſcus." If we know and love Chriſt, we ſhall alſo love, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be acquainted with the brethren of Chriſt: We may generally know a man by his company. And though all are not ſaints that aſſociate with ſaints (for tares will be always ſpringing up among the wheat till the time of harveſt) yet, if we never keep company, but are ſhy and aſhamed of the deſpiſed children of God, it is a certain ſign we have not yet experimentally learnt Jeſus, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him into our hearts. My dear friends, be not deceived; if we are friends to the Bridegroom, we ſhall be friends to the children of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. Saul, as ſoon as he was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, "was certain days with the diſciples that were at Damaſcus."</p>
            <p>But who can tell what joy theſe diſciples felt when Saul came among them! I ſuppoſe holy Ananias introduced him. Methinks I ſee the once perſecuting zealot, when they came to ſalute him with a holy kiſs, throwing himſelf upon each of their necks, weeping over them with floods of tears, and ſaying, "O my brother, O my ſiſter, Can you forgive me? Can you give ſuch a wretch as I the right hand of fellowſhip, who intended to drag you behind me bound unto Jeruſalem!"—Thus, I ſay, we may ſuppoſe Saul addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his fellow-diſciples; and I doubt not but they were as ready to forgive and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orget as Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias was, and ſaluted him with the endearing ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of brother Saul. Lovely was this meeting; ſo
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:029886_0112_0FE2C15EAD530318"/>
lovely, that it ſeemed Saul continued certain days with them, to communicate experiences, and to learn the way of God more perfectly, to pray for a bleſſing on his future miniſtry, and to praiſe Chriſt Jeſus for what he had done for their ſouls. Saul, perhaps, had ſat certain years at the feet of Gamaliel, but undoubtedly learnt more theſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain days, than he had learnt before in all his life. It pleaſes me to think how this great ſcholar is transformed by the renewing of his mind: what a mighty change was here! That ſo great a man as Saul was, both as to his ſtation in life, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal qualifications, and ſuch a bitter enemy to the Chriſtians; for him, I ſay, to go and be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain days with the people of <hi>this mad way,</hi> and to ſit quietly, and be taught of illiterate men, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe diſciples we may be ſure were, what a ſubſtantial proof was this of the reality of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion!</p>
            <p>What a hurry and confuſion may we ſuppoſe the chief prieſts now were in! I warrant they were ready to cry out, what! is he alſo deceived? As for the common people, who know not the law and are accurſed, for them to be carried away is no ſuch wonder; but for a man bred up at the feet of Gamaliel, for ſuch a ſcholar, ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the cauſe as Saul; for him to be led away with a company of ſilly, deceived men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſurely it is impoſſible: We cannot believe it. But Saul ſoon convinces them of the reality of his becoming a fool for Chriſt's ſake: For ſtraightway, inſtead of going to deliver the letters from the high prieſts, as they expected, in order to bring the diſciples that were at Damaſcus bound to Jeruſalem, "he preached Chriſt in the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, that he is the Son of God." This was
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:029886_0113_0FE2C0CBF6FE6268"/>
another proof of his being converted. He not only converſed with Chriſtians in private, but he preached Chriſt publicly in the ſynagogues: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, he inſiſted on the divinity of our Lord, proving, notwithſtanding his ſtate of humiliation, that he was really the Son of God.</p>
            <p>But why did Saul preach Chriſt thus? Becauſe he had felt the power of Chriſt upon his own ſoul. And here is the reaſon why Chriſt is ſo ſeldom preached, and his divinity ſo ſlightly inſiſted on in our ſynagogues, becauſe the generality of thoſe that pretend to preach him, never felt a ſaving work of converſion upon their own ſouls. How can they preach, unleſs they are firſt taught of, and then ſent by God? Saul did not preach Chriſt before he knew him; no more ſhould any one elſe. An unconverted miniſter, though he could ſpeak with the tongues of men and angels, will be but as a ſounding braſs and tinkling cymbal to thoſe whoſe ſenſes are exerciſed to diſcern ſpiritual things. Miniſters that are unconverted, may talk and declaim of Chriſt, and prove from books that he is the Son of God; but they cannot preach with the demonſtration of the Spirit and with power, unleſs they preach from experience, and have had a proof of his divinity, by a work of grace wrought upon their own ſouls. God forgive thoſe who lay hands on an unconverted man, knowing that he is ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would not do it for a thouſand worlds. Lord Jeſus, keep thy own faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants pure, and let them not be then parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of other men's ſins!</p>
            <p>Such an inſtance as was Saul's converſion, we may be aſſured, muſt make a great deal of noiſe; and, therefore, no wonder we are told, ver. 21. "But all that heard him were amazed, and ſaid,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029886_0114_0FE2C166448472C8"/>
Is not this he that deſtroyed them who called on this name in Jeruſalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief prieſts?"</p>
            <p>Thus it will be with all that appear publicly for Jeſus Chriſt; and it is as impoſſible for a true Chriſtian to be hid, as a city built upon a hill.—Brethren, if you are faithful to, you muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and have remarks made on you for Chriſt; eſpecially if you have been remarkably wicked before your converſion. Your friends ſay, is not this he, or ſhe, who a little while age would run to as great exceſs of riot and vanity as the worſt of us all? What has turned your brain? Or if you have been cloſe, falſe, formal hypocrites, as Saul was, they will wonder that you ſhould be ſo deceived, as to think you were not in a ſafe ſtate before. No doubt, numbers were ſurpriſed to hear Saul, who was touching the law blameleſs, affirm that he was in a damnable condition (as in all probability he did) a few days before.</p>
            <p>Brethren, you muſt expect to meet with many ſuch difficulties as theſe. The ſcourge of the tongue is generally the firſt croſs we are called to beat for the ſake of Chriſt. Let not, therefore, this move you: It did not intimidate, no, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encouraged Saul.</p>
            <p>Says the text, "But Saul increaſed the more in ſtrength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damaſcus, proving that this is very Chriſt." Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition never yet did, nor ever will hurt a ſincere convert: Nothing like oppoſition to make the man of God perfect. None but a hireling, who careth not for the ſheep, will be affrighted at the approach or barking of wolves. Chriſt's miniſters
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:029886_0115_0FE2C0D2837A9060"/>
are as bold as lions: It is not for ſuch men as they to flee.</p>
            <p>And therefore (that I may draw towards a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion) let the miniſters and diſciples of Chriſt learn from Saul, not to fear men or their revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but, like him, increaſe in ſtrength, the more wicked men endeavour to weaken their hands.—We cannot be Chriſtians without being oppoſed: No; diſciples in general muſt ſuffer; miniſters in particular muſt ſuffer great things. But let not this move any of us from our ſteadfaſtneſs in the goſpel: He that ſtood by and ſtrengthened Saul, will alſo ſtand by and ſtrengthen us: He is a God mighty to ſave all that put their truſt in him. If we look up with an eye of faith, we, as well as the firſt martyr St. Stephen may ſee Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God, ready to aſſiſt and protect us. Though the Lord's ſeat is in heaven, yet he has reſpect to his ſaints in an eſpecial manner, when ſuffering here on earth: Then the Spirit of Chriſt and of glory reſts upon their ſouls. And, if I may ſpeak my own experience, "I never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy more rich communication from God, than when deſpiſed and rejected of men for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt." However, little they may deſign it, my enemies are my greateſt friends. What I moſt fear, is a calm; but the enmity which is in the hearts of natural men againſt Chriſt, will not ſuffer them to be quiet long: No; as I hope the work of God will increaſe, ſo the rage of men and devils will increaſe alſo. Let us put on, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the whole armour of God: Let us not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear the face of men: Let us fear him only who can deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell: I ſay unto you, let us fear him alone. You ſee how ſoon God can ſtop the fury of his enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="unknown:029886_0116_0FE2C16AEA96C178"/>
You have juſt now heard of a proud, powerful zealot ſtopped in his full career, ſtruck down to the earth with a light from heaven, converted by the almighty power of efficacious grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon zealouſly promoting, nay, reſolutely ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, the faith which once with threatnings and ſlaughters he endeavoured to deſtroy. Let this teach us to pity and pray for our Lord's moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemies. Who knows, but in anſwer thereunto, our Lord may give them repentance unto life? Moſt think, that Chriſt had reſpect to Stephen's prayer, when he converted Saul. Perhaps for this reaſon God ſuffers his adverſaries to go on, that his goodneſs and power may ſhine more bright in their converſion.</p>
            <p>But let not the perſecutors of Chriſt take en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from this to continue in their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Remember, though Saul was converted, yet the high prieſt and Saul's companions, were left dead in treſpaſſes and ſins: And, if this ſhould be your caſe, you will of all men be moſt miſerable: For perſecutors have the loweſt place in hell. And, if Saul was ſtruck to the earth by a light from heaven, how will you be able to ſtand before Jeſus Chriſt, when he comes in terrible majeſty to take vengeance on all thoſe who have perſecuted his goſpel? Then the queſtion, "Why perſecuted thou me?" will cut you through and through. The ſecret enmity of your hearts ſhall be then detected before men and angels, and you ſhall be doomed to dwell in the blackneſs of darkneſs for evermore. Kiſs the Son therefore, leſt he be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: For even you may yet find mercy, if you believe on the Son of God: Though you perſecute him, yet he will be your Jeſus. I cannot deſpair

of any of you, when I find a Saul among the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at Damaſcus. What though your ſins are as ſcarlet, the blood of Chriſt ſhall waſh them as white as ſnow. Having much to be forgiven, deſpair not; only believe, and like Saul, of whom I have now been ſpeaking, love much. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

You are all thronging round, but which of you will touch the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? What a comfort will it be to Saul; and to your own ſouls, when you meet him in heaven, to tell him, that hearing of his, was a means, under God, of your converſion! Doubtleſs it was written for the encouragement of all poor returning ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; he himſelf tells us ſo: For "in me God ſhewed all long-ſuffering that I might be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to them that ſhould hereafter believe." Was Saul here himſelf, he would tell you ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he would; but being dead, by this account of his converſion, he yet ſpeaketh. O that God may ſpeak by it to your hearts! O that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of God might this day ſtick faſt in your ſouls, and you made to cry out, "Who art thou Lord?" Are there any ſuch amongſt you? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I feel ſomething of what this Saul felt, when he ſaid, "I travail in birth again for you till Chriſt be formed again in your hearts." <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>OF all the verſes in the book of God, this whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> I have now read to you, is, I believe, one of the moſt comprehenſive: What glad tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings does it bring to believers! What precious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges are they herein inveſted with: How are they here led to the fountain of them all, I mean, the love, the everlaſting love of God the Father! "Of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and redemption."</p>
            <p>Without referring you to the context, I ſhall from theſe words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Point out to you the fountain from which all thoſe bleſſings flow, which the elect of God partake of in Jeſus Chriſt, "who of God is made unto us." And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall conſider what theſe bleſſings are, "wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would point out to you the fountain from which all thoſe bleſſings flow, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of God partake of in Jeſus, "who of God is made
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:029886_0120_0FE2C173D6D84058"/>
unto us:" the Father, he it is who is ſpoken of here. Not as though Jeſus Chriſt was not God alſo; but God the Father is the fountain of the Deity; and, if we conſider Jeſus Chriſt acting as Mediator, God the Father is greater than he; there was an eternal contract between the Father and the Son: "I have made a covenant with my choſen, and I have ſworn unto David my ſervant;" now David was a type of Chriſt, with whom the Father made a covenant, that if he would obey and ſuffer, and make himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, he ſhould "ſee his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eed, he ſhould prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhould proſper in his hands." This compact our Lord refers to, in that glorious prayer recorded in the 17th chap. of John; and therefore he prays for, or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with a full aſſurance, all that were given to him by the Father: "Father, I will that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am." For this ſame reaſon the apoſtle breaks out in praiſes of God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for he loved the elect with an everlaſting love, or, as our Lord expreſſes it, "before the foundation of the world;" and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſhew them to whom they were beholden for their ſalvation, our Lord, in the 25th of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, repreſents himſelf, ſaying, "Come, ye bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed children of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." And thus, in reply to the mother of Zebedee's children, he ſays, "It is not mine to give, but it ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared of the Father." The apoſtle therefore, when here ſpeaking of the Chriſtian's privileges, leſt they ſhould ſacrifice to their own drag, or
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029886_0121_0FE2C0E4594786F0"/>
think their ſalvation was owing to their own faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, or improvement of their own free-will, reminds them to look back on the everlaſting love of God the Father; "who of God is made unto us, &amp;c."</p>
            <p>Would to God, this part of doctrine was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered more, and people were more ſtudious of the covenant of redemption between the Father and the Son! we ſhould not then have ſo much diſputing againſt the doctrine of election, or hear it condemned (even by good men) as a doctrine of devils. For my own part, I cannot ſee how true humbleneſs of mind can be attained without a knowledge of it; and though I will not ſay, that every one who denies election is a bad man, yet I will ſay, with that ſweet ſinger, Mr. Trail, it is a very bad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſuch a one, whoever he be, I think cannot truly know himſelf: for, if we deny elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt, partly at leaſt, glory in ourſelves; but our redemption is ſo ordered, that no fleſh ſhould glory in the divine preſence; and hence it is, that the pride of man oppoſes this doctrine, becauſe according to this doctrine, and no other, "he that glories muſt glory only in the Lord." But what ſhall I ſay? Election is a myſtery that ſhines with ſuch reſplendent brightneſs, that, to make uſe of the words of one who has drank deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of electing love, it dazzles the weak eyes even of ſome of God's dear children; however, though they know it not, all the bleſſings they receive, all the privileges they do or will enjoy through Jeſus Chriſt, flow from the everlaſting love of God the Father: "But of him are you in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us, wiſdom, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſanctification, and redemption."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:029886_0122_0FE2C178A5796628"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I come to ſhew what theſe bleſſings are, which are here, through Chriſt, made over to the elect. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt is made to them <hi>wiſdom</hi>—But wherein does true wiſdom conſiſt? Was I to aſk ſome of you, perhaps you would ſay, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging the luſt of the fleſh, and ſaying to your ſouls, eat, drink, and be merry. But this is only the wiſdom of brutes—They have as good a guſt and reliſh for ſenſual pleaſures, as the greateſt ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icure on the earth—Others would tell me true wiſdom conſiſted in adding houſe to houſe, and field to field, and calling lands after their own names; but this cannot be true wiſdom; for riches often take to themſelves wings and fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, like an eagle toward heaven. Even wiſdom itſelf aſſures us, "that a man's life doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the abundance of the things which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes;" vanity, vanity, all theſe things are vanity; for, if riches leave not the owner, the owners muſt ſoon leave them; "for rich men muſt alſo die, and leave their riches for others;" their rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es cannot procure them redemption from the grave, whither we are all haſtening apace.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you deſpiſe riches and pleaſure, and therefore place wiſdom in the knowledge of books: but it is poſſible for you to tell the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſtars, and call them all by their names, and yet be mere fools; learned men are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wiſe; nay, our common learning ſo much cried up, makes men only ſo many accompliſhed fools; to keep you therefore no longer in ſuſpence, and withal to humble you, I will ſend you to a heathen ſchool, to learn what true wiſdom is: <hi>know thyſelf,</hi> was a ſaying of one of the wiſe men of Greece; this is certainly true wiſdom, and
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029886_0123_0FE2C0EC0E160888"/>
this is that wiſdom ſpoken of in the text, and which Jeſus Chriſt has made to all elect ſinners; they are made to know themſelves, ſo as not to think more highly of themſelves, ſo as not to think more highly of themſelves, than they ought to think. Before they were darkneſs; now they are light in the Lord; and in that light they ſee their own darkneſs; they now bewail themſelves as fallen creatures by nature, dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, ſons and heirs of hell, and children of wrath; they now ſee that all their righteouſneſſes are but as filthy rags; that there is no health in their ſouls; that they are poor and miſerable, blind and naked; and that there is no name given under heaven, whereby they can be ſaved, but that of Jeſus Chriſt. They ſee the neceſſity of cloſing with a Saviour, and behold the wiſdom of God in appointing him to be a Saviour; they are alſo made willing to accept of ſalvation upon our Lord's own terms, and to receive him as their all in all: thus Chriſt is made to them wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Righteouſneſs. "Who of God is made unto us, wiſdom, righteouſneſs;" Chriſt's whole perſonal righteouſneſs is made over to, and accounted theirs. Being enabled to lay hold on Chriſt by faith, God the Father blots out their tranſgreſſions, as with a thick cloud; their ſins, and their iniquities he remembers no more; they are made the righteouſneſs of God in Jeſus, who is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth. In one ſenſe, God now ſees no ſin in them; the whole covenant of works is fulfilled in them; they are actually juſtified, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, and looked upon as righteous in the ſight of God; they are perfectly accepted in the Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they are complete in him; the flaming ſword of God's wrath, which before moved every way,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:029886_0124_0FE2C17FC17565D8"/>
is now removed, and free acceſs given to the tree of life; they are enabled now to reach out the arm of faith, and pluck and live for evermore.—Hence it is that the apoſtle, under a ſenſe of this bleſſed privilege, breaks out into this triumphant language, "it is Chriſt that juſtifies, who is he that condemns?" Does ſin condemn? Chriſt's righteouſneſs delivers believers from the guilt of it: Chriſt is their Saviour, and is become a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for their ſins: who therefore ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? Does the law condemn? By having Chriſt's righteouſneſs impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, they are dead to the law, as a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; Chriſt has fulfilled it for them, and in their ſtead. Does death threaten them? They need not fear: The ſting of death is ſin, the ſtrength of ſin is the law; but God has given them the victory, by imputing to them the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>And what a privilege is here! Well might the angels at the birth of Chriſt, ſay to the humble ſhepherds, "Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy;" unto you that believe in Chriſt, "a Saviour is born." And well may they rejoice at the converſion of poor ſinners: for the Lord is their righteouſneſs: they have peace with God, through faith in Chriſt's blood, and ſhall never enter into condemnation. O believers! (for this diſcourſe is intended in a ſpecial manner for you) lift up your heads; "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I ſay, rejoice." Chriſt is made to you of God, righteouſneſs, what then ſhould you fear? you are made the righteouſneſs of God in him; you may be called, "The Lord our righteouſneſs." Of what then ſhould you be afraid? What ſhall ſeparate you henceforward from the love of Chriſt?
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029886_0125_0FE2C0F236D06110"/>
Shall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? No; I am perſuaded, neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate you from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who of God is made unto you righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>This is a glorious privilege, but this is only the beginning of the happineſs of believers: for,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt is not only made to them righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but ſanctification. By ſanctification, I do not mean a bare hypocritical attendance on outward ordinances (though rightly informed Chriſtians will think it their duty and privilege conſtantly to attend on all outward ordinances.) Nor do I mean by ſanctification, a bare outward reformation, and a few tranſient convictions, or a little legal ſorrow; for all this an unſanctified man may have; but, by ſanctification I mean a total renovation of the whole man; by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, believers become legally, by ſanctification they are made ſpiritually, alive; by one they are entitled to, by the other they are made meet for glory. They are ſanctified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore throughout, in ſpirit, ſoul and body.</p>
            <p>Their underſtandings, which were before dark, now become light in the Lord: and their will, before contrary to, now become one with the will of God: their affections are now ſet on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; their memory is now filled with divine things; their natural conſciences are now enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; their members, which were before inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of uncleanneſs, and of iniquity unto iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are now inſtruments of righteouſneſs and true
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029886_0126_0FE2C1845D3153E0"/>
holineſs; in ſhort, they are new creatures; "old things are paſſed away, all things are become new," in their hearts; ſin has now no longer do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them; they are freed from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though not the indwelling and being of it; they are holy both in heart and life, in all manner of converſation; they are made partakers of a divine nature; and from Jeſus Chriſt they receive grace for grace; and every grace that is in Chriſt, is copied and tranſcribed into their ſouls; they are transformed into his likeneſs; he is formed within them; they dwell in him, and he in them; they are led by the Spirit, and bring forth the fruits thereof: they know that Chriſt is their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, God with and in them; they are living temples of the Holy Ghoſt. And therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a holy habitation unto the Lord, the whole Trinity dwells and walks in them; even here, they fit together with Chriſt in heavenly places, and are vitally united to him, their head, by a living faith; their Redeemer, their Maker, is their huſband; they are fleſh of his fleſh, bone of his bone; they talk, they walk with him, as a man talketh and walketh with his friend; in ſhort, they are one with Chriſt, even as Jeſus Chriſt and the Father are one.</p>
            <p>Thus is Chriſt made to believers ſanctification. And O what a privilege is this! To be changed from beaſts into ſaints, and from a deviliſh, to be made partakers of a divine nature; to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from the kingdom of Satan, into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God's dear Son! To put off the old man, which is corrupt, and to put on the new man, which is created after God, in righteouſneſs and true holineſs. O what an unſpeakable bleſſing is this! I almoſt ſtand amazed at the contemplation
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029886_0127_0FE2C0F8955A3B78"/>
thereof Well might the apoſtle exhort believers to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap>; indeed they have reaſon always to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

               </gap> may this be a myſtery to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, for it is a myſtery even to the ſpiritual man himſelf, a myſtery which he cannot fathom. Does it not often dazzle your eyes, O ye children of God, to look at your own brightneſs, when the candle of the Lord ſhines out, and your Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lifts up the light of his bleſſed countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſouls? Are you not aſtoniſhed, when you feel the love of God ſhed abroad in your hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, and God holds out the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſceptre of his mercy, and bids you aſk what you will, and it ſhall be given you? Does not that peace of God, which keeps and rules your hearts, ſurpaſs the utmoſt limits of your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings? And is not the joy you feel unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Is it not full of glory? I am perſuaded it is; and in your ſecret communion, when the Lord's love ſlows in upon your ſouls, you are as it were ſwallowed up in, or, to uſe the apoſtle's phraſe, "filled with all the fulneſs of God." Are not you ready to cry out with Solomon, "And will the Lord, indeed, dwell thus with men? How is it that we ſhould be thus thy ſons and daughters, O Lord God Almighty!"</p>
            <p>If you are children of God, and know what it is to have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son; if you walk by faith, and not by ſight; I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured this is frequently the language of your hearts.</p>
            <p>But look forward, and ſee an unbounded proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of eternal happineſs lying before thee, O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever! What thou haſt already received, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not only made to believers, wiſdom, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſanctification, but alſo redemption.</p>
            <p>But, before we enter upon the explanation and contemplation of this privilege,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Learn hence the great miſtake of thoſe writers, and clergy, who, notwithſtanding they talk of ſanctification and inward holineſs (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſometimes they do, though in a very looſe and ſuperficial manner) yet they generally make it the cauſe, whereas they ſhould conſider it as the effect, of our juſtification. Of him "are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, righteouſneſs," and then ſanctification. For Chriſt's righteouſneſs, or that which Chriſt has done in our ſtead without us, is the ſole cauſe of our acceptance in the ſight of God, and of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs wrought in us: To this, and not to the light within, or any thing wrought within, ſhould poor ſinners ſeek for juſtification in the ſight of God: for the ſake of Chriſt's righteouſneſs alone, and not any thing wrought in us, does God look favourably upon us; our ſanctification at beſt, in this life, is not complete: Though we are deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from the power, we are not freed from the in-being of ſin; but not only the dominion, but the in-being of ſin, is forbidden by the perfect law of God: For it is not ſaid, "thou ſhalt not
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:029886_0129_0FE2C0FE80B66F20"/>
give way to luſt, but, thou ſhalt not luſt." So that whilſt the principle of luſt remains in the leaſt degree in our hearts, though we are otherwiſe nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſo holy, yet we cannot, on account of that, hope for acceptance with God. We muſt firſt therefore, look for a righteouſneſs without us, even the righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: For this reaſon the apoſtle mentions it, and puts it before ſanctification in the words of the text. And whoſoever teacheth any other doctrine, doth not preach the truth as it is in Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From hence alſo, the Antinomians and formal hypocrites may be confuted, who talk of Chriſt without, but know nothing, experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of a work of ſanctification wrought within them. Whatever they may pretend to, ſince Chriſt is not in them, the Lord is not their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and they have no well-grounded hope of glory: For though ſanctification is not the cauſe, yet it is the effect of our acceptance with God; "who of God is made unto us righteouſneſs and ſanctification." He therefore, that is really in Chriſt, is a new creature; it is not going back to a covenant of works, to look into our hearts, and, ſeeing that they are changed and renewed, from thence form a comfortable and well-grounded aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the ſafety of our ſtates: No, but this is what we are directed to in ſcripture; by our bringing forth the fruits, we are to judge whether or no we ever did truly partake of the Spirit of God, "We know (ſays John) that we are paſſed from death unto life, becauſe we love the breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren." And however we may talk of Chriſt's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and exclaim againſt legal preachers: yet, if we are not holy in heart and life, if we are not ſanctified and renewed by the Spirit in our
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:029886_0130_0FE2C19024A40528"/>
minds, we are ſelf-deceivers, we are only formal hypocrites: For we muſt not put aſunder what God has joined together; we muſt keep the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between the two extremes; not inſiſt ſo much on the one hand upon Chriſt without, as to exclude Chriſt within, as an evidence of our being his, and as a preparation for future happineſs; nor on the other hand, ſo depend on inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs or holineſs wrought in us, as to exclude the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt without us. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us now go on, and take a view of the other link, or rather the end, of the believer's golden chain of privileges, redemption. But we muſt look very high; for the top of it, like Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob's ladder, reaches heaven, where all believers will aſcend, and be placed at the right hand of God. "Who of God is made unto us, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption."</p>
            <p>This is a golden chain indeed! And, what is beſt of all, not one link can ever be broken aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from another. Was there no other text in the book of God, this ſingle one ſufficiently proves the final perſeverance of true believers? for never did God yet juſtify a man, whom he did not ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify; nor ſanctify one whom he did not complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly redeem and glorify; no, as for God, his way, his work, is perfect; he always carried on and finiſhed the work he began; thus it was in the firſt, ſo it is in the new creation; when God ſays, "let there be light," there is light, that ſhines more and more unto the perfect day, when believers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their eternal reſt, as God entered into his. Thoſe whom God has juſtified, he has in effect glorified: for as a man's worthineſs was not the cauſe of God's giving him Chriſt's righteouſneſs, ſo neither ſhall his unworthineſs be a cauſe of his
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029886_0131_0FE2C104037BEC08"/>
taking it away; God's gifts and callings are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance; and I cannot think, they are clear in the notion of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, who deny the final perſeverance of the ſaints; I fear, they underſtand juſtification in that low ſenſe, which I underſtood it in a few years ago, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying no more than remiſſion of ſins: but it not only ſignifies remiſſion of ſins paſt, but alſo a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, how will he not with him freely give us all things? Therefore, the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, after he ſays, "who of God is made unto us righteouſneſs," does not ſay, perhaps he may be made to us ſanctification and redemption; but he is made: for there is an eternal, indiſſoluble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between theſe bleſſed privileges. As the obedience of Chriſt is imputed to believers, ſo his perſeverance in that obedience is to be imputed to them alſo: and it argues great ignorance of the covenant of grace and redemption to object againſt it.</p>
            <p>By the word redemption, we are to underſtand, not only a complete deliverance from all evil, but alſo a full enjoyment of all good both in body and ſoul: I ſay both in body and ſoul: for the Lord is alſo for the body; the bodies of the ſaints in this life are temples of the Holy Ghoſt; God makes a covenant with the duſt of believers; after death, though worms deſtroy them, yet, even in their fleſh ſhall they ſee God. I fear, indeed, there are ſome Sadducees in our days, or at leaſt heretics, who ſay, either that there is no reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body, or that the reſurrection is paſt already, namely, in our regeneration: Hence it is, that our Lord's coming in the fleſh, at the day of judgment, is denied; and conſequently, we muſt
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029886_0132_0FE2C1975134A5D8"/>
throw aſide the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper. For why ſhould we remember the Lord's death until he come to judgment, when he is already come to judge our hearts, and will not come a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time? But all this is only the reaſoning of unlearned, unſtable men, who certainly know not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm. That we muſt follow our Lord in the regeneration, be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of a new birth, and that Chriſt muſt come into our hearts, we freely confeſs, and we hope, when ſpeaking of theſe things, we ſpeak no more than what we know and feel: but then it is plain, that Jeſus Chriſt will come, hereafter, to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that he aſcended into heaven with the body which he had here on earth; for, ſays he, after his reſurrection, "handle me, and ſee; a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as you ſee me have." And it is plain, that Chriſt's reſurrection was an earneſt of ours: for, ſays the apoſtle, "Chriſt is riſen from the dead, and become the firſt fruits of them that ſlept;" and as in Adam all die and are ſubject to mortality; ſo all that are in Chriſt, the ſecond Adam, who repreſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as their foederal head, ſhall certainly be made alive, or riſe again with their bodies at the laſt lay.</p>
            <p>Here then, O believers! is one, though the loweſt, degree of that redemption which you are to be partakers of hereafter; I mean, the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your bodies: For this corruptible muſt put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. Your bodies, as well as ſouls, were given to Jeſus Chriſt by the Father: they have been companions in watching, and faſting and praying: Your bodies therefore, as well as ſouls,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029886_0133_0FE2C109FA92DB98"/>
ſhall Jeſus Chriſt raiſe up at the laſt day. Fear not, therefore, O believers, to look into the grave; for to you it is no other than a conſecrated dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, where your bodies ſhall ſleep quietly until the morning of the reſurrection; when the voice of the archangel ſhall ſound, and the trump of God give the general alarm, "Ariſe ye dead, and come to judgment;" earth, air, fire, water, ſhall give up your ſcattered atoms, and both in body and ſoul ſhall you be ever with the Lord. I doubt not but many of you are groaning under crazy bodies, and complain often that the mortal body weighs down the immortal ſoul; at leaſt this is my caſe; but let us have a little patience, and we ſhall be delivered from our earthly priſons; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re long, theſe tabernacles of clay ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and we ſhall be cloathed with our houſe which is from heaven: hereafter, our bodies ſhall be ſpiritualized, and ſhall be ſo far from hindering our ſouls through weakneſs, that they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtrong; ſo ſtrong, as to bear up under an exceeding and eternal weight of glory; others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain may have deformed bodies, emaciated alſo with ſickneſs, and worn out with labour and age; but wait a little, until your bleſſed change by death comes; then your bodies ſhall be renewed and made glorious, like unto Chriſt's glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: of which we may form ſome faint idea, from the account given us of our Lord's transfiguration on the Mount, when it is ſaid, "His raiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came bright and glittering, and his face brighter than the ſun." Well then may a believer break out into the apoſtle' triumphant language, 'O death, where is thy ſting! O grave, where is thy victory!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="unknown:029886_0134_0FE2C19BEE912480"/>
But what is the redemption of the body, in compariſon of the redemption of the better part, our ſouls? I muſt, therefore, ſay to you believers, as the angel ſaid to John, "Come up higher," and let us take as clear a view as we can, at ſuch a diſtance, of the redemption Chriſt has purchaſed for, and will ſhortly put you in actual poſſeſſion of. Already you are juſtified, already you are ſanctified, and thereby freed from the guilt and dominion of ſin: but, as I have obſerved, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and indwelling of ſin yet remains in you; God ſees it proper to leave ſome Amalekites in the land, to keep his Iſrael in action. The moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Chriſtian, I am perſuaded, muſt agree, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to one of our articles, "that the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature remains even in the regenerate; that the fleſh luſteth always againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh." So that believers cannot do things for God with that perfection they deſire; this grieves their righteous ſouls day by day, and, with the holy apoſtle, makes them to cry out, "Who ſhall deliver us from the body of this death!" I thank God, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt will, but not completely before the day of our diſſolution; then will the very being of ſin be deſtroyed, and an eternal ſtop put to inbred, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling corruption. And is not this a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? I am ſure believers eſteem it ſo: for there is nothing grieves the heart of a child of God ſo much, as the remains of indwelling ſin. Again, believers are often in heavineſs through manifold temptations; God ſees that it is needful and good for them ſo to be; and though they may be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured, and wrapt up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſhould be puffed up with the abundance of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. But be not weary, be not faint in your minds: the time of your complete redemption draweth nigh. In heaven the wicked one ſhall ceaſe from troubling you, and your weary ſouls ſhall enjoy an everlaſting reſt; his fiery darts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach thoſe bliſsful regions: Satan will never come any more to appear with, diſturb, or accuſe the ſons of God, when once the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhuts the door. Your righteous ſouls are now grieved, day by day, at the ungodly converſation of the wicked; tares now grow up among the wheat; wolves come in ſheep's cloathing: but the redemption ſpoken of in the text will free our ſouls from all anxiety on theſe accounts; hereafter you ſhall enjoy a perfect communion of faints; nothing that is unholy or unſanctified ſhall enter into the holy of holies, which is prepared for you above: This, and all manner of evil what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you ſhall be delivered from, when your redemption is hereafter made complete in heaven; not only ſo, but you ſhall enter into the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all good.

Was I to entertain you whole ages with an account of it, when you come to heaven you muſt ſay, with the queen of Sheba, "Not half, no, not one thouſandth part was told us." All we can do here, is to go upon Mount Piſgah, and by the eye of faith, take a diſtant view of the promiſed land: we may ſee it, as Abraham did Chriſt, afar off, and rejoice in it; but here we o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy men! you know not what you do. Were your eyes open, and had you ſenſes to diſcern ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, you would not ſpeak all manner of evil againſt the children of God, but you would eſteem them as the excellent ones of the earth, and envy their happineſs: your ſouls would hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after it: you alſo would become fools for Chriſt's ſake. You boaſt of wiſdom; ſo did the philoſophers of Corinth: but your wiſdom is the fooliſhneſs of folly in the ſight of God.—What will your wiſdom avail you, if it does not make you wiſe unto ſalvation? Can you, with all your wiſdom, propoſe a more conſiſtent ſcheme to build your hopes of ſalvation on, than what has been now laid down before you? Can you, with all the ſtrength of natural reaſon, find out a better

way of acceptance with God, than by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Is it right to think your own works can in any meaſure deſerve or procure it? If not, why will you not believe in him? Why will you not ſubmit to his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? Can you deny that you are fallen crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Do not you find that you are full of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and that theſe diſorders make you unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py? Do not you find that you cannot change your own hearts? Have you not reſolved many and many a time, and have not your corruptions yet dominion over you? Are you not bond-ſlaves to your luſts, and led captive by the devil at his will? Why then will you not come to Chriſt for ſanctification? Do you not deſire to die the death of the righteous, and that your future ſtate may be like theirs?

And why then will you not come to Chriſt? He alone can procure you everlaſting redemption.—Haſte, haſte away to him, poor beguiled ſinners. You lack wiſdom; aſk it of Chriſt. Who knows but he may give it you? He is able: for he is the wiſdom of the Father; he is that wiſdom which was from everlaſting. You have no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; away, therefore, to Chriſt: He is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth. You are unholy; flee to the Lord Jeſus: he is full of grace and truth! and of his fulneſs, all may receive that believe in him. You are as if afraid to die; let this drive you to Chriſt;
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:029886_0138_0FE2C1A9117C0360"/>
he has the keys of death and hell; in him is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous redemption; he alone can open the door which leads to everlaſting life. Let not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the deceived reaſoner boaſt any longer of his pretended reaſon. Whatever you may think, it is the moſt unreaſonable thing in the world not to believe on Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſent. Why, why will you die? Why will you not come unto him, that you may have life? Ho! every one that thirſteth, come unto the waters of life and drink freely: Come, buy without money and without price. Were theſe bleſſed privileges in the text to be purchaſed with money, you might ſay, we are poor, and cannot buy: or, were they to be conferred only on ſinners of ſuch a rank or degree, then you might ſay, how can ſuch ſinners as we, expect to be ſo highly favoured? But they are to be freely given of God to the worſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. To us, ſays the apoſtle; to me a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to you Corinthians, who were unclean, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, covetous perſons, idolaters. Therefore, each poor ſinner may ſay then, why not unto me? Has Chriſt but one bleſſing? What if he has bleſſed millions already, by turning them away from their iniquities; yet he ſtill continues the ſame: he lives for ever to make interceſſion, and therefore will bleſs you, even you alſo. Though, Eſau like, you have been profane, and hitherto deſpiſed your heavenly Father's birth-right; even now, if you believe, Chriſt will be made to you of God, "wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
            <p>But I muſt turn again to believers, for whoſe inſtruction, as I obſerved before, this diſcourſe was particularly intended. You ſee brethren, partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the heavenly calling, what great bleſſings are

treaſured up for you in Jeſus Chriſt your Head, and what you are entitled to by believing on his name, take heed therefore, that ye walk worthy of the vocation where with ye are called: Think often how highly you are favoured, and remember you have not choſen Chriſt, but Chriſt hath choſen you. Put on (as the elect of God) humbleneſs of mind, and glory, but O, let it be only in the Lord—for you have nothing but what you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of God; by nature you were as fooliſh, as legal, as unholy, and in as damnable a condition as others; be pitiful therefore, be courteous, and as ſanctification is a progreſſive work, beware of thinking you have already attained. Let him that is holy, be holy ſtill, knowing that he who is moſt pure in heart, ſhall hereafter enjoy the cleareſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God—let indwelling ſin be your daily bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and not only bewail and lament, but ſee that you ſubdue it daily by the power of divine grace, and look up to Jeſus continually to be the Finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as well as Author of your faith—build not on your own faithfulneſs, but on God's unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—take heed of thinking you ſtand by the power of your own free will—the everlaſting love o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THOUGH there be ſome who dare to deny the Lord Jeſus, and diſbelieve the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he has been pleaſed to give us, and thereby bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction; yet I would charitably hope there are but few, if any ſuch among you to whom I am now to preach the kingdom of God. Was I to aſk you, "how you expect to be juſtified in the ſight of an offended God?" I ſuppoſe you would anſwer, only for the ſake of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But, was I to come more home to your conſciences, I fear moſt would make the Lord Jeſus but in part their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and go about, as it were, to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of their own. And this is not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the rules of Chriſtian charity: For we are all ſelf-righteous by nature; it is as natural for us to turn back to a covenant of works, as for the ſparks to fly upwards. We have had ſo many legal and ſo few free-grace preachers, for theſe
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:029886_0141_0FE2C1228EA17BC0"/>
many years, that moſt profeſſors now ſeem to be ſettled upon their lees, and rather deſerve the title of Phariſees than Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Thus it was with the generality of the people during the time of our Lord's public miniſtrations: And therefore, in almoſt all his diſcourſes, he preached the goſpel to poor ſinners, and denounced terrible woes againſt proud ſelf-juſticiaries. The parable to which the words of the text belong, looks both theſe ways: For the evangeliſt informs us (ver. 9.) that our Lord "ſpake it unto certain who truſted in themſelves, that they were righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and deſpiſed others." And a notable parable it is; a parable worthy your moſt ſerious attention. "He that hath ears to hear let him hear" what Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks to all viſible profeſſors in it.</p>
            <p>Ver. 10. "Two men went up to the temple to pray," (and never two men of more oppoſite cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters) "the one a Phariſee, and the other a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican." The Phariſees were the ſtricteſt ſect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews; I was of the ſtricteſt ſect of the Phariſees, ſays Paul. They played often; not only ſo, but they made long prayers; and, that they might appear extraordinary devout, they would pray at the corners of the ſtreet, where two ways met, that people going or coming, both ways, might ſee them. "They made broad (as our Lord informs us) the borders of their philacte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies," they had pieces of parchment ſown to their long robes, on which ſome parts of the ſcripture were written, that people might from thence infer, that they were lovers of the law of God. They were ſo very punctual and exact in outward purifications, that they waſhed at their going out and coming in. They held the waſhing of pots, brazen veſſels and tables, and many other ſuch-like things they
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:029886_0142_0FE2C1B352C13948"/>
did. They were very zealous for the traditions of the fathers, and for the obſervation of the rites and ceremonies of the church, notwithſtanding they frequently made void the law of God by their traditions. And they were ſo exceedingly exact in the outward obſervation of the Sabbath, that they condemned our Lord for making a little clay with his ſpittle; and called him a ſinner, and ſaid, he was not of God, becauſe he had given ſight to a man born blind, on the Sabbath-day. For theſe reaſons they were had in high veneration among the people, who were ſadly miſled by theſe blind guides: They had the uppermoſt places in the ſynagogues, and greetings in the market places (which they loved dearly) and were called of men, Rabbi; in ſhort, they had ſuch a reputation for piety, that it became a proverb among the Jews, that if there were but two men ſaved, the one of them muſt be a Phariſee.</p>
            <p>As for the Publicans it was not ſo with them. It ſeems they were ſometimes Jews, or at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes of the gate; for we find the one here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the temple; but for the generality, I am apt to think they were Gentiles;—for they were gatherers of the Roman taxes, and uſed to amaſs much wealth (as appears by the confeſſion of Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, one of the chief of them) by wronging men by falſe accuſations. They were ſo univerſally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, that our Lord himſelf tells his diſciples, the excommunicated man ſhould be to them as a Heathen man, or a Publican. And the Phariſees thought it a ſufficient impeachment of our Lord's character, that he was a "friend to Publicans and ſinners, and went to ſit down with them at meat."</p>
            <p>But, however they diſagreed in other things, they agreed in this, that public worſhip is a duty
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029886_0143_0FE2C12933B76140"/>
incumbent upon all: For they both came up to the temple. The very Heathens were obſervers of temple-worſhip. We have very early notice of men's ſacrificing to, and calling upon the name of the Lord, in the Old Teſtament! and I find it no where contradicted in the new. Our Lord, and his apoſtles, went up to the temple; and we are commanded by the apoſtle, "not to forſake the aſſembling of ourſelves together," as the manner of too many is in our days; and ſuch too, as would have us think well of them, though they ſeldom or never tread the courts of the Lord's houſe. But, though our devotions begin in our cloſets, they muſt not end there. And, if people never ſhew their devotions abroad, I muſt ſuſpect they have little or none at home. "Two men went up to the temple." And what went they thither for? Not (as multitudes amongſt us do) to make the houſe of God a houſe of merchandiſe, or to turn it into a den of thieves; much leſs to ridicule the preacher, or diſturb the congregation. No, they came to the temple, ſays our Lord, to pray. Thither ſhould the tribes of God's ſpiritual Iſrael go up, to walk with and pour out their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mighty God of Jacob.</p>
            <p>"Two men went up to the temple to pray." I fear one of them forgot his errand. I have often been at a loſs what to call the Phariſee's addreſs; It certainly does not deſerve the name of prayer: He may rather be ſaid to come to the temple to boaſt, than to pray; for I do not find one word of confeſſion of his original guilt; not one ſingle pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for pardon of his paſt actual ſins, or for grace to help and aſſiſt him for the time to come: he only brings in God, as it were, a reckoning of
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:029886_0144_0FE2C1BA19DDEED8"/>
his performances, and does that, which no fleſh can juſtly do, I mean, glory in his preſence.</p>
            <p>Verſe 11. "The Phariſee ſtood, and prayed thus with himſelf; God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or even as this Publican."</p>
            <p>Our Lord firſt takes notice of his poſture; the Phariſee ſtood, he is not to be condemned for that; for ſtanding, as well as kneeling, is a proper poſture for prayer. When you ſtand praying, ſays our Lord; though ſometimes our Lord kneeled, nay, lay ſlat on his face upon the ground; his apoſtles alſo kneeled, as we read in the Acts, which has made me wonder at ſome, who are ſo bigotted to ſtanding in family as well as public prayer, that they will not kneel, notwithſtanding all kneel that are around them. I fear there is ſomething of the Phariſee in this conduct. Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtanding are indifferent, if the knee of the ſoul be bent, and the heart upright towards God. We ſhould ſtudy not to be particular in indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent things, leſt we offend weak minds. What the Phariſee is remarked for, is his ſtanding by himſelf: For the words may be rendered, he ſtood by himſelf, upon ſome eminent place, at the upper part of the temple, near the holy of holies, that the congregation might ſee what a devout man he was: Or it may be underſtood as we read it, he prayed by himſelf or of himſelf out of his own heart; he did not pray by form; it was an extempore prayer: For there are many Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees that pray and preach too extempore. I do not ſee why theſe may not be acquired, as well as other arts and ſciences. A man, with a good elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, ready turn of thought, and good memory,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029886_0145_0FE2C12EC8879800"/>
may repeat his own or other men's ſermons, and by the help of a Wilkins or Henry, may pray ſeemingly excellently well, and yet not have the leaſt grain of true grace in his heart; and I ſpeak this, not to cry down extempore prayer, or to diſcourage thoſe dear ſouls who really pray by the Spirit; I only would hereby give a word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to thoſe who are ſo bigotted to extempore prayer, that they condemn, at leaſt judge, all that uſe forms, as though not ſo holy and heavenly, as others who pray without them. Alas! this is wrong. Not every one that prays extempore is a ſpiritual, nor every one that prays with a form, a formal man. Let us not judge one another; let not him that uſes a form, judge him that prays extempore, on that account; and let not him that prays extempore, deſpiſe him who uſes a form.—"The Phariſee ſtood, and prayed thus by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf." Which may ſignify alſo praying inwardly in his heart; for there is a way (and that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent one too) of praying when we cannot ſpeak: thus Anna prayed when ſhe ſpoke not aloud, only her lips moved. Thus God ſays to Moſes, "Why crieſt thou?" when it is plain, he did not ſpeak a word. This is what the apoſtle means by the "Spirit making interceſſion (for believers) with groanings which cannot be uttered." For there are times when the ſoul is too big to ſpeak; when God fills as it were, and overſhadows it with his preſence, ſo that it can only fall down, worſhip, adore, and lie in the duſt before the Lord. Again, there is a time when the ſoul is benumbed, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and dry, and the believer has not a word to ſay to his heavenly Father; and then the heart only can ſpeak. And I mention this for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of weak Chriſtians, who think they nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029886_0146_0FE2C1BFD8168100"/>
are accepted but when they have a flow of words, and fancy they do not pleaſe God at the bottom, for no other reaſon but becauſe they do not pleaſe themſelves. Such would do well to conſider, that God knows the language of the heart, and the mind of the ſpirit; and that we make uſe of words, not to inform God, but to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ourſelves. Whenever therefore any of you find yourſelves in ſuch a frame, be not diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: offer yourſelves up in ſilence before God, as clay in the hands of the potter, for him to write and ſtamp his own divine image upon your ſouls. But I believe the Phariſee knew nothing of this way of prayer: he was ſelf-righteous, a ſtranger to the divine life; and therefore either of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer explanations may be beſt put upon theſe words. "He ſtood, and prayed thus with himſelf; God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican." Here is ſome appearance of devotion, but it is only in appearance. To thank God, that we are not extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, and as wicked in our practices, as other men are, is certainly meet, right, and our bounden duty: for whatever degrees of goodneſs there may be in us, more than in others, it is owing to God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining, preventing and aſſiſting grace. We are all equally conceived and born in ſin all are fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſhort of the glory of God, and liable to all the curſes and maledictions of the law; ſo that he that glorieth, muſt glory only in the Lord. For none of us have any thing which he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and whatever we have received, we did not in the leaſt merit it, nor could we lay the leaſt claim to it on any account whatever: we are wholly indebted to free grace for all. Had the
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:029886_0147_0FE2C136069A0488"/>
Phariſee thought thus, when he ſaid, "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are," it would have been an excellent introduction to his prayer: but he was a free-willer, as well as ſelf-righteous (for he that is the one muſt be the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) and thought by his own power and ſtrength he had kept himſelf from theſe vices. And yet I do not ſee what reaſon he had to truſt in himſelf that he was righteous, merely becauſe he was not an extortioner, unjuſt, adulterer; for all this while he might be, as he certainly was (as is alſo every ſelf-righteous perſon) as proud as the devil. But he not only boaſts, but lies before God (as all ſelf-juſticiaries will be found liars here or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.) He thanks God that he was not unjuſt: but is it not an act of the higheſt injuſtice to rob God of his prerogative? Is it not an act of injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to judge our neighbour? And yet of both theſe crimes this ſelf-righteous vaunter is guilty. "Even as this Publican!" He ſeems to ſpeak with the utmoſt diſdain; <hi>this Publican</hi> Perhaps he pointed at the poor man, that others might treat him with the like contempt. Thou proud, confident boaſter, what hadſt thou to do with that poor Publican? Suppoſing other Publicans were unjuſt and extortioners, did it therefore follow that he muſt be ſo? Or, if he had been ſuch a ſinner, how knoweſt thou but he has repented of thoſe ſins? His coming up to the temple to pray, is one good ſign of a reformation at leaſt. Thou art therefore inexcuſable, O Phariſee, who thus judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the Publican; for thou that judgeſt him to be unjuſt, art, in the very act of judging, unjuſt thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: thy ſacrifice is only the ſacrifice of a fool.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen what the Phariſee's negative goodneſs comes to; I think, nothing at all. Let
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:029886_0148_0FE2C1C8667640A0"/>
us now ſee how far his poſitive goodneſs extends; for, if we are truly religious, we ſhall not eſchew evil, but alſo do good: "I faſt twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs."</p>
            <p>The Phariſee is not here condemned for his faſting, for faſting is a Chriſtian duty; "when you faſt," ſays our Lord, thereby taking it for granted, that his diſciples would faſt. And "when the bridegroom ſhall be taken away, then ſhall they faſt in thoſe days." In faſting often, ſays the apoſtle. And all that would not be caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways, will take care, as their privilege, without legal conſtraint, to "keep their bodies under, and bring them into ſubjection." The Phariſee is only condemned for making a righteouſneſs of his faſting, and thinking that God would accept him, or that he was any better than his neighbours, merely on account of his faſting: this is what he was blamed for. The Phariſee was not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended for faſting twice in a week; I wiſh ſome Chriſtians would imitate him more in this: but to depend on faſting in the leaſt, for his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the fight of God, was really abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. "I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs:" He might as well have ſaid, I pay tithes. But ſelf-righteous people (whatever they may ſay to the contrary) think they give ſomething to God. I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs: I make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of giving tithes, not only of all that the law requires, but of my mint, anniſe, and cummin, of all things whatever I poſſeſs; this was well; but to boaſt of ſuch things, or of faſting, is Phariſaical and deviliſh. Now then let us ſum up all the righteouſneſs of this boaſting Phariſee, and ſee what little reaſon he had to truſt in himſelf, that he was righteous, or to deſpiſe others. He is not
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029886_0149_0FE2C13AD7275670"/>
unjuſt (but we have only his word for that, I think I have proved the contrary;) he is no adulterer, no extortioner; he faſts twice in the week, and gives tithes of all that he poſſeſſes; and all this he might do, and a great deal more, and yet be a child of the devil: for here is no mention made of his loving the Lord his God with all his heart, which was the "firſt and great commandment of the law;" here is not a ſingle ſyllable of inward religion; and he was not a true Jew, who was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one outwardly. It is only an outſide piety at the beſt; inwardly he is full of pride, ſelf-juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, free-will, and great uncharitableneſs.</p>
            <p>Were not the Phariſees, do you think, highly offended at this character? For they might eaſily know that it was ſpoken againſt them. And though perhaps ſome of you may be offended at me, yet, out of love, I muſt tell you, I fear this parable is ſpoken againſt many of you: For are there not many of you, who go up to the temple to pray, with no better ſpirit than this Phariſee did? And becauſe you faſt, it may be in the Lent, or every Friday, and becauſe you do nobody any harm, receive the ſacrament, pay tithes, give an alms now and then, you think that you are ſafe, and truſt in yourſelves that you are righteous, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpiſe thoſe, who do not come up to you in theſe outward duties? This I am perſuaded is the caſe of many of you, although alas! it is a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate one, as I ſhall endeavour to ſhew at the cloſe of this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Let us now take a view of the Publican, verſe 13. "And the Publican ſtanding afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his eyes unto heaven, but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying, God be merciful to me a ſinner."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="unknown:029886_0150_0FE2C1CD087ABEF0"/>
The "Publican ſtanding afar off:" Perhaps in the outward court of the temple, conſcious to himſelf that he was not worthy to approach the holy of holies; ſo conſcious, and ſo weighed down with a ſenſe of his own unworthineſs, that he would not ſo much as lift up his eyes unto heaven, which he knew was God's throne. Poor heart! what did he feel at this time! None but returning Publicans, like himſelf can tell. Methinks I ſee him ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afar off, penſive, oppreſſed, and even over whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſorrow; ſometimes he attempts to look up; but then, thinks he, the heavens are unclean in God's ſight, and the very angels are charged with folly; how then ſhall ſuch a wretch as I, dare to lift up my guilty head! And to ſhew that his heart was full of holy ſelf-reſentment, and that he ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed after a godly ſort, he ſmote upon his breaſt; the word in the original implies, that he ſtruck hard upon his breaſt; he will lay the blame upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>one but his own wicked heart. He will not, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled Adam, tacitly lay the fault of his vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon God, and ſay, the "paſſions which thou gaveſt me, they deceived me, and I ſinned:" he is too penitent thus to reproach his Maker: he ſmites upon his breaſt, his treacherous, ungrateful, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed breaſt; a breaſt now ready to burſt: and at length, out of the abundance of his heart, I doubt not with many tears, he at laſt cries out, "God be merciful to me a ſinner." Not, God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to yonder proud Phariſee: he found enough in himſelf to vent his reſentment againſt, without looking abroad upon others. Not, God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to me a ſaint; for he knew all his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were but filthy rags. Not, God be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſuch or ſuch a one; but, God be merciful to me, even to me a ſinner, a ſinner by birth, a
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029886_0151_0FE2C1410ADDC8B8"/>
ſinner in thought, word, and deed; a ſinner as to my perſon, a ſinner as to all my performances; a ſinner in whom is no health, in whom dwelleth no good thing; a ſinner, poor, miſerable, blind, and naked, from the crown of the head to the ſole of the feet, full of wounds, and bruiſes, and putrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſores; a ſelf-accuſed, ſelf-condemned ſinner. What think you? would this Publican have been offended if any miniſter had told him that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be damned? would he have been angry, if any one had told him, that by nature he was half a devil and half a beaſt? No: he would have confeſſed a thouſand hells to have been his due, and that he was an earthly, deviliſh ſinner. He felt now what a dreadful thing it was to depart from the living God: he felt that he was inexcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able every way; that he could in no wiſe, upon account of any thing in himſelf, be juſtified in the ſight of God; and therefore lays himſelf at the feet of ſovereign mercy, "God be merciful to me a ſinner." Here is no confidence in the fleſh, no plea fetched from faſting, paying tithes, or the performance of any other duty; here is no boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was not an extortioner, unjuſt, or an adulterer. Perhaps he had been guilty of all theſe crimes, at leaſt he knew he would have been guilty of all theſe, had he been left to follow the devices and deſires of his own heart; and therefore, with a broken and contrite ſpirit, he cries out, "God be merciful to me a ſinner."</p>
            <p>This man came up to the temple to pray, and he prayed indeed. And a broken and contrite heart God will not deſpiſe. I tell you, ſays our Lord, I who lay in the boſom of the Father from all eternity; I who am God, and therefore know all things; I who can neither deceive, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:029886_0152_0FE2C1D4574F54B8"/>
whoſe judgment is according to right; I tell you, whatever you may think of it, or of me for telling you ſo, this man, this Publican, this deſpiſed, ſinful, but broken-hearted man, went down to his houſe juſtified (acquitted, and looked upon as righteous in the ſight of God) rather than the other.</p>
            <p>Let Phariſees take heed that they do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert this text; for when it is ſaid, "this man went down to his houſe juſtified rather than the other," our Lord does not mean that both were juſtified, and that the Publican had rather more juſtification than the Phariſee: but it implies, either that the Publican was actually juſtified, but the Phariſee was not; or, that the Publican was in a better way to receive juſtification, than the Phariſee; according to our Lord's ſaying, "the Publicans and harlots enter into the kingdom of heaven before you." That the Phariſee was not juſtified is certain, for God reſiſteth the proud; and that the Publican was at this time actually juſtified (and perhaps went home with a ſenſe of it in his heart) we have great reaſon to infer from the latter part of the text, "For every one that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed, and he that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf ſhall be exalted."</p>
            <p>The parable therefore now ſpeaks to all who hear me this day: for that our Lord intended it for our learning, is evident, from his making ſuch a general application; "for every one that exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf ſhall be abaſed, and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted."</p>
            <p>The parable of the Publican and Phariſee, is but as it were a glaſs, wherein we may ſee the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſpoſition of all mankind; for all mankind
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:029886_0153_0FE2C146C48086E0"/>
may be divided into two general claſſes. Either they truſt wholly in themſelves, or in part, that they are righteous, and then they are Phariſees; or they have no confidence in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, are ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned ſinners, and then they come under the character of the Publican juſt now deſcribed. And we may add alſo, that the different reception theſe men met with, points out to us in lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, the different treatment the ſelf-juſticiary and ſelf-condemned criminal will meet with at the terrible day of judgment; "Every one that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts himſelf ſhall be abaſed, but he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted."</p>
            <p>Every one, without exception, young or old, high or low, rich or poor (for God is no reſpecter of perſons) every one, whoſoever he be, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himſelf, and not free grace; every one that truſteth in himſelf that he is righteous, that reſts in his duties; or thinks to join them with the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, for juſtification in the ſight of God, though he be no adulterer, no extortioner, though he be not outwardly unjuſt, nay, though he laſt twice in the week, and gives tithes of all that he poſſeſſes; yet ſhall he be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſight of all good men who know him here, and before men and angels, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when Jeſus Chriſt comes to appear in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereafter. How low, none but the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God can tell. He ſhall be abaſed to live with devils, and make his abode in the loweſt hell for evermore.</p>
            <p>Hear this, all ye ſelf-juſticiaries, tremble, and behold your doom! a dreadful doom, more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than words can expreſs, or thought conceive! If you refuſe to humble yourſelves, after hearing this parable, I call heaven and earth to witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

you this day, that God ſhall viſit you with all his ſtorms, and pour all the vials of his wrath upon your rebellious heads; you exalted your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here, and God ſhall abaſe you hereafter; you are as proud as the devil, and with devils ſhall you dwell to all eternity. Be not deceived, God is not mocked; he ſees your hearts, he knows all things. And notwithſtanding you may come up to the temple to pray, your prayers are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, and you go down to your houſes unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it you are ſelf juſticiaries; and do you know what it is to be unjuſtified? Why, if you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified, the wrath of God abideth upon you; you are in your blood; all the curſes of the law belong to you: Curſed are you when you go out, curſed are you when you come in; curſed are your thoughts, curſed are your words, curſed are your deeds; every thing you do, ſay, or think from morning to night, is only one continued ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſin.

Humble yourſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God: Pull down every ſelf-righteous thought, and every proud imagination that now exalteth itſelf againſt the perfect, perſonal, imputed righteouſneſs of the dear Lord Jeſus: For he (and he alone) that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</p>
            <p>He that humbleth himſelf, whatever he be; if, inſtead of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

nay, notwithſtanding the ſins of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind center and unite in him; yet, if through grace, like the Publican, he is enabled to humble himſelf, he ſhall be exalted; not in a temporal manner; for Chriſtians muſt rather expect to be abaſed, and to have their names caſt out as evil and to lay down their lives for Chriſt Jeſus in this world: But he ſhall be exalted in a ſpiritual ſenſe; he ſhall be freely juſtified from all his ſins by the blood of Jeſus; he ſhall have peace with God, a peace which paſſeth all underſtanding; not only peace, but joy in believing; he ſhall be tranſlated from the kingdom of Satan, to the kingdom of God's dear Son: He ſhall dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him: He ſhall be one with Chriſt, and Chriſt one with him: He ſhall drink of divine pleaſures as out of a river: He ſhall be ſanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in ſpirit, ſoul, and body; in one word, he ſhall be filled with all the fulneſs of God. Thus ſhall the man who humbleth himſelf be exalted here; but O how high ſhall he be exalted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after! as high as the higheſt heavens, even to the righthand of God: There he ſhall ſit, happy both in ſoul and body, and judge angels; high, out of the reach of all ſin and trouble, eternally ſecure from all danger of falling. O ſinners, did you but know how highly God intends to exalt thoſe who humble themſelves, and believe in Jeſus, ſurely you would humble yourſelves, at leaſt beg of God to humble you; for it is he that muſt ſtrike the rock of your hearts, and cauſe floods of contrite tears to flow therefrom. And O, that God would give this ſermon ſuch a commiſſion, as he once gave the rod of Moſes! I would ſtrike you through and through with the rod of his word, till each of you was brought to cry out with the poor
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:029886_0156_0FE2C271EA4F7B60"/>
Publican, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> What pleaſant language would this be in the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth! Are there no ſinners among you? What, are you all Phariſees? Surely you cannot bear the thoughts of returning home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified, can you? What if a fit of the apoplexy ſhould ſeize you, and your ſouls be hurried away before the awful Judge of quick and dead? What will you do without Chriſt's righteouſneſs? If you go out of the world unjuſtified, you muſt remain ſo for ever. O, that you would humble yourſelves, then would the Lord exalt you: It may be, that whilſt I am ſpeaking, the Lord might juſtify you freely by his grace. I obſerved, that perhaps the Publican had a ſenſe of his juſtification before he went from the temple, and knew that his pardon was ſealed in heaven; and who knows but you may be thus exalted before you go home, if you humble yourſelves? O, what peace, love, and joy, would you then feel in your hearts! You would have a heaven upon earth. O, that I could bear any of you ſay (as I once heard a poor ſinner, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my preaching cry out) "He is come, he is come!" How would you then, like him, extol a precious, a free-hearted Chriſt! How would you magnify him for being ſuch a friend to Publicans and ſinners? Greater love can no man ſhew, than to lay down his life for a friend; but Chriſt laid down his life for his enemies, even for you, if you are enabled to humble yourſelves, as the Publican did. Sinners, I know not how to leave off talking with you; I would fill my mouth with arguments, I would plead with you. Come, let us reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; though your ſins be as ſcarlet, yet if you humble yourſelves, they ſhall be as white as ſnow.

One act of true faith in Chriſt juſtifies you for ever and ever; he has not promiſed you what he cannot perform; he is able to exalt you: For God hath exalted, and given him a name above every name, that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhall bow; nay, God hath exalted him to be not only a Prince, but a Saviour. May he be a Saviour to you! and then I ſhall have reaſon to rejoice in the day of judgment, that I have not preached in vain, nor laboured in vain.</p>

            <p>THESE words contain part of a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which the bleſſed Jeſus was pleaſed to make to his weeping and ſorrowful diſciples. The time was now drawing near, in which the Son of man was firſt to be lifted upon the croſs, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to heaven. Kind, wondrous kind! had this merciful High-prieſt been to his diſciples, during the time of his tabernacling amongſt them. He had compaſſion on their infirmities, anſwered for them when aſſaulted by their enemies, and fet them right when out of the way, either in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or practice. He neither called nor uſed them as ſervants, but as friends; and he revealed his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to them from time to time. He opened their underſtandings, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> underſtand the ſcriptures; explained to them the hidden myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the kingdom of God, when he ſpoke to others in parables: Nay, he became the ſervant of them all, and even condeſcended to waſh their feet. The thoughts of parting with ſo dear and
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:029886_0159_0FE2C1E9DD61F900"/>
loving a maſter as this, eſpecially for a long ſeaſon, muſt needs affect them much. When on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain occaſion he intended to be abſent from them only for a night; we are told, he was obliged to conſtrain them to leave him; no wonder then, that when he now informed them he muſt entirely go away, and that the Phariſees in his abſence would put them out of their ſynagogues, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them; yea, that the time ſhould come, that whoſoever killed them, would think they did God ſervice (a prophecy, one would imagine, in an eſpecial manner deſigned for the ſuffering miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this generation;) no wonder, I ſay, conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering all this that we are told, ver. 6. Sorrow had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> their hearts: "Becauſe I have ſaid theſe things unto you, ſorrow hath filled your hearts." The expreſſion is very emphatical; their hearts were ſo full of concern; that they were ready to burſt. In order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore, to reconcile them to this mournful diſpenſation our dear and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Redeemer ſhews them the neceſſity he lay under to leave them; "Nevertheleſs I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away:" As though he had ſaid, Think not, my dear diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that I leave you out of anger: No, it is for your ſakes, for your profit that I go away: For if I go not away, if I die not upon the croſs for your ſins, and riſe again for your juſtification, and aſcend into heaven to make interceſſion, and plead my merits before my Father's throne, the Comforter, the Holy Ghoſt, will not, cannot come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you. And, that they might know what he was to do, "When he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin, and of righteouſneſs, and of judgment."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="unknown:029886_0160_0FE2C27EF8352518"/>
The perſon referred to in the words of the text, is plainly the Comforter, the Holy Ghoſt; and the promiſe was firſt made to our Lord's apoſtles. But though it was primarily made to them, and was literally and remarkably fulfilled at the day of Pentecoſt, when the Holy Ghoſt came down as a mighty ruſhing wind, and alſo when three thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and were pricked to the heart by Peter's preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet, as the apoſtles were the repreſentatives of the whole body of believers, we muſt infer, that this promiſe muſt be looked upon as ſpoken to us, and to our children, and to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</p>
            <p>My deſign from theſe words, is to ſhew the manner in which the Holy Ghoſt generally works upon the hearts of thoſe, who, through grace, are made veſſels of mercy, and tranſlated from the kingdom of darkneſs, into the kingdom of God's dear Son.</p>
            <p>I ſay, generally: for as God is a ſovereign agent, his ſacred Spirit bloweth not only on whom, out when and how it liſteth. Therefore, far he it from me to confine the Almighty to one way of acting: or ſay, that all undergo an equal degree of conviction; no, there is a holy variety in God's methods of calling home his elect. But this we may affirm aſſuredly, that, wherever there is a work of true conviction and converſion wrought upon a ſinner's heart, the Holy Ghoſt, whether by a greater or leſs degree of inward ſoul-trouble, does that which our Lord Jeſus told the diſciples, in the words of the text, that he ſhould do when he came.</p>
            <p>If any of you ridicule inward religion, or think there is no ſuch thing as our feeling or receiving the Holy Ghoſt, I fear my preaching will be quite
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029886_0161_0FE2C1EE944C0F68"/>
fooliſhneſs to you, and that you will underſtand me no more than if I ſpoke to you in an unknown tongue. But as the promiſe in the text is made to the world, and as I know it will be fulfilling till time ſhall be no more, I ſhall proceed to explain the general way whereby the Holy Ghoſt works upon every converted ſinner's heart; and I hope that the Lord, even whilſt I am ſpeaking, will be pleaſed to fulfil it in many of your hearts. "And when he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment."</p>
            <p>The word which we tranſlate reprove, ought to be rendered convince; and in the original it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es a conviction by way of argumentation, and coming with a power upon the mind equal to a demonſtration. A great many ſcoffers of theſe laſt days, will aſk ſuch as they term pretenders to the Spirit, how they feel the Spirit, and how they know the Spirit? They might as well aſk, how they know, and how they feel the ſun when it ſhines upon the body? For with equal power and demonſtration does the Spirit of God work upon and convince the ſoul. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It convinces of ſin; and generally of ſome enormous ſin, the worſt perhaps the convicted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ever was guilty of. Thus, when our Lord was converſing with the woman of Samaria, he convinced her firſt of her adultery: "Woman, go call thy huſband. The woman anſwered, and ſaid, I have no huſband. Jeſus ſaid unto her, Thou haſt well ſaid, I have no huſband: for thou haſt had five huſbands, and he whom thou now haſt, is not thy huſband; in this ſaidſt thou truly." With this, there went ſuch a powerful conviction of all her other actual ſins, that ſoon after, ſhe "left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:029886_0162_0FE2C2863905AFD0"/>
ſaith to the men, Come, and ſee a man that told me all things that ever I did: Is not this the Chriſt?" Thus our Lord alſo dealt with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor Saul: he convinced him firſt of the horrid ſin of perſecution; "Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?" Such a ſenſe of all his other ſins, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably at the ſame time revived in his mind, that immediately he died; that is, died to all his falſe confidences, and was thrown into ſuch an agony of ſoul, that he continued three days, and neither did eat nor drink. This is the method the Spirit of God generally takes in dealing with ſinners; he firſt convinces them of ſome heinous actual ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and at the ſame time brings all their other ſins into remembrance, and as it were ſets them in battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>array before them: "When he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin."</p>
            <p>And was it ever thus with you, my dear hearers? (For I muſt queſtion you as I go along<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe I intend, by the divine help, to preach not only to your heads, but your hearts.) Did the Spirit of God ever bring all your ſins thus to remembrance, and make you cry out to God, "thou writeſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things againſt me?" Did your actual ſins ever appear before you, as though drawn in a map? If not, you have great reaſon (unle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> you were ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the womb) to ſuſpect th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> you are not convicted, much more not converted, and that the promiſe of the text was never yet fulfilled in your hearts.</p>
            <p>Farther: When the Comforter comes into a ſinner's heart, though it generally convinces the ſinner of his actual ſin firſt, yet it leads him to ſee and bewail his original ſin, the fountain from which all theſe polluted ſtreams do flow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="unknown:029886_0163_0FE2C1F6D3450390"/>
Though every thing in the earth, air and water; every thing both without and within, concur to prove the truth of that aſſertion in the ſcripture, "in Adam we all have died;" yet moſt are ſo hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they may give an aſſent to the truth of the propoſition in their heads, yet they never felt it really in their hearts. Nay, ſome in words profeſſedly deny it, though their works, too, too plainly prove them to be degenerate ſons of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate father. But when the Comforter, the Spirit of God arreſts a ſinner, and convinces him of ſin, all carnal reaſoning againſt original corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every proud and high imagination, which exalteth itſelf againſt that doctrine, is immediately thrown down; and he is made to cry out, "Who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?" He now finds that concupiſence is ſin; and does not ſo much bewail his actual ſins, as the inward perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart, which he now finds not only to be an enemy to, but alſo direct enmity againſt God.</p>
            <p>And did the Comforter, my dear friends, ever come with ſuch a convincing power as this into your hearts? Were you ever made to ſee and feel, that in your fleſh dwelleth no good thing; that you are conceived and born in ſin; that you are by nature children of wrath; that God would be juſt if he damned you, though you never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an actual ſin in your lives? So often as you have been at church and ſacrament, did you ever feelingly confeſs, that there was no health in you; that the remembrance of your original and actual ſins was grievous unto you, and the burden of them intolerable? If not, you have been only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to God vain oblations; you never yet pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your lives, the Comforter never yet came ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:029886_0164_0FE2C28AF44D9660"/>
into your ſouls; conſequently you are not in the faith properly ſo called; no, you are at preſent in a ſtate of death and damnation.</p>
            <p>Again, the Comforter, when he comes effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to work upon a ſinner, not only convinces him of the ſin of his nature, and the ſin of his life, but alſo of the ſin of his duties.</p>
            <p>We all naturally are legaliſts, thinking to be juſtified by the works of the law. When ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what awakened by the terrors of the Lord, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, like the Phariſees of old, go about to eſtabliſh our own righteouſneſs, and think we ſhall, find acceptance with God, if we ſeek it with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ears; finding ourſelves damned by nature and our actual ſins, we then think to recommend ourſelves to God by our duties, and hope, by our doings of one kind or another, to inherit eternal life. But, whenever the Comforter comes into the heart, it convinces the ſoul of theſe falſe reſts, and makes the ſinner to ſee that all his righteouſneſſes are but as filthy rags; that his beſt works are but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſplendid ſins; and that, for the moſt pompous ſervices, he deſerves no better doom than that of the unprofitable ſervant, to be thrown into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er darkneſs, where is weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
            <p>And was this degree of conviction ever wrought in any of your ſouls? Did the Comforter ever come into your hearts, ſo as to make you ſick of your duties, as well as your ſins? Were you ever, with the great apoſtle of the Gentiles, made to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor your own righteouſneſs which is by the law, and acknowledge that you deſerve to be damned, though you ſhould give all your goods to ſeed the poor? Were you made to feel, that your very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance needed to be repented of, and that every
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:029886_0165_0FE2C1FBB3F8A448"/>
thing in yourſelves is but dung and droſs? And that all the arguments you can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etch for mercy, muſt be out of the heart and pure unmerited love of God? Were you ever made to lie at the feet of ſovereign grace, and to ſay, Lord if thou wilt, thou may'ſt ſave me; if not, thou may'ſt juſtly damn me; I have nothing to plead, I can in no wiſe juſtify myſelf in thy ſight; my beſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, I ſee will condemn me; and all I have to depend upon is thy free grace? What ſay you? Was this ever, or is this now, the habitual language of your hearts? You have been frequently at the temple; but did you ever approach it in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the poor publican; and, after you have done all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> acknowledge that you have done nothing; and upon a feeling experimental ſenſe of your own unworthineſs and ſinfulneſs every way, ſmite upon your breaſts, and ſay, "God be merciful to us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?" If you never were thus minded, the Comforter never yet effectually came into your ſouls, you are out of Chriſt; and if God ſhould require your ſouls in that condition, he would be no better to you than a conſuming ſire.</p>
            <p>But there is a fourth ſin, of which the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when he comes convinces the ſoul, and which alone (it is very remarkable) our Lord mentions as though it was the only ſin worth mentioning; for indeed it is the root of all other ſins whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: It is the reigning as well as the damning ſin of the world. And what now do you imagine that ſin may be? It is that curſed ſin, that root of all other evils, I mean the ſin of unbelief. "Of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me."</p>
            <p>But does the Chriſtian world, or any of you that hear me this day, want the Holy Ghoſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of unbelief? Are there any infidels
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:029886_0166_0FE2C29271F77930"/>
here? Yes (O that I had not too great reaſon to think ſo) I fear moſt are ſuch: Not indeed ſuch infidels as profeſſedly deny the Lord that bought us (though I fear too many even of ſuch monſters are in every country) but I mean ſuch unbelievers that have no more faith in Chriſt than the devils themſelves. Perhaps you may think you believe, becauſe you repeat the creed, or ſubſcribe to a confeſſion of faith; becauſe you go to church or meeting, receive the ſacrament, and are taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to full communion. Theſe are bleſſed privileges; but all this may be done without our being true believers. And I know not how to detect your falſe hypocritical faith better, than by putting to you this queſtion, How long have you believed? Would not moſt of you ſay, as long as we can remember, we never did diſbelieve. Then this is a certain ſign that you have no true faith at all: No, not ſo much as a grain of muſtard ſeed: For if you believe now (unleſs you were ſanctified from your infancy, which is the caſe of ſome) you muſt know that there was a time in which you did not believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the Holy Ghoſt, if ever you received it, convinced you of this. Eternal truth has declared, "when he is come he will convince the world of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me."</p>
            <p>None of us believe by nature: But after the Holy Ghoſt has convinced us of the ſin of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the ſin of our lives and duties, in order to convince us of our utter inability to ſave our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that we muſt be beholden to God, as for every thing elſe, ſo for faith (without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe, or be ſaved by Chriſt) he convinces us alſo that we have no faith. Doſt thou believe on the Son of God? is the grand queſtion
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:029886_0167_0FE2C2022D4D80F0"/>
which the Holy Ghoſt now puts to the ſoul: At the ſame time he works with ſuch power and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, that the ſoul ſees, and is obliged to confeſs, that it has no faith.</p>
            <p>This is a thing little thought of by moſt who call themſelves believers. They dream they are Chriſtians becauſe they live in a Chriſtian country: If they were born Turks, they would believe on Mahomet; for what is that which men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call faith, but an outward conſent to the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed religion? But do not you thus deceive your ownſelves; true faith is quite another thing. Aſk yourſelves, therefore, whether or not the Holy Ghoſt ever powerfully convinced you of the ſin of unbelief? You are perhaps ſo devout (you may imagine) as to get a catalogue of ſins, which you look over, and confeſs in a formal manner, as often as you go to the holy ſacrament: But among all your ſins, did you ever once confeſs and bewail that damning ſin of unbelief? Were you ever made to cry out, Lord, give me faith; Lord, give me to believe on thee; O that I had faith! O that I could believe! If you never were thus diſtreſſed, at leaſt, if you never ſaw and felt, that you had no faith, it is a certain ſign that the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter, never came into and worked ſavingly upon your ſouls.</p>
            <p>But is it not odd, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be called a Comforter, when it is plain, by the experience of all God's children, that this work of conviction is uſually attended with ſore inward conflicts, and a great deal of ſoul-trouble? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the Holy Ghoſt may well be termed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, even in this work; becauſe it is the only way to, and ends in, true ſolid comfort. Bleſſed are they that are thus convicted by him; for they
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:029886_0168_0FE2C297C8A954B8"/>
ſhall be comforted. Nay, not only ſo, but there is preſent comfort, even in the midſt of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions: The ſoul ſecretly rejoices in the ſight of its own miſery, bleſſes God for bringing it out of darkneſs into light, and looks forward with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable proſpect of future deliverances, knowing, that 'though ſorrow may endure for a night, joy will come in the morning."</p>
            <p>Thus it is that the Holy Ghoſt convinces the ſoul of ſin. And, if ſo, how wretchedly are they miſtaken, that blend the light of the Spirit with the light of conſcience, as all ſuch do, who ſay, that Chriſt lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and that light, if improved, will bring us to Jeſus Chriſt? If ſuch doctrine be true, the promiſe in the text was needleſs: Our Lord's apoſtles had already that light; the world hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be convinced, had that light; and, if that was ſufficient to bring them to Chriſt, why was it expedient that Chriſt ſhould go away to heaven, to ſend down the Holy Ghoſt to do this for them? Alas! all have not this Spirit: It is the ſpecial gift of God, and, without this ſpecial gift, we can never come to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The light of conſcience will accuſe or convince us of any common ſin; but the light of natural conſcience never did, never will, and never can convince us of unbelief. If it could, how comes it to paſs, that not one of the heathens, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the light of nature in ſuch an eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, was ever convinced of unbelief? No, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience cannot effect this; it is the peculiar property of the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter: "When he is come, he will reprove (or convince) the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and judgment."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="unknown:029886_0169_0FE2C206DC6E7910"/>
We have heard how he convinces of ſin: We come now to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is the righteouſneſs, of which the Comforter convinces the world?</p>
            <p>By the word <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> in ſome places of ſcripture, we are to underſtand that common juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice which we ought to practice between man and man; as when Paul is ſaid to reaſon of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and righteouſneſs before a trembling Felix. But here (as in a multitude of other places in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ) we are to underſtand by the word righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, the active and paſſive obedience of the dear Lord Jeſus; even that perfect, perſonal, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient righteouſneſs, which he has wrought out for that world which the Spirit is to convince. "Of righteouſneſs (ſays our Lord) becauſe I go to the Father, and ye ſee me no more." This is one argument that the Holy Spirit makes uſe of to prove Chriſt's righteouſneſs, becauſe he is gone to the Father, and we ſee him no more. For had he not wrought out a ſufficient righteouſneſs, the Father would have ſent him back, as not having done what he undertook; and we ſhould have ſeen him again.</p>
            <p>O the righteouſneſs of Chriſt! It ſo comforts my ſoul, that I muſt be excuſed if I mention it in almoſt all my diſcourſes. I would not, if I could help it, have one ſermon without it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever infidels may object, or Arminians ſophiſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argue againſt an imputed righteouſneſs; yet whoever know themſelves and God, muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that "Jeſus Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs (and perfect juſtification in the ſight of God) to every one that believeth," and that we are to be made the righteouſneſs of God in him. This, and this only, a poor ſinner can
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:029886_0170_0FE2C29F91251578"/>
lay hold of, as a ſure anchor of his hope. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other ſcheme of ſalvation men may lay, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge I can ſee no other foundation whereon to build my hopes of ſalvation, but on the rock of Chriſt's perſonal righteouſneſs, imputed to my ſoul.</p>
            <p>Many, I believe, have a rational conviction of, and agree with me in this: But rational convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if reſted in, avail but little; it muſt be a ſpiritual, experimental conviction of the truth which is ſaving. And therefore our Lord ſays, when the Holy Ghoſt comes in the day of his power, it convinces of this righteouſneſs, of the reality, completeneſs and ſufficiency of it, to ſave a poor ſinner.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen how the Holy Ghoſt convinces the ſinner of the ſin of his nature, life, duties, and of the ſin of unbelief, and what then muſt the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do? He muſt, he muſt inevitably deſpair, if there be no hope but in himſelf. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit has hunted the ſinner out of all his falſe reſts and hiding-places, taken off the pitiful fig-leaves of his own works, and driven him out of the trees of the garden (his outward reformations) and placed him naked before the bar of a ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign, holy, juſt, and ſin-avenging God; then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it is, when the ſoul, having the ſentence of death within itſelf becauſe of unbelief, has a ſweet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of Chriſt's righteouſneſs made to it by the holy Spirit of God. Here it is, that he begins more immediately to act in the quality of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, and convinces the ſoul ſo powerfully of the reality and all-ſufficiency of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, that the ſoul is immediately ſet a hungering and thirſting after it. Now the ſinner begins to ſee, that though he has deſtroyed himſelf, yet in Chriſt

is his help; that, though he has no righteouſneſs of his own to recommend him, there is a fulneſs of grace, a fulneſs of truth, a fulneſs of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the dear Lord Jeſus, which, if once impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, would make him happy for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>None can tell, but thoſe happy ſouls who have experienced it, with what demonſtration of the Spirit this conviction comes. O how amiable, as well as all-ſufficient, does the bleſſed Jeſus now appear! With what new eyes does the ſoul now ſee the Lord its righteouſneſs! Brethren, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable. If you were never thus convinced of Chriſt's righteouſneſs in your own ſouls, though you may believe it doctrinally, it will avail you nothing; if the Comforter never came ſavingly into your ſouls, then you are comfortleſs indeed. But</p>
            <p>What will this righteouſneſs avail, if the ſoul has it not in poſſeſſion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The next thing therefore the Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when he comes, convinces the ſoul of, is judgment.</p>
            <p>By the word <hi>judgment</hi> I underſtand, that well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded peace, that ſettled judgment, which the ſoul forms of itſelf, when it is enabled by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to lay hold on Chriſt's righteouſneſs, which I believe it always does, when convinced in the manner before-mentioned. "Of judgment (ſays our Lord) becauſe the Prince of this world is judged;" the ſoul, being enabled to lay hold on Chriſt's perfect righteouſneſs by a lively faith, has a conviction wrought in it by the Holy Spirit, that the "Prince of this world is judged." The ſoul being now juſtified by faith, has peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and can trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:029886_0172_0FE2C2A441F25E08"/>
ſay, it is Chriſt that juſtifies me, who is he that condemns me? The ſtrong man armed is now caſt out; my ſoul is in a true peace; the Prince of this world will come and accuſe, but he has now no ſhare in me: The bleſſed Spirit which I have received, and whereby I am enabled to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Chriſt's righteouſneſs to my poor ſoul, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully convinces me of this: Why ſhould I fear? Or of what ſhall I be afraid, ſince God's Spirit witneſſes with my ſpirit, that I am a child of God? The Lord is aſcended up on high; he has led captivity captive; he has received the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter, that beſt of gifts for men: and that Comforter is come into my heart: he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that hath promiſed: I, even I am powerfully, rationally, ſpiritually convicted of ſin, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and judgment. By this I know the prince of this world is judged.</p>
            <p>Thus, I ſay, may we ſuppoſe that ſoul to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, in which the promiſe of the text is happily fulfilled. And though, at the beginning of this diſcourſe, I ſaid, moſt had never experienced any thing of this, and that therefore this preaching muſt be fooliſhneſs to ſuch; yet I doubt not but there are ſome few happy ſouls, who, through grace, have been enabled to follow me ſtep by ſtep and notwithſtanding the Holy Ghoſt might not directly work in the ſame order as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and perhaps they cannot exactly ſay the time when, yet they have a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now what ſhall I ſay to you? O thank God, thank the Lord Jeſus, thank the ever bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Trinity, for this unſpeakable gift: For you would never have been thus highly favoured, had not he who firſt ſpoke darkneſs into light, loved you with an everlaſting love, and enlightened you by his Holy Spirit, and that too, not on account of any good thing foreſeen in you, but for his own name's ſake.</p>
            <p>Be humble therefore, O believers be humble: Look to the rock from whence you have been hewn: Extol free grace; admire electing love, which alone has made you to differ from the reſt of your brethren. Has God brought you into light? Walk as becometh the children of light. Provoke not the Holy Spirit to depart from you: For though he hath ſealed you to the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and you know that the Prince of this world is judged; yet if you backſlide, grow luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, or forget your firſt love, the Lord will viſit your offences with the rod of affliction, and your ſin with ſpiritual ſcourges. Be not therefore high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but fear. Rejoice, but let it be with trembling. As the elect of God, put on, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbleneſs of mind, but bowels of compaſſion; and pray, O pray for your unconverted brethren!

Pray whilſt I am preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Lord may enable me to ſay, This day is the promiſe in the text fulfilled in ſome poor ſinners' hearts. Cry mightily to God, and with the cords of a holy violence, pull down bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on your neighbours' heads. Chriſt yet lives and reigns in heaven: The reſidue of the Spirit is yet in his hand, and a plentiful effuſion of it is promiſed in the latter days of the church. And O that the Holy Ghoſt, the bleſſed Comforter,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029886_0174_0FE2C2AD4C6D3E70"/>
would now come down, and convince thoſe that are Chriſt leſs among you, "of ſin, of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of judgment!" O that you were once made willing to be convinced!</p>
            <p>But perhaps you had rather be filled with wine than with the Spirit, and are daily chaſing that Holy Ghoſt from your ſouls. What ſhall I ſay for you to God? "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." What ſhall I ſay from God to you? Why?" that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf:" Therefore I beſeech you, as in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God. Do not go away contradicting and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming. I know Satan would have you begone. Many of you may be uneaſy, and are ready to cry out, "What a wearineſs is this!" But I will not let you go: I have wreſtled with God for my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in private, and I muſt wreſtle with you here in public. Though of myſelf I can do nothing, and you can no more by your own power come to and believe on Chriſt, than Lazarus could come forth from the grave; yet who knows but God may beget ſome of you again to a lively hope by this fooliſhneſs of preaching, and that you may be ſome of that world, which the Comforter is to convince "of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?" Poor Chriſt-leſs ſouls! do you know what a condition you are in? Why, you are lying in the wicked one, the devil; he rules in you, he walks and dwells in you, unleſs you dwell in Chriſt, and the Comforter is come into your hearts. And will you contentedly lie in that wicked one the devil? What wages will he give you? Eternal death. O that you would come to Chriſt! The free gift of God through him is eternal life. He will accept of you even now, if you will believe in

him. The Comforter may yet come into your hearts, even yours. All that are now his living temples, were once lying in the wicked one as well as you. This bleſſed gift, this Holy Ghoſt, the bleſſed Jeſus received even for the rebellious.</p>
            <p>I ſee many of you affected: But are your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions only a little wrought upon, or are your ſouls really touched with a lively ſenſe of the heinouſneſs of your ſins, your want of faith, and the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt? If ſo, I hope the Lord has been gracious, and that the Comforter is coming into your hearts. O do not ſtifle theſe convictions! Do not go away, and ſtraightway forget what manner of doctrine you have heard, and thereby ſhew that theſe are only common workings of a few tranſient convictions, floating upon the ſurface of your hearts. Beg of God that you may be ſincere (for he alone can make you ſo) and that you may indeed deſire the promiſe of the text to be fulfilled in your ſouls, Who knows but the Lord may be gracious? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you have no plea but ſovereign mercy; but for your encouragement alſo, remember it is the world, ſuch as you are, to whom the Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is to come, and whom he is to convince: Wait therefore at Wiſdom's gates. The bare probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of having a door of mercy opened, is enough to keep you ſtriving. Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, the chief of them: You know not but he came to ſave you. Do not go and quarrel with God's decrees, and ſay, if I am a reprobate, I ſhall be damned; if I am elected, I ſhall be ſaved; and therefore I will do nothing. What have you to do with God's decrees? Secret things belong to him; it is your buſineſs to give "all diligence to make your calling and election

ſure." If there are but few who find the way that leads to life, do you ſtrive to be ſome of them: You know not but you may be in the number of thoſe few, and that your ſtriving may be the means which God intends to bleſs, to give you an entrance in. If you do not act thus, you are not ſincere; and, if you do, who knows but you may find mercy? For though after you have done all that you can, God may juſtly cut you off, yet never was a ſingle perſon damned who did all that he could. Though therefore your hands are withered, ſtretch them out; though you are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent ſick, and lame, come lie at the pool. Who knows but by and by the Lord Jeſus may have compaſſion on you, and ſend the Comforter to convince you of ſin, righteouſneſs, and of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

My heart is touched with a ſenſe of your condition: May our merciful High-Prieſt now ſend down the Comforter and make you ſenſible of it alſo! O the love of Chriſt! It conſtrains me to beſeech you to come to him; what do you reject, if you reject Chriſt, the Lord of glory! Sinners, give the dear Redeemer a lodging in your ſouls. Do not be Bethſhemites; give Chriſt your hearts, your whole hearts. Indeed he is worthy. He made you and not you yourſelves. You are not your own; give Chriſt then your bodies and ſouls, which are his! Is it not enough to melt you down,

to think that the high and lofty One who inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth eternity, ſhould condeſcend to invite you by his miniſters? How ſoon can he frown you to hell? And how know you but he may this very inſtant, if you do not hear his voice? Did any yet harden their hearts againſt Chriſt, and proſper? Come then do not ſend me ſorrowful away: Do not let me have reaſon to cry out, O my leanneſs, my leanneſs! Do not let me go weeping into my cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and ſay, "Lord they will not believe my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; Lord, I have called them, and they will not anſwer; I am unto them as a very pleaſant ſong, and as one that plays upon a pleaſant inſtrument; but their hearts are running after the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh, and the pride of life." Would you be willing that I ſhould give ſuch an account of you, or make ſuch a prayer before God? And yet I muſt not only do ſo here, but appear in judgment againſt you hereafter, unleſs you will come to Chriſt. Once more therefore I intreat you to come. What objections have you to make? Behold, I ſtand here in the name of God, to anſwer all that you can offer. But I know no one can come, unleſs the Father draw him: I will therefore addreſs me to my God, and intercede with him to ſend the Comforter into your hearts.</p>

            <p>SALVATION, every where through the whole ſcripture, is ſaid to be the free gift of God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Not only free, becauſe God is a ſovereign agent and therefore may withhold it from, or confer it on, whom he pleaſeth; but free, becauſe there is nothing to be found in man, that can any way induce God to be merciful unto him. The righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is the ſole cauſe of our finding favour in God's ſight: This righteouſneſs apprehended by faith (which is alſo the gift of God) makes it our own; and this faith, if true, will work by love.</p>

them, might from thence infer the manner we muſt expect to be dealt with ourſelves, and learn in what way we muſt look for ſalvation, if we tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire to be made partakers of the inheritance with the ſaints in light.</p>
            <p>The converſion of the perſon referred to in the text, I think will be of no ſmall ſervice to us in this matter, if rightly improved, I would hope, moſt of you know who the perſon is, to whom the Lord Jeſus ſpeaks; it is the Publican Zaccheus, to whoſe houſe the bleſſed Jeſus ſaid, ſalvation came, and whom he pronounces a ſon of Abraham.</p>
            <p>It is my deſign (God helping) to make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon his converſion recorded at large in the preceding verſes, and then to inforce the latter part of the text, as an encouragement to poor undone ſinners to come to Jeſus Chriſt. "For the Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt."</p>
            <p>The evangeliſt Luke introduces the account of this man's converſion thus, ver. 1. "And Jeſus entered and paſſed through Jericho." The holy Jeſus made it his buſineſs to go about doing good. As the ſun in the firmament is continually ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his benign, quickening, and cheering influenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es over the natural; ſo the Son of Righteouſneſs aroſe with healing under his wings, and was daily and hourly diffuſing his gracious influences over the moral world. The preceeding chapter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us of a notable miracle wrought by the holy Jeſus on a poor blind Bartimeus; and in this, a greater preſents itſelf to our conſideration. The evangeliſt would have us take particular notice of it; for he introduces it with the word behold: "And behold, there was a man named Zaccheus,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029886_0181_0FE2C22BC6D41BA0"/>
who was the chief among the Publicans, and he was rich."</p>
            <p>Well might the evangeliſt uſher in the relation of this man's converſion with the word <hi>behold!</hi> For, according to human judgment, how many inſurmoutable obſtacles lay in the way of it! Surely no one will ſay there was any fitneſs in Zaccheus for ſalvation; for we are told that he was a Publican, and therefore in all probability a notorious ſinner. The Publicans were gatherers of the Roman taxes; they were infamous for their abominable extortion; their very name therefore became ſo odious, that we find the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees often reproached our Lord, as very wicked, becauſe he was a friend unto and ſat down to meat with them. Zaccheus then, being a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, was no doubt a ſinner; and, being chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Publicans, conſequently was chief among ſinners. Nay, he was rich. And one inſpired apoſtle has told us, that not many mighty, not many noble, are called. Another ſaith, "God has choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith." And he who was the Maker and the Redeemer of the apoſtles, aſſures us, "that it is eaſier for a camel (or cable-rope) to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God." Let not therefore the rich glory in the multitude of their riches.</p>
            <p>But rich as he was, we are told, verſe 3 that he ſought to ſee Jeſus." And that was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der indeed! The common people heard our Lord gladly, and the poor received the goſpel. The multitude, the very mob, the people that kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w not the law, as the proud high-prieſts called them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſed to follow him on foot into the country, and ſometimes ſtayed with him three days together to
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:029886_0182_0FE2C2C535F727B0"/>
hear him preach: But did the rich believe or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on him? No. Our Lord preached up the doctrine of the croſs; he preached too ſearching for them, and therefore they counted him their enemy, perſecuted and ſpoke all manner of evil againſt him falſely. Let not the miniſters of Chriſt marvel, if they meet with the like treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the rich men of this wicked and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous generation. I ſhould think it no ſcandal (ſuppoſing it true) to hear it affirmed, that none but the poor attended my miniſtry. Their ſouls are as precious to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the ſouls of the greateſt men. They were the poor that attended him in the days of his fleſh: Theſe are they whom he hath choſen to be rich in faith, and to be the greateſt in the kingdom of heaven. Were the rich in this world's goods generally to ſpeak well of me, woe be unto me; I ſhould think it a dreadful ſign that I was only a wolf in ſheep's cloathing, that I ſpoke peace, peace, when there was no peace and propheſied ſmoother things than the goſpel would allow of. Hear ye this, O ye rich. Let who will dare to do it, God forbid that I ſhould deſpiſe the poor; in doing ſo, I ſhould reproach my Maker. The poor are dear to my ſoul; I rejoice to ſee them fly to the doctrine of Chriſt, like the doves to their windows. I only pray that the poor who attend, may be evangel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized, and turned into the ſpirit of the goſpel: "If ſo, bleſſed are ye; for yours is the kingdom of heaven."</p>
            <p>But we muſt return to Zaccheus. He ſought to ſee Jeſus. This is good news. I heartily wiſh I could ſay, it was out of a good principle: But, without ſpeaking contrary to that charity which hopes and believeth all things for the beſt, we
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:029886_0183_0FE2C234919F98C0"/>
may ſay, that the ſame principle drew him after Chriſt, which now draws multitudes (to ſpeak plainly, it may be multitudes of you) to hear a particular preacher, even curioſity: For we are told, that he came not to hear his doctrine, but to view his perſon, or to uſe the words of the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, to ſee who he was. Our Lord's ſame was now ſpread abroad through all Jeruſalem, and all the country round about: Some ſaid he was a good man; others, nay, but he deceiveth the people. And therefore curioſity drew out this rich Publican Zaccheus to ſee who this perſon was, of whom he had heard ſuch various accounts. But it ſeems he could not conveniently get a ſight of him for the preſs, and becauſe he was little of ſtature. Alas! how many are kept from ſeeing Chriſt in glory, by reaſon of the preſs. I mean, how many are aſhamed of being ſingularly good, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> therefore follow a multitude to do evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have a preſs or throng of polite acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance!

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and are aſhamed to confeſs him before men. This baſe, this ſervile fear of man, is the bane of true Chriſtianity; it brings a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſnare upon the ſoul, and is the ruin of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: For I am fully perſuaded, numbers are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally convicted of goſpel truths; but not being able to brook contempt, they will not proſecute their convictions, nor reduce them to practice. Happy thoſe, who in this reſpect, at leaſt, like Zaccheus, reſolved to overcome all impediments that lie in their way to a ſight of Chriſt: For find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could not ſee Chriſt becauſe of the preſs, and the littleneſs of his natural ſtature, he did not ſmite upon his breaſt, and depart, ſaying, "It is
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:029886_0184_0FE2C2C9D692D6D0"/>
in vain to ſeek after a ſight of him any longer, I can never attain unto it." No, finding he could not ſee Chriſt, if he continued in the midſt of the preſs, "he ran before the multitude; and climbed up into a ſycamore tree, to ſee him; for he was to paſs that way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>
            <p>There <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eeing Chriſt in glory, unleſs we run before the multitude, and are willing to be in the number of thoſe deſpiſed few, who take the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God by violence. The broad way in which ſo many go, can never be that ſtraight and narrow way which leads to life. Our Lord's flock was, and always will be, comparatively a little one: And unleſs we dare to run before the multitude in a holy ſingularity, and can rejoice in being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted fools for Chriſt's ſake, we ſhall never ſee Jeſus with comfort, when he appears in glory. From mentioning the ſycamore-tree, and conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering the difficulty with which Zaccheus muſt climb it, we may farther learn, that thoſe who would ſee Chriſt, muſt undergo other difficulties and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, beſides contempt. Zaccheus, without doubt went through both. Did not many, think you, laugh at him as he ran along, and in the language of Michal, Saul's daughter, cry out, how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous did the rich Zacheus look to-day, when, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, the greatneſs of his ſtation, he ran before a pitiful, giddy mob, and climbed a ſycamore-tree, to ſee an enthuſiaſtic preacher! But Zaccheus cares not for all that; his curioſity was ſtrong: If he could but ſee who Jeſus was, he did not value what ſcoffers ſaid of him. Thus, and much more will it be with all thoſe who have an effectual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee Jeſus in heaven: They will go on from ſtrength to ſtrength, break through every difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lying in their way, and care not what men or
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:029886_0185_0FE2C239300073C0"/>
devils ſay of or do unto them. May the Lord make us all thus minded, for his dear Son's ſake!</p>
            <p>At length, after taking much pains, and going (as we may well ſuppoſe) through much contempt, Zaccheus has climbed the tree; and there he ſits, as he thinks, hid in the leaves of it, and watching when he ſhould ſee Jeſus paſs by: "For he was to paſs by that way."</p>
            <p>But ſing, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth! Praiſe magnify, and adore ſovereign, electing, free, preventing love; Jeſus the everlaſting God, the Prince of peace, who ſaw Nathaniel under the fig tree, and Zaccheus from eternity, now ſees him in the ſycamore-tree, and calls him in time.</p>
            <p>Ver, 5. "And when Jeſus came to the place, he looked up, and ſaw him, and ſaid unto him, Zaccheus, make haſte and come down; for this day I muſt abide at thy houſe." Amazing love! Well might Luke uſher in the account with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! It is worthy of our higheſt admiration. When Zaccheus thought of no ſuch thing, nay, thought that Chriſt Jeſus did not know him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Chriſt does what we never hear he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after, I mean, invite himſelf to the houſe of Zaccheus, ſaying, "Zaccheus make haſte and come down; for this day I muſt abide at thy houſe." Not pray let me abide, but I muſt abide this day at thy houſe. He alſo calls him by name, as though he was well acquainted with him: and indeed well he might; for his name was written in the book of life, he was one of thoſe whom the Father had given him from all eternity: therefore he muſt abide at his houſe that day. "For whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called."</p>
            <p>Here then, as through a glaſs, we may ſee the doctrine of free grace evidently exemplified before
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:029886_0186_0FE2C2D078232F70"/>
us. Here was no fitneſs in Zaccheus. He was a Publican, chief among the Publicans; not only ſo, but rich, and came to ſee Chriſt only out of curioſity: but ſovereign grace triumphs over all. And if we do God juſtice, and are effectually wrought upon, we muſt acknowledge there was no more fitneſs in us than in Zaccheus; and, had not Chriſt prevented us by his call, we had remained dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and alienated from the divine life, even as others. "Jeſus looked up, and ſaw him, and ſaid unto him, Zaccheus, make haſte and come down; for this day I muſt abide at thy houſe."</p>
            <p>With what different emotions of heart may we ſuppoſe Zaccheus received this invitation? Think you not that he was ſurpriſed to hear Jeſus Chriſt call him by name, and not only ſo, but invite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his houſe? Surely, thinks Zaccheus, I dream: it cannot be; how ſhould he know me? I never ſaw him before: beſides, I ſhall undergo much contempt, if I receive him under my roof. Thus, I ſay, we may ſuppoſe Zaccheus thought within himſelf. But what ſaith the ſcripture? "I will make a willing people in the day of my power." With this outward call, there went an efficacious power from God, which ſweetly over-ruled his natural will: and therefore, verſe 6. "He made haſte, and came down, and received him joyfully," not only into his houſe, but alſo into his heart.</p>
            <p>Thus it is the great God brings home his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. He calls them by name, by his word or providence; he ſpeaks to them alſo by his Spirit. Hereby they are enabled to open their hearts, and are made willing to receive the King of glory, For Zaccheus' ſake, let us not entirely condemn people that come unto the word, out of no better
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:029886_0187_0FE2C24015396538"/>
principle than curioſity. Who knows, but God may call them? It is good to be where the Lord is paſſing by. May all who are now preſent out of this principle, hear the voice of the Son of God ſpeaking to their ſouls; and ſo hear that they may live! Not that men ought therefore to take en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to come out of curioſity. For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a thouſand more, at other times, came to ſee Chriſt out of curioſity, as well as Zaccheus, who were not effectually called by his grace. I only mention this for the encouragement of my own ſoul, and the conſolation of God's children, who are too apt to be angry with thoſe who do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on the word out of love to God: but let them alone. Brethren, pray for them. How do you know but Jeſus Chriſt may ſpeak to their hearts? A few words from Chriſt applied by his Spirit, will ſave their ſouls. "Zaccheus, ſays Chriſt, make haſte and come down. And he made haſte, and came down, and received him joyfully."</p>
            <p>I have obſerved in holy ſcripture, how particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly it is remarked, that perſons rejoiced upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt. Thus the converted Eunuch went on his way rejoicing; thus the jailor rejoiced with his whole houſe; thus Zaccheus received Chriſt joyfully. And well may thoſe rejoice who receive Jeſus Chriſt; for with him they receive righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and eternal redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Many have brought up an ill report upon our good land, and would fain perſuade people that religion will make them melancholy mad. So far from it, that joy is one ingredient of the kingdom of God in the heart of a believer; "the kingdom of God is righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt." To rejoice in the Lord, is a goſpel duty. Rejoice in the Lord always, and
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:029886_0188_0FE2C2D55D881EA0"/>
again I ſay, rejoice. And who can be ſo joyful, as thoſe who know that their pardon is ſealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go hence and are no more ſeen? The godly may, but I cannot ſee how any ungodly men can rejoice: they cannot be truly cheerful. What if wicked men may ſometimes have laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amongſt them? It is only the laughter of fools; in the midſt of it there is heavineſs; at the beſt, it is but like the crackling of thorns under a pot: It makes a blaze, but ſoon goes out. But, as for the godly, it is not ſo with them; their joy is ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id and laſting. As it is a joy that a ſtranger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddleth not with, ſo it is a joy that no man taketh from them, it is a joy in God, a joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory.</p>
            <p>It ſhould ſeem that Zaccheus was under ſoul-diſtreſs but a little while; "perhaps," ſays Guth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in his book intitled, The trial concerning a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt, "not above a quarter of an hour;" I add, perhaps not ſo long: For as one obſerves, ſometimes the Lord Jeſus delights to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver ſpeedily. God is a ſovereign agent, and works upon his children in their effectual calling, according to the counſel of his eternal will. It is with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, as natural birth: All women have not the like pangs; all Chriſtians have not the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of conviction. But all agree in this, that all have Jeſus Chriſt formed in their hearts: And thoſe who have not ſo many trials at firſt, may be viſited with the greater conflicts hereafter; though they never come into bondage again, after they have once received the ſpirit of adoption. "We have not (ſays Paul) received the ſpirit of bondage again unto fear." We know not what Zaccheus underwent before he died: However this one
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:029886_0189_0FE2C244D01AF878"/>
thing I know, he now believed in Chriſt, and was juſtified, or acquitted, and looked upon as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in God's ſight, though a Publican, chief among the Publicans, not many moments before. And thus it is with all, that, like Zaccheus, receive Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by faith into their hearts. The very moment they find reſt in him, they are freely juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified from all things from which they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes; "for by grace are we ſaved, through faith, and that not of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it is the gift of God."</p>
            <p>Say not within yourſelves this is a licentious, Antinomian doctrine; for this faith, if true, will work by love, and be productive of the fruits of holineſs. See an inſtance in this convert Zacche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as: No ſooner had he received Jeſus Chriſt by faith into his heart, but he evidences it by his works; for ver. 8. we are told Zaccheus ſtood forth, and ſaid unto the Lord, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give unto the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him four fold."</p>
            <p>Having believed on Jeſus in his heart, he now makes confeſſion of him with his mouth to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Zaccheus ſtood forth: He was not aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſtood forth before his brother Publicans; for true faith caſts out all ſervile, ſinful fear of men; and ſaid "Behold, Lord." It is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how readily people in ſcripture have owned the divinity of Chriſt immediately, upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Thus the woman at Jacob's well; "Is not this the Chriſt?" Thus the man born blind; "Lord, I believe; and worſhipped him." Thus Zaccheus, "Behold, Lord." An inconteſtible proof this to me, that thoſe who deny our Lord's divinity, never effectually felt his power: If they
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:029886_0190_0FE2C2DB9543B5D8"/>
had, they would not ſpeak ſo lightly of him; they would ſcorn to deny his eternal power and God-head. "Zaccheus ſtood forth, and ſaid, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him fourfold." Noble fruits of a true living faith in the Lord Jeſus! Every word calls for our notice. Not ſome ſmall, not the tenth part, but the half. Of what? My goods; things that were valuable. My goods, his own, not another's: I give: Not, I will give when I die, when I can keep them no longer; but, I give now, even now. Zaccheus would be his own executor. For whilſt we have time we ſhould do good. But to whom would he give half of his goods? Not to the rich, not to thoſe who were already clothed in purple and fine linen, of whom he might be recompenſed again; but to the poor, the maimed, the halt, the blind, from which he could expect no recompence till the reſurrection of the dead. "I give to the poor." But know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he muſt be juſt, before he could be chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and conſcious to himſelf that in his public adminiſtrations he had wronged many perſons, he adds, "And, if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him fourfold." Hear ye this, all ye that make no conſcience of cheating the king of his taxes, or of buying or ſelling run goods. If ever God gives you true faith, you will never reſt, till, like Zaccheus, you have made reſtitution to the utmoſt of your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I ſuppoſe, before his converſion he thought it no harm to cheat thus, no more than you may do now, and pleaſed himſelf frequently, to be ſure, that he got rich by doing ſo: But now he is griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it at his heart; he confeſſes his injuſtice
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:029886_0191_0FE2C24B287DD458"/>
before men, and promiſes to make ample reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Go, ye cheating Publicans, learn of Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, go away and do likewiſe; if you do not make reſtitution here, the Lord Jeſus ſhall make you confeſs your ſins before men and angels, and condemn you for it, when he comes in the glory of his Father to judgment hereafter.</p>
            <p>After all this, with good reaſon might our Lord ſay unto him, "This day is ſalvation come to this houſe; foraſmuch as he is the ſon of Abraham;" not ſo much by a natural as by a ſpiritual birth. He was made partaker of like precious faith with Abraham: Like Abraham, he believed on the Lord, and it was accounted to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: His faith, like Abraham's, worked by love; and I doubt not, but he has been long ſince ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Abraham's harbour.</p>
            <p>And now are you not aſhamed of yourſelves, who ſpeak againſt the doctrines of grace, eſpecially that doctrine of being juſtified by faith alone, as though it leaded to licentiouſneſs? What can be more unjuſt than ſuch a charge? Is not the inſtance of Zaccheus a ſufficient proof to the contrary? Have I ſtrained it to ſerve my own turn? God forbid. To the beſt of my knowledge I have ſpoken the truth in ſincerity, and the truth as it is in Jeſus. I do affirm that we are ſaved by grace, and that we are juſtified by faith alone: But I do alſo affirm, that faith muſt be evidenced by good works where there is an opportunity of performing them.</p>
            <p>What therefore has been ſaid of Zaccheus, may ſerve as a rule, whereby all may judge whether they have faith or not. You ſay you have faith; but how do you prove it? Did you ever hear the Lord Jeſus call you by name? Were you ever
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:029886_0192_0FE2C2E0618C5930"/>
made to obey that call? Did you ever, like Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, receive Jeſus Chriſt joyfully into your hearts? Are you influenced by the faith you ſay you have, to ſtand up and confeſs the Lord Jeſus before men? Were you ever made willing to own, and humble yourſelves for, your paſt offences? Does your faith work by love, ſo that you conſcientiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay up, according as God has proſpered you, for the ſupport of the poor? Do you give alms of all things that you poſſeſs? And have you made due reſtitution to thoſe you have wronged? If ſo, happy are ye; ſalvation is come to your ſouls; you are ſons, you are daughters of, you ſhall ſhortly be everlaſting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bleſſed with faithful Abraham. But, if you are not thus minded, do not deceive your own ſouls; though you may talk of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by ſaith, like angels, it will do you no good; it will only increaſe your damnation. You hold the truth, but it is in unrighteouſneſs: Your faith being without works, is dead; you have the devil, not Abraham, for your father. Unleſs you get a faith of the heart, a faith working by love, with devils and damned ſpirits ſhall you dwell for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
            <p>But it is time now to enforce the latter part of the text; "For the Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt." Theſe words are ſpoken by our Saviour, in anſwer to ſome ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Phariſees, who inſtead of rejoicing with the angels in heaven, at the converſion of ſuch a ſinner, murmured, "that he was gone to be a gueſt with a man that was a ſinner." To vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his conduct, he tells them, that this was an act agreeable to the deſign of his coming: "For the Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:029886_0193_0FE2C24FCCBD2390"/>
which was loſt." He might have ſaid, the "Son of God." But O the wonderful condeſcenſion of our Redeemer! He delights to ſtyle himſelf the Son of man. He came not only to ſave, "but to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt." He came to Jericho to ſeek and ſave Zaccheus; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Zaccheus would never have been ſaved by him. But from whence came he? Even from heaven, his dwelling-place, to this lower earth, this vale of tears, "to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt;" or all that feel themſelves loſt, and are willing, like Zaccheus, to receive him into their hearts to ſave them; with how great a ſalvation? even from the guilt, and alſo from the power of their ſins; to make them heirs of God, and joint-heirs with himſelf, and partakers of that glory which he enjoyed with the Father before the world began. Thus will the Son of man ſave that which is loſt. He was made the Son of man on purpoſe that he might ſave them. He had no other end but this in leaving his Father's throne, in obeying the moral law, and hanging upon the croſs: All that was done and ſuffered, merely to ſatisfy, and procure a righteouſneſs for poor, loſt, undone ſinners, and that too without reſpect of perſons. "That which was loſt:" all of every nation and language, that feel, bewail, and are truly deſirous of being delivered from their loſt ſtate, did the Son of man come down to ſeek and to ſave: For he is mighty, not only ſo, but will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God through him; he will in no wiſe caſt them out. For he is the ſame to-day as he was yeſterday. He comes now to ſinners, as well as formerly; and, I hope, hath ſent me out this day to ſeek,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:029886_0194_0FE2C2E7AE693DA8"/>
and, under him, to bring home ſome of you, the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>What ſay you? Shall I go home rejoicing, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that many like ſheep, have gone aſtray, but they have now believed on Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to the great Shepherd and Biſhop of their ſouls? If the Lord would be pleaſed thus to proſper my handy-work, I care not how many le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galiſts and ſelf-righteous Phariſees murmur againſt me, for offering ſalvation to the worſt of ſinners: For I know the Son of man came to ſeek and to ſave them; and the Lord Jeſus will now be a gueſt to the worſt Publican, the vileſt ſinner that is among you, if he does but believe on him.—Make haſte then, O ſinners, make haſte, and come by faith to Chriſt. Then, this day, even this hour, nay this moment, if you believe, Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come and make his eternal abode in your hearts. Which of you is made willing to receive the King of glory? Which of you obeys the call, as Zaccheus did? Alas! why do you ſtand ſtill? How know you, whether Jeſus Chriſt may ever call you again? Come then, poor, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſinners; come away, poor, loſt, undone Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans: Make haſte, I ſay, and come away to Jeſus Chriſt. The Lord condeſcends to invite himſelf to come under the filthy roofs of the houſes of your ſouls. Do not be afraid of entertaining him; he will fill you with all peace and joy in believing. Do not be aſhamed to run before the multitude, and to have all manner of evil ſpoken againſt you falſely for his ſake: One ſight of Chriſt will make amends for all. Zaccheus was laughed at; and "all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer perſecution." But what of that? Zaccheus is now crowned in glory; as you alſo ſhall ſhortly
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:029886_0195_0FE2C255405A9B50"/>
be, if you believe on, and are reproached for Chriſt's ſake. Do not, therefore, put me off with frivolous excuſes; there is no excuſe can be given for your not coming to Chriſt. You are loſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done without him; and if he is not glorified in your ſalvation, he will be glorified in your deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if he does not come and make his abode in your hearts, you muſt take up an eternal abode with the devil and his angels. O that the Lord would be pleaſed to paſs by ſome of you at this time! O that he may call you by his Spirit, and make you a willing people in this day of his power! For I know my calling will not do, unleſs he, by his efficacious grace, compel you to come in. O that you once felt what it is to receive Jeſus Chriſt into your hearts! You would ſoon, like Zacche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, give him every thing. You do not love Chriſt, becauſe you do not know him; you do not come to him, becauſe you do not feel your want of him: you are whole and not broken-hearted; you are not ſick, at leaſt not ſenſible of your ſickneſs; and, therefore, no wonder you do not apply to Jeſus Chriſt, that great, that almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty phyſician. You do not feel yourſelves loſt, and therefore do not ſeek to be found in Chriſt. O that God would wound you with the ſword of his Spirit, and cauſe his arrows of conviction to ſtick deep in your hearts! O that he would dart a ray of divine light into your ſouls! For if you do not feel yourſelves loſt without Chriſt, you are of all men moſt miſerable: your ſouls are dead; you are not only an image of hell, but in ſome degree hell itſelf: you carry hell about with you, and you know it not. O that I could ſee ſome of you ſenſible of this, and hear you cry out, "Lord, break this hard heart; Lord, deliver me from the
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:029886_0196_0FE2C2EC4E562E68"/>
body of this death; draw me, Lord make me willing to come after thee; I am loſt; Lord, ſave me, or I periſh!" Was this your caſe, how ſoon would the Lord ſtretch forth his almighty hand, and ſay, be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid? What a wonderful calm would then poſſeſs your troubled ſouls! Your fellowſhip would then be with the Father and the Son: Your life would be hid with Chriſt in God.</p>
            <p>Some of you, I hope, have experienced this, and can ſay, I was loft, but am found; I was dead, but am alive again. The Son of man came and ſought me in the day of his power, and ſaved my ſinful ſoul. And do you repent that you came to Chriſt? Has he not been a good Maſter! Is not his preſence ſweet to your ſouls? Has he not been faithful to his promiſe? And have you not found, that even in doing and ſuffering for him, there is an exceeding preſent great reward? I am perſuaded you will anſwer, Yes. O then, ye ſaints, recommend and talk of the love of Chriſt to oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you! This may encourage others to come unto him. And who knows but the Lord may make you fiſhers of men? The ſtory of Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus was left on record for this purpoſe. No truly convicted ſoul, after ſuch an inſtance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace has been laid before him, need deſpair of mercy. What if you are Publicans? Was not Zaccheus a Publican? What if you are chief among the Publicans? Was not Zaccheus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? What if you are rich? Was not Zaccheus rich alſo? And yet almighty grace made him more than conqueror over all theſe hindrances. All things are poſſible to Jeſus Chriſt; nothing is too hard for him: he is the Lord almighty. Our
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:029886_0197_0FE2C25A9B7D1430"/>
mountains of ſins muſt all fall before this great Zerubabel. On him God the Father has laid the iniquities of all that ſhall truly believe; and in his own body he bare them on the tree. There, there, by faith, O mourners in Sion, may you ſee your Saviour hanging with arms ſtretched out, and hear him, as it were, thus ſpeaking to your ſouls; "Behold how I have loved you! Behold my hands and my feet? Look, look into my wounded ſide, and ſee a heart flaming with love: Love ſtronger than death. Come into my arms, O ſinners, come waſh your ſpotted ſouls in my heart's blood. See here is a fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ntain opened for all ſin and all uncleanneſs! See, O guilty ſouls, how the wrath of God is now abiding upon you: Come, haſte away, and hide yourſelves in the clefts of my wounds; for I am wounded for your tranſgreſſions; I am dying that you may live for evermore. Behold, as Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, ſo I am here lifted up upon a tree. See how I am become a curſe for you: The chaſtiſement of your peace is upon me. I am thus ſcourged, thus wounded, thus crucified, that you by my ſtripes may be healed. O look unto me all ye trembling ſinners, even to the ends of the earth! Look unto me by faith, and you ſhall be ſaved: For I came thus to be obedient even unto death, that I might ſave that which was loſt"</p>
            <p>And what ſay you to this, O ſinners? Suppoſe you ſaw the King of glory dying, and thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you? Would you believe on him? No, you would not, unleſs you believe on him now—For though he is dead, he yet ſpeaketh all this in the ſcripture, nay, in effect, ſays all this in the words of the text, "The Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt—Do not
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:029886_0198_0FE2C2F253E9D2F8"/>
therefore any longer crucify the Lord of glory, bring thoſe rebels, your ſins, which will not have him to reign over them—Bring them out to him, though you cannot ſlay them yourſelves, yet he will ſlay them for you, the power of his death and reſurrection is as great now as formerly—Make haſte therefore, make haſte, O ye publicans and ſinners, and give the dear Lord Jeſus your hearts, your whole hearts. If you refuſe to hearken to this call of the Lord, remember your damnation will be juſt, I am free from the blood of you all: You muſt acquit my Maſter and me at the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day of judgment. O that you may know the things that belong to your everlaſting peace, before they are eternally hid from your eyes! Let all that love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THE apoſtle, in the verſes before the text, had been cautioning the Philippians to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the conciſion, Jadaizing teachers, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſubvert them from the ſimplicity of the goſpel, by telling them, they ſtill ought to be ſubject to circumciſion and all the other ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Moſes. And that they might not think he ſpoke out of prejudice, and condemned their tenets becauſe he himſelf was a ſtranger to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh diſpenſation, he acquaints them, that if any other man thought he had whereof he might truſt in the fleſh, or ſeek to be juſtified by the outward privileges of the Jews, he had more: for he was circumciſed the eighth day; of the ſtock of Iſrael (not a proſelyte, but a native Iſraelite;) of the tribe of Benjamin (the tribe which adhered to Judah when the others revolted;) an Hebrew of the Hebrews, a Jew both of the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſide) and as touching the law, a phariſee, the ſtricteſt ſect among all Iſrael. To ſhew that he was no Gallio in religion, through his great though miſguided zeal, he had perſecuted the church of Chriſt; and as touching the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:029886_0200_0FE2C2F7C317B7B0"/>
of the law (as far as the Phariſees expoſition of it went) he was blameleſs, and had kept it from his youth. But, when it pleaſed God who ſeparated him from his mother's womb, to reveal his Son in him, What things were gain to me, (he ſays) thoſe privileges I boaſted myſelf in, and ſought to be juſtified by, I counted loſs for Chriſt. And that they might not think he repented that he had done ſo, he tells them, he was now more confirmed than ever in his judgment. For, ſays he, "yea doubtleſs," (the expreſſion in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal riſes with a holy triumph)" and I do count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord." And that they might not object that he ſaid, and did not, he acquaints them, he had given proofs of the ſincerity of theſe profeſſions, becauſe for the ſake of them, he had ſuffered the loſs of all his worldly things, and ſtill was willing to do more; for, "I count them but dung (no more than offals thrown out to dogs) ſo that I may win, (or have a ſaving intereſt in) Chriſt, and be found in him, (as the manſlayer in the city of refuge) not having my own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is of the law," not depending on hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abraham for my father, or on any works of righteouſneſs which I have done, either to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone or ſerve as a balance for my evil deeds, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs which is of God by faith, a righteouſneſs of God's appointing, and which will be imputed to me, if I believe in Chriſt, "that I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection;" that I may have an experimental knowledge of the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his reſurrect on by feeling the influences of his bleſſed Spirit on my ſoul. In which words two things are implied.</p>

            </p>
            <p>That Jeſus ſhould riſe from the dead was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> on his own account. He had often appealed to this as the laſt and moſt convincing proof, he would give them that he was the true Meſſiah, "There ſhall no other ſign be given you, than the ſign of the prophet Jonas. And again, Deſtroy this temple of my body, and in three days I will build it up." Which words his enemies remembered, and urged it as an argument, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Pilate to grant them a watch, to prevent his being ſtolen out of the grave. "We know that deceiver ſaid, whilſt he was yet alive, after three days I will riſe again." So that had he not riſen again, they might have juſtly ſaid, we know that this man was an impoſtor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was neceſſary on our account. "He roſe again, ſays the apoſtle, for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;" or that the debt we owed to God for our ſins, might be fully ſatisfied and diſcharged.</p>
            <p>It had pleaſed the Father (for ever adored be his infinite love and free grace) to wound his only Son for our tranſgreſſions, and to arreſt and confine him in the priſon of the grave, as our ſurety for the guilt we had contracted by ſetting at nought his commandments. Now had Chriſt continued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:029886_0202_0FE2C2FF90AB6520"/>
in the grave, we could have had no more aſſurance that our ſins were ſatisfied for, than any common debtor can have of his creditor's being ſatisfied whilſt his ſurety is kept confined. But he being releaſed from the power of death, we are thereby aſſured, that with his ſacrifice God was well pleaſed, and that our atonement was finiſhed on the croſs, and that he had made a full, perfect, and ſufficient ſacrifice, oblation, and ſatisfaction for the ſins of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> It was neceſſary that our Lord Jeſus ſhould riſe again from the dead, to aſſure us of the certainty of the reſurrection of our own bodies.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the reſurrection of the body was entirely exploded and ſet at nought among the Gentiles, as appears from the Athenians mocking at, and calling St. Paul a babbler and a ſetter forth of ſtrange doctrines when he preached to them Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and the reſurrection. And though it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by moſt of the Jews, as is evident from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſages of ſcripture, yet not by all; the whole ſect of the Sadduces denied it. But the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt put it out of diſpute. For as he acted as our repreſentative, if he our Head is riſen, then muſt we alſo, who are his members riſe with him. And as in the firſt Adam we all died, even ſo in him our ſecond Adam we muſt all, in this ſenſe, be made alive.</p>
            <p>As it was neceſſary, upon theſe accounts, that our bleſſed Lord ſhould riſe from the dead; ſo it is plain beyond contradiction, that he did. Nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was any matter of fact better atteſted; never were more precautions made uſe of to prevent a cheat. He was buried in a ſepulchre, hewn out of a rock, ſo that it could not be ſaid that any digged under, and conveyed him away. It was a
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:029886_0203_0FE2C26C830C9808"/>
ſepulchre alſo wherein man never was laid; ſo that if any body did riſe from thence, it muſt be the body of Jeſus of Nazareth. Beſides, the ſepulchre was ſealed; a great ſtone rolled over the mouth of it; and a band of ſoldiers (conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not of friends, but of his profeſſed enemies) was ſet to guard it. And as for his diſciples coming by night and ſtealing him away, it was altogether improbable: for it was not long ſince, that they had all forſaken him, and they were the moſt backward in believing his reſurrection. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it was true that they came whilſt the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſlept; yet the ſoldiers muſt be caſt into a deep ſleep indeed, that the rolling away ſo great a ſtone did not awake ſome of them.</p>
            <p>And our bleſſed Lord's afterwards appearing at ſundry times, and in divers manners, to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as when they were aſſembled together, when they were walking to Emma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, when they were fiſhing; nay, and condeſcending to ſhew them his hands and feet, and his appearing to above five hundred brethren at once, put the truth of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection out of all diſpute.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is one objection that may be made againſt what has been ſaid, that the books wherein theſe facts are recorded were written by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</p>
            <p>And who more proper perſons than thoſe who were eye-witneſſes of what they related, and eat and drank with him after his reſurrection? "But they were illiterate and ignorant men." Yet as good witneſſes of a plain matter of fact, as the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt learned maſters in Iſrael. Nay, this render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them more proper witneſſes. For being plain men, they were therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be ſuſpected of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="209" facs="unknown:029886_0204_0FE2C3042DF07B98"/>
laid down their lives for a teſtimony of the truth of it. We read indeed of Jacob's telling a lie, though he was a plain man, in order to get his father's bleſſing. But it was never heard ſince the world began, that any man, much leſs a whole ſet of men, died martyrs for the ſake of an untruth, when they themſelves were to reap no advantage from it.</p>
            <p>No, this ſingle circumſtance proves them to be Iſraelites indeed, in whom was no guile. And the wonderful ſucceſs God gave to their miniſtry after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when three thouſand were converted by one ſermon; and twelve poor fiſhermen, in a very ſhort time enabled to be more than conquerors over all the oppoſition men or devils could make, was as plain a demonſtration, that Chriſt was riſen, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their goſpel, as that a divine power, at the ſound of a few ram horns, cauſed the wall of Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to fall down.</p>
            <p>But what need we any farther witneſſes? Believe you the reſurrection of our bleſſed Lord? I know that you believe it, as your gathering together on this firſt day of the week in the courts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Lord's houſe abundantly teſtifies.</p>
            <p>What concerns us moſt to be aſſured of, and which is the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> thing I was to ſpeak to, is, Whether we have experimentally known the power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; that is, Whether or not we have received the Holy Ghoſt, and by his powerful operations on our hearts, have been raiſed from the death of ſin, to a life of righteouſneſs, and true holineſs.</p>
            <p>It was this, the great apoſtle was chiefly deſirous to know: the reſurrection of Chriſt's body he was ſatisfied would avail him nothing, unleſs he experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the power of it in rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> dead ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="unknown:029886_0205_0FE2C34906831188"/>
For another, and that a chief end of our bleſſed Lord's riſing from the dead, was to enter heaven as our repreſentative, and to ſend down the Holy Ghoſt to apply that redemption he had finiſhed on the croſs, to our hearts, by working an entire change in them.</p>
            <p>Without this, Chriſt would have died in vain. For it would have done us no ſervice to have had his outward righteouſneſs imputed to us, unleſs we had an inward inherent righteouſneſs wrought in us. Becauſe, being altogether conceived and born in ſin, and conſequently unfit to hold communion with an infinitely pure and holy God, we cannot poſſibly be made meet to ſee and enjoy him, till a thorough renovation has paſſed upon our hearts.</p>
            <p>Without this we leave out the Holy Ghoſt in the great work of our redemption. But as we were made by the joint concurrence and conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bleſſed Trinity; and as we were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in their name, ſo muſt all of them concur in our ſalvation: as the Father made, and the Son redeemed, ſo muſt the Holy Ghoſt ſanctify and ſeal us, or otherwiſe we have believed in vain.</p>
            <p>This then is what the apoſtle means by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſt's reſurrection, and this is what we are as much concerned experimentally to know, as that he roſe at all.</p>
            <p>Without this, though we may be moraliſts, though we may be civilized, good-natured people, yet we are no Chriſtians. For he is not a true Chriſtian, who is only one outwardly; nor have we therefore a right, becauſe we daily profeſs, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt roſe again the third day from the dead. But he is a true Chriſtian who is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and then only can we be ſtyled true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, when we not only profeſs to believe, but
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:029886_0206_0FE2C328462C8D18"/>
have felt the power of our bleſſed Lord's riſing from the dead, by being quickened and raiſed by his Spirit, when dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, to a thorough newneſs both of heart and life.</p>
            <p>The devils themſelves cannot but believe the doctrine of the reſurrection, and tremble; but yet they continue devils, becauſe the benefits of this reſurrection have not been applied to them, nor have they received a renovating power from it, to change and put off their diabolical nature. And ſo, unleſs we not only profeſs to know, but alſo feel that Chriſt is riſen indeed, by being born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from above, we ſhall be as far from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God as they: our faith will be as ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as the faith of devils.</p>
            <p>Nothing has done more harm to the Chriſtian world, nothing has rendered the croſs of Chriſt of leſs effect, than a vain ſuppoſition, that religion is ſomething without us. Whereas we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that every thing that Chriſt did outwardly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt be done over again in our ſouls; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the believing there was ſuch a divine Perſon once on earth who triumphed over hell and the grave, will profit us no more than believing there was once ſuch a perſon as Alexander who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the world.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt was born of the Virgin's womb, ſo muſt he be ſpiritually formed in our hearts. As he died for ſin, ſo muſt we die to ſin. And as he roſe again from the dead, ſo muſt we alſo riſe to a divine life.</p>
            <p>None but thoſe who have followed him in this regeneration, or new-birth, ſhall ſit on thrones as approvers of his ſentence, when he ſhall come in terrible majeſty to judge the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="unknown:029886_0207_0FE2C30B9A2C1A90"/>
It is true, as for the outward work of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, it was a tranſient act, and was certainly finiſhed on the croſs; but the application of that redemption to our hearts, is a work that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue always, even unto the end of the world.</p>
            <p>So long as there is an elect man breathing on the earth, who is naturally engendered of the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the firſt Adam, ſo long muſt the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit, which was purchaſed by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſecond Adam, that Lord from heaven, be breathing upon his ſoul.</p>
            <p>For though we may exiſt by Chriſt, yet we cannot be ſaid to exiſt in him, till we are united to him by one ſpirit, and enter into a new ſtate of things, as certainly as he entered into a new ſtate of things, after that he roſe from the dead.</p>
            <p>We may throng and crowd round about Chriſt, and call him Lord, Lord, when we come to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before his footſtool; but we have not effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually touched him, till by a lively faith in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, we perceive a divine virtue coming out of him, to renew and purify our ſouls.</p>
            <p>How greatly then do they err who reſt in a bare hiſtorical faith of our Saviour's reſurrection, and look only for external proofs to evidence it? Whereas were we the moſt learned diſputers of this world, and could ſpeak of the certainty of this fact with the tongue of men and angels, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this inward teſtimony of it in our hearts, tho' we might convince others, yet we ſhould never be ſaved by it ourſelves.</p>
            <p>For we are but dead men, we are like ſo many carcaſes wrapt up in grave clothes, till that ſame Jeſus who called Lazarus from his tomb, and at whoſe own reſurrection many that ſlept aroſe, doth raiſe us alſo by his quickening Spirit from our
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:029886_0208_0FE2C32C980C6AF8"/>
natural death, in which we have ſo long lain, to a holy and heavenly life.</p>
            <p>We might think ourſelves happy, if we had ſeen the holy Jeſus after he was riſen from the dead, and our hands had handled that Lord of life. But more happy are they who have not ſeen him, and yet having felt the power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, therefore believe in him. For many ſaw our divine Maſter, who were not ſaved by him; but whoſoever has thus felt the power of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, has the earneſt of his inheritance in his heart, he has paſſed from death to life, and ſhall never fall into final condemnation.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible that this is fooliſhneſs to the natural man, as were many ſuch like truths to our Lord's own diſciples, when only weak in faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he roſe again. But when theſe natural men, like them, have fully felt the power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they will then own that this doctrine is from God, and ſay with the Samaritans, "Now we believe not becauſe of thy ſaying," for we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have experienced it in our hearts.</p>
            <p>And O that all unbelievers, all letter-learned maſters of Iſrael, who now look upon the doctrine of the power of Chriſt's reſurrection, or our new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, as an idle tale, and condemn the preachers of it as enthuſiaſts and madmen, did but thus feel the power of it in their ſouls, they would no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aſk, how this thing could be? But they would be convinced of it as much as Thomas was, when he ſaw the Lord's Chriſt; and like him, when Jeſus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id him reach out his hands and thruſt them into his ſide, in a holy confuſion they would cry out, "My Lord, and my God!"</p>
            <p>But how ſhall an unbeliever, how ſhall the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Chriſtian come thus to "know Chriſt, and
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:029886_0209_0FE2C311901EB968"/>
the power of his reſurrection?" God, who cannot lie, has told us, "I am the reſurrection and the life, whoſoever liveth and believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live." Again ſays the apoſtle, "By faith we are ſaved, and that not of ourſelves, it is the gift of God."</p>
            <p>This, this is the way, walk in it. Believe and you ſhall live in Chriſt, and Chriſt in you; you ſhall be one with Chriſt, and Chriſt one with you. But without this, your outward goodneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions will avail you nothing.</p>
            <p>But then, by this faith we are not to underſtand a dead ſpeculative faith, a faith in the head; but a living principle wrought in the heart by the powerful operations of the Holy Ghoſt, a faith that will enable us to overcome the world, and forſake all in affection for Jeſus Chriſt. For thus ſpeaks our bleſſed Maſter, "Unleſs a man forſake all that he hath, he cannot be my diſciple."</p>
            <p>And ſo the apoſtle, in the words immediately following the text, ſays, "being made conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his death;" thereby implying, that we cannot know the power of Chriſt's reſurrection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we are made conformable to him in his death.</p>
            <p>This we have ſhadowed out by the cuſtom of baptizing by immerſion in the primitive church, and (which is alſo recommended by our own) their putting the infants under the water, ſignified their obligation to die unto ſin; as their taking them out of the water, ſignified their riſing again to newneſs of life. To which the apoſtle plainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, when he ſays, "we are buried with him in baptiſm."</p>
            <p>If we can reconcile light and darkneſs, heaven and hell, then we may hope to know the power of Chriſt's reſurrection without dying to ourſelves
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:029886_0210_0FE2C3322AC5F768"/>
and the world. But till we can do this, we might as well expect that Chriſt will have concord with Belial.</p>
            <p>For there is ſuch a contrariety between the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world, and the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that he who will be at friendſhip with the one, muſt be at enmity with the other: "We cannot ſerve God and mammon."</p>
            <p>This may, indeed, ſeem a hard ſaying; and many, with the young man in the goſpel, may be tempted to go away ſorrowful: but wherefore ſhould this offend them? For what is all that is in the world, the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh, and the pride of life, but vanity and vexation of ſpirit?</p>
            <p>God is love; and therefore, could our own wills, or the world, have made us happy, he never would have ſent his own dear Son Jeſus Chriſt to die and riſe again, to deliver us from the power of them. But becauſe they only torment and cannot ſatisfy, therefore God bids us to renounce them.</p>
            <p>Had any one perſuaded profane Eſau not to loſe ſo glorious a privilege, merely for the ſake of gratifying a preſent corrupt inclination, when he law him about to ſell his birth-right for a little red pottage, would not one think that man to have been Eſau's friend! And juſt thus ſtands the caſe between God and us. By the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, we are new-born to an heavenly inheritance among all them which are ſanctified; but our own corrupt wills would tempt us to ſell this glorious birth-right for the vanities of the world, which, like Eſau's red pottage, may pleaſe us for a while, but will ſoon be taken away from us. God knows this, and therefore rather bids us renounce them for a ſeaſon, than for the

ſhort enjoyment of them loſe the privilege of that glorious birth-right, to which, by knowing the power of the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, we are entitled.</p>
            <p>O the depth of the riches and excellency of Chriſtianity! Well might the great St. Paul count all things but dung and droſs for the excellency of the knowledge of it. Well might he deſire ſo ardently to know Jeſus, and the power of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. For even on this ſide eternity it raiſes us above the world, and makes us to ſit in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Well might that glorious company of worthies, recorded in the holy ſcriptures, ſupported with a deep ſenſe of their heavenly calling, deſpiſe the pleaſures and profits of this life, and wander about in ſheep-ſkins, and goat-ſkins, in dens and caves of the earth, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented.</p>
            <p>And O that we were all like-minded! that we felt the power of Chriſt's reſurrection as they did! How ſhould we then count all things as dung and droſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord! How ſhould we then recover our primitive dignity, trample the earth under our feet, and with our ſouls be continually gaſping after God.</p>
            <p>And what hinders but we may be thus minded? Is Jeſus Chriſt, our great High Prieſt, altered from what he was? No, he is the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever. And though he is exalted to the righthand of God, yet he is not aſhamed to call us brethren. The power of his reſurrection is as great now as formerly, and the Holy Spirit, which was aſſured to us by his reſurrection, as ready and able to quicken us who are dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, as any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

us but cry, and that inſtantly, to him that is mighty and able to ſave; let us, in ſincerity and truth, without ſecretly keeping back the leaſt part, renounce ourſelves and the world; then we ſhall be Chriſtians indeed. And though the world may caſt us out and ſeparate from our company, yet Jeſus Chriſt will walk with, and abide in us. And at the general reſurrection of the laſt day, when the voice of the archangel and trump of God ſhall bid the ſea and the graves to give up their dead, and all nations ſhall appear before him, then will he confeſs us before his Father and the holy angels, and we ſhall receive that invitation which he ſhall then pronounce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
