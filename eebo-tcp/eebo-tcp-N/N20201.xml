            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following Hiſtory would moſt willingly have been excuſed from the ſervice, had any other perſon appeared to have undertaken it. A work of this kind was wanted: The author, however unequal to the taſk, had advantages herefor above ſome others, being born in the weſtern part, and having the bounds of his habitation fixed in the eaſtern part, of the county. Had the writer of theſe ſheets known before he began, what a labour it would have been, he would not have attempted it, but having begun, he was unwilling to deſiſt, and has been urged on by the partiality of his friends. However difficult the collection of materials has been, yet he has derived a ſatisfaction by no means ſmall, in ranſacking records, ſearching into the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this part of the country, and in endeavouring to gratify his readers with a hiſtory thereof.</p>
            <p>The locality of the work may be thought, by ſome, an objection to it. But to have compleated a hiſtory of the Commonwealth, upon this plan, would be a labour too great, and too lengthy for any one, unleſs he was a perſon of fortune, and ſhould devote a long life wholly thereunto. If various gentlemen, in different parts of the State, would undertake to write a hiſtory of their particular counties or diſtricts, upon this, or a better plan, we might then hope to ſee a complete hiſtory of Maſſachuſetts collected, which would be not merely entertaining, but profitable and inſtructive from age to age; care being taken to make ſuch alterations in, and additions to the work, as
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:026481_0005_0FD04FDB8AE903B8"/>
time would occaſion: Theſe would reſpect the civil and eccleſiaſtical ſtate of the counties, their population, and their improvements in arts and manufactures.</p>
            <p>The greateſt care and pains have been taken to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain exact dates, where it was poſſible. Hence towns and churches may know their reſpective ages, if at any time their records ſhould be unhappily deſtroyed. The dates, however, are all inſerted according to the origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and, therefore, the reader, in order to know when a century or more has elapſed from the date of any event recorded in this hiſtory, will always remember to add eleven days thereto, until he comes down to the <hi>2</hi>d of September <hi>1752,</hi> when New Style, ſo called, took place. For inſtance, if a town was incorporated Auguſt <hi>1, 1728,</hi> it will not have completed a full century until Auguſt <hi>12, 1828.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The author of this work has endeavoured to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and to do juſtice to every town in its deſcription and hiſtory, and if he has failed hereof, it muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to other cauſes than any particular local preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. He has not omitted any thing worth preſerving, which has come to his knowledge.</p>
            <p>Many and too great defects will, moſt likely, be found by diſcerning readers of this hiſtory; but none, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but ſuch as their candor and ingenuity will readily excuſe in this firſt attempt of the kind; and none but what may be remedied in time, if ever a future edition ſhould be called for. And perſons, who find defects or miſtakes, or ſee the neceſſity of additions or alterations, are requeſted candidly to point them out to</p>

               <p>It is large in extent; being bounded on the ſouth, almoſt equally, by the States of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut and Rhodeiſland; and on the north by the ſtate of Newhampſhire.

               <p>AS this is the ſhire town of the county of Worceſter, we will firſt give an account and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this place, and then proceed to the other towns in the county according to their reſpective ages, reckoning from the dates of the acts of incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.</p>
               <p>Worceſter is <hi>part</hi> of a tract of land called by the aboriginals, <hi>Quinfigamond</hi>; which territory was by them eſteemed to bound eaſterly, partly on Quinſigamond pond, and partly on Haſſanamiſco, now Grafton; ſoutherly, on the Nipnet, or Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mug country, where Oxford and ſome adjacent towns now are; weſterly, on Quaboag, now Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and lands in that vicinity; and northerly, on Naſhawogg, now Lancaſter, Sterling, &amp;c. &amp;c. On October 24th, 1668, a townſhip of land of rather more than eight miles ſquare, to be bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eaſterly on Quinſigamond pond, was granted by the General Court, to Daniel Gookin, Daniel Henchman, Thomas Prentice, and their aſſociates. But war, at that time, and for ſeveral ſucceeding years, prevailing with the Indians, the ſettlement of the place was prevented until the year 1685: At which time, the natives appearing peaceably diſpoſed, and behaving in a friendly manner to the Engliſh, the above named perſons, together with John Wing, George Danſon, Peter Goulding, Dickery Sargeant, Iſaac Bull and Jacob Leonard, ventured to begin the plantation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:026481_0025_0FD056250A9E0480"/>The town was incorporated the preceding year October 15, 1684, and the name of Worceſter given to it. But the firſt town meeting ever held in the place, was on the laſt Wedneſday of September, 1722. A ſpecial order of the General Court paſſed directing Judge Fulham of Weſton, to call ſaid meeting.<note n="*" place="bottom">Here we muſt obſerve, by the way, that the method of the Government was very different in former times, from what it has been ſince.—In thoſe earlier days, plantations were named, and ſaid to be incorporated, when there were few, or no inhabitants in them; and when a ſufficient number of people had ſettled in them, a ſpecial reſolve of Court paſſed to empower them too meet, and chooſe their town Officers: But for 60 years paſt, they have been <hi>incorporated, named,</hi> and empowered to hold town meetings, by the ſame act.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the year following ſeveral other men, with their families, moved into the place. And the ſettlement thereof went on proſperouſly until the year 1701, when the Indians began again to attack the frontier towns in Maſſachuſetts. In the year 1702, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians killed the wife of Dickery Sargeant, and two of his children, and carried three of his children into captivity.<note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe children, two ſons and a daughter, choſe to dwell among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. However, in 1726, they accompanied Miſs Williams, taken from Deerfield, on a viſit to then friends in Newengland.</note> In this town alſo, Mr. Eliſha Ward was ſuppoſed to be killed, for he was known to be ſhot at, and never after ſeen, or heard of. The war raged with ſuch fury at this time, that Worceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was entirely depopulated. But peace being concluded with the Indians, in the beginning of the year 1713. Some of the proprietors of the townſhip applied to the General Court for encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement and direction towards its reſettlement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:026481_0026_0FD056268A87EC40"/>In conſequence of this application the Court ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a committee to aſcertain the claims of the grantees; and conduct the reſettlement of the place. On the 21ſt of October, 1713, Jonas Rice, with his family, moved into the place and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, without any other inhabitants, until the ſpring of the Year 1715, when a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons joined him. The number of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers was augmented by Emigrants from Ireland in 1718: Since which time it has flouriſhed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed exceedingly, and become large, populous and wealthy. In the year 1740, Holden was ſet off from Worceſter, and became a diſtinct town; and in 1778, 2200 acres, with the inhabitants thereon, were taken from this town to aid in forming the town of Ward;—Yet ſtill Worceſter is large in its dimenſions, being about ſix miles ſquare: And bounded, northerly, on Holden; eaſterly on Shrewſbury, Boylſton and Long Pond; ſoutherly, on Ward and Sutton, and weſterly, on Leiceſter, and Holden. It is become very populous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining two thouſand one hundred inhabitants, according to the cenſus taken in the year 1791: And it will no doubt, ſtill greatly increaſe for many years. It is alſo wealthy and opulent, being the third town in the county, in the proportion which it pays in a ſtate tax; and would be the firſt, moſt certainly, in the liſt, did not the other two, Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and Sutton, greatly exceed it in extent and dimenſions; and alſo in the number of ſouls.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants, in the outer parts of this town, ſubſiſt by huſbandry. But in the centre, in the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026481_0027_0FD05628090B75D0"/>
compaſs of one mile, and moſtly on one ſtreet, are collected the county officers, a number of merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and ſhop keepers, profeſſional men, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks of various ſorts. A very great trade is here carried on, in European and Weſtindia goods; and the adjacent country is ſupplied from this town: Here are large apothecary ſtores, and ſtores of all kinds of hardware.</p>
               <p>A printing preſs was here ſet up in 1775, by Mr. Iſaiah Thomas, who is thought to do far more buſineſs than any other in the ſtate, or in the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States of America.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In the time of the political controverſy between Great Britain, and theſe States, previous to the war, near the cloſe of the year 1774, ſeveral gentlemen applied in Boſton, to Iſaiah Thomas, printer of the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts Spy, (a Newſpaper famed for its oppoſition to the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which was no ſmall ſpoke in the wheel of the American Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution) to ſet up a printing pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> in Worceſter: He conſented, and iſſued propoſals for that purpoſe and for printing a newſpaper weekly, in the town of Worceſter: But, ſoon after, the politicks of that time wearing a more ſerious aſpect, and Mr. Thomas being one of a liſt of perſons, who it was thought, would firſt feel the weight of Britiſh vengence, ſecretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf, and his printing materials, from Boſton. His printing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus he ſent off for Worceſter, about three days before the battle of Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, and he himſelf followed the day after that battle. On the 3d of May, 1775, he, at Worceſter, recommenced the publication of the Maſſachuſetts Spy, which was the firſt printing performed in the county. This newſpaper is ſtill printed at Worceſter, and is the oldeſt in the State, the Boſton Gazette excepted.</p>
                     <p>When the war ceaſed, Mr. Thomas extended his buſineſs, and in the year 1788, reeſtabliſhed a printing office i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Boſton, he himſelf reſiding in Worceſter, where he ſtill carries on the printing buſineſs on a very larger ſcale, as he does alſo in Boſton. Among other large works which have iſſued from his preſſes in Worceſter, are three editions of the Bible, viz. a large Folio, with 50 copper plates; a large Royal Quarto, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance, &amp;c. and one in Octavo;—they are all the firſt of the kind ever printed in America:—And, upon examination, his editions are found the moſt correct of any now extant. He is now preparing to print two other editions of the Bible; viz. a ſmall Quarto; and one in Duodecimo, or the common ſchool Bible: For this laſt, all the types will be kept ſtanding for the whole work, as is the method in the King's printing houſes in England and Scotland. Mr. Thomas has alſo carried on the Bookbinding buſineſs very extenſively; and is now engaged in building, in Worceſter, as large a Paper Mill as is in this ſtate. His Bookſtore in Worceſter is kept well filled with a large aſſortment of Books in all branches of Literature, which is a great accommodation to purchaſers, in the town and county. His manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures employ and ſupport a large number of people; and it may juſtly be ſaid, that the buſineſs of no one perſon, has added more to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and advantage of the town and county of Worceſter, than his.</p>
                  </note> The houſes in the ſtreet, are very compact, many of them large and elegant, as alſo the ſtores and ſhops. And here they have a number of large inns, not only for the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the people of the county, at the times
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026481_0028_0FD056298A59CF90"/>
for holding the courts, but for travellers, and it is a place of great reſort. On the ſtreet has lately been erected a large and handſome ſchoolhouſe, of about 60, by 30 feet, and two ſtories high. On the lower floor are two apartments, one deſigned for a grammar ſchool, and the other for a writing ſchool. In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pper ſtory there is one large a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, with a fire place at each end: This is uſed by the ſcholars on their exhibition days. On the top there is a cupola with a bell. The ſtreet is wide, ſtraight, and very pleaſant, and adorned on either ſide with trees. And upon the whole, this town is one of the moſt populous, lively, flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, agreeable inland places in the ſtate. There are two congregational religious ſocieties in this town, called the firſt and ſecond pariſhes. Theſe have no parochial boundaries, but are called poll pariſhes; each inhabitant having a right by law, to pay and to connect himſelf to which pariſh he pleaſes, only ſignifying his choice, by leaving his

name at any time for that purpoſe, with the town clerk. They have accordingly two large and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant meetinghouſes, about three quarters of a mile apart; one ſtanding near the ſouth end, and the other the north end of the ſtreet, by which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are happily accommodated.</p>
               <p>In the year 1719, the firſt meetinghouſe was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and here a church was gathered, and the Rev. Andrew Gardner, the firſt miniſter was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the autumn of that ſame year 1719, but the month and day cannot be aſcertained. He was diſmiſſed from Worceſter on the laſt Wedneſday of October 1722, and was afterwards ſettled at Lunenburgh. Mr. Gardner was ſucceeded in the ſacred office by the Rev. Iſaac Burr, who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their ſecond paſtor, on the 25th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1725. He, likewiſe, after a few years, was diſmiſſed from his work, viz. on November, 1744.</p>
               <p>After his removal the Rev. Thaddeus Maccarty, for a ſhort ſpace Miniſter of Kingſton, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Plymouth, where he was ordained November 3d, 1742, was inſtalled paſtor, the third in ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of the church and people of Worceſter, on the 10th of June 1747. He continued in office until his death, which was on July 20, 1784.</p>
               <p>After the Rev. Mr. Maccarty's death, a ſecond church was formed here on December 1ſt, 1785, and the Rev. Aaron Bancroft was ordained to the paſtoral care thereof, February 1, 1786. This ſecond religious ſociety was incorporated, as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Pariſh November 13, 1787.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:026481_0030_0FD0562C886425C8"/>To the Rev. Mr. Maccarty ſucceeded, as paſtor of the firſt church and ſociety in Worceſter, the Rev. Samuel Auſtin, who was inſtalled here on the 29th of September, 1790. This gentleman had been for a ſhort ſpace, miniſter of the fourth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational ſociety in Newhaven, in Connecticut.</p>
               <p>In Worceſter, a Social Library company has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been eſtabliſhed; their ſtock already amounts to 90l. and as the inſtitution is founded on a large and liberal plan, it will doubtleſs be greatly increaſed.</p>
               <p>In this town, a number of gentlemen, requeſting the ſame, received a charter in April, 1793, from the Maſſachuſetts Grand Lodge for holding a LODGE of FREE MASONS, by the name of the MORNING STAR LODGE, and Iſaiah Thomas, was unanimouſly elected Maſter. And on the 11th of June, the Grand Lodge, of Maſſachuſetts, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Worceſter for the purpoſe, he was inſtalled by the moſt worſhipful Grand Maſter, John Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and the Lodge conſecrated. The ſtated meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Morning Star Lodge are on the third Tueſday of every month.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now preſent our readers with a geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical deſcription of the town of Worceſter.</p>
               <p>The town is full of round gradual riſing hills, and of dales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There are few craggy precipices, and few extenſive plains. The middle, or moſt thick ſettled part, is in a valley, ſurrounded by pleaſant hills, and from the hill as we enter the town from the eaſt, it makes an agreeable appearance. Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuck and Boggachoag hills are remarkable for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly had Indian towns on them. They
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026481_0031_0FD0562E082163F0"/>
are neither of them very high. Millſtone hill, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a mile from the courthouſe, to the eaſt, is the common property of the inhabitants, who procure from thence ſtones, ſome of which they ſplit out, and hew for underpinning to their houſes, for door ſtones and ſteps. The ſtones are hard grained, and peculiarly fit for Millſtones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It muſt be a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar advantage to ſuch a town as Worceſter, to have ſuch an inexhauſtible quarry of building ſtone, which can be worked into any ſhape, where there are, and will be ſo many gentlemen who wiſh to build with elegance, as well as for convenience.</p>
               <p>The natural growth of wood is oak, walnut and cheſnut, on the higher lands, ſome pine on the ſmall plains and valleys, and in the ſwamps and low lands, aſh, birch and maple. The town is well ſupplied with wood. And as every farmer has his own plat of woodland upon his homeſtead, ſo the face of the town appears more woody from the hills, than it is in fact. The interſperſion of hills and dales, fields and woods, affords an agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and variegated proſpect, extending about ſix or ſeven miles from the obſerver's eye. And a more enlarged view is not to be had from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eminence in the town.—The ſoil is pretty good, warm, more inclined to ſand than clay, however it cannot be called ſandy; is is friendly to the growth of Indian corn. Some of the farmers have lately turned their attention to raiſing wheat and flax, and with conſiderable ſucceſs. Rye is raiſed here in great quantities. The riſing grounds are very good for paſtures and orchards; and the lower not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026481_0032_0FD0562F88CD5B60"/>
for hay. Indeed, there is ſoil of almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind in Worceſter, and almoſt on every farm. It is not eaſy to deſcribe its general properties for it is productive, in a degree, of almoſt all kinds of country produce, and not noticeable for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular one.</p>
               <p>How far this town affords mines and minerals, has never yet been fully aſcertained. About the year 1754, a broad flat vein, about a foot thick, of lead and ſilver ore, in the proportion of 2½ penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weights of ſilver to one pound of lead, was diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, running ſlauntwiſe down into a rock. Some perſons purchaſed it, and procured a miner, who followed it a little way into a rock, on a hill; and then adviſed to meet it by digging away before it. In this undertaking conſiderable money was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, but they never met the vein. After a while, they left off diſcouraged. However, in digging to meet this vein, they found ſeveral pieces of ore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſize of a peck, or half buſhel.</p>
               <p>Worceſter has really but one pond within its limits, this is called <hi>North Pond,</hi> and is of an oval form; covering about 30 acres of ground, and is ſurrounded partly by woods and partly by a ſwamp and meadow. Though not an agreeable pond, yet it is well ſupplied with the uſual ſorts of common pond fiſh, as pickerel, perch, ſhiners, breams, eels, and pouts. Theſe fiſh, however, are not of the beſt quality, as the water is rather ſlagnant, and the bottom muddy. As to Quinſigamond, or Long Pond, or what is ſometimes called Worceſter Pond, the facts are theſe, that all the water of that pond
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026481_0033_0FD056310B2E9068"/>
which lies within the line of the town of Worceſter, does not cover more than one acre of land, being two or three ſmall coves: The reſt of the pond lies within the bounds of Shrewſbury, and will be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed when we come to ſpeak of that town.</p>
               <p>Worceſter is very well watered by rivers, brooks and rivulets. Bimilick, or Mill brook has its ſource in North Pond; and running ſoutherly, it croſſes the great road a little north of the Courthouſe, and empties into Blackſtone river. It is not more than ten feet wide and one foot deep; but a fine ſtream. Turkeybrook, which is about the ſame ſize, origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates in Holden. Tatnuck, or Halfway River, in the ſouthweſterly part of the town, runs alſo from Holden, empties perhaps ten times as much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and is about two rods wide. This paſſes on through Sutton, to the ſouthward. Boggachoag river, which runs northwardly, through a corner of Ward, is nearly as large as Halfway River. Theſe three ſtreams unite in French River, ſo called.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe ſtreams there are, within the town of Worceſter, a very large paper mill, four grift mills, four ſaw mills, two fulling mills, and two trip hammers. The fulling mills are the property of Meſſrs. Stowell, father and ſons, by whom the clothier's buſineſs, in all its branches, is carried on to as great perfection as any where in the ſtate. They dye fine ſcarlet, and deep blue colours, in the beſt manner.</p>
               <p>Beſides the above mentioned there are two or three works for the making of Potaſh, in which Pearlaſh is alſo made: Alſo a diſtillery for gin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:026481_0034_0FD05632896FC198"/>There is a Poſt office in this town; the Poſtmaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is Iſaiah Thomas.</p>
               <p>The great poſt road, from Boſton to Springfield is very good in that part of it which goes through Worceſter. As this is the ſhire town, roads from all parts of the county, and in every direction, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre here. There is now a Poſt road eſtabliſhed, from Worceſter to Providence, which paſſes through Mendon.</p>
               <p>Worceſter is ſituated 47 miles from Boſton, a little to the ſouth of weſt.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid what may be thought ſufficient, in deſcribing the town of Worceſter, we cannot take our leave of it, without mentioning with reſpect, the name of Chandler. The town of Worceſter, in particular, and the county of Worceſter at large, were originally greatly indebted to the Hon. John Chandler, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Woodſtock, the firſt Judge in the county, and his ſon, the firſt Col. John Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Worceſter, who, in proceſs of time ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his father in all his offices, titles and honours, for their addreſs, activity and enterpriſe. And their names ought to be held in grateful remembrance.</p>

               <head>LANCASTER.</head>
               <p>THIS is, by ſeveral years, the eldeſt town in the county of Worceſter, and, originally, one of the largeſt, as will appear in the ſequel of this hiſtory, when we come to mention the ſeveral large towns which have been ſet off from it. So early as in the year 1645, <hi>Sholan,</hi> alias <hi>Shaumauw,</hi> proprietor of <hi>Naſhawogg,</hi> and Sachem of the <hi>Naſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi> who lived at <hi>Wauſhacum,</hi> (which is in Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) informed Mr. Thomas King of Watertown, with whom he traded, and for whom he had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, of this tract of land as well accommodated for a plantation, deſiring the Engliſh would come and ſet down by him. Accordingly, Mr. King, Mr. John Preſcot, Harmon Garret, Thomas Skid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Mr. Day, Mr. Symonds, with others, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of ſaid <hi>Sholan,</hi> a deed of Naſhawogg, ten miles in lengh, and eight in breadth, under theſe reſtrictions, that the Engliſh ſhould not moleſt the Indians in their hunting, fiſhing, or uſual planting places.—And the General Court confirmed the deed. And here we ought to obſerve, the fidelity of <hi>Sholan</hi> who conveyed this tract of land to the Engliſh, that he always behaved in a peaceable, friendly manner towards them. As did alſo <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> his nephew, and ſucceſſor as Sachem; but <hi>Sag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amore Sam,</hi> nephew to Matthew, and ſucceeded him, was of a different temper and character; and, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Philip in his rebellion, was taken by the Engliſh, and executed as a rebel. They of the

tribe who ſurvived this war of Philip's divided; one part moving to Albany, and the other to Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicook, with which tribe they incorporated.</p>
               <p>Let us return from this digreſſion. Mr. King ſold all his intereſt in this grant to his aſſociates, who having given lots of land to Richard Linton, Lawrence Waters, and John Ball, ſent them up to perform divers things at the common expenſe of the proprietors: And theſe were the firſt inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. For the ſpace of ſeven years little was done to forward the ſettlement of the plantation; nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertheleſs, there being nine families in the place, they petitioned the General Court to be incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a town, which was granted on the 18th of May, 1653, and the name of Lancaſter was given to it.</p>
               <p>The town was in peace and proſperity for the ſpace of twenty two years, from its incorporation— and the Indians were very ſerviceable to the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, by ſupplying them, on reaſonable terms, with ſuch corn and wild meat as they needed.</p>
               <p>But on the 24th of June, 1675, Philip, Sachem of Pocanoket, commonly called <hi>King Philip,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt the Engliſh, and commenced a moſt bloody and deſtructive war.—And on the 22d of Auguſt following, eight perſons, viz. George Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, William Fagg, Jacob Farrar, Joſeph Wheeler, Mordecai MacLoad, with his wife and two of their children, were killed in different parts of the town. The Narraganſet Indians, joining Philip in his rebellion, marched into the country, and perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Nipnets and Naſhaways to take up arms al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo againſt the Engliſh.</p>

And on the the 10th of Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary, 1676, very early in the morning, aſſaulted the town in five diſtinct bodies and places, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of the unfortified houſes, and killing ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral perſons, viz. Jonas Fairbank, Joſhua Fairbank, Richard Wheeler, Ephraim Sawyer, Henry Farrar, and Mr. Ball and wife. However, they deſtroyed no garriſon, but that round the Rev.

               <p>The enemy ſoon ſet fire to the houſe, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Engliſh to the ſad neceſſity of ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Indians, rather than to periſh by the flames.

In this ſtate of deſolation, the town continued about four years; during which time the Rev. Mr. Rowlandſon preached at Wethersfield in Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, and there he died, before the reſettlement of the town. From 1680 to the year 1692, they were not moleſted in the reſettlement of the town. But the French king eſpouſing the cauſe of James the ſecond in 1688, who had abdicated the Britiſh throne, involved the nation in a war with France, and Newengland in a war with the Canadians, both French and Indians: In the calamities of which this town had a large ſhare. For, on the 18th of July 1692, the Indians aſſaulted the houſe of Peter Joſlin, who was at his labour in the field; and knew nothing thereof, until, entering the houſe, he found his wife and three children, with a widow Whitcomb, who lived in his family, barbarouſly butchered with their hatchets, and weltering in their blood. His wife's ſiſter, with another of his children, were carried into captivity—ſhe returned; but that child was murdered in the wilderneſs.— In 1695, on a Lord's day morning, Mr. Abraham Wheeler, was mortally wounded.—On the 11th of September, 1697, when the inhabitants, not ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of any enemy, were gone out to their labour, the Indians came, in ſeveral companies, into the town, and were n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

mile's diſtance, and, deſigning to bring his little ſon from ſaid garriſon, mounted his horſe, (which came running to him in a fright) and rode, full ſpeed, into the gate, but yet nothing ſuſpicious of an enemy: However, this was a mean of ſaving the garriſon; for the enemy, who were juſt ready to ruſh into it, ſuppoſing they were diſcovered, gave over that deſign, and fired at ſuch as were in the fields.—At this time, the Rev. John Whiting being, on ſome occaſion, at a diſtance from his garriſon, they ſurpriſed and killed him—they, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, offered him quarter; but he choſe rather to fight to the laſt, than reſign himſelf to them whoſe tender mercies are cruelty. At the ſame time they killed twenty others, viz. Daniel Hudſon and his wife and two of their daughters, Ephraim Roper, and wife and daughter, John Skait and wife, Joſeph Rugg and wife and three children, widow Rugg, Jonathan Fairbank, and two of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and two of the children of Nathaniel Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: They wounded two, but not mortally; and captivated Jonathan Fairbank's wife, widow Wheeler, Ephraim Roper's ſon, John Skait's ſon, Joſeph Rugg's ſon, and Mary Glaſier: Five of theſe returned.</p>
               <p>In 1704, a large army of French and Indians came from Canada, with a deſign to deſtroy North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, but, finding they were prepared to receive them, they turned their courſe towards Lancaſter; and on the 31ſt of July, early in the morning, they fell furiouſly upon the town; and in their firſt onſet killed Lieut. Nathaniel Wilder, near the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026481_0041_0FD0563DA234BE90"/>
gate of his own garriſon; and on the ſame day three others, viz. Abraham How, John Spaulding, and Benjamin Hutchins, near the ſame garriſon.</p>
               <p>The enemy were uncommonly brave, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though Capt. Tyng, who commanded the ſoldiers of the garriſon, and Capt. How, with a company from Marlborough, who marched imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to their aſſiſtance, together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the town, maintained a warm conflict with them, for ſome time, yet being much inferior in number were obliged to retreat into the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Upon this the enemy burned the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and ſix other buildings, and deſtroyed much of the live ſtock of the town. Before night there came ſuch numbers to the relief of the town, that the enemy retreated; and though purſued, were not overtaken.</p>
               <p>What number of the enemy were killed at the above time is uncertain; but it was ſuppoſed to be conſiderable:— French officer, of ſome diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was mortally wounded, which greatly exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated them.</p>
               <p>On the 26th of October, the ſame year, 1704, a party of the enemy having been diſcovered at Still River, the ſoldiers and inhabitants belonging to Mr. Gardiner's garriſon, with divers others, went in queſt of them, and returned in the evening much fatigued with the ſervice of the day—Mr. Gardner, (who had been preaching ſeveral years with the people of Lancaſter, and was now their Paſtor elect) in compaſſion to the ſoldiery, took the watch that night upon himſelf; and coming
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026481_0042_0FD0563E8EF68D18"/>
out of the box, late in the night upon ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was heard by one Samuel Preſcott in the houſe, between ſleeping and waking, who, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him an enemy, ſeized the firſt gun which came to hand, and ſhot him through the body in the parade. But the fatal miſtake immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; and he, being carried into the houſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave the perſon who ſhot him, and in an hour or two expired, to the great grief, not only of his conſort, but of his people, who had an high eſteem of him.</p>
               <p>On the 15th of October, 1705, Mr. Thomas Sawyer, with his ſon, Elias Sawyer, and John Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The Indians treated Mr. Sawyer with much cruelty, but at length they arrived at Montreal. There Mr. Sawyer obſerved to the French Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, that on the River Chamblee there was a fine ſeat for mills; and that he would build a ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill for him, provided he would procure a ranſom for himſelf, his ſon, and Biglow. The Governor readily cloſed with the propoſal, as, at that time, there was no ſawmill in all Canada, nor artificer capable of building one. He accordingly applied to the Indians, and obtained the ranſom of young Sawyer and Biglow, without the leaſt difficulty; but no ſum would purchaſe Mr. Sawyer's redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Him, (being diſtinguiſhed for his bravery, which had proved fatal to a number of their breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren)
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026481_0043_0FD0564009FDC510"/>
they were determined to immolate.—The victim was accordingly led forth and actually faſtened to the ſtake, environed with materials, ſo diſpoſed as to effect a lingering death.—The ſavages, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding the unfortunate priſoner, began to antic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipate the horrid pleaſure of beholding their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive writhing in tortures amidſt the riſing flames, and of rending the air with their diſmal yells.—On a ſudden a Friar appeared, and, with great ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, held forth what he declared to be the key to the gates of Purgatory; and told them unleſs they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately releaſed their priſoner, he would inſtantly unlock thoſe gates, and ſend them headlong therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Superſtition prevailed, and wrought the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Mr. Sawyer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For they, at once, unbound him, and gave him up to the Governor. In one year he compleated a mill, when he and Biglow were diſcharged. They detained his ſon Elias one year longer, to inſtruct them in the art of ſawing and keeping the mill in order; when he was amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and ſent home to his friends; where his father and he both lived to a good old age, and were gathered to their graves in peace.</p>
               <p>On the 16th of July, 1707, Mr. Jonathan White was killed by the Indians. And on the 18th of Auguſt in this ſame year, 1707, twenty four ſtout Indians, who, according to their own account, had all been captains, came to Marlborough, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other miſchief they did there,<note n="*" place="bottom">See mention of this ſame company, in the account of Northborough.</note> captivated Mr. Jonathan Wilder, a native of Lancaſter: The next day, they were purſued by about thirty people from

Marlborough and Lancaſter, and overtaken in what is now Sterling. The front of our men came upon them before they had the leaſt apprehenſion of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.—Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On Auguſt 5th, 1710, a party of the enemy coming by advantage of the buſhes very near to Mr. Nathaniel and Mr. Oliver Wilder, and an Indian ſervant at their labour in the field, the ſervant was killed, but the men eſcaped to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.—And this was the <hi>laſt miſchief</hi> done by the enemy, in Lancaſter.—After that period they were a peaceable, proſperous, happy people; they grew and flouriſhed, multiplied and increaſed, they ſpread and extended their branches far and wide: So that, with the greateſt propriety, the people of this place may adopt the words of the pſalmiſt, in reference to Iſrael, and ſay,—"Many a time have
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026481_0045_0FD0564308113B38"/>
they afflicted me from my youth—many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed againſt me."—I would here obſerve, the account given above of the deſolations, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which befel the town of Lancaſter, is, <hi>chiefly</hi> in the words of the Rev. Mr. Harrington, in a century ſermon he preached there on the 28th of May, 1753.</p>
               <p>I will now proceed to give ſome particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Eccleſiaſtical ſtate of this town, from its beginning.—It was incorporated, as we have ſaid, in 1653. The following year, Mr. Joſeph Rowlandſon preached among the people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo doing, until April 14th, 1658, when they invited him to ſettle with them in the work of the miniſtry; their invitation he accepted, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was ordained the ſame year, at which time, no doubt the Church of Chriſt was gathered here: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of theſe things we cannot ſpeak with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, ſince the records of the Church, in Mr. Rowlandſon's time, were, in all probability, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in his garriſon. As the town was wholly broken up and deſtroyed, as above related, in 1676, ſo the Rev. Mr. Rowlandſon continued with the people from the firſt but about 22 years, and died before the reſettlement of the town.—The place lay in ruins about four years. In 1680, they began to reſettle: And divers gentlemen preached with them. In February, 1688, Mr. John Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was invited to preach with them on probation; and continued preaching until November, 1690, when he was invited to take the overſight of them
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:026481_0046_0FD0564489B225B0"/>
in the Lord; and he, accepting their invitation was, probably, ſoon after ordained.</p>
               <p>But we cannot be certain of the preciſe day, as no records of the time of his miniſtry have ever been found.—He continued but a ſhort ſpace, in the ſacred office, being cut off, by the enemy, as before mentioned, on the 11th of September, 1697.</p>
               <p>In May, 1701, Mr. Andrew Gardner, began to preach at Lancaſter, and in September following the people gave him a call to ſettle with them in the work of the goſpel miniſtry. This invitation he accepted, and his ordination was appointed; but before the day came a ſudden and ſurpriſing death arreſted him: Being unfortunately, but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded in the houſe of his friends, in his own garriſon, in the night following the 26th of October, 1704; the particulars of which have been related above.</p>
               <p>In May, 1705, Mr. John Prentice came to preach among this people, and ſupplied the deſk until February, 1707, when he received an invitation to ſettle among them, which he accepted; and he was accordingly, ſolemnly ſeparated unto this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred employment on the 29th of March, 1708. In his day there was peace, and the town grew and flouriſhed exceedingly: For during his miniſtry, from his dioceſe were formed the towns of Harv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Bolton, Leominſter, and the ſecond precinct, which is now called Sterling. He was a good and faithful ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, continuing in his office almoſt forty years, living much beloved; and died greatly lamented, on the 6th of January. 1748.

The breach made upon the Church and town was happily repaired the enſuing fall, in the inſtallment of the Rev. Timothy Harrington, to the paſtoral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice among them, November 16th, 1748; who ſtill continues, in an advanced age.</p>
               <p>The Rev.

               <p>We proceed to a Geographical, and Topo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical deſcription of Lancaſter. It is about nine miles in length from north to ſouth, and four in width from eaſt to weſt: Bounded by Lunenburgh and Leominſter on the north and north weſt; by Shirley in the county of Middleſex, on the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt; by Harvard, Bolton and Berlin, on the eaſt; by Boylſton on the ſouth, and by Sterling on the weſt. The body of the town is ſituated on low and level lands near the intervals; and ſo as to afford an agreeable proſpect of a conſiderable part of it. There are two main branches of the River Naſhaway. The north branch originates from a Pond in Weſtminſter, and, running through Fitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh and Leominſter, enters Lancaſter in the North weſt part of the town; and purſues a ſoutheaſt courſe into the middle of it, within a few rods of the meetinghouſe. The ſouth branch ſprings up from the foot of Watchuſett, in Princeton, and running through Sterling and Boylſton, enters at the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt angle of the town; then running northeaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, meets the north branch about half a mile below the meetinghouſe; and then, keeping a northeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern courſe, enters Shirley. On both branches and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:026481_0050_0FD0564B4A5994F8"/>
within the town of Lancaſter they have corn and ſaw mills. There are nine large bridges within the town: Two on the north branch, three on the ſouth, and four after their junction. None are leſs than five rods in length; and the firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the confluence of theſe waters is planked ten rods. On the two branches, and after they unite, there is a vaſt body of exceeding rich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The river Naſhaway overflows the whole interval, of nearly 3000 acres, twice in a year, in the ſpring, and in autumn and in ſome places two miles in width. Sometimes it has overflowed the interval lands in ſummer; and then it has generally done vaſt damage, by carrying off fences, great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of hay and flax, &amp;c. and deſtroyed large fields of Indian corn. In 1787, by a freſhet, a ſaw mill, on the north branch, about two miles from the meetinghouſe, was ſwept off, and about three acres of good rich interval land waſhed away to the depth of 12 feet, leaving only a bed of cobble ſtones, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely uſeleſs. The lands riſing from the interval are, moſtly, plain and level, on which the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the middle of the town, ſtand; and theſe lands are good for all kinds of grain: Wheat and hemp are raiſed upon them in great plenty. The higher lands are good for wood and paſturage.

               <p>We have now to obſerve, that the town of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter is at great expenſe in building and repairing bridges and cauſeways: And the General Court, in conſideration hereof, granted a Lottery, a few years paſt, whereby they might raiſe a certain ſum of money for theſe purpoſes. Nevertheleſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their rivers occaſion the people much coſt, and ſometimes great loſs and damage by the freſhets, yet the bounteous Author of Nature, ſeemed to conſider theſe things, and made them great, if not full compenſation, by ſome ſingular natural advantages in the town; and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026481_0053_0FD0564FCAB4D070"/>
by the richneſs and fertility of their large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals; and the eaſe with which their lands are cultivated, and made productive. And upon the whole, notwithſtanding it has been curtailed on every ſide, this is ſtill a very large and wealthy town; peaceable and happy; proſperous and flouriſhing; and the people are induſtrious and good.</p>
               <p>In this town when the general cenſus was taken, in the year 1791, there were 214 houſes, and 1460 inhabitants.

               <head>MENDON.</head>
               <p>THIS is a very ancient town indeed, the ſecond in age in the county. It was an orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal grant to certain perſons, of eight miles ſquare, made by the General Court, at an early period, we cannot ſay exactly when; it was called Quanſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pauge by the natives. It was incorporated by an Act of the Legiſlature, on the 15th of May, 1667, and the name of Mendon given to it. It was lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, a plan drawn, and return made to the General Court, by a Mr. Joſhua Fiſher. After the Province line was ſettled, it was again ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, and a plan of it drawn by a Mr. William
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:026481_0054_0FD05651484FEE00"/>
Rider, in the year 1725; according to which plan its boundaries and extent were as follow, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at ſouthweſt corner it ran eaſt ſeven and an half miles on the line between Maſſachuſetts and Rhodeiſland; then north four miles and 40 rods; then eaſt, one mile by a river; then north again, three miles and 280 rods; then weſt, eight and an half miles; then ſouth eight miles, to the firſt bounds. But this meaſure muſt be very large, ſince all Uxbridge, almoſt the whole of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and a large part of Upton were taken from Mendon, together with Milford; and ſtill there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main two pariſhes in the town. Its preſent bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by actual ſurvey, are ſouth, by Rhodeiſland State, ſix miles and a quarter; on the weſt, by Uxbridge and Northbridge, ſeven miles and 140 rods to Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton line; northweſt, by Upton, two miles; northeaſt, by Milford, four miles and a quarter; eaſt, by Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham in the county of Suffolk, four miles and three quarters. When they held their firſt town meeting, or firſt acted as a corporate body, does not appear, nor when the Church was gathered and the firſt miniſter was ſettled. Here, as in ſome other inſtances we may meet with, we have to lament the entire want of ancient records. If ever any records were kept in thoſe early days, of theſe matters, they were loſt when the town was broken up in the time of the Indian wars, or in ſome other way. We have alſo to regret the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and defects attending ſuch records as are to be found.</p>
               <p>In little more than eight years from the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of Mendon, commenced the Narraganſet,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:026481_0055_0FD05652C92D2EA0"/>
or King Philip's war. And all that I can find in "Hubbard's hiſtory of the Indian wars," or in "Governor Hutchinſon's hiſtory of Maſſachuſetts," or by any other way, is this, viz. "On the 14th of July, 1675, the Nipnet or Nipmuck Indians, killed four or five people at Mendon." And this was the firſt miſchief ever done by the Indians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ancient limits of the Maſſachuſetts. For it muſt be remembered, that the colony of Plymouth was not annexed to Maſſachuſetts until the charter from William and Mary in 1691. I cannot find that ever any other miſchief was done by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in Mendon, except the abovementioned. However the people then here were in ſuch fear and danger, as that the town was entirely broken up for ſome time, and moſt or all of them moved off. How long the place remained deſolate, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſay with certainty. It could not be long, as will appear by the following account of the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ſtate of Mendon.</p>
               <p>All we can find on record is ſimply this—"The Rev. Joſeph Emerſon was the firſt Paſtor of the Church in Mendon. He lived here before the war, known by the ſtile of King Philip's Indian war." I add, in this war the town and church were broken up, and Mr. Emerſon never returned to officiate with them in the paſtoral office. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſays, he was miniſter here about eight years, this will carry back the date of his ordination, and the gathering of the Church, to the year 1667, that is, to about the time when the town was incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—The records go on to ſay—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:026481_0056_0FD056544C8F1A68"/>"The Rev. Grindall Rawſon was the ſecond Paſtor of the Church in this town. He was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the 20th year of his age. He died Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary the 6th, 1715, in the 57th year of his age, and 37th of his miniſtry." But here we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, his tombſtone ſays, "he died in the 35th year of his miniſtry:" And this is the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſeveral reaſons. According to the town record, he muſt have been ſettled in the year 1678, which is carrying it back too near the time when the town was broken up: And conſidering the then ſtate of the country, in conſtant fear, and great danger from the Indians, it is not at all likely they ſhould reſettle ſo ſoon; but in the year 1680 they probably might.</p>
               <p>The records further ſay, "The Rev. Joſeph Dorr was the third Paſtor of this Church. He died March 9th, 1768, in the 79th year of his age, and the 52d year of his miniſtry." This will carry back the time of the Rev. Mr. Dorr's ordination to the year, 1716. The Rev. Joſeph Willard ſucceeded Mr. Dorr in the work of the goſpel miniſtry in Mendon, whereunto he was ſolemnly conſecrated on the 19th of April, 1769. He was diſmiſſed from his paſtoral relation to this Church and people, on the 4th of December, 1782, in the 13th year of his miniſtry. This diſmiſſion of Mr. Willard was occaſioned by the coldneſs and inattention of the people. The Rev. Mr. Willard was inſtalled Paſtor of the Church and flock of God in Boxborough, in the county of Middleſex, on the 2d of November, 1785, where he lives in
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:026481_0057_0FD05655C8E0ACB0"/>
peace and harmony with his people. The Rev. Caleb Alexander ſucceeded Mr. Willard as Paſtor of the firſt Church and congregation in Mendon, (the fifth in ſucceſſion) where he was inſtalled the 12th of April, 1786, in the 31ſt year of his age, and where he continues in his ſacred employment. This gentleman had been previouſly ſettled at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marlborough in the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is a ſecond pariſh in this town, which was incorporated as a diſtinct precinct for miniſterial purpoſes, by the appellation of "The ſouth pariſh in Mendon," in the year 1766. In this ſame year the congr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gational inhabitants of this pariſh began to build them a meetinghouſe for the publick worſhip of God, and accompliſhed the work in a ſhort time. And in the year 1768, the Church of Chriſt, in this ſouth pariſh was imbodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Rev. Benjamin Balch was ordained their Paſtor. And on Saturday morning March 27th, 1772, before daylight, Mr. Balch left the pariſh, without knowledge or conſent of the people of his charge. Mr. Balch was, a few years ſince, inſtalled at Barrington in Newhampſhire. About one half of the people of this ſouth pariſh have been Anabaptiſts and Quakers, ever ſince that part of the town was firſt ſettled, which was about 90 years ago. And from the time when Mr. Balch left this pariſh, the congregational intereſt therein has been in a declining ſtate. They ſeldom have any preaching; nor is there any preſent proſpect of
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:026481_0058_0FD05657492A34E8"/>
their ever having another miniſter ſettled among them.</p>
               <p>As to the religious ſtate of both pariſhes in Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, let it ſuffice to ſay, there are, in general, three denominations, Congregationaliſts, Anabaptiſts, and Friends. There is another claſs without a name. A ſmall ſociety of Friends are very punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in attending their form of worſhip; and they have a very decent meetinghouſe for the purpoſe. Some who are, politically, Friends, do not intereſt themſelves much in any form. There is not in the town any incorporated ſociety of Anabaptiſts. They who are of this perſuaſion, go ſometimes on the ſabbath to other towns, to attend publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in their way.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid what will be thought ſufficient, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the religious ſtate and eccleſiaſtical polity of Mendon, ſome Geographical Deſcription of the town ſhall now be preſented to the reader.</p>
               <p>The land, in general, is good, though there is ſome which is rough and hard: The ſoil is rich and very productive. It is moſtly high, hilly land, yet not very uneven: And there is a ſufficiency of ſtones to fence their farms. The old pariſh abounds principally in mowing and paſture land. The ſouth pariſh is better adapted to grain. The town is excellent for orcharding, and all kinds of fruit trees. There are three high hills in this place, from either of which the four Newengland States, may be ſeen, in a fair day. They are known by the following names, <hi>Caleb</hi>'s <hi>Hill,</hi> this is near the centre of the town; <hi>Wigwam Hill,</hi> is ſituated a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:026481_0059_0FD05658C94C10E0"/>
to the ſouth weſt, from Caleb's Hill; and <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kee</hi> or Miſqueo Hill, this lies in the northweſt corner of the town, and part of it falls within the limits of Upton.</p>
               <p>The groves of wood here are, in general, very thrifty and tall, conſiſting for the moſt part of walnut and oak. There are fine foreſts of moſt excellent cheſnut, ſuitable for buildings or for fences.</p>
               <p>The town of Mendon, like almoſt all other high, hilly, rocky places, is moiſt, rich, ſtrong land, well watered with numerous ſprings and rivulets: But there are no ſtreams of note, except two: The firſt is Charles River, which touches on the eaſtern part of this town. This River takes its riſe from a marſhy place in the ſouthweſt part of Hopkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in the county of Middleſex, and runs ſouth, through Milford in this county, and the eaſterly part of Mendon, and then paſſes on to Belling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, in the county of Suffolk. The ſecond is Mill River, which alſo originates in the ſouthweſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern part of Hopkinton, and, running through the weſtern part of Milford, paſſes through the eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſide of Mendon, and croſſing the road to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, joins Blackſtone River, near Winſooket Falls, in the town of Cumberland, in the State of Rhodeiſland. There is but one Pond in this town, ſituated in the weſtern part of it, and called <hi>Taft</hi>'s <hi>Pond</hi>; it is large, and affords great plenty of the uſual ſorts of hook fiſh. There is no viſible ſtream which runs into this pond; but a ſtream iſſues from it ſufficient to carry a griſt mill. On
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:026481_0060_0FD0565A4A573398"/>
theſe rivers and ſtreams, within the town, there are five griſt mills, two ſaw mills, two clothiers' works, and one forge. There is ſome good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val lands upon theſe ſtreams, and ſome bodies of excellent meadows, and induſtry might make more.</p>
               <p>The people ſubſiſt chiefly by farming; they have indeed the common mechanicks, and one or two dealers in European, Eaſt and Weſtindia goods: And here they have both pot and pearl aſh works.</p>
               <p>The place derives great benefit from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick roads which paſs through it in various direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The road from the northerly part of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, paſſes through Mendon to Boſton. The poſt road from Worceſter to Providence alſo goes through this town; as alſo a road, of much travel, from Vermont and Newhampſhire, and the north part of the county of Worceſter into the State of Rhodeiſland. Mendon is ſituated quite at the ſoutheaſt angle of the county; and is 37 miles from Boſton, to the ſouthweſt, and 18 miles from the Courthouſe in Worceſter. When the late enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration was made there were 222 dwelling houſes, and 1555 inhabitants, in the place. It has ſtood as the twelfth among the towns, in the proportion it pays to a ſtate tax.</p>

A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of inhabitants of Ipſwich, in the county of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, petitioned the General Court for a tract of land, and obtained their requeſt, in the words following, "At a great and general Court of election held at Boſton the 20th of May, 1660. In anſwer to a petition of ſeveral inhabitants of Ipſwich, this court judgeth it meet to grant the petitioners ſix miles ſquare, or ſo much land as ſhall be contained in ſuch a compaſs, in a place near Quaboag pond." The grantees, that they might have a juſt and equitable, as well as a legal, right to the land, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it of the natives, who claimed and poſſeſſed it, and it was conveyed to them by deed. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great diſadvantages under which they then laboured, in the infancy of our country, in the midſt of the Indian enemy, and no Engliſh ſettlements nearer than Marlborough on the eaſt, and Springfield on the weſt, the inhabitants ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and flouriſhed, as that upon application to the General Court, they were incorporated into a townſhip, by the name of Brookfield, by an act which bears date, October 15th, 1673. But the court appointed and continued a committee of three gentlemen, belonging to other places, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:026481_0062_0FD0565D4A9EAC78"/>
regulate and ratify all affairs relative to ſettling and building up the town. A committee, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as aforeſaid, petitioned the General Court to be releaſed from ſuch ſervices, and prayed that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants might be left to conduct and manage their own affairs, which was granted November 12th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1718. The inhabitants, not ſatisfied with their firſt grant, petitioned the Court for more land, when an act paſſed December 3, 1719, making the town eight miles ſquare.</p>
               <p>In the year 1675, not two years after its incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, Brookfield was utterly deſtroyed by the Indians, when the inhabitants conſiſted of about twenty families; they had then a houſe for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip, and preaching, but no ſettled miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The circumſtances of its deſolation are of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to be tranſmitted to poſterity, and I ſhall relate them, as I have collected and laid them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from the late Governor Hutchinſon's hiſtory of Maſſachuſetts, the Rev. Mr. Hubbard's hiſtory of the Indian war, and Capt. Thomas Wheeler's narrative thereof. "The Nipnet or Nipmuck <note n="*" place="bottom">"Theſe were ſeated upon leſs rivers and lakes, or large ponds, where Oxford now is, and towns near it." Hutchinſon's hiſtory.</note> Indians, having on the 14th of July, 1675, killed four or five people at Mendon, the governor and council, in hopes of reclaiming them, ſent Capt. Edward Hutchinſon, of Boſton, to Quaboag, Brookfield, near which place there was to be a great rendezvous of thoſe Indians, to treat with ſeveral Sachems, in order to the publick peace: and ordered Capt. Thomas Wheeler, of Concord, with a part of his troop, about 20 men, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:026481_0063_0FD0565EC9CC3D60"/>
him for ſecurity and aſſiſtance. They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the Lord's day, Auguſt the 1ſt, and ſent a meſſage to the Indians, deſiring to treat with them. Three of the chief Sachems promiſed to meet them next morning about eight o'clock, Auguſt 2d, upon a plain at the head of Wickaboug Pond, two or three miles weſt of the meetinghouſe. Captains Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon and Wheeler, with their company, and three of the principal inhabitants of Brookfield, Capt. John Ayres, John Coye, and Joſeph Pritchard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thither at the appointed time, but found not the Indians there. They then rode forward about four or five miles towards the Nipnet's chief town. When they came to a place called Mominimiſſet, a narrow paſſage, between a ſteep hill and a thick ſwamp, they were ambuſhed by two or three hundred Indians, who ſhot down eight of the company, viz. Zechariah Phillips of Boſton, Timothy Farley of Billerica, Edward Colburn of Chelmsford, Samuel Smedley of Concord, Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach Hapgood of Sudbury, and Capt. Ayres, John Coye and Joſeph Pritchard of Brookfield, named above, and mortally wounded Capt. Hutchinſon. The reſt eſcaped, through a bye path, to Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. The Indians flocked into the town; but the inhabitants, being alarmed, had all got together in the principal houſe, on an eminence, a little to the ſoutheaſt of where the weſt pariſh meetinghouſe now ſtands. They had the mortification to ſee all their dwelling houſes, about 20, with all their barns and outhouſes burnt. The houſe where they had aſſembled, was then ſurrounded, and a variety of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026481_0064_0FD05660481922A8"/>
attempts were made for two days and nights to ſet fire to it, but did not ſucceed. At length, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 4th, at evening, the Indians filled a cart with hemp, and other combuſtible matter, which they kindled, and endeavoured to thruſt to the houſe in order to fire it; but this attempt was defeated, partly by a ſhower of rain which fell and wet the materials, as Capt. Wheeler ſays in his narrative, who was on the ſpot, and partly by aid arriving: For Major Willard, who had been ſent after ſome other Indians weſtward of Lancaſter and Groton, hearing of the diſtreſs of Brookfield, when he was about four or five miles from Lancaſter, altered his courſe, and the ſame night reached Brookfield, with Capt. Parker, and 46 men about an hour after it was dark, after a tedious march of 30 miles. And though the Indian ſcouts diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered him and fired their alarm guns, yet the main body, from their high joy, always accompanied with a horrid noiſe, heard them not. Willard joined the beſieged, and the Indians immediately poured in all the ſhot they could, but without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and then burning all the buildings, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this garriſon, and deſtroying all the horſes and cattle they could find, withdrew to their dens. They were not purſued being much ſuperiour in number.</p>
               <p>It is fitting to add to the above, the very partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular account, which the Rev. Dr. Fiſke of Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, has given in a marginal note, annexed to an hiſtorical diſcourſe concerning the ſettlement of this town, and its diſtreſſes during the Indian wars,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026481_0065_0FD05661CEACAB08"/>
preached December 31ſt, 1775, and immediately publiſhed. The account is as follows, viz. "That three of the men killed in the ambuſhment, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Brookfield, as above named: That when the Indians purſued the party into the town, they ſet fire to all the buildings except a few in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the houſe in which the inhabitants had taken ſhelter: That they endeavoured to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept five or ſix men who had gone to a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe to ſecure ſome things there: But they all got ſafe to the place of refuge, except a young man, Samuel Pritchard, who was ſtopped ſhort by a fatal bullet: That the houſe in which they were beſieged was unfortified, except by a few logs haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tumbled up on the outſide, after the alarm, and by a few feather beds hung up on the inſide. And though the ſiege continued from Monday in the afternoon, until early on Thurſday morning, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 5th, in which time innumerable balls entered the houſe, only one man, Henry Young, who was in the chamber, was killed. The Indians ſhot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fire arrows to burn the houſe, but without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.—When the troop which relieved Brookfield, got into the town, which was late at night, they were joined by great numbers of cattle, which had collected together in their fright at the conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the buildings, and the firing and war whoops of the Indians: and for protection theſe poor ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals followed the troop till they arrived at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged houſe. The Indians deceived hereby, and thinking there was a much larger number of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than there really was, immediately ſet fire to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026481_0066_0FD0566350716960"/>
the barn belonging to the beſieged houſe, and to Joſeph Pritchard's houſe and barn, and the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe, which were the only buildings left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnt, and went off. A garriſon was maintained at this houſe till winter, when the court ordered the people away, ſoon after which the Indians came and burnt this houſe alſo."</p>
               <p>Having mentioned Major Willard, Capt. Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon and Capt. Wheeler, it will be proper to ſay ſomething further reſpecting each of them.—Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Hutchinſon and Wheeler, tarried at Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field until Auguſt 13th, and then, with moſt of their men, ſet off for their homes; they arrived at Marlborough the next day, where Capt. Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon, fatigued with his journey and his wound growing worſe, died Auguſt 19th, and was there buried the next day, Auguſt 20th, 1675.</p>
               <p>Captain Wheeler, who accompanied Capt. Hutchinſon, and ſaw him buried, the next day, Auguſt 21ſt, arrived ſafe at Concord, where he and they who returned with him, kept October 21ſt, 1675, as a day of praiſe and thankſgiving to God for their remarkable deliverance and ſafe return, when the Rev. Mr. Bulkley of Concord preached a ſermon to them from thoſe words in Pſalm cxvi.12, ¿ "What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me?" which was printed.</p>
               <p>Major Willard tarried at Brookfield, and at Hadley and the adjacent towns, for ſeveral weeks, and then returned to Groton, where the ſafety of that and ſome neighbouring towns required his preſence. He was ſoon after diſplaced for going
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026481_0067_0FD05664C9EB3AF8"/>
to Brookfield without orders, or while under orders to march another way. The Rev. Dr. Fiſke's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations hereupon in a note, are well worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in this place. "Major Willard's conduct in altering his courſe and coming to the relief of Brookfield, being dictated by humanity and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with bravery and ſucceſs, has gained him the applauſe of people in general. But as it was beſide his orders, he was cenſured by the court and caſhier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which diſguſted his friends, and broke his heart. And though the puniſhment may ſeem too rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet it is to be remembered, that if commanders of parties, ſent upon particular expeditions, may take liberty to vary from their expreſs orders, nothing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual could be accompliſhed, and only confuſion, diſappointment, loſs, and in many caſes ruin, would be likely to enſue."</p>
               <p>To return to Brookfield. The town, totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Indians in Auguſt 1675, lay in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins ſeveral years, and the inhabitants were diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. "But, ſays the Rev. Dr. Fiſke, in the ſermon above referred to, peace being ſettled with the Indians, ſome of the diſperſed, after a while, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the place of their former habitation, and in conjunction with others, gradually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled the town, ſo that in the year 1692, they had a committee appointed by the court, as formerly, to direct and regulate the ſettlement of ſaid plantation and the affairs thereof. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill in the midſt of a wilderneſs, and always expoſed to the blood thirſty ſavages, whenever they
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:026481_0068_0FD056664C2F9930"/>
ſhould take it into their heads to moleſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, its increaſe and improvements were ſlow."</p>
               <p>In the war which is commonly denominated Queen Anne's war, which broke out not long after the reſettlement of the town, and continued ſeveral years, Brookfield, as well as many other towns, was greatly haraſſed and annoyed; the Indians frequently making ſudden inroads, killing and ſcalping, or captivating one and another of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. During this war, a number of men, women and children were killed, ſeveral taken priſoners, and ſome were wounded. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are as follow, as related by the Rev. Dr. Fiſke, in the ſermon above referred to. "The firſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief was in the latter end of July or beginning of Auguſt 1692. A party of Indians came into the town and broke up two or three families. Joſeph Woolcot being at work at a little diſtance from his houſe, his wife, being fearful, took her children and went out to him. When they returned to the houſe at noon, they found the Indians had been there, for his gun and ſeveral other things were miſſing. And looking out at a window he ſaw an Indian, at ſome diſtance, coming towards the houſe. He immediately ſent out his wife and his two little daughters to hide themſelves in the buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and he taking his little ſon under his arm and his broad ax in his hand, went out with his dog in ſight of the Indian. The dog being large and fierce, attacked the Indian ſo furiouſly, that he was obliged to diſcharge his gun at the dog to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of him; immediately upon which Woolcot
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:026481_0069_0FD05667C9DE17B0"/>
ſat down the child and purſued the Indian till he heard the bullet roll down his gun, the Indian charging as he ran; he then turned back, ſnatched up his child and made his eſcape, through the ſwamps, to a fort. His wife being greatly terrified, diſcovered by her ſhrieks where ſhe was; and the Indian ſoon found and diſpatched both her and her children. Others of the party about the ſame time, came into the houſe of one Maſon while the family were at dinner. They killed Maſon and one or two children, and took his wife and an infant which they had wounded, and carried them off. They alſo took two brothers, Thomas and Daniel Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; they ſoon diſpatched Thomas, pretending he had miſinformed them about the number of men which were in the town. John Lawrence, their brother, rode with all haſte to Springfield for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. A company, under Capt. Colton, came with the greateſt ſpeed and purſued the Indians. They found Mrs. Maſon's child, which the ſavages had knocked on the head and thrown away in the buſhes; and continuing their purſuit, they came upon the Indians' encampment, which was a ſort of bruſh hedge, which they deridingly called "En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen's fort." The party waited till break of day, and then came ſo near as to put their guns through this bruſh and fire upon the Indians, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fifteen of whom were killed, the reſt fled with ſuch precipitation as to leave ſeveral of their arms, blankets, powderhorns, &amp;c. and their priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Daniel Lawrence and Mrs. Maſon, whom our men conducted back. This ſame John Lawrence,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:026481_0070_0FD05669491539D0"/>
who rode expreſs and procured the company which reſcued the abovementioned priſoners, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards going in company with one Samuel Owen, in ſearch of a man who was miſſing; the Indians came upon them, killed Lawrence, but Owen eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped. Mary MacIntoſh was fired upon and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſhe was milking her cows. Robert Grain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and John Clary were paſſing along the road, on a certain day, and being fired upon by the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, Grainger was killed on the ſpot; Clary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to eſcape, but had not fled far before he alſo was ſhot down. At another time, Thomas Battis of Brookfield, riding expreſs to Hadley, was killed in the wilderneſs, in a place now called Belchertown. Early one morning John Woolcot, a lad about twelve or fourteen years old, was rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſearch of the cows, when the Indians fired at him, killed his horſe from under him and took him priſoner. The people at Jennings's garriſon hearing the firing, and concluding the people at another garriſon were beſet, ſix men ſet out for their aſſiſtance, but were waylayed by the Indians. The Engliſh ſaw not their danger, till they ſaw there was no eſcaping it. And therefore, knowing that an Indian could not look an Engliſhman in the face, and take a right aim, they ſtood their ground, preſenting their pieces wherever they ſaw an Indian, without diſcharging them, excepting Abijah Bartlet, who turned to flee and was ſhot dead. The Indians kept firing at the reſt and wounded three of them, Joſeph Jennings in two places; one ball grazed the top of his head, by
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026481_0071_0FD0566B4EFDF788"/>
which he was ſtruck blind for a moment; another ball paſſed through his ſhoulder, wounding his collar bone, yet by neither did he fall, nor was he mortally wounded. Benjamin Jennings was wounded in the leg, and John Green in the wriſt. They were preſerved at laſt by the following ſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agem. A large dog, hearing the firing, came to our men; one of whom, to encourage his breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and intimidate the Indians, called out, "Capt. Williams is come to our aſſiſtance, for here is his dog." The Indians, ſeeing the dog, and knowing Williams to be a famous warrior, immediately fled, and our men eſcaped. John Woolcot the lad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned, was carried to Canada, where he remained ſix or ſeven years, during which time, by converſing wholly with Indians, he not only loſt his native language, but became ſo naturalized to the ſavages, as to be unwilling, for a while, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his native country. Some years afterwards, viz. in March, 1728, in a time of peace, he and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man having been hunting, and coming down Connecticut River with a freight of ſkins and fur, they were hailed by ſome Indians; but not being willing to go to them, they ſteered for another ſhore. The Indians landed at a little diſtance from them; ſeveral ſhots were exchanged, at length Woolcot was killed.</p>
               <p>The laſt miſchief which was done by the ſavages, in Brookfield, was about the 20th of July, 1710. Six men, viz. Ebenezer Hayward, John White, Stephen and Benjamin Jennings, John Groſvenor and Joſeph Kellog, were making hay in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:026481_0072_0FD0566C4892E2A0"/>
when the Indians, who had been watching an opportunity to ſurpriſe them, ſprung ſuddenly upon them, diſpatched five of them, and took the other, John White, priſoner. White ſpying a ſmall company of our people at ſome diſtance, jumped from the Indian who held him, and ran to join his friends; but the Indian fired after him, and wounded him in the thigh, by which he fell; but ſoon recovering and running again, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain fired at and received his death wound."</p>
               <p>Great indeed were the difficulties, diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and hardſhips, under which this then infant plantation laboured, ſo that it was more than forty years from the breaking up of the town, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt meetinghouſe, before they erected an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. A church was gathered, and the Rev. Thomas Cheney was ordained their firſt Paſtor, the third Wedneſday of October, 1717. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their miniſter a little more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So rapidly did the town increaſe and flouriſh, after the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their firſt miniſter, that on March 29th, 1750, a ſecond pariſh was incorporated in the northerly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt of the town. Here a church was gathered May 28th, 1752, and the Rev. Eli Forbes was ordained their firſt miniſter on the third of June the ſame year. Mr. Harding continued the miniſter of the firſt precinct until the people fell into a moſt unhappy controverſy about erecting a
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:026481_0073_0FD0566DCA760E08"/>
new meetinghouſe. The contention was ſo ſharp, and the oppoſite parties ſo uncomplying that they parted, and formed two diſtinct religious ſocieties. The act for dividing the firſt pariſh, and incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the third precinct paſſed November 8th, 1754. In conſequence hereof, Mr. Harding requeſted a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which was granted by the church and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a mutual eccleſiaſtical council, May 8th, 1755. After his diſmiſſion the Rev. Joſeph Parſons was ordained Paſtor of the firſt church and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, on the 23d of November, 1757. A church was gathered in the third pariſh, or eaſt precinct, April 15th, 1756, and on the 24th of May, 1758, the Rev. Nathan Fiſke, D. D. was ordained their ſpiritual overſeer, and ſtill continues. Mr. Parſons continued Paſtor of the firſt church upwards of thirteen years, being releaſed from the ſickneſs and pains of this mortal ſtate January 17th, 1771, in the fourteenth year of his miniſtry, and 38th of his age. In about nine months after his deceaſe, viz. on October 23d, 1771, the Rev. Ephraim Ward was ſeparated to the paſtoral office, the fourth in ſucceſſion in the firſt church and precinct.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Forbes continued in the faithful diſcharge of the miniſterial work among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the ſecond precinct almoſt 23 years; and on the 1ſt of March, 1775, the paſtoral relation was diſſolved by mutual conſent, under the conduct of an eccleſiaſtical council, each party in charity with, and heartily recommending the other. To him ſucceeded, as ſecond Paſtor of the ſecond precinct, the Rev. Joſeph Appleton, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="75" facs="unknown:026481_0074_0FD0566F483EB7C0"/>
ſeparated to the work of the goſpel miniſtry, October 30th, 1776.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Forbes was, June 5th, 1776, inſtall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Paſtor of the firſt church in Glouceſter, Cape Anne, where he continues, faithfully ſerving God in the goſpel of his Son. It is fitting farther to obſerve, that Mr. Forbes, while miniſter in Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, went repeatedly Chaplain to provincial regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the laſt French war, to the weſtward, which qualified him the better to endure the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and fatigues of a miſſion to the weſtern tribes of Indians, which he was requeſted by the board of Commiſſioners at Boſton to undertake. His people were at firſt averſe to his going; but were at length prevailed upon by a committee of that board to conſent, May 30th, 1762, that he might go for a few months. He accordingly ſet out the firſt of June, with Mr. Rice, now miniſter of Weſtminſter and Mr. Eliſha Gunn of Montague, for an interpreter: They followed Mohawk River about 70 miles, then turned ſouthward to lake Oſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ego near <hi>Cherry Valley,</hi> (this lake makes the head of one of the main branches of Suſquehannah Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) croſſed the lake, went down that river 120 miles to a town called <hi>Onoquagie,</hi> pleaſantly ſituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the eaſtern bank of the Suſquehannah, then containing 30 houſes, 40 families, and 300 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, beſides upwards of 20 warriors. Here they arrived June 21ſt, 1762. Near this place were two ſmall towns of Tuſcaroras. Here he preached; opened two ſchools, one for adults, and another for children; gathered a church; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026481_0075_0FD05670C98A94C8"/>
ſpecial ordinances to them; and left them September 1ſt, 1762, under the care of Mr. Rice. During his ſtay there, he baptized great numbers; ſome brought their children 60 and 70 miles to receive Chriſtian baptiſm: They were moſtly infants, whoſe parents had been baptized by former miſſionaries, or in the Dutch or Engliſh churches in the vicinity of Albany.</p>
               <p>Having gone through with the eccleſiaſtical hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Brookfield, a Geographical Deſcription thereof ſhall now be preſented.</p>
               <p>Brookfield is diſtant from the Statehouſe in Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton between ſixty and ſeventy miles. The great poſt road from Boſton to Newyork, runs through it; and the ſixty one mile ſtone ſtands near the eaſtern boundary, and the ſeventy mileſtone near the weſtern line. This town is bounded on the eaſt by Spencer; on the ſouth by Sturbridge and Weſtern; on the weſt, by Weſtern and Ware; and on the north, by Newbraintree and Oakham. It is a townſhip of moſt excellent land in general. The face of the town is pretty uneven and ſtony, though there are three or four plains of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extent within it, one eſpecially in the firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, extenſive, excellent for raiſing grain, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful for building ſpots, and large tracts of mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow and interval upon Quaboag River, which runs in a weſterly direction through the town. The main branch of this river comes from Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, another branch iſſues from North Pond, ſo called, in Leiceſter, and, running through Spencer, falls into Quaboag River in the eaſterly part of Brookfield.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:026481_0076_0FD04FD40D13ABE8"/>The land is generally fertile, and richly repays the cultivator for his labour and pains; and there is ſuch a variety of ſoils, as to be ſuited to tillage, grazing, mowing and fruit. All kinds of grain are raiſed here to advantage; and farmers here, as well as elſewhere are making great improvements in huſbandry.</p>
               <p>There is ſo little deſcent in Quaboag river for five miles, that the current is very ſluggiſh, the waters almoſt ſtagnant, and the extenſive meadows on each ſide are of ſmall value in their preſent ſtate, being ſo liable to be overflowed. This evil has been growing for many years, through increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſtructions in ſo torpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By much labour and expenſe in clearing the channel of obſtructions, this evil may be cured. A trial was made laſt year by the proprietors of the meadows, whereof they reaped, ſenſibly, good effects; and hence are encouraged to a determined perſeverance. Beſides this flat meadow, there are large tracts of ſwaley or ſwampy land, which yield conſiderable quantities of fowlmeadow and other valuable graſſes, to the amount of two tons on an acre when made into hay.</p>
               <p>There is one large pond in the ſouth precinct of the extent of a mile ſquare, called by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians Quaboag Pond; but now more generally denominated Podunk Pond, from a tract of mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow adjoining, which the Indians called Podunk.

Quaboag river advances directly to the very bank of this pond; then turns, almoſt at right angles, and runs parallel with the edge about twenty rods, leaving a narrow beach or ridge; then diverges ſo as to form a ſmall iſland, upon which ſhrubs, alders and buſhes are growing; then bends its courſe and opens a channel into the pond, at the northeaſt, running nearly through the middle of it, and paſſes off in an outlet at the weſterly edge. Cloſe to the ſide of the pond where the river en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is a large bridge, there being a county road along the beach of this pond, for more than half a mile; and travellers paſs about twenty rods on a narrow ridge, between the river and pond, which, though very moderately ſloping on the ſide next the pond, is perpendicular on the ſide of the river, and is generally overflowed in the ſpring and fall, to the hazard and ſometimes ſuſpenſion of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. This beach had formerly a row of large pines and ſwamp white oaks growing upon it. But the floods, agitated by the winds, have ſo waſhed away the ſoil, that the moſt of them are dead and blown down, and the beach is gradually wearing away.</p>
               <p>On the ſouth of this pond, and about a quarter of a mile diſtant, is another pond, of not more than half the amplitude of the former, known by the name of the South Pond. This communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with, and empties its redundant waters into the larger pond, by a creek or brook, except in the time of a freſhet, when the waters flow ſo much

faſter into the great pond as to reverſe the current of the brook, and repleniſh the leſſer.</p>
               <p>There is another conſiderable pond in the weſt precinct, called Wickoboag Pond, from whence quantities of iron ore are annually collected. This pond is ſupplied by ſeveral rivulets, and has one large outlet into the river, about twenty or thirty rods in length, called Laſhaway. Theſe ponds and rivers, and the other ſmaller ſtreams, by which the land is interſected, are plentifully furniſhed with pickerel, perch, and divers other kinds of fiſh.</p>
               <p>On the rivers and ſtreams in the town, there are ſeven griſt mills, ſix ſaw mills, and three fulling mills. Mr. Jenks, beſides his mills, proſecutes the blackſmiths' buſineſs largely, and has two trip ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and a grindſtone carried by water.</p>
               <p>One of the clothiers' works above referred to, is in the firſt pariſh; a very convenient ſituation indeed for carrying on the clothiers' buſineſs in all its branches. Ellis and company are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors hereof. About 5000 yards of cloth are annually dreſſed at theſe works. Theſe men have obtained the art of coloring ſcarlet, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judges pronounce equal to any which is imported; an art which few in this Commonwealth have attained unto.</p>
               <p>In a conſiderable part of the low lands, the clay lies near the ſurface. There is much clay adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſouth pond, and clay forms the bed of the river. No mines have, as yet, been diſcovered, although ſearch therefor has been made at no

ſmall expenſe. There is ſome iron ore, a bed of yellow ocre nearly exhauſted, and large quantities, both of mud and ſtone, which yield copperas, and contain a ſtrong vitriolic quality. Many of the wells, both on high and low grounds, have what is called hard water. There are alſo ſtones which contain ſulphur; but how to extract it has not yet been diſcovered.</p>
               <p>There are two large hills, principally in the firſt pariſh. One is called Coye's Hill, and ſuppoſed to take its name from one Coye, a proprietor of, and an early inhabitant in Brookfield. This hill extends into Weſtern. The other is called <hi>Ragged Hill,</hi> probably from its extreme rough and rocky appearance. Both theſe hills are excellent for mowing, for paſturing, and for orcharding; and there are ſeveral very good farms upon them. Partly between theſe two hills there is a large ledge of rocks, which in all probability was rent aſunder ages ago, by an earthquake: The rock on one ſide is ſhelving over, and the opening made is ſufficient to contain an hundred men; and the appearance indicates that it was formerly a place of rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous for Indians. This place is called by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Brookfield, <hi>The Stone Houſe.</hi>

This place has been famed for the longevity, and

In 1782, a Mr. Green, then above ninety, followed his fifth child, a woman in her ſixty ſecond year, to the grave, above four miles, riding erect and ſteady, on a lively horſe. He died not long ſince, in the vicinity of Hanover in Newhampſhire, aged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of an 100 years. Alſo in 1782, died the widow Elizabeth Olds in her 92d year. Her poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity were as follow; ten children, ſeventy three grand children, two hundred and one great grand children, and two of the fifth generation; two of her grand daughters being grandmothers. Total, two hundred and eighty ſix. Of theſe, two hundred and thirty two were living at her deceaſe. In 1788, died Mr. Cyprian Rice, in the ninety eighth year of his age; and in a few months after died Mr. Eliſha Rice, his brother, in the ninety ninth year of his age. They were born at Marlborough. They left not a numerous iſſue. There is now living in Brookfield a Mr. Thomas Ainſworth, who ſuppoſes he is the laſt ſurviving ſoldier who was in the famous Lovell's fight.</p>

               <p>THIS was a grant made by the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment in the year 1682, to Joſeph Dudley, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor, to William Stoughton, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Lieutenant-governor of Maſſachuſetts, to Major Robert Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Meſſrs.

The grant expreſſed eight miles ſquare; but as ſurveyed and located, it muſt be near twelve miles in length from eaſt to weſt, and about nine in width, from north to ſouth, comprehending all Charlton, a part of Dudley, and a part of Ward. It was originally bounded weſt, on Newmedfield, (now Sturbridge) north, on a tract of land called the Country Gore,

others, of a part of the original grant, dated July 8th, 1713, that they might ſettle and build up the town. The firſt town meeting held in Oxford for the choice of town officers was on the 22d of July, 1713. The people inhabiting this territory were in continual fears from the natives; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, the ſettlement of the town went on but ſlowly for many years. Except what has been related above, I cannot find that any perſons were killed by the Indians in Oxford. But Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Hutchinſon gives a piece of hiſtory, which muſt not be omitted in this work. It is in theſe words. "On the ſixth of Auguſt, 1724, four In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians came upon a ſmall houſe in Oxford, which was built under a hill. They made a breach in the roof, and as one of them was attempting to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he received a ſhot in his belly from a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous woman, the only perſon in the houſe, who had two muſkets and two piſtols charged, and was prepared for all four, but they thought fit to retreat, carrying off the dead, or wounded man." It is pity the name of this heroine has not been preſerved, that it might be handed down to lateſt poſterity.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſettlers in Oxford, conſidering the then ſtate of the country, took early care for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſupport of a preached goſpel, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Chriſtianity among them: According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt church of Chriſt in this place was gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered January 18th, 1721, and the Rev. John Campbell was ordained the firſt miniſter, that ſame year, viz. March 11th, 1721. This gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:026481_0084_0FD0567DCCC9F0E8"/>
came from the north of Scotland; was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated at Edinburgh, and received the honours of that Univerſity. He came into America in the year 1717. He continued the worthy and faithful paſtor of the church and flock here, until May 25th, 1761, when he died in the 71ſt year of his age, and in the 42d of his miniſtry.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Campbell was ſucceeded in the ſacred office by the Rev. Joſeph Bowman, who was inſtalled here November 14th, 1764. (This Mr. Bowman was firſt ordained at Boſton, Auguſt 31ſt, 1762, to the work of the goſpel miniſtry, more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, among the Mohawk Indians on the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern borders of Newengland. He went to Onoho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quague, an Indian town on the Suſquehannah, in October following. He returned the laſt of May, 1763; but hoſtilities commencing between the Indians tribes in June, he did not go back to them; and the war continuing, he was, by the board of commiſſioners, diſmiſſed from his miſſion in June, 1764.)—Mr. Bowman lived in great harmony with the people of Oxford until 1775, when the then ſtate of the country, as to the controverſy and war with Greatbritain, occaſioned differences among the people; theſe led a number to profeſs themſelves Quakers, and then they declared themſelves to be of the ſect, called Univerſaliſts, which finally ended in Mr. Bowman's diſmiſſion, at his deſire, with advice of council, Auguſt 28th, 1782. After his removal from Oxford, the Rev. Mr. Bowman was inſtalled at Bernard, in the State of Vermont, September 22, 1784, where he ſtill continues, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying

               <p>The Rev. Elias Dudley was ordained ſucceſſor to Mr. Bowman at Oxford, April 13th, 1791.</p>
               <p>In the town of Oxford there is a ſociety of them who are denominated Univerſaliſts, (about a fifth of the inhabitants:) Theſe, with ſome families from ſeveral neighbouring towns, make a reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſociety: And they have erected a large elegant meetinghouſe, towards the ſouth end of Oxford plain, where the road from Connecticut interſects the road from Worceſter to Dudley. This houſe is conſtructed upon the moſt modern plan, with a tower and bell. This ſociety have not, as yet, any ſettled miniſter. There is alſo a number in Oxford of the Anabaptiſt perſuaſion; they are deſtitute of any ſtated teacher.</p>
               <p>We will now give ſome Geographical Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this town. Oxford, though very extenſive at firſt, has been much curtailed, nevertheleſs, it is ſtill a large and reſpectable town, being about ſeven miles in length from north to ſouth, and about five miles in width from eaſt to weſt. The preſent boundaries of Oxford are as follow; north, it is bounded on Leiceſter, Ward, and a country gore of land: Eaſt, by Sutton; ſouth, by a gore of land, and Dudley; and weſt, by Charlton. When the late cenſus was taken there were 150 houſes, and 1000 inhabitants in the town. The town of Oxford is not very hilly and uneven: In the centre thereof there is a large and fine plain of
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:026481_0086_0FD05680886EFF20"/>
a mile and a half in length, and about a mile in width: This plain is almoſt wholly under culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and is pretty level. On this plain, the road from Worceſter to the eaſterly part of Connecticut, and to Rhodeiſland, runs from the north to the ſouth: Near the north end of it ſtands the congregational meetinghouſe; and about a mile ſouth of this is the meetinghouſe of the ſociety of Univerſaliſts: Theſe houſes are both large and elegant: On ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the ſtreet there are many good build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and almoſt the whole plain is under the eye of the traveller at once. From the plain the lands riſe on all ſides, eſpecially on the eaſt and on the weſt; but not very high. The ſoil on the plain is good for grain of all kinds; but not ſo for paſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or mowing. But the higher lands are very good for mowing, paſturing and orcharding, the ſoil is ſtrong and fertile. Dudley hills, ſo called, on the ſouth, which are pretty high, fall partly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of Oxford. About three quarters of a mile weſt of the great road on the plain, runs French River from the north to the ſouth, which falls into the river Quinebaug in the town of Thompſon in the State of Connecticut. This river derived its name from the French proteſtants who firſt ſettled in Oxford. On this river are ſome very good meadows of ſeveral hundreds of acres. On the eaſt ſide of the plain there is a fine ſtream, which heads in Great Meadow, ſo called, in the norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part of the town, containing 100 acres, or more. By the ſides of this ſtream there are ſome pretty good meadows. This brook empties into French
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:026481_0087_0FD056FE8A2F6048"/>
River. Potaſh Brook, ſo called, which is never dry, is a fine rivulet, and falls into the above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are two very pretty ponds in the town: One in the weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part, called Augootſback: The other a little north of the firſt meetinghouſe on the Worceſter road, known by the name of <hi>Oxford Pond.</hi> There are ſome ſmall cedar ſwamps, in this town, which yield cedar for ſhingles, and other valuable uſes. The town is in general well wooded: On the higher lands are oaks of all kinds, walnut and cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut: On the lower, grow aſh, birch, maple, &amp;c. There is ſome pitch pine in the town: But not much white pine, at this day, that being chiefly taken off. On the plain, there are two or three ſtores of European and India goods: And in the town there are all the common artificers, tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and mechanics; but the body of the people are farmers. The roads of travel through Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford are an advantage to the town—the largeſt road is that which comes from Connecticut through Charlton, Oxford, to Sutton, and ſo on to Boſton, falling into the poſt road in Weſton: The next, is the road from Worceſter, through Oxford, to Dudley, &amp;c. &amp;c. Oxford is ſituated to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt from Boſton, at the diſtance of 54 miles; and from Worceſter courthouſe it is 10 miles, nearly ſouth.</p>

               <p>THIS tract of land was originally purchaſed by a number of gentlemen, of Sachem John Wampus, and his company, Indians who claimed it. Wampus firſt reſerved four miles ſquare, for his countrymen the Indians, which they called <hi>Haſſanamiſco</hi>; this is now Grafton.

However, in the year 1716, three families had got ſeated in the place, and wintered there in the winter of 1716 and 1717, when the great ſnow fell, as our fathers have told us. This ſnow fell on ſome of the laſt days of February, old ſtile, and came ſo deep, that it wholly covered over the hut in which one of the families lived. The man being from home, the family might have periſhed had not an Indian, who knew the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, come to their relief. He found the hut only by the hole which the ſmoke from the fire place had made through the ſnow.</p>
               <p>In September 1717, the fall after the great ſnow, the firſt child was born in the town, named Abigail Marſh, daughter of Mr. Benjamin Marſh, who was afterwards an anabaptiſt elder in the town. This woman is now living, has had four huſbands, and is, at this time, a widow; her name is Chaſe.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of Sutton firſt acted as a body corporate, or held their firſt town meeting on the 3d day of December, 1718, at the dwelling houſe of Mr. John Stockwell. Their buſineſs was to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganize themſelves, and to chooſe a committee to join the proprietors' committee in order to procure preaching. Conſequently they muſt have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated a little before by an act of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:026481_0090_0FD27D9E1408B538"/>
and veſted with full town powers and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges: And this was previous to the incorporation of Leiceſter or Rutland.</p>
               <p>The exact day when the firſt congregational church in Sutton was imbodied cannot be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The record ſays, "In the fall of the year 1720." The firſt miniſter, the Rev. John MacKinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was ordained November 9th, 1720. He was a gentleman of good abilities and had his education in Scotland. Obſerve, by the way, the early care and pains this people took to have the goſpel preached, and a miniſter ſettled among them. In about four years from their beginning the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the place, they had a miniſter ordained.</p>
               <p>Mr. MacKinſtry differed ſo much from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his notions of church government, that they parted: And he was diſmiſſed from his paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral relation to them, September 2d, 1728. This gentleman was afterwards reſettled in Connecticut.</p>
               <p>The ſecond miniſter of the town, the Rev. David Hall, was ordained October 15th, 1729. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the honourary degree of <hi>Doctor of Divinity,</hi> at Dartmouth college, in the year 1777. After a life of piety and uſefulneſs, he died May 8th, 1789, in the 85th year of his age, and the 60th year of his miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Dr. Hall was ſucceeded in the ſacred office by the Rev. Edmund Mills, who was ſeparated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto June 23d, 1790. The people of the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational church and ſociety have lately repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their meetinghouſe, and built a tower to it: And Mr. Ebenezer Warters, a man of large prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:026481_0091_0FD27D57F284A9B8"/>
in the town, has given them a bell weighing about 750 lb. and which coſt upwards of 80<hi>l.</hi> And Mr. Gardner Warters, deceaſed, gave 30<hi>l.</hi> towards a clock for the meetinghouſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond pariſh in Sutton was incorporated by an act of Court, October 28th, 1743. This is about three miles wide, and ſix and one half miles in length; ſo that the old pariſh is much larger. The firſt meeting of the ſecond pariſh was held December 26th, 1743. The ſecond congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al church in the town, was formed by a covenant, dated September 10th, 1747. The Rev. James Welman was conſecrated Paſtor of the ſecond church October 7th, 1747, and was diſmiſſed from office July 22d, 1760. The Rev. Mr. Welman was, in 1768, reſettled at Corniſh, in the county of Cheſhire, in the State of Newhampſhire.</p>
               <p>Mr. Welman was ſucceeded in the paſtoral office, in the ſecond church in Sutton, by the Rev. Eben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezer Chaplain, who was ordained November 14th, 1764.</p>
               <p>There is no record to be found when the firſt Anabaptiſt ſociety was collected in Sutton, nor when Mr. Benjamin Marſh, their firſt elder, was ordained. Tradition ſays, it was about the year 1735. They built a ſmall meetinghouſe about a mile weſterly from the firſt pariſh meetinghouſe. After ſome years part of Elder Marſh's congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion left him, and joining with new ones, in the year 1767 introduced Mr. Jeremiah Barſtow, as their Elder, and built another Anabaptiſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe about a mile further weſterly, on the road
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:026481_0092_0FD27D594414DC60"/>
towards Oxford. In 1772, the major part of Elder Barſtow's ſociety became diſſatisfied with him; he then, with his adherents, aſked a diſmiſſion from the reſt, and adjoined to Elder Marſh and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his ſociety. In January 1775, Elder Marſh died in the 89th year of his age. Mr. Barſtow kept up a ſociety in town, until 1782, when he moved away. In 1783, they introduced Mr. Ebenezer Lamſon as their teacher, and who, continuing with them until the firſt of April, 1788, was then ordained their elder. In the ſoutheaſt part of the town the people have for ſeveral years heard one Mr. William Batcheldor, who lived among them, and in October, 179<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, he was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their elder.</p>
               <p>About ten years paſt, the Shakers made conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearance in the ſecond pariſh, in this town, but have ſome time ſince, wholly ſubſided.</p>
               <p>There have alſo, for ten or twelve years paſt, been a number of the ſect called Univerſaliſts, in Sutton; the moſt of them congregate at Oxford; a few at Grafton. There is one family in town, who profeſs to be Quakers. The number of theſe ſeveral denominations cannot be aſcertained, as many of them are unſtable.</p>
               <p>We will now preſent our readers with ſome To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pographical Deſcription of the town of Sutton.</p>
               <p>The general face of it is hilly land, of a deep loam, pretty rocky, good for orcharding, and for Indian corn and graſs; but indifferent for all other ſorts of grain, and for flax. There are ſeveral mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows and ſwamps, but none very extenſive, or any
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:026481_0093_0FD27D5AD6E82E78"/>
way remarkable. There is a conſiderable body of poor land in the ſouth part of the town; and there is a ſmall quantity of poor, broken land in the northeaſt corner of the ſecond pariſh. There is ſome good, both high and low interval land, on Blackſtone River, ſo called. As this river has its ſource in Sutton, and is ſingular in its formation and courſe, we ſhall attempt a particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. The reputed head of this river is a pond of about 70 acres, called Ramſhorn Pond, becauſe of the crookedneſs of the ſtream which iſſues from it. The pond is ſituated about two miles ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt from the ſecond pariſh meetinghouſe. It has a ſmall inlet at the ſouthweſt part; the outlet is at the northeaſt; and the ſtream runs northeaſt until it comes within about half a mile weſt of ſaid meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe; then bears away northweſt, and runs through Ward, within about half a mile of Ward meetinghouſe; takes in ſeveral ſtreams in that town, which have mills on them, particularly one coming from Leiceſter, called Kettle Brook; paſſes on to Worceſter; and about a mile ſoutherly from the ſouth meetinghouſe, receives Bimilick or Mill Brook, which comes from the North Pond in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, then turns back, running ſoutheaſterly, and comes within half a mile eaſt of Sutton ſecond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh meetinghouſe; paſſes on and takes in the Mill Brook, ſo called, the outlet of a large pond, called Crooked Pond, lying a little weſt of the line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two meetinghouſes in Sutton; and which is about a mile eaſt of the little or Ramſhorn Pond firſt mentioned. The inlet of this pond is on the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:026481_0094_0FD27D5D76F1B838"/>
ſouthweſt, the outlet is northeaſt, has a griſt mill (in the north pariſh near the pond) with two run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which, according to the original grant, has the ſole command of the water. This pond is ſuppoſed to be fed chiefly by ſprings, and is little affected by droughts: Many people from the neighbouring towns bring their grain to this mill, in dry ſeaſons. On this ſame brook, about half a mile below, is Meſſrs. Burbanks' paper mill. A few rods below, is an oil mill. A few rods below the oil mill, is a fulling mill. A few rods below the fulling mill, in the late war, powder mills were erected, but are ſince diſcontinued. A little furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er down, in the year 1776, a gun manufactory was erected, but is ſince converted into a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactory for ſcythes, axes and mill irons; and here they have trip hammers, bellows, and grindſtones, carried by water. Having deſcribed this brook, iſſuing from the pond, and the water works upon it, we return to the river. The river, after it has received this brook, bears away, and runs northeaſt, and eaſt; and takes in a brook from a pond in the northeaſt part of the ſecond pariſh in Sutton, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dorrett</hi>'s <hi>Pond</hi>; having an inlet on the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt; the outlet is at the ſoutheaſt. Said river then runs eaſterly into Grafton, and there receives the ſtream which iſſues from Quinſigamond, or Shrewſbury Long Pond. The river then bears away, and runs ſoutherly through Northbridge and Uxbridge; and, about a mile ſoutheaſt from Uxbridge meetinghouſe, takes in a ſtream which iſſues from a pond chiefly in Sutton, near the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:026481_0095_0FD27D63993556B0"/>
ſouthweſt corner of the town, called Manchaug Pond. This pond has an inlet on the northweſt; the outlet is to the ſoutheaſt, and both in Sutton. This outlet runs along near the ſouth line of Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, until it comes to Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned the river, and the ſtreams, we would juſt obſerve, this town is famed for its manufactures, its mills, and water works. Here are, one paper mill, one oil mill, ten griſt mills, ſix ſaw mills, three fulling mills, ſeven trip ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, five ſcythe and ax makers, one hoe maker; ſeveral who work at nail making; and ſix works for making of potaſh. But here are no mines, no forge, furnace, pearlſhery, nor fiſh of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>There are two or three natural curioſities worthy of particular notice.</p>
               <p>As firſt, In the weſt part of Sutton, within ſixty rods of the riſe of the inlet of Ramſhorn Pond, which is the head of Blackſtone River running to Providence and falling into the ſea at Briſtol, is a brook ſo large as to carry a ſaw mill in Sutton, then bears away into Oxford, joins French River, which unites with the river Quinebaug, and enters the ſea at Newlondon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A few rods weſt of the ſecond pariſh meetinghouſe, there is a ſwamp, having two out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets; one at the ſouthweſt; the other at the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt: Both theſe outlets enter Blackſtone River, above deſcribed, at about one mile's diſtance from each other: But the river is eſtimated to run ten or twelve miles, after the entrance of that on the
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:026481_0096_0FD27D6DCC2204A0"/>
weſterly ſide, before it returns and takes in that on the eaſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the ſoutheaſterly part of the town is a cavern in the earth or rocks, commonly called <hi>Purgatory.</hi> The rocks on each ſide of the chaſm evidently appear to have been rent aſunder. People may enter ſome rods under the ground or rocks, and there are cracks down which they drop pebbles, and after theſe ſtrike the ſides alternately ſeveral times, they are heard to fall into the water; and a brook iſſues out at the bottom of the hill.</p>
               <p>It may be acceptable to give a more particular deſcription of this place, called Purgatory.</p>
               <p>It is the ſide of a hill, which conſiſts of vaſt ledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of rocks: Where the natural deſcent begins, a chaſm has been formed of perhaps thirty, and in ſome places, forty feet in width, in theſe ledges, by ſome violent concuſſion, which left this body of ſtones of all ſhapes and ſizes, to fall in: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, it is all open to the heavens; and the ledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, on either ſide, are from five to ten, and ſo on to twenty, and even forty feet in height. This chaſm is, perhaps, near eighty rods in length; and the deſcent is gradual, and not very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. Where the greateſt depth is, water iſſues from crevices in the rocks, and hangs in icicles, and even in ſolid bodies of ice, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> only in May, as I have ſeen, but in June, although the deſcent is to the ſouth. Some ſmall caverns were formed by the falling of theſe rocks, through which perſons have deſcended, and come out ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rods below. This is a moſt ſtupendous place,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:026481_0097_0FD27D6F43C09240"/>
and fills the mind of the beholder with moſt exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ideas of the infinite power of the great Creator of all things, "who removeth the mountains, and they know not; who ſhaketh the earth out of its place, and the pillars thereof tremble." After all, no deſcription given of this place, by another, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſons to form juſt and adequate conceptions of it.</p>
               <p>The growth of wood in Sutton, is oak of all ſorts, and what they call the oak cheſnut, the bark whereof is like the common gray oak, but the leaves reſemble, almoſt exactly, thoſe of the cheſnut tree; walnut of all kinds; great plenty of cheſnut; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of butternut; but little of buttonwood. In the low lands the wood is aſh, beech, birch, elm of all ſorts, maple, white and pitch pine. They have alſo ſaſſafras, ſarſaparilla, and alders. Here are to be found ginſeng, and the cohuſh root, of ſpecial medicinal qualities.</p>
               <p>There is much travelling through this town. The principal roads are—one coming from Connecticut, through Oxford, and paſſing from weſt to eaſt, through the town. About three miles weſt of the firſt pariſh meetinghouſe this road parts; the left hand road paſſes by the meetinghouſe, and ſo on through Grafton, Weſtborough, and Southbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, and leads to Boſton, falling into the poſt road in Weſton. The right hand road, at ſaid parting, paſſes on about two miles ſouth of ſaid meetinghouſe, and enters what is called the middle road in Uxbridge, and ſo goes on, through Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to Boſton. Another principal road, is a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:026481_0098_0FD27D705836DA40"/>
road from Worceſter, paſſing from north to ſouth through the town, by both meetinghouſes: At the ſouth meetinghouſe it parts, and, by various part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, leads to Douglaſs and the weſt part of Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</p>
               <p>There is another county road, which leads from Uxbridge to Worceſter, through the eaſt part of Sutton. This was lately in contemplation to be made the poſt road from Worceſter to Providence.</p>
               <p>The town of Sutton is diſtant from the State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in Boſton 46 miles to the ſouthweſt. And from Worceſter courthouſe, it is ſix miles to the north pariſh meetinghouſe; and to the ſouth pariſh meetinghouſe, to the ſouth nine miles.</p>
               <p>This is a large and flouriſhing town, the ſecond in wealth in the county; and when the cenſus was taken in 1791, there were 2642 inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

               <head>LEICESTER.</head>
               <p>THE townſhip of Leiceſter was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the General Court, on the tenth of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1713, to Col. Joſhua Lamb, of Roxbury, and others, his aſſociates; and on the fifteenth day of the ſame month and year, the Court, by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſolve or act, gave this tract of land the name of Leiceſter.

<pb n="100" facs="unknown:026481_0099_0FD27D71F25066D0"/>
and by the Engliſh it was uſually called <hi>Strawber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hill.</hi> The place was not incorporated, and veſted with town powers and privileges, until the cloſe of the year 1720, or the beginning of the year 1721: For the firſt town meeting held in Leiceſter was on the ſixth of March, 172<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. A ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of this grant being ordered, and a return there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made, the General Court eſtabliſhed the lines and boundaries of it by a ſpecial act, on the 19th of January, 1714. The tract was to be eight miles ſquare; and was granted on theſe conditions, that the proprietors ſhould reſerve a ſufficient quantity of land for the uſe of the miniſtry and ſchools, and ſee that fifty families were ſettled thereon in ſeven years. The proprietors accordingly, at a meeting in Boſton, on the 23d of February, 1713, voted to give one half of the townſhip to fifty families who ſhould ſettle thereon, in that ſpace of time. That number of families hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed to, and ſettled at Leiceſter, the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors, at a meeting held at Boſton, on the 23d of July, 1722, choſe a committee, conſiſting of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Dudley and Joſhua Lamb, Eſqrs; Mr. Nathan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iel Kenny, Mr. Samuel Tyler, and Mr. Samuel Green, to make and execute a deed of the eaſterly half of Leiceſter, lying weſt of and adjoining to Worceſter; eaſt of Brookfield, ſouth of Rutland, and north of a gore of land lying between Oxford and Leiceſter, to Mr. John Stebbins, and others; which deed bears date January 8th, 1724; and was recorded November 26th, 1729, Libro 29th, page 329 of the records of the county of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex.
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:026481_0100_0FD27D744D991FF8"/>
This grant was intended to be eight miles ſquare: But the meaſure was large, and included the whole of what is now Spencer: And at the north end, two miles in width and four in length were taken off to help form the town of Paxtor in 1765: And at the ſoutheaſt part of the town, about 2500 acres were taken off to aid in making up the town of Ward, in 1778. Leiceſter is ſtill a very conſiderable town, and contained when the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was made, nearly 1100 inhabitants.—It is bounded on the north by Paxton; on the eaſt by Worceſter and Ward; on the ſouth by Oxford; and on the weſt by Spencer.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſettlers of Leiceſter, like the people in general, of that day, paid early attention to relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, to the ſupport of the goſpel, and the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt among them. When the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational church in this place was gathered, cannot now be exactly aſcertained, as there were no church records kept or preſerved, till within about 40 years. But the probability is this, that the church was formed at the time of the firſt miniſter's being ſettled with them, who was the Rev. David Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. This Mr. Parſons was ordained at Malden, near Boſton, but ſoon removed with a conſiderable part of his people, to Leiceſter, where he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled, by the beſt account to be now had, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 15th, 1721. He did not continue long in the miniſtry at Leiceſter, but was diſmiſſed from his paſtoral relation to that flock, and died in about two years after. He was ſucceeded in the ſacred office, at Leiceſter, by the Rev. David Goddard,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:026481_0101_0FD27D7AAE1CB000"/>
who was ſolemnly conſecrated thereto June 30th, 1736. He was not ſuffered to continue long with this people, by reaſon of death; for being on a journey, at Framingham, he was there ſeized with a fever which put a period to his days January 19th, 1754, in the 48th year of his age, and the 13th of his miniſtry.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Joſeph Roberts ſucceeded Mr. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard in the miniſtry at Leiceſter, whereunto he was ordained October 23d, 1754, and he was diſmiſſed therefrom December 15th, 1762. To him ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the work of the goſpel miniſtry, the Rev. Benjamin Conklin, who was ſeparated thereunto on the 23d of November, 1763, and ſtill continues in office.</p>
               <p>There is a conſiderable ſociety of Anabaptiſts in Leiceſter, and which has been of long ſtanding. Their firſt teacher was Mr. Thomas Green, a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. After his death, the Rev. Benjamin Foſter, A.

The Anabaptiſt ſociety in Leiceſter, have for their preſent teacher Mr. Nathan Dana. Their houſe of worſhip is in the ſouth part of the town.</p>
               <p>Alſo, there is in Leiceſter, a number of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called Friends, or Quakers, who have a very good houſe for their way of worſhip, erected in the north part of the town in the year 1791.</p>

Alſo the Hon. Judge Gill has given a number of well choſen books, which coſt 30l. ſterling in England, to the academy, for the uſe of the inſtructors, and alſo for the uſe of the ſtudents, under certain regulations.</p>
               <p>Some Topographical Deſcription of this town ſhall now be attempted.</p>
               <p>Leiceſter is ſituated upon the height of land between the Atlantick Ocean, eaſt and ſouth, and Connecticut River on the weſt. The town is very hilly and uneven; it is indeed famed for its
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:026481_0105_0FD27D855CA1C1F8"/>
hills, but theſe are moiſt, ſpringy and rocky yet not exceedingly ſo. The ſoil is pretty good, deep and ſtrong, but rather cold clayey and wet, not ſo well adapted to grain as to graſs and paſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: It is pretty good for orcharding and fruit trees of all kinds.</p>
               <p>There are divers hills of note and fame in the town; the firſt we ſhall mention, and the moſt conſiderable, is Strawberry Hill, ſo called by the Engliſh when they firſt came there, in conſequence of the exuberant growth of thoſe berries. On this hill ſtands their elegant new meetinghouſe, on the northweſt ſide of the common which is level, fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſoutheaſt, erected in 1784. At the northeaſt angle of the ſquare ſtands the academy buildings; the other ſides of the ſquare are lined with large handſome dwelling houſes. This hill is high and rather ſteep, but not large and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. A ſecond hill is called <hi>Indian Hill,</hi> or <hi>Bald Hill,</hi> on account of its being cleared and planted with corn by the Indians, a long time before the white people went up ſo far to live. A third is called <hi>Mooſe Hill,</hi> becauſe of the great number of thoſe quadrupeds which were wont to harbour there. Another is called <hi>Cary's Hill,</hi> from one of that name who went thither and digged a cave in the ſide of this hill, and lived there as an hermit many years, while that part of the country was in its wilderneſs ſtate. A fifth is known by the name of <hi>Graſs Hill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although there is no river running through the town, yet it is well watered by ſprings and rivulets,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:026481_0106_0FD27D8C36026E68"/>
and by ſeveral large brooks upon which there are three corn and five ſaw mills; here alſo are clothiers' works, where that buſineſs is carried on in all its branches. Two of the brooks above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, run from north to ſouth, and are empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one into Providence river, the other into the Sound or ſea, at Newlondon, in Connecticut. The firſt of theſe is called Kettle Brook, and has its ſource in that part of Paxton which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Leiceſter; is a very conſiderable ſtream, and running through the eaſterly part of the town, paſſes into Ward, and there falls into Blackſtone River. The other riſes from a large meadow in the weſterly part of the town, of upwards of an hundred acres, part of which is in Spencer; this ſtream connects itſelf with the outlet of a pond which is ſituated a little eaſterly of the centre of the town of about forty or fifty acres: Theſe two are the ſources of French River, which runs through Oxford, and falls into the ſea at Newlondon.</p>
               <p>There is another pond in the northweſterly part of the town, containing about one hundred acres, whence iſſues a ſtream which runs weſterly, and forms a branch of the River Chicabee, and falls into Connecticut River at Springfield. On this ſtream or outlet from the pond there is a griſt mill, and by a drain and dam the pond may be raiſed or lowered ten feet, which is of ſingular advantage to the inhabitants of the vicinity, on account of grinding in the ſummer ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>In the eaſterly part of the town there is a place where the water, running from the northerly ſide
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:026481_0107_0FD27D8EF54A8C30"/>
of the poſt road, goes to Providence, while that on the ſouth ſide goes to Newlondon. In the weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part of the town there is alſo a place where the water, from the north ſide of the road, runs to Connecticut River; and that on the ſouth ſide goes to Newlondon.</p>
               <p>There is in this town a great variety of timber and wood, being a good proportion of almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind which is known to grow in this part of the country, except pitch and yellow pine.</p>
               <p>The principal roads of travel, are, firſt, the poſt road from Boſton to Springfield, through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the town: Secondly, about one hundred rods weſt from the meetinghouſe is the county road to Sturbridge, which turns to the left hand: Thirdly, through the north part of the town is a county road from Worceſter to Newbraintree and Hardwick: Fourthly, from Rutland, and the northern part of the county, there is a large road through the town, leading through Charlton, Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Pomfret, &amp;c. to Norwich.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of Leiceſter moſtly live by the cultivation of the ſoil; and here are many very fine farms, and the buildings are in general good, and indicate a very conſiderable degree of wealth. There are ſeveral perſons here who deal in foreign and domeſtick articles of trade; and they have beſides the uſual mechanicks and tradeſmen, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous gunſmith, Mr. Thomas Earle, who is ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to equal any workman in the United States, in that branch of buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:026481_0108_0FD27D8FE4F7B308"/>Here alſo there are eſtabliſhed manufactories of cotton and wool cards, and the work is carried on in all its branches to the greateſt perfection. In this buſineſs are conſtantly employed fifteen or twenty men, excluſive of a great number of women and children: And they vend, annually, from twelve to fifteen thouſand pair.</p>
               <p>Leiceſter is a growing flouriſhing town; and is ſituated upon the poſt road from Boſton to Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Newyork and Philadelphia: It is ſix miles from the courthouſe in Worceſter, a little to the ſouthweſt; and from Boſton, it is fifty three miles, ſeveral degrees to the ſouth of weſt.</p>

                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:026481_0111_0FD27D95E674CD88"/>The proprietors, at a meeting at Boſton, Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 14th, 1715, voted that the contents of ſix miles ſquare be ſurveyed, and ſet off for the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 62 families in order to the performance of the condition of the grant. The ſix miles ſquare, granted to men who would go on and ſettle, was that part which is now called Rutland. The ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers on the 11th of Auguſt 1720, entered into a written agreement with the proprietors, and bound themſelves by certain articles, ſigned and witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And on the 26th of June 1721, this ſix miles ſquare was confirmed to the ſettlers by the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors, as a ſure eſtate of inheritance to them, their heirs and aſſigns forever, and recorded. On the 12th of July 1721, the inhabitants of Rutland were aſſembled, by order of the committee of the proprietors, to chooſe a miniſter, when the Rev. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Willard was choſen, by a great majority of the voters. At a meeting of the freeholders and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this ſix miles ſquare, or Rutland, October 9th, 1721, Samuel Wright moderator, "Voted, that the town will prefer a petition to the General Court, to give their ſanction, and eſtabliſh them as a town, to have and enjoy all the privileges other towns enjoy."</p>
               <p>A petition was accordingly preſented to the General Court, and they ſometime in their ſeſſion, which was begun at Boſton upon Wedneſday the 30th of May 1722, paſſed an act of incorporation, entitled,

               <p>From the foregoing ſtatement, it appears that the whole grant of 12 miles ſquare was named Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in 1713; but that only the ſix miles ſquare granted by the proprietors to the ſettlers, was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rutland, and incorporated as a town; and that this was not done until the ſeſſion of the General Court which was begun May 30, 1722. And in conſequence of the above recited act, an order of the General Court paſſed July 6th, 1722, author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing and empowering Capt. Samuel Wright to call a meeting of the freeholders and other inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the town of Rutland, on the laſt Monday of July current, then to chooſe town officers to ſerve until the general meeting in March next. The town was notified and met accordingly; and this was the firſt legal town meeting ever held in Rutland.</p>
               <p>After the ſettlers had performed their conditions, and the ſix miles ſquare was incorporated, we find the proprietors of the townſhip of Rutland, in all
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:026481_0114_0FD27D52531C78A8"/>
future meetings, had nothing to do with ſaid ſix miles ſquare, which is now the town of Rutland; but concerned themſelves only with the other parts of their original grant, we ſhall therefore leave them, and confine ourſelves to the account of Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>We have ſaid, the ſettlers of the ſix miles ſquare, on the 12th of July 1721, invited the Rev. Joſeph Willard to ſettle with them in the work of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, which invitation he accepted. This Mr. Willard had been ordained a miniſter of Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the county of Hampſhire, but continued a very little time with them before he was diſmiſſed. After he had accepted the invitation to ſettle with the people of Rutland, he met with many and great diſcouragements, and particularly by reaſon of the fears and dangers ariſing from the Indians; ſo that an appointment of his inſtallation was deferred. However, at length a day was fixed upon for his ſolemn ſeparation to the work of the miniſtry in that place, in the fall of the year 1723; but he lived not to ſee the day, being cut off by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as ſhall be now related. As Deacon Joſeph Stevens and four of his ſons were making hay in a meadow, at Rutland, a little north of the place where the meetinghouſe now ſtands, Auguſt 14th, 1723, they were ſurpriſed by five Indians. The father eſcaped in the buſhes; two of his ſons were then and there ſlain; the other two, (Phinehas the eldeſt, and Iſaac the youngeſt) were made priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Two of the five Indians waylaid a Mr. Davis and ſon, who that afternoon were making hay in

a meadow not far off, but weary of waiting they were returning to the others, and met Mr. Willard in their way, who was armed: One of the Indians' guns miſſed fire, the others did no execution. Mr. Willard returned the fire, and wounded one of them, it is ſaid mortally, the other cloſed in with Mr. Willard; but he would have been more than a match for him, had not the other three come to his aſſiſtance: And it was ſome conſiderable time before they killed Mr. Willard. This account Phinehas Stevens gave upon his return from cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, who was a ſpectator of ſome part of the tragedy. The Indians having killed and ſcalped Mr. Willard, and taken ſome of his clothes, went off to Canada with the two captives above named. They were redeemed in about a year. Phinehas Stevens was a famous warrior, a captain, and a principal man in building up and defending the then young plantation No. 4, now Charleſtown, in Newhampſhire ſtate. Iſaac Stevens lived at Rutland. They have both been dead many years. On the 3d of Auguſt 1724, the Indians came again upon Rutland, killed three perſons, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one, and made another priſoner. This is as I find it related in Governor Hutchinſon's hiſtory. Others ſpeak of but two killed: But the names of the killed, wounded, or priſoner, cannot now be aſcertained. This was the laſt miſchief done at Rutland by the Indians, ſo far as we can learn.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of Rutland is brief and as here follows. The church of Chriſt in the town was gathered November 1ſt, 1727, and on
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:026481_0116_0FD27DA5F59748B8"/>
the ſame day the Rev. Thomas Frink was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their firſt Paſtor. Mr. Frink continued but a little time as their miniſter, being diſmiſſed from his office September 8th, 1740. (Mr. Frink was inſtalled Paſtor of the third church in Plymouth, November 7th, 1743, where he continued miniſter but a ſhort ſpace; being diſmiſſed from thence, he was inſtalled at Barre on the laſt Wedneſday in October 1753; from whence alſo he was diſmiſſed July 17th, 1766.) The Rev. Joſeph Buckminſter ſucceeded Mr. Frink, as a miniſter of the goſpel of Chriſt, at Rutland, whereunto he was ordained September 15th, 1742. Mr. Buckminſter continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the able faithful and worthy miniſter of Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land until November 3d, 1792, when he died in the 73d year of his age, and the 51ſt of his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He was ſucceeded in about eight months, by the Rev. Hezekiah Goodrich, who was ſeparated to the paſtoral office in Rutland, on the 19th of June 1793.</p>
               <p>In this town upwards of forty perſons have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united, and eſtabliſhed a ſocial Library, of the value of nearly 30<hi>l.</hi> and containing about 70 vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umes at preſent.</p>
               <p>Some Geographical Deſcription of Rutland ſhall now be attempted.</p>
               <p>The town is ſituated on the height of land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſea and Connecticut River: It is hilly and very uneven: The hill on which the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe ſtands is high: And the meetinghouſe may be ſeen in many of the adjacent towns, and even at a great diſtance to the weſt and northweſt; but
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:026481_0117_0FD27DA9E0F652F0"/>
as the town abounds with hills it affords no exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and commanding proſpect of itſelf. Eaſt of the meetinghouſe is a hill called Muſchapauge hill or Rice's hill, containing two or three hundred acres, this is very good land, and has ſome fine farms upon it. Part of Turkey Hill, ſo called, on the ſouth falls within Rutland, the reſt is in Paxton. This is high, but moſt excellent land.</p>
               <p>Other hills there are many, but none particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noticeable. The land in general is very good, and the ſoil is rich and ſtrong: It is not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for raiſing of grain, though a ſufficiency is produced for the inhabitants; it is very well adapted to graſs and grazing, and moſt excellent for orcharding: Here are large and fine orchards, and much cyder is made in the town.</p>
               <p>Rutland, being the height of land, has no large rivers running through it. Piſs River, ſo called, which originates on the weſt ſide of Watchuſett Hill, runs through Hubbardſton, and paſſes acroſs the northweſt angle of this town, and ſo falls into Ware river. On this river are one corn mill, two ſaw mills, one fulling mill, and one trip hammer, within the limits of Rutland; and the meadows on this river are conſiderable. There is a large ſtream, called Long Meadow Brook, running through the town, in the weſterly part thereof, on which are large meadows, and two corn mills and two ſaw mills within the bounds of this town. About half a mile eaſt of the meetinghouſe is a famous ſpring, the waters whereof ſoon divide; part runs to Merimack and part to Connecticut

Evans's Pond, ſo called, of about 60 or 70 acres, in the ſouthweſterly part of the town. Alſo, Gregory's or Long Pond, which is long and narrow, in the ſouthweſterly quarter. Theſe are all well ſtored with fiſh. Browning's Pond is large, this is ſituated in the ſoutherly part, and is partly in Rutland, partly in Spencer; but the largeſt part is in Oakham. The growth of wood in Rutland is, oak of all ſorts, cheſnut, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, pine of all ſorts, aſh, maple, birch, beach, poplar, elm, ſaſſafras, hemlock, hackmatack, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the weſterly and northweſterly part of the town is an extenſive plain, a great part of which is ſtill covered with pitch pine. This is rather light land. The people of Rutland are principally farmers, except a few traders in European, Eaſt and Weſtindia goods, the uſual mechanicks, and thoſe employed in the card making buſineſs, which is newly ſet up here: And they are a peaceable, happy, flouriſhing people. In this town, pot and pearl aſh making is carried on very largely. When the cenſus was taken about two years ago there were 1072 ſouls in the town.</p>
               <p>Rutland is bounded, on the north by Hubbardſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; on the northeaſt, by Princeton; on the eaſt, by Holden; on the ſouth, by Paxton; on the weſt, by Oakham; and on the northweſt, by Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.

               <p>THIS town was taken from Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and lying the whole length of that town on the weſt ſide, thence was called Weſtborough when incorporated by act of the General Court on the 18th of November 1717. This before uſed to be called <hi>Chauncey</hi> Village at the weſt end of Marlborough. Here a Church was gathered on the 28th of October 1724, and on the ſame day the Rev.

Thomas and Edmund Rice had families, and were fixed down but a little weſt of where the preſent meetinghouſe in Weſtborough ſtands. On Auguſt 8th, 1704, as ſeveral perſons were buſy in ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax, on a plain about eighty rods from the houſe of Mr. Thomas Rice (the firſt ſettler in Weſtbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, and ſeveral years repreſentative of the town of Marlborough, in the General Court) and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of boys with them, ſeven, ſome ſay ten, Indians ſuddenly ruſhed down a woody hill near by, and, knocking the leaſt of the boys on the head (Nahor, about five years old, ſon of Mr. Edmund Rice, and the firſt Engliſh perſon ever buried in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough) they ſeized two, Aſher and Adonijah, ſons of Mr. Thomas Rice, the oldeſt about ten, and the other about eight years of age, and two others, Silas and Timothy, ſons of Mr. Edmund Rice abovenamed, of about nine and ſeven years of age, and carried them away to Canada. The perſons who were ſpreading flax, eſcaped ſafely to the houſe. Aſher, in about four years, returned, being redeemed by his father. This was effected by the kind mediation of the Rev. Mr. Lydius, then miniſter of Albany. And here, by the way, it ſhould be noted, that when the old Indian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem <hi>Ountaſſogo,</hi> the chief of the Cagnawagas, at the conference with Governor Belcher at Deerfield, made a viſit to Boſton, he ſtopped awhile in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough;

               <p>The venerable Mr. Parkman, in a manuſcript account of theſe perſons found among his papers ſince his death, adds, with reſpect to this Timothy, in theſe words: "He himſelf, in proceſs of time, came to ſee us. By the interpoſition of Col.

               <p>The chief aboveſaid came, and the ſaid Mr. Tarbell with him as interpreter and companion. They arrived here September 15th.

His Excellency Governor Belcher ſent for them, who, accordingly, waited on him at Boſton. They alſo viſited Tarbell's relations at Groton; then returned to us in their way back to Albany and Canada.

               <p>Let us proceed to ſome Geographical Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Weſtborough. The town is pretty large, and very generally ſettled, containing, when the cenſus was taken in 1791, houſes 118, and inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants 934. It is about 34 miles from Boſton, a little to the ſouth of weſt, and 13 miles eaſt from Worceſter. The middle of the town is level, but the lands riſe, at about a mile's diſtance from the meetinghouſe into higher, eſpecially to the eaſt, ſouth and weſt. The ſoil is in general good, the farms are large, and the inhabitants induſtrious and wealthy, as any one muſt naturally ſuppoſe from the appearance of their places and buildings. The growth of wood here is ſimilar to that in the neighbouring towns: The higher lands bear plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of oak and cheſnut, ſome walnut; in the ſwamps and low lands grow aſh, birch and maple: Here alſo they have large and excellent cedar ſwamps, which afford the people much cedar for ſhingles and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er important and neceſſary uſes: There is, at this day, but little white pine, but conſiderable pitch
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:026481_0124_0FD27DB9A4E23AF0"/>
pine. There is very little broken poor land in the town; neither is it very rocky; but bears all kinds of grain in plenty; it is good for orchard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, graſs and paſturing: It is very well watered by ſmall ſtreams and rivulets, on which they have mills; and on theſe they have conſiderable bodies of good meadow land. The river Aſſabet, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the northweſt angle of the town, has upon its banks a very large body of very excellent meadow or interval.</p>
               <p>Ponds there are ſeveral in the town, as Great Chauncy in the northeaſterly part, into which a rivulet enters at the ſouth end from ſwamps and low lands; this is a fine pond, and here is a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fiſh. A ſmall ſtream iſſues from the north end of this pond and empties into Little Chauncy, which is in Northborough.</p>
               <p>About a mile ſouth of Great Chauncy, there is a ſmall pond, near the road from Weſtborough to Boſton, whence iſſues a ſmall ſtream to the ſouth, entering a large cedar ſwamp, and running through that, empties into a large pond called Cedar Swamp Pond, which is environed on the eaſt, north and weſt, with ſaid ſwamp; from this pond, on the ſouth, there is an outlet which runs into Hopkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and aids in forming Sudbury, or Concord South River. It is worthy of notice, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in this town, though they take different routs, finally unite in Concord, by the confluence of the north and ſouth river in that town. In the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſterly part of Weſtborough is ſituated Hobomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho Pond, not large, encircled with a meadow,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:026481_0125_0FD27EAFE77593E8"/>
bearing the ſame name, and from this there is an outlet into the River Aſſabet, abovementioned.</p>
               <p>Weſtborough is bounded on the eaſt, by South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough and Hopkinton; on the ſouth, by Upton; on the weſt, by Grafton and Shrewſbury; and on the north, by Northborough.</p>

               <head>UXBRIDGE.</head>
               <p>THE town of Uxbridge was taken from the ancient town of Mendon, and was incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated by an act of the Legiſlature, on the 27th of June 1727, and then received its preſent name. It was the weſterly part of that town. It was large at firſt, extending ten or twelve miles from north to ſouth; but has ſince been curtailed, having the north part ſet off in 1772, and made a diſtinct town, by the name of Northbridge.</p>
               <p>Uxbridge ſtill remains a very conſiderable town in extent, and for the number of its inhabitants. When the cenſus was taken in 1791, there were 180 dwelling houſes, and 1310 inhabitants in the place.</p>
               <p>The people took early care for the ſupport of the goſpel, and the inſtitutions of Chriſtianity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; accordingly, ſoon after the incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the town, viz. on the ſixth of January 1731, a church of Chriſt was here gathered under
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:026481_0126_0FD27EB1EC5DE900"/>
the direction of the Rev. Joſeph Dorr of Mendon: and on February third, 1731, the Rev. Nathan Webb, was inveſted with the paſtoral office in the place. Mr. Webb continued the faithful miniſter of the town upwards of 41 years; being removed by death on the 14th of March 1772. The Rev. Hezekiah Chapman ſucceeded Mr. Webb in the work of the miniſtry in Uxbridge; whereunto he was ſolemnly ſeparated January 27th, 1774; and from which he was diſmiſſed April 5th, 1781. The Rev. Joſiah Spalding, ſucceeded Mr. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as miniſter of Uxbridge, being ordained on the 11th of September 1783: He continued with this people but about four years, being diſmiſſed from his paſtoral relation to them, October 23d, 1787. Theſe two gentlemen were diſmiſſed more on account of the peculiarity of their religious ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than any thing beſide. Mr. Spalding has ſince been inſtalled at Worthington in the county of Hampſhire. On the 17th of October 1792, the Rev. Samuel Judſon was ordained Paſtor, the fourth in ſucceſſion, of the congregational ſociety in Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>In the town of Uxbridge there are a few fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies of the Anabaptiſt perſuaſion. And here alſo is a very conſiderable ſociety, nearly one quarter of the inhabitants of the town, of the ſect called Friends, who have a meetinghouſe for the worſhip of God in their way, built with brick.</p>
               <p>We will now give ſome Geographical Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the town of Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:026481_0127_0FD27EB2EE399670"/>This town is ſituated at the ſouthern extremity of the county, and is bounded on the ſouth, by the line between this Commonwealth, and the ſtate of Rhodeiſland; on the weſt, by Douglaſs; on the north, by Northbridge; and on the eaſt, by Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
               <p>Uxbridge is 42 miles from Boſton, ſomewhat to the ſouthweſt, and is 18 miles from the courthouſe in Worceſter, to the ſoutheaſt.</p>
               <p>The land in the town is pretty level, for the ſpace of about one mile round the meetinghouſe, being a plain, and rather ſandy and light; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, good for raiſing of grain of all ſorts; then it riſes to hills on all ſides, but not very high, nor very rocky; theſe are moiſt and good for orchard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for grazing, and for Engliſh graſs: There is a good proportion of interval and meadow lands upon the rivers, which are in general very good. There are three rivers in this town, all of them unite in the ſouth part; Blackſtone, Mumford, and Weſt River. Blackſtone River has its ſource in Sutton; and was particularly deſcribed in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that town. This river comes from Sutton through Grafton and Northbridge, and enters Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge at the north end of the town, and running through the town, near the middle, paſſes into Rhodeiſland State: This is a large and fine river. Mumford River has its riſe in Rocky Woods, ſo called, in Douglaſs, being increaſed by ſtreams from Badluck Pond, and from Manchaug Pond, in Douglaſs, and by ſprings and rivulets, and runs an eaſterly courſe into Uxbridge, then turns and
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:026481_0128_0FD27EBA6E2FBEE8"/>
runs ſoutheaſterly within a few rods of Uxbridge meetinghouſe, where there are ſeveral ſorts of mills and water works, in excellent order, and where much buſineſs is well performed. This river con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues its courſe, and joins Blackſtone River about one mile ſoutheaſt of the meetinghouſe.</p>
               <p>Weſt River is not large, its main ſource is a pond in the northerly part of Upton, and running through a part of Northbridge, it paſſes through the eaſterly ſide of Uxbridge, and falls into Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone River about two miles ſoutheaſt from the meetinghouſe. Beſides theſe rivers, there are divers brooks and rivulets, by which this town is finely watered. There are alſo three ſmall ponds in the town, covering ten or twelve acres of land each, and are called, Pout Pond, Mud Pond, and Shoelog Pond. Pout Pond is in the eaſt part of the town, about one mile from the meetinghouſe. Mud Pond is ſituated in the ſoutheaſt part of the town, not far from Blackſtone River, with which it holds a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication when the water is high. Shoelog Pond is ſituated in the ſouthweſt part of the town, from whence iſſues a ſmall ſtream, which runs into Glouceſter, in the State of Rhodeiſland. Not far from this pond an iron mine has been diſcovered, and wherein perſons have wrought to very conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable advantage. Upon the farm of Dr. Samuel Willard, in Uxbridge, there is a fine quarry of ſtone, of a greyiſh colour, eaſily ſplit, and wrought into any ſhape for underpinning, door ſtones, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:026481_0129_0FD27EBBE879DCB8"/>The growth of wood and timber in this town is pretty much like that of other towns in general: Oak of various ſorts, ſome cheſnut, walnut, poplar and pine.</p>
               <p>The people of Uxbridge ſubſiſt chiefly by the cultivation of the ſoil: They have, however, all the common ſorts of mechanicks, and a few dealers in European, Eaſt and Weſt India goods.</p>
               <p>There is one road of conſiderable travel, from Connecticut, directly through this town to Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſo on to Boſton.</p>
               <p>This may be conſidered as a large, wealthy, flouriſhing place, and ſtands forward in the liſt of towns, according to the proportion which it pays to a State tax.</p>

               <p>THE town of Southborough, was taken from the ancient town of Marlborough, and derived its name from the circumſtance of its lying about ſouth from that town. It was incorporated, by act of Court, July 6th, 1727. A few years paſt, a ſtrip of land, belonging to Framingham, of about three hundred acres, and running up between Southborough and Hopkinton, was annexed to Southborough.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:026481_0130_0FD27EBD66F534A0"/>The church of Chriſt in this town, was embodied on the 24th of October 1730, and on the ſame day the Rev. Nathan Stone was ordained their firſt Paſtor: He was a judicious, prudent, and faithful miniſter of Chriſt, and was continued ſerving God in the goſpel of his Son, to the great ſatisfaction of his people, until May 31ſt, 1781, when he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this life, in the 74th year of his age and 51ſt of his miniſtry. The people were deſtitute of a ſettled miniſter for the long ſpace of ten years, even until June 1ſt, 1791, when the Rev. Samuel Sumner was ſolemnly ſeparated unto the paſtoral office over the church and flock of God in Southborough.</p>
               <p>We ſhall proceed to give ſome Geographical Deſcription of this town. It is ſituated on the eaſt ſide of the county, and is bounded by Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough on the north, Framingham on the eaſt, Hopkinton on the ſouth, and Weſtborough and Northborough on the weſt: It is 29 miles from Boſton, a little to the ſouth of weſt; and 17 miles from Worceſter courthouſe, about eaſt. It is not large in extent, but pretty well filled with people, who are generally good and wealthy farmers. They have about 120 dwelling houſes, 150 families, and 840 inhabitants. The town is not level, nor yet very uneven; there are no extenſive plains, and no very high hills; the ſoil is ſtrong, good and rich, and productive, amply repaying for its cultivation. It is not very rocky, however, there is a ſufficiency of ſtone, perhaps on every farm, whereby it is, or may be walled in. In the South part of the town there is a hill, which, from the ſteepneſs of its aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:026481_0131_0FD27EBEDD20AA40"/>
is called Breakneck Hill, over the ſteepeſt part runs a town road; it is rocky and rough, but cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with a large growth of young wood, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the north. In the northeaſt part is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated what is called Pine Hill, which was covered with pines and timber until the year 1787, when, by a hurricane, the wood was chiefly deſtroyed. On the weſt ſide of the town there is a ſteep hill over which the county road lies, but not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by any particular name.</p>
               <p>The town is well watered by ſtreams and rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets. Stony Brook riſes in the eaſterly part of Weſtborough, runs through Southborough in a courſe which in general is eaſterly; but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeveral great angles; for what is worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, the road through the town to Boſton croſſes this ſtream three times within the ſpace of four miles. This ſtream enters Framingham and there falls into Sudbury River. On this ſtream are two ſaw mills, in fine order, of profit to their owners, and benefit to the town. Upon the ſame brook are four corn mills. One in the weſterly part of the town, neareſt its ſource, and on the great road, can grind but about half the year, as raiſing a pond in the ſummer ſeaſon would damage a large body of meadow land. But below this, at the diſtance of two or three miles, as the ſtream runs, ſtands another mill in good repair, and where much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is done, not only for the benefit of this, but the neighbouring towns. About two miles further down this ſtream, are two well conſtructed corn mills, the property of Col. Thomas Nixon, which
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:026481_0132_0FD27EC35691E4A0"/>
grind all the year, except in a very dry ſeaſon, as the waters of Angle Brook, and Broad Meadow Brook fall into this ſtream above theſe mills. On this Stony Brook, clothiers' works have lately been erected in the eaſterly part of the town where much buſineſs is well performed.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſtream is called Angle Brook, from its winding courſe. One branch of this ſtream riſes near the meetinghouſe in Marlborough, and anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er branch a little further ſouth, and ſoon uniting enters Southborough, and there joining with Broad Meadow Brook, in about the diſtance of a mile, falls into Stony Brook, as abovementioned. There are many other ſtreams leſs noticeable. But we muſt obſerve what is called Sudbury River, iſſues from Cedar Swamp Pond, in the ſoutheaſterly part of Weſtborough, and when it leaves that town, is the boundary between Southborough and Hopkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, on the ſouth. The meadows on this river, in Southborough, are narrow, but produce large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of good ſtock hay, being a mixture of meadow, and Engliſh graſs. Thoſe upon Stony and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Brooks are good, and yield moſt excellent bank hay. There is but one pond in this town, in the weſtern part, ſmall, covering perhaps ſix acres of ground. To this there is a ſmall inlet, and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to the ſouth; and all the waters in this town run ſoutherly and eaſterly, and empty into Sudbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Concord River. Here are no pot or pearl-aſh works.</p>
               <p>The growth of wood is ſufficient for the town, if prudently uſed, and conſiſts of white, red and
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:026481_0133_0FD27EC6DBFCB410"/>
black oak, ſome walnut, and more cheſnut: The low lands are all under cultivation. Upon the whole, this, though not large, its contents being but about 8350 acres, is a good town; and the people are induſtrious and wealthy, in general; and hoſpitable and peaceable.</p>

               <head>SHREWSBURY.</head>
               <p>IN the year 1717, November 2d, a grant was made to certain perſons, chiefly of Marlborough, who petitioned therefor, of all the lands lying between the original grant of Lancaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the north; Marlborough, on the eaſt; Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton on the ſouth; and Worceſter on the weſt. Moſt of the firſt ſettlers were from Marlborough. The tract of land was very long (about fifteen miles north and ſouth) but not very wide (from three and an half to four and five miles.) The whole was called, by the proprietors, Shrewſbury from the beginning.</p>
               <p>In about ten years from the date of the grant, it was ſo ſtocked with inhabitants, as that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Court incorporated it as a town, by an act which bears date December 19th, 1727, and gave it the name whereby it had all along been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="unknown:026481_0134_0FD27EC80A534B98"/>The town ſo flouriſhed and increaſed, as that in a little more than twenty years a ſecond pariſh, in the northerly part, was formed, viz. on the 17th December 1742, which has ſince been made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct town.</p>
               <p>The ſouth part of this original grant which is now Shrewſbury, is about ſeven miles in length from north to ſouth, and about three and an half or four miles in width; and it is bounded by Worceſter on the weſt; by Boylſton on the north; by Weſtborough and Northborough on the eaſt; and by Grafton on the ſouth. It is ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated about ſix miles from Worceſter courthouſe, a little to the northeaſt, and from Boſton 41 miles a little to the ſouthweſt. The poſt road from Boſton to Worceſter, and ſo on to Newyork, &amp;c. paſſes directly through the town; and the great road from Vermont, and from the upper part of Newhampſhire, and northweſtern part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unites with the poſt road about a mile and an half weſt of the meetinghouſe. Beſides which there is a road of conſiderable travel from the northward, directly through Shrewſbury, to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>The eccleſiaſtical hiſtory of this place is but brief, and is as here follows:</p>
               <p>On the fourth day of December 1723, the church of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was gathered here, and on the ſame day the Rev. Job Cuſhing was ordained their firſt Paſtor. He continued in peace and love with his people, and faithfully ſerving the Lord in the work of the miniſtry almoſt 37 years; and
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:026481_0135_0FD27EC96017DDB8"/>
was ſuddenly cut off, by a fit of the apoplexy, Auguſt 6th, 1760, in the 67th year of his age. And on the 25th of June 1762, the Rev. Joſeph Summer was ſolemnly inveſted with the paſtoral office in this place; and who ſtill continues to miniſter to them in holy things. There are a few Baptiſts in the ſouth part of the town, but no church of that denomination.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed to a Geographical Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this town, I have thought that ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſorrowful an occurrence as took place in Shrewſbury, in its infancy, ought to be recorded in this hiſtory. I ſhall give it in the words of the account publiſhed in the only Newſpaper (I have been told) then printed in Newengland, if not on this ſide Philadelphia. It was a ſmall half ſheet printed by B. Green.</p>

                     <p>"An exact account of the awful burning of Capt. John Keyes's houſe, with five perſons in it, at Shrewſbury, in the night between the 7th and 8th of this inſt. taken from a letter of the Rev. Mr. Breck of Marlborough, and from the mouth of Mr. Ebenezer Bragg of the ſame, formerly of Ipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, the only perſon of thoſe who lodged in the houſe, who, by a diſtinguiſhing providence, eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the flames.</p>
                     <p>"Capt. Keyes was building an houſe about nine or ten feet off his old one. It was almoſt finiſhed. And Mr. Bragg aforeſaid, the carpenter, with his brother Abiel, of 17 years of age, and William Oaks of 18, his apprentices, were work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:026481_0136_0FD27ECB22DC29F0"/>
about it. Capt. Keyes, with his wife and four daughters, lodged in the old one; and the three carpenters, with three ſons of the Captain's, viz. Solomon of twenty, John of thirteen, and Steven of ſix years of age, lay in the new. On the Wedneſday night, going to bed, they took a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry care of the fire, being excited thereto by the ſaying of one, <hi>He would not have the houſe burnt for an hundred pounds</hi>; and the reply of another, <hi>He would not for two hundred.</hi> Upon which, they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully raked away the chips lying near it, and ſtayed till the reſt were almoſt burnt out; and then they went all ſix together into three beds in one of the chambers; and were very cheerly and merry at their going to bed, which was about ten of the clock.</p>
                     <p>"But about midnight Mr. Bragg was awaked with a notion of the houſe being on fire, and a multitude calling to quench it; with which he got up, ſaw nothing, heard no voice, but could hardly fetch any breath, through the ſtifling ſmoke; concluded the houſe was on fire, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome body ſtirring, againſt whom he hit two or three times in the dark: And not being able to ſpeak, or to breathe any longer, and ſtriking his forehead againſt the chimney, he thought of the window and happily found it: When he gained it, he tarried a minute, holding it faſt with one hand, and reaching out the other, in hopes of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome or other to ſave them, till the ſmoke and fire came ſo thick and ſcorching upon him, he could endure no longer; and hearing no noiſe in the chamber, only, as he thought, a faint groan or

                  </gap> immediately, and there is quite a ſteep hill before you leave Shrewſbury, on the way to Worceſter. The town is not very uneven conſidered altogether, but is pretty rocky. There is a very large and extenſive proſpect from the middle of the town, and all round the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, eaſt and weſt, north and ſouth, and from ſome parts of the town ſeven meetinghouſes can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. The land, in general, is rather rough and hard, but the ſoil is ſtrong, rich, and very produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive when ſubdued. The higher lands are very good for orcharding, and fruit trees of all kinds, and for paſturage, and even for mowing; for the land is not dry, and it bears a dry ſeaſon exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well. It is not ſo well proportioned with til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage land; however, what they till is very produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and richly repays the labour beſtowed upon it. There is very little poor broken, waſte land in the town. And it is richly ſtored with a fine

The largeſt ſtream in the town is that which iſſues from Sewall's Pond, which is within the limits of Boylſton, and running ſoutherly a mile and a quarter, falls into Long Pond, on the road to Worceſter, over which is the bridge at the head of ſaid pond.

This pond lies almoſt wholly within the bounds of Shrewſbury, not more than one acre falling within the limits of Worceſter. It is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the largeſt and fineſt pond in the county. Indeed, it may very fitly be denominated a lake. Upon the top of the hill, on the weſt ſide of Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, it appears to travellers as a large river, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented with woods on each ſide. It affords great plenty of fiſh, as pickerel, large perch, eels, ſhiners, breams, &amp;c. and the brooks which run into it, contain ſome trout. The water of this pond is in general deep; in ſome places it has been found ninety ſix feet deep. In this pond there are a numb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The firſt, or uppermoſt, at the north end, is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Little Pine Iſland, has upon it a thicket of vines, and contains about a quarter of an acre. The ſecond is Graſs Iſland, covered with graſs and willows, and which has been mowed in a dry ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The third is called Sherman's Iſland, and contains about one acre and an half, and has a growth of ſmall timber and wood upon it, of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds. The fourth is called Bowman's Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, of about three acres, and is clothed with pine and other timber. The fifth is denominated Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry Iſland, from the conſiderable quantity of thoſe berries which grow thereon; this contains about three acres. The ſixth is another Graſs Iſland, having upon it willows and waterbuſhes. The ſeventh is known by the name of Grape Iſland, of about the fourth of an acre, bears large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of grapes. The eighth, commonly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sharp Pine Iſland, of three quarters of an acre, is covered with divers ſorts of wood. The ninth is known by the name of Ram Iſland, of two acres, covered with oak and cheſnut. The tenth and laſt is a very large iſland, and generally called Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten's Iſland; this contains about 150 acres; a conſiderable part of which is under cultivation; and there are three families living thereon, having good farms: Theſe are inhabitants of Shrewſbury. This iſland has oak, cheſnut, walnut, and ſome pine thereon. There are two or three other places in the pond where land appears in a dry ſeaſon, but at other times are covered with water. This is bounded north and weſt, by the Long or Great

From them runs a river, at the ſoutheaſt, which paſſes into Grafton, whereon are a number of mills, and other water works. There is a ſmall outlet from Long Pond, ſoutherly, into Flint's Pond; and from Flint's Pond eaſtwardly, there is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let into the river juſt mentioned. And what is truly noticeable is this, while the water, more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally, runs out of Long Pond into Flint's Pond, yet in the drier ſeaſons of the year, the water runs out of Flint's Pond into Long Pond; for Flint's Pond is fed by ſprings and rivulets, which keep it always full. There is a pond called Jordan Pond, lying about half a mile eaſtward of the great or Long Pond, and about midway of the length of it, and from this there is an outlet, by which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſome parts of the year empty into Long Pond. On the ſtream which runs from Sewall's Pond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Quinſigamond or Long Pond, there is a griſt mill.

               <p>ON the 4th of November, 1719, the General Court, at the requeſt of a number of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, made a grant to them of this territory for a valuable conſideration, reſerving, however, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, ſchool, and miniſterial rights of land; as alſo a right to the firſt ordained miniſter.</p>
               <p>There is a hill, in the middle of the town, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Turkey Hill,</hi> on account of the great number of wild Turkies which frequented the place in that day.

compliment to George II, who, the preceding year, came to the Britiſh throne; and was ſtyled Duke of Lunenburg, as having in his German do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions a town of that name.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſettler in this place, was a Mr. Samuel Page, who was dubbed governor Page, and is mentioned by that title to this day: He lived to a great age, and died in September, 1747. Many of the firſt ſettlers were emigrants from Ireland and Scotland; whoſe deſcendants, by intermarriages, are now blended and incorporated with the other inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the place is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. Like people in general, at that day, who came to America for the ſake of enjoying the ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red rights of conſcience, they were fond of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the publick inſtitutions of religion, and took early care to ſettle a miniſter: Accordingly, here a church was gathered, and the Rev. Andrew Gardner, (who had been the firſt miniſter at Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter) was inſtalled their firſt miniſter on the 15th of May, 1728, a little before the incorporation of the town. Mr. Gardner continued not four years in the miniſtry here; being diſmiſſed the 22d of February, 1732. After his diſmiſſion, he moved up nigh to Connecticut River, in Newhampſhire State, where he died, but a few years ſince, in a very advanced age.</p>
               <p>The ſecond miniſter of Lunenburg, was the Rev. David Stearns, who was ordained April 18th, 1733; and died of a peripneumony, March 9th, 1761, in the 52d year of his age, and 28th of his
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:026481_0144_0FD056EE08B2E208"/>
miniſtry. As he lived greatly beloved, he died no leſs lamented.</p>
               <p>He was ſucceeded, for a few days, by the Rev. Samuel Payſon, who was ſeparated unto the ſacred work of the goſpel miniſtry September 8th, 1762; and died February 14th, 1763, of an atrophy.</p>
               <p>He was ſucceeded by the Rev. Zabdiel Adams, who was ſolemnly conſecrated unto the ſervice of God, in the goſpel of his Son, on the 5th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1764, and who is ſtill living.</p>
               <p>During the adminiſtration of theſe miniſters there have been baptized, of infants and adults, down to the preſent time, no leſs than 2400 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: And the church here is comparatively large, containing very little ſhort of two hundred communicants.</p>
               <p>The growth and increaſe of Lunenburg was rapid and great; for in the year 1764, the whole town of Fitchburg was taken from it. It is now bounded by Townſend, in the county of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, on the north; by Shirley, in the ſame county, on the eaſt; by Leominſter, on the ſouth; and by Fitchburg, on the weſt. It is about 44 miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from Boſton, over Charles River bridge, to the northweſt; and 25 miles north by eaſt, from the courthouſe in Worceſter.</p>
               <p>The ſoil of this town is ſweet, and as productive as is uſually found in ſo northern a ſituation. For though the land be in general high, yet by reaſon of its coheſive texture, and having a clayey ſtratum within a few feet of its ſurface, it retains moiſture ſufficient for vegetation through the whole
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:026481_0145_0FD056C888AD0220"/>
ſummer, unleſs in ſeaſons of ſevere drought. The ſoil is friendly to the growing of wheat, rye, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian corn, oats, &amp;c. The wheat raiſed on the hills is of the firſt quality. Many parts of it bear hemp and flax luxuriantly. The mowing and paſture lands are equal to what are generally found in the county. It is a place famed for cyder; as their high lands are excellent for orcharding: But the canker worms beginning to infeſt the trees, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them with a ſcarcity of this kind of fruit.</p>
               <p>The natural growth of wood and timber in the town is oak, white, red, black and gray. Of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut there is conſiderable plenty; and of cheſnut a large proportion. In the low lands there is aſh, alſo rock and white maple, black, white and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low birch, ſome beach and other hard wood. Nevertheleſs, as there is very little waſte land, and the people are numerous, fuel will in a few years be ſcarce and dear. White and yellow pines were plenty in the infancy of the plantation; but from the great and long conſumption of both, a ſcarcity is ſenſibly felt. Although the ſurface of the town is uneven, and may be denominated hilly; yet it is not rocky; there being, take the town in gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, not more than ſtones ſufficient to wall in the ſeveral incloſures.</p>
               <p>From the elevated ſituation of the land, and its proximity to thoſe lofty mountains, the Grand Monadinock in Newhampſhire, and the Watchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett in this county, being about twelve miles from the latter, and twenty five from the former, the air is keen and piercing in winter, pleaſant in ſummer,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:026481_0146_0FD056EF8BCC3BB0"/>
and through the whole year very ſalubrious. Here are little or no ſtagnant waters; but few meadows; and but few brooks and ſtreams. In conſequence of which they are in a great degree exempted from fogs, from deleterious vapours and exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and having the air ventilated by high winds, the inhabitants are remarkably healthy, and free from thoſe diſorders of the put<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſcent kind which ſweep off many in other places; and they double their numbers in leſs than 25 years. This occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions large emigrations, and as the farms are ſmall in general, being on an average not more than 75 or 80 acres; this, together with the fecundity of the people, produces a large number of pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, with which the town is burdened more ſo, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, than any other town in the county; creating an expenſe beyond that of ſupporting the goſpel. However, the greater part of the people live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, and a few may be ſaid to be opulent. The people are induſtrious and economical, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous, hoſpitable to ſtrangers, and much given to convivial entertainments.</p>
               <p>The town labours under other diſadvantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe already mentioned. For though the directeſt route from the northerly part of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut River, and from the State of Vermont, to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, be through Lunenburg, yet from difficulty in the road for a ſhort ſpace of way, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of certain men, the travel paſſes to the north or ſouth of it; whereby the people are left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all the benefit ariſing from travellers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiting their money among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:026481_0147_0FD056CA82220540"/>Beſides this, they labour under the want of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient water to carry their corn and ſaw mills. Though there are ſeveral ſmall ſtreams on which there are mills, yet they are generally inoperative a conſiderable part of the year. Mulpus, ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is but a ſmall brook, which, originating in the weſt part of the town, runs eaſt about twelve miles, and then empties itſelf into the River Naſhaway, in the north part of Shirley. This deficiency of water obliges ſome of the inhabitants to carry their grain to other towns to be ground, a certain part of the year. But while we ſpeak of this ſingular deficiency of water, we are conſtrained to mention a Mr. Wetherbee, who, having built both corn and ſaw mills, in the ſouthweſt part of the town, on what is called part of the north branch of Naſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way River, and finding, by ſeveral years experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the water was not ſufficient to carry his mills, except in the ſpring of the year, or in rainy ſeaſons, was at great expenſe to dig a canal, in length about a mile, to convey water from a larger branch of the ſame river, (which comes from Weſtminſter) into his mill pond; which enables him in a wet ſeaſon, to grind for all; and, in a dry one, for moſt of his numerous cuſtomers. An inſtance of ſo ſpirited and laudable enterprize is worthy to be tranſmitted to poſterity. This man, it is thought, makes the beſt wheat flour within the compaſs of Newengland; and has grain brought to his mill from remote places.</p>
               <p>In the ſouthweſt, ſouth, and ſoutheaſt parts of the town, are three ponds, which, retaining their
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:026481_0148_0FD056F118FA5D08"/>
Indian names, are called Onkeſhewalom, Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pog, and Catatoonamug; The firſt of which is nearly two miles and an half; the ſecond, two miles, and the laſt not more than one mile in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. From theſe ponds, the neighbouring anglers draw from time to time, pickerel, perch, roach, bream, and other freſh water fiſh, not only ſo as to give themſelves a delicious repaſt, but ſometimes a quantity to ſell to their townſmen.</p>
               <p>Mines, minerals or foſſils, there are none in the town; nor furnaces, or forge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. The blackſmiths bring their iron from a diſtance. The nailing buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has been carried on here to advantage.</p>
               <p>In giving an account of Lunenburg, we ought not to omit the mention of Edward Hartwell, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who early came into the place, and poſſeſſing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages above people in general, was promoted in the town and county; he was a deacon of the church; and, paſſing different grades of office, was Major of a regiment of militia; a juſtice of the peace; a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas; and a repreſentative of the town, with few interruptions, for a great number of years; in which ſtation he continued until a very advanced period of his life; and, finally, he died in the 97th year of his age, as full of piety as of days. This gentleman was much engaged in the Indian wars, and was very helpful to the neighbouring towns in ſcouring the woods, and driving off the ſavages. In Lunenburg, indeed, he had little work of this kind to perform. For, though the Indians afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time inhabited this territory, as is evident by veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiges
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:026481_0149_0FD056CB8AA353E0"/>
thereof remaining to this day, yet they never much annoyed the Engliſh; they did, indeed, ſo put them in fear, that between the years 1740 and 1750, the inhabitants frequently went armed to the houſe of God on the ſabbath. There were alſo a few troops ſtationed in this town at garriſoned houſes, to which the people retired at night for ſafety. In the ſummer of the year 1749, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians came into the northweſt limits of the town, and killed two ſoldiers, Jennings and Blodget, who were ſtationed there, and carried Mr. John Fitch and his family into captivity, who all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in ſafety, after enduring incredible hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and fatigues, except Mrs. Fitch who ſicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and died in Canada.</p>
               <p>Lunenburg is almoſt wholly ſettled: The town contains but 14000 acres of land; and on this ſpace, when the late cenſus was taken, there were 192 houſes, and nearly 1300 ſouls.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe the account of Lunenburg in the words of the Rev. Mr. Adams, in a letter to the author. "The town is much more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the health than the wealth of its inhabitants. Almoſt deſtitute of travel through it, the people live an independent, but ſolitary life. In their ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical affairs they have been remarkably peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. They diſmiſſed Mr. Gardner; but becauſe he was unworthy. Two of their miniſters died in rapid ſucceſſion. None of them were ſo long in the miniſtry, nor ſo old, as myſelf. Almoſt thirty years have I lived among them in profound peace."</p>

               <p>THE grant of this townſhip was orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inally made to the Hon. Meſſrs.

It was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe all the lands between Woodſtock, or the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony line, ſouth; Oxford, north; the grant to Medfield, now Sturbridge, weſt; and Newſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, now Douglaſs, eaſt. This tract of land was incorporated by act of the Legiſlature, on the 2d of February, 1731, and the name of <hi>Dudley</hi> was given to it, as a token of reſpect to that family, who were principal proprietors of the ſoil, and great benefactors to the firſt ſettlers in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. Since the incorporation of Dudley, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was made to it by a ſtrip of land taken from Oxford, and annexed thereto. The preſent extent of this town is nearly eaſt and weſt about nine miles; north and ſouth about four miles. It is now bounded, north, by Oxford, and Charlton; eaſt, by Douglaſs; ſouth, by the ſtate line, or Woodſtock; and weſt, by Sturbridge.</p>
               <p>Dudley has but one religious ſociety, viz. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational, although there may be about thirty families of various other perſuaſions, in the place. The church of Chriſt here was founded in the year 1732, and the Rev. Perley Howe was ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted

Mr. Howe was afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled at Killingſley in Connecticut. He was ſucceeded in the paſtoral office at Dudley by the Rev. Charles Gleaſon, who was ordained October 31ſt, 1744. He continued the worthy, faithful and beloved miniſter of the town until his death, which took place May 7th, 1790. The Rev. Joſhua Johnſon, who had been for a ſhort time miniſter of the north pariſh in Woodſtock, was inſtalled Paſtor of the church and congregation in Dudley, as ſucceſſor to Mr. Gleaſon, December 1ſt, 1790.</p>
               <p>The congregational meetinghouſe, which is the only one in this town, was erected in the year 1734. It ſtands on an hill, which commands a ſouth proſpect of extenſive farms even to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of twelve miles. Four acres of land on the ſummit of this hill were given to the town for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick uſes, by the Pegan tribe of Indians, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that all of their tribe, who ſhould ever inhabit the town, ſhould have the right to convenient ſeats in the meetinghouſe on days of public worſhip. This tribe ſtill exiſts, to the number of ten or twelve, and hold about 200 acres of excellent land near the middle of the town; but their whole intereſt is conſtantly taken care of by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the General Court.</p>

               <p>THE town of Harvard is ſituated on the eaſtern ſide of the county, thirty five miles from Boſton, a little to the north of weſt, and is twenty three miles from the courthouſe in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, to the northeaſt.

Harvard was not an original grant, but taken from Lancaſter, Stow and Groton, principally from the two former. From the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:026481_0154_0FD056F5880DCC50"/>
of its being made up of the corners of other towns, it was rather irregular in its ſhape; but before the incorporation of Boxborough, which took off the eaſterly angle of this town, it was nearly equal to ſeven miles ſquare: It is now more than ſix. The bill for the incorporation of this tract of land paſſed the Legiſlature, June 29th, 1732, when it was called Harvard, to bear up the name of that excellent and worthy miniſter of Charleſtown the Rev. John Harvard, who died in 1638, who laid the foundation of Harvard Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in Cambridge, bequeathing thereto 779<hi>l.</hi> 17<hi>s.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> when by a ſpecial order of court, it took the name of Harvard College. At the time of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation of the town of Harvard, it conſiſted of about 50 families.</p>
               <p>The town of Harvard is very hilly and uneven; the land is rough and hard to ſubdue, but the ſoil is warm and ſtrong, rich and fertile. It produces good crops of grain of all kinds. Such broken land, however, is better adapted to the raiſing of wheat and rye, than Indian corn. As the town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is rocky, the farmers are induced to appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a large proportion of their land to graſs and paſturage. The principal articles carried hence to market, are beef, pork, butter, and cheeſe. The high lands are particularly fertile in cheſnut trees, whoſe fruit yields the owners no inconſiderable profit. And as the lands are excellent for orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arding, many farmers pay particular attention to raiſing all kinds of fruit, which they have in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of the beſt quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="unknown:026481_0155_0FD056D0097CF868"/>There are about 1000 acres of what is called interval land in this town; though perhaps half of it may more properly be ſtyled meadow.</p>
               <p>Although there are ſeveral hills in this place, yet there are but three which have names, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it particular notice. The firſt we ſhall mention is called <hi>Pin Hill,</hi> from its remarkable form which is pyramidical. The perpendicular height of this hill, from the brook which runs at the foot of it, is judged to be two hundred feet. In the bowels of this hill are contained vaſt quantities of blue or ſlate ſtone. It leaſes to the ſtone cutters in this and a neighbouring town for 6<hi>l.</hi> 10<hi>s.</hi> per annum. The ſtones taken hence, are not ſo eaſily wrought, as ſome of a ſimilar kind: But on this account, however, they are more valuable for jambs and hearths, as they in the ſame proportion, do the more reſiſt the heat of fire. Theſe ſtones are chiefly uſed, for grave and tomb ſtones; and are carried to a great diſtance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe called Bear Hill, and Oak Hill, are not, ſtrictly ſpeaking, diſtinct hills, but links only in a chain of hills, which begins in the weſt part of Lyttleton, and extends ſouthweſterly through Harvard, as far as the centre of Bolton. Oak Hill, however, which riſes in the eaſterly part of the town, is the ſummit of this range, and affords a proſpect ſingularly diverſified and extenſive. The land upon theſe hills is moſtly exceeding good.</p>
               <p>The general growth of wood in Harvard, is the ſame as in other towns of ſimilar ſoils. Cheſnut, oak of all kinds, and walnut, conſtitute the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:026481_0156_0FD056F74C6F2E88"/>
part on the high lands. They have ſome white pine, and in the northerly part, conſiderable pitch pine. In the low lands they have much elm, ſome butternut and button wood, birch, aſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Harvard is like other hilly, rocky places, not dry, but moiſt land, and well watered indeed by numerous ſprings and rivulets, running about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the hills, and which cauſe them to rejoice on every ſide.</p>
               <p>Naſhaway, or Lancaſter River, flows along the confines of Harvard upwards of ſix miles. The depth of the water, when the bed of the river is full, is about twelve feet; and about ſix feet at low water. This river, an humble imitator of the Nile, overflows its banks at certain ſeaſons, and greatly fertilizes the bordering lands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Still River</hi> originates in ſome marſhes and quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires in the weſterly part of Bolton, and is joined by a brook running from the interval lands in Lancaſter, near the river. Theſe two ſtreams unite in Harvard, and compoſe what is called <hi>Still River,</hi> or long pond, or lake, which paſſes in a ſilent and almoſt imperceptible manner, for three miles, (one mile or more of which is in Harvard,) and then by a ſmall outlet, empties itſelf into the river Naſhaway.</p>
               <p>There are two or three ponds of ſome notoriety in this town. The largeſt of theſe begins but a little ſouthweſterly of the meetinghouſe, and very nigh the ſeat of Col. Bromfield, and extends away ſoutherly. It is called <hi>Bear Hill Pond,</hi> as it lies upon the weſterly ſide of that hill. Its figure is
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:026481_0157_0FD056D18A087758"/>
oblong: Its circumference more than three miles. In this pond are two ſmall iſlands of about three acres each. The greateſt depth of this pond is not more than twenty feet.</p>
               <p>At the north weſt angle of the town, is ſituated what is commonly called <hi>Hell Pond,</hi> from its amazing depth, being ninety five feet in one place, by meaſure; and between eighty and ninety feet in general, all over the pond, and immediately as you launch from ſhore. This pond is nearly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Its diameter is about three hundred yards. Fiſh were never caught here until within a few years, when pike and perch were put therein, which have ſince multiplied exceedingly. Near this is a ſmall pond, with which the former is ſuppoſed to maintain a ſubterraneous communication. There is alſo another, in the north part of the town, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Robbins</hi>'s <hi>Pond;</hi> but this is not remarkable for ſize or depth. About an hundred rods from Hell Pond, is a ſpring, known by the name of <hi>Cold Spring.</hi> The waters hereof are always pure and cold, and never freeze. The head of this ſpring is two or three yards broad. Bear Hill Pond emits a ſtream from its north ſide, which almoſt winds around Pin Hill; and which, within the limits of Harvard, ſupplies with water, four griſt mills, one ſaw mill, one clothiers' works, one forge, and one trip hammer. Theſe are all in the north part of the town. In the ſouth part, there are two griſt mills, and one ſaw mill, furniſhed with water from two ſtreams which iſſue from the eaſt ſide of the chain of hills above deſcribed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="unknown:026481_0158_0FD056F88B72E0B0"/>It is worthy of particular mention, that the eaſtern ſide of the above hills is uniformly ſteep, while the oppoſite ſide has a gentle and gradual declivity.</p>
               <p>At the foot of Oak Hill, on the eaſtern ſide, there is a mine which may be juſtly deemed a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. Early in the year 1783, when a rage for the treaſures, thought to be hid in the bowels of the earth, was prevalent in the country, it was thought by ſome perſons, from the colour of the earth in this place, and from the working of the mineral rods, that ſilver ore might be obtained not far beneath the ſurface of the ground. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome gentlemen in this town and its vicinity, (twenty five in number) formed themſelves into a mine company for the purpoſe of deſcrying thoſe hidden treaſures, and enriching themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Under the conduct of certain men, Meſſrs. Ives and Peck, they began their operations in July following. Theſe were continued, though with frequent interruptions, until ſometime in the year 1789. During this time, they had, with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, digged through a conſiderable quantity of condenſed gravel, until they came to a ſolid rock: Into this they penetrated more than forty feet. But, either from the unſkilfulneſs of the mineral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, or for want of perſeverance in their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the ſhining ore has not yet been diſcovered. The company, after expending one thouſand one hundred dollars in the proceſs, is amically diſſolved. The ſides of this cavity are almoſt rectilinear. It is about ſix feet high, and half as wide. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavation
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:026481_0159_0FD056D352AB5F88"/>
was made, partly by heating the rock to a great degree, and then cooling it ſuddenly with water; but the greater portion of it was effected with powder. Pieces of the earth, which they dug before they entered the rock, had the appearance of yellow lead, and were conſiderably ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. This cavern now reſts a deſerted monument of ſucceſsleſs toils. Its mouth opens to the eaſt; and the riſing ſun, to a perſon in the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, renders the proſpect highly delightful.</p>
               <p>The town of Harvard is large and numerous, here are 200 dwelling houſes, which, like thoſe of moſt country towns in this State, are ſcattered over the place without much order; and conſiſt of ſome good and more ordinary buildings. The inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are 1400; theſe are chiefly farmers, who are frugal and induſtrious, and ſome are become wealthy. They have two or three traders in foreign goods, and all the uſual ſorts of mechanicks.</p>
               <p>This town diſcovers great ſolicitude for the good education of its children. The inhabitants divide themſelves into eight diſtricts: In each there is a neat and commodious ſchoolhouſe; and ſix of them, in the winter ſeaſon, are furniſhed with latin grammar inſtructors; the other two with Engliſh grammar maſters. In the ſummer, the very young children are taught by approved females; while they who are more advanced, are handling the plough and the diſtaff. Here a library company has lately been formed. They have at preſent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one hundred volumes in their library. No doubt it will ſoon be conſiderably augmented.
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:026481_0160_0FD056FA0A708410"/>
There is alſo here a ſocial club eſtabliſhed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of twelve of the principal inhabitants, who have monthly meetings. In them they endeavour to acquire information on the common, as well as on the moſt important affairs agitated in the world.</p>
               <p>The principles and modes of religion in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard, are uncommonly numerous. Within the limits of the town dwell congregationaliſts, ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, preſbyterians, epiſcopalians, univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts and ſhakers. Until after the commencement of the late war, they were all of the denomination firſt-mentioned; and this ſtill compriſes five ſevenths of the ſouls in the town.</p>
               <p>The congregational church in Harvard was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied by an eccleſiaſtical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til September 7th, 1757 (almoſt twenty four years in the ſacred office here) when he was diſmiſſed from his paſtoral relation to this people. Mr. Seccombe was afterwards employed many years in the work of the miniſtry in the province of Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcotia, where he died in 1792, aged eighty four years. Mr. Seccombe was ſucceeded in the work of the miniſtry at Harvard, by the Rev. Joſeph Wheeler, who was conſecrated thereunto Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 12th, 1759. In a few years Mr. Wheeler was afflicted with bodily infirmities, which peculiarly affected his voice, in conſequence whereof he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited a diſmiſſion from that ſacred employment, which accordingly took place by advice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of a mutual council, July 28th,

He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a worthy Magiſtrate, and Regiſter of Probate in the county of Worceſter, from 1776, until Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 10th, 1793, when he died in the fifty eighth year of his age.

He was ſuffered to continue but a little time, being removed by death on the 23d of September 1777. After Mr. Johnſon's deceaſe, the Rev. Ebenezer Groſvenor was inſtalled their Paſtor on the 19th of June 1782. He had been before Paſtor of the firſt church in Scituate almoſt ſeventeen years. Mr. Groſvenor was not ſuffered to continue long at Harvard, being tranſlated by death to a better world May 28th, 1788, in the forty ninth year of his age.</p>
               <p>The town was deſtitute of a ſettled miniſter near four years, when the Rev. William Emerſon was ſeparated unto that ſacred office, May 23d, 1792, the fifth Paſtor in ſucceſſion. In this church of Harvard 1805 perſons have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and 540 have been admitted to church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>In the year 1776 an anabaptiſt ſociety began to collect in Harvard. It was eſtabliſhed in 1778, when Mr. Iſaiah Parker, who is alſo a phyſician, was ordained their teacher, and ſtill continues. The number of this ſociety has ſince been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what increaſed by perſons from the ſkirts of the adjacent towns. This ſociety have a pretty meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:026481_0162_0FD056FB89422DA0"/>
in the ſouthweſt part of the town, near to Still River, in a pleaſant conſpicuous place. The epiſcopalians, preſbyterians, and univerſaliſts are but few, and have no diſtinct and ſeparate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</p>
               <p>Sometime in the year 1780, the leaders of that ſect of religioniſts, called ſhakers, came into this town; and as there are few of them indeed in any other part of the county, it is highly fitting and proper to give a full account of them in this place.</p>
               <p>They fixed themſelves down in a corner of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard, where ſuperſtition and enthuſiaſm had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably flouriſhed under the auſpices of one Mr. Ireland. A part of this man's followers kindled at this new torch of fanaticiſm, while the majority of theſe old faſhioned enthuſiaſts at the ſight of the ſhakers' diſtraction became more rational and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Since their beginning in Harvard, they have been continually making reforms in their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, modes of worſhip and manners. In a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and political view they have greatly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorated. From groſs indecencies in their rites and behaviour, they are become moderate and civil. Formerly they were indolent and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in ſociety; now they are the moſt induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and peaceful members of the community. The number of ſhakers in Harvard is about one hundred and fifty. Theſe are divided into three orders; or as they call them, <hi>gifts.</hi> The firſt of theſe orders conſiſts principally of the youngeſt and faireſt of them who are gathered. Theſe are under the moſt rigid rules poſſible. They are
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:026481_0163_0FD056D60C25F088"/>
never to ſee any of the world's people, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them of the lower orders. All their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, words and ſteps, are narrowly inſpected by their ſpiritual teacher, who almoſt perſuades them to believe that he is converſant with their thoughts. They of the firſt order are privileged with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral addreſſes; to the others he uſually communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates his monitions by a meſſenger.</p>
               <p>The ſecond order is compoſed of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m who are gathered, but who are more advanced in years, and otherwiſe leſs vigorous and alert in labour and in devotion.</p>
               <p>The loweſt order are they who live about in families.</p>
               <p>Extreme ſimplicity in dreſs and manners charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terizes this ſingular religious ſect. They are neat in their apparel and furniture. The houſes which they have erected in this town, are large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and approach to ſomething like elegance. Their floors and ſtairs are all covered to prevent making a noiſe. They imitate the Moravians apparently more than any other denomination; particularly in their modes of government and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination. They affect to be wholly under the dominion of the Spirit; and to crucify even the innocent deſires of the fleſh, inſomuch that they neither marry nor are given in marriage. So ſtrict are they in their laws of abſtinence from women, that the two ſexes are not permitted to live in the ſame houſe, nor even to enter the ſame door. Inſtances of inchaſtity, eſpecially among the governed, ſeldom or ever occur. The orders
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:026481_0164_0FD056FD07B22760"/>
are under the moſt complete ſubjection to their leaders. The utmoſt preciſion and regularity are obſerved in their eating, ſleeping and working. Hence they are making quite rapid proficiency in the lower kinds of the mechanick arts; and ſuch is their agricultural ſkill and perſeverance, that they have reduced the moſt rugged and indoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of Harvard to a ſtate reſembling that of a garden.</p>
               <p>We conclude this account with only remarking, that it is not a little ſtrange, that the leaders of this deluded ſect, who certainly can claim no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence above ordinary men in point of capacity and improvement, ſhould thus keep bound in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude ſo great a number of their brethren in the very heart of Newengland. But it will be ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtill, if in ſuch an era as this, the majority of the ſhakers, who now pant for liberty, ſhould long continue in ſhackles of bondage to their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid what may be thought quite ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient upon the eccleſiaſtical and religious ſtate of Harvard, we ſhall cloſe our account of this place, with ſaying it is a large, proſperous and wealthy town; and notwithſtanding the diverſity of ſects, the people are peaceable and happy.</p>

               <p>THIS is that tract of land of four miles ſquare, which was reſerved for the Indians when the town of Sutton was granted to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. It was called by the Indians Haſſanamiſco, and known by that name only until April 18th, 1735, when it was incorporated by an act of the Legiſlature, and called Grafton.

                  </gap> land was taken from Shrewſbury and added to Grafton, on the north, and about half a mile of Sutton, on the ſouth, was annexed to it; ſo that Grafton is now five miles in length, from north to ſouth, and four in width from eaſt to weſt. This town is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the north, by Shrewſbury; on the eaſt, by Weſtborough and Upton; on the ſouth, by Upton and Sutton; and on the weſt, by Sutton.</p>
               <p>At firſt there were divers Indian families here: As they diminiſhed, the white people became proprietors of the ſoil, by purchaſe; and a grant from the General Court, upon theſe conditions, however, that they ſhould always provide preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſchooling, and ſeats in the meetinghouſe, for the remaining Indians. And as the people hold the lands of the original four miles ſquare, on ſuch conditions, they muſt all of whatever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, be equally bound to contribute to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a goſpel miniſter in the place. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Court has from the beginning, appointed a committee of three, called the truſtees of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians' intereſt; their buſineſs is to take care of their property, both real and perſonal, and diſpoſe of the ſame to the beſt advantage, for the ſupport and maintenance of the Indians. This committee, at preſent, have little to do in the execution of their truſt, as the lands have by length of time, and various concurring circumſtances, chiefly paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the hands of the white people. There are indeed ſeveral farms in the poſſeſſion of the heirs of the Indians, married to negroes; but it is ſaid there is not one male in the town at this day, who is all of Indian extract or blood.</p>
               <p>The Indians very ſoon decreaſed in this place, and the whites became poſſeſſors and occupiers of the ſoil; and ſo early as the 28th of December 1731, a Chriſtian congregational church was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied here, and on the next day, the Rev. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prentice was ordained their firſt Paſtor. He became what was called in that day, a zealous newlight, or more properly, a raving enthuſiaſt. He was diſmiſſed from his paſtoral relation to Grafton, July 8th. 1747, and became an itinerant preacher. He was ſucceeded in the work of the goſpel miniſtry at Grafton by the Rev. Aaron Hutchinſon, who was ſolemnly conſecrated here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto on the 6th of June 1750. Mr. Hutchinſon continued upwards of twenty two years as Paſtor of Grafton, and was diſmiſſed from his relation to that church and people, November 18th, 1772. He has ſince generally been employed in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the goſpel, and is ſtill living. The Rev. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iel Groſvenor ſucceeded Mr. Hutchinſon as Paſtor of the church and flock of God in Grafton, to which office he was ſeparated by the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery, on the 19th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1774. By reaſon of great bodily infirmities of long continuance, he requeſted a diſmiſſion from his particular relation to the Church and people of Grafton, to which they acceded with great reluctance, and which took place January 1ſt, 1788. No miniſter is ſince ſettled in the place. Mr. Groſvenor's health, being in a good meaſure reſtored, he is moſt conſtantly employed in preaching in neighbouring vacant pariſhes.</p>
               <p>Some years ago there was an anabaptiſt ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and church eſtabliſhed in Grafton, and they had a regular miniſter of publick education ſettled with them; but now there is neither miniſter nor church of that denomination in the town, and very few anabaptiſt families.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to ſome Geographical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Grafton. It is a moſt excellent town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of land. The face of the town is hilly and uneven, and in general rocky; but the ſoil is moiſt and ſtrong, rich and very productive: It is good for Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, barley, and flax: The lands are naturally warm and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to froſts; and as they are high and rocky, they are well adapted to orcharding and all kinds of fruit trees. There are three noticeable hills in the town The firſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e mentioned, is called Cheſnut Hill, as abounding in that ſort of wood.
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:026481_0168_0FD057000BF7A8E0"/>
This is ſituated but a little eaſt of the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and is the higheſt land in the town, hiding Grafton from Weſtborough: This is not large; the land is moiſt and good. On the eaſterly ſide of the town lies George Hill, two miles and an half in length. It took its name from one George Miſco, an Indian who dwelt upon it. This is a hill of moſt excellent land; and there are a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of very fine farms upon it. A third is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated Brigham Hill, from a number of that name who have lived upon it: This lies in the weſterly part of the town, is high, about two miles in length; has upon it ſeveral excellent and large farms, though ſome parts of it are rough, broken lands.</p>
               <p>The general growth of wood is walnut, oak of all kinds, cheſnut, ſome pitch pine, butternut, but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton wood, black and white aſh, and birch. There is ſome pine plain land in the town near the rivers.</p>
               <p>Blackſtone River, from the north pariſh in Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, enters Grafton in the ſouthweſterly part of the town; this is then become a large and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful river, and runs about three miles in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly part of Grafton, and then paſſes into Upton. Little River, or more properly Quinſigamond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the outlet from the pond of that name, runs along on the weſt ſide of the town, within about half a mile of the meetinghouſe, and between that and Brigham Hill; and about one mile and an half ſouth from the meetinghouſe joins Blackſtone Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. On theſe rivers, before and after the junction, there are conſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="170" facs="unknown:026481_0169_0FD056DB4ACB61C8"/>
and rich interval lands. The River Aſſabet, which runs northeaſt, and empties into Merrimack, has its ſource in Grafton, about one mile and an half northeaſt from the meetinghouſe: This paſſes through the northweſt angle of Weſtborough, into Northborough, &amp;c. Beſides theſe, on the weſt ſide of George Hill, runs George Brook, which riſes in the northerly part of Grafton; this paſſes to the ſouth. On this ſtream there are large and good meadows. There is no pond in the town. Upon the ſeveral rivers and ſtreams abovementioned, there are four griſt mills, ſeveral ſaw mills, three trip hammers, and one fulling mill. The town abounds with rivulets and ſprings of water.</p>
               <p>The people ſubſiſt mainly by the cultivation of the ſoil, and they are amply recompenſed for all their labour. They have one or two traders in foreign goods, and the uſual tradeſmen and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks; and here pot aſh making is carried on. Grafton, though not a large tract of land, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rich and good ſoil, is pretty well filled with people, and they are become wealthy. There were nearly 900 inhabitants when the cenſus was taken about two years ago. This town reaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantage from the travel through it. A road much uſed, leading from Connecticut to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, paſſes through this town; as alſo the poſt road from Worceſter to Providence. Grafton is forty miles from Boſton, to the ſouthweſt: It is thirty four miles from Providence, to the northweſt, and eight from the courthouſe in Worceſter, a little to the ſouth of eaſt.</p>

The poſt road from Worceſter to Providence paſſes through this place, about a mile ſouthweſt of the meetinghouſe. It was incorporated by an act of the Legiſlature on the 14th of June, 1735, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains upwards of 13000 acres of land; and when the cenſus was taken there were 126 dwelling houſes, about 150 families, and about 900 inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants in the place.</p>
               <p>As no church records are to be found of what took place in the earlier days of this town, ſo the preciſe time when the congregational church was formed here cannot be aſcertained; but it was ſoon after the incorporation of the town, when the Rev. Thomas Weld was ordained their firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. This gentleman continued in the miniſtry among this people but a few years, being diſmiſſed from his paſtoral relation to them; and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards inſtalled at a pariſh in Middleborough, in the county of Plymouth. From hence alſo he was removed, and ſoon after entered the army, in the laſt French war, in the capacity of chaplain, where he died. He was ſucceeded at Upton, in

the work of the goſpel miniſtry, by the Rev. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha Fiſh, who was ſolemnly ſeparated unto this ſacred employment on the 5th of June, 1751, and who, having obtained help of God, ſtill continues, faithfully ſerving the Lord in the goſpel of his Son. There is a conſiderable ſociety of anabaptiſts in this town, and has been for many years. For early in the year 1751 they ordained one Mr. Abraham Bloſs for their teaching elder, who continued there but a few years before he left them; after which the ſociety and church diſſolved. However, a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals remained, who called themſelves ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, who rarely had any meetings for religious worſhip among themſelves for ſeveral years, but occaſionally attended upon teachers of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination in other towns. But early in the year 1787 there aroſe a conſiderable number, very ſuddenly, who called themſelves anabaptiſts, and ſtill remain as a diſtinct ſociety, to whom one el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ingalls firſt miniſtered; and ſince they have the occaſional inſtruction of Mr. Simeon Snow who has been ordained at large. However, there is not, ſo far as I can learn, any church ſo gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them as to celebrate the Lord's ſupper by themſelves.</p>
               <p>In the town of Upton there are alſo a number of the people called friends or quakers, but no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct ſociety of that denomination is formed there.</p>
               <p>We ſhall proceed to ſome Topographical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Upton. Some parts of the town are very rough and uneven, others more level. The ſoil is generally ſtrong, rich and good, favourable

for orcharding, and fruit of moſt kinds, and for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turage and graſs; and there are a number of rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets paſſing about in the valleys, between the hills, whereby it is pretty well furniſhed with water. There is one river, which has its ſource in Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and paſſing-through the weſt part of Upton, in a ſoutherly courſe, known by the name of <hi>Weſt River</hi>: This is emptied into Blackſtone Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the lower part of Uxbridge. On this river there are ſome good meadows; alſo mills. A little north of the meetinghouſe, there is a ſmall pond fed by rivulets and ſprings, from the ſouth end of which there iſſues a fine ſtream, on which there is a corn mill within a few rods of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe, whereby the inhabitants are greatly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated and benefited; this falls into Weſt River. The growth of wood is ſimilar to that of other towns of like kinds of ſoil. The high lands have plenty of oak of the ſeveral ſorts; conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of walnut; ſome cheſnut: The low lands have birch, maple, elm, alder, &amp;c. There is much pitch pine in the place, and alſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able white pine remaining even at this day. This town is ſituated about thirty eight miles from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, to the ſouthweſt; and fifteen miles from Worceſter courthouſe, about ſoutheaſt; and is bounded on the north by Weſtborough; on the eaſt, by Hopkinton and Milford; on the ſouth, by Mendon; and on the weſt, by Northbridge and Grafton.</p>

Joſhua Lamb, Nathaniel Page, Andrew Gardner, Benjamin Gamblin, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Tucker, John Curtiſs, Richard Draper, and Samuel Ruggles, of Roxbury. This tract of land included what is now Hardwick. In conſequence of the abovementioned deed, the heirs of thoſe gentlemen petitioned the General Court, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a grant of this townſhip on the 17th of June, 1732. It was called Lambſtown, from the firſt named proprietor, until it was incorporated and made a town by an act of the Legiſlature, which bears date January 10th, 1738, when the name of <hi>Hardwick</hi> was given to it.</p>
               <p>This town contains, according to its original grant, about ſix miles ſquare, notwithſtanding a part on the eaſterly ſide of the place was ſet off more than forty years ago, to help in making up the town of Newbraintree. Hardwick is now bounded on the north, by Peterſham and Barre; on the eaſt, by Barre, Newbraintree and <hi>Ware Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> on the ſouth, by Ware River, and the town of Ware, in the county of Hampſhire; and on the weſt, by Greenwich in that county.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="unknown:026481_0174_0FD0570524DF50D8"/>After the location of this grant a number of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers immediately entered upon the lands, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers followed ſo rapidly, as that they ſoon had the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached among them, and as early as November 17th, 1736, a little more than four years from the date of the grant, the church of Chriſt was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſame day the Rev. David White was ordained their firſt Paſtor. He died January 6th, 1784, in the 74th year of his age, and the 48th of his miniſtry. He was ſucceeded in the ſacred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by the Rev. Thomas Holt, who was ſeparated unto that high and holy calling on the 25th of June, 1789, after a vacancy of five years and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſix months.</p>
               <p>The people of Hardwick, conſidering their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, are remarkably united in their ſentiments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting religion. There are a few antipedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts in the place; as alſo a few profeſſed univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliſts.</p>
               <p>We proceed to ſome Topographical Deſcription of Hardwick. The town is of a good form and ſhape, being nearly ſquare. The face of the town is rather rough, hilly and uneven: Although there are no very great and remarkable hills. The ſoil is, in general, deep, loamy, and very fertile. The lands produce all kinds of grain in ſufficient plenty for the inhabitants; but they are beſt adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to graſs and paſturage: Here vaſt quantities of butter and cheeſe are made, and moſt excellent beef fatted for the market. All kinds of fruit trees flouriſh here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="unknown:026481_0175_0FD056DFCBEE2F18"/>The principal growth of wood is oak of all ſorts, cheſnut and walnut; but in the north weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern part of the town, there is ſome white and pitch pine. The land is generally rocky and moiſt; and it is finely watered in every part by ſprings, ſtreams and rivulets, which run about in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys among the hills; but there are no ſtreams of note or diſtinction in the town, although they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh water for all ſorts of water works; and there are within the town, five corn mills, four ſaw mills, and two clothiers' works, where much buſineſs is performed to the great advantage of the people.</p>
               <p>Ware River, which is large, runs on the eaſt and ſouth of the town, and is the boundary between this town and Newbraintree, and alſo between Hardwick and the town of Ware. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val on this river, in the eaſtern part of the town, may contain perhaps as much as two hundred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of very excellent mowing land. On this riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a furnace was erected ſeveral years ago, and where much hard ware has been manufactured; but at preſent there is no buſineſs done thereat.</p>
               <p>There are two conſiderable ponds in the town; one called <hi>Pottapoug,</hi> in the northerly part, is about two miles in length, and nearly one third of a mile in breadth; this is ſtored with fiſh. It has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let which comes from Peterſham; its outlet paſſes through the northweſtern part of Hardwick, and falls into Chicabee River. The other, called <hi>Muddy Pond,</hi> is about one mile in length, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half a mile in width in the ſoutherly part.
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:026481_0176_0FD0570608B4D608"/>
It has plenty of good fiſh. It has a ſmall inlet; its outlet is into Ware River.</p>
               <p>The roads of travel are from Boſton, either through Worceſter or Rutland, to Hardwick, and ſo on to Northampton. Another road from the ſouthweſt, with one from the ſoutheaſt, form a junction near the centre of the town, and then paſſing northward, through Peterſham into the States of Newhampſhire and Vermont. Hardwick is ſituated a little ſouthweſt from Boſton, diſtant from the State houſe ſeventy two miles, and from the courthouſe in Worceſter twenty five miles, a little to the northweſt. It is a very large, flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wealthy town, and contained, when the cenſus was taken, 245 houſes and 1725 inhabitants; and was the fifth town in the county in the proportion it paid to a State tax in 1790.</p>

               <p>THIS town was taken from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient town of Lancaſter; and was incorporated on the 24th of June, 1738, by act of the Legiſlature, when it received its preſent name. The tract of land was large at firſt: In the year 1784, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of Berlin, to the ſouth, was ſet off from it: Still it is large enough to make a very reſpectable figure among the towns in the county.

when the continental cenſus was taken, 125 houſes, and 861 inhabitants. It is bounded by Lancaſter on the weſt; by Harvard, on the north; by Stow, in the county of Middleſex, on the eaſt; by Marlborough on the ſoutheaſt; and by Berlin, on the ſouth. It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s diſtant from Boſton about thirty four miles nearly weſt; and from the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in Worceſter, it is about eighteen miles, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the northeaſt.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of Bolton is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. The church of Chriſt here was gathered on the 4th of November, 1741; on which day the Rev. Thomas Goſs was ordained their firſt paſtor, who continued until January 17th, 1780, when he died in the ſixty third year of his age, and thirty ninth of his miniſtry. He was ſucceeded, a ſhort ſpace of time, by the Rev. John Walley, who had been before for ſeveral years miniſter of a pariſh in Ipſwich. Mr. Walley was diſmiſſed from Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, not long before his death. He was ſucceeded in the work of the goſpel miniſtry in this place, by the Rev. Phineas Wright, who was ſolemnly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated hereunto October 26th, 1785, and who ſtill lives. The people are peaceable and happy, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and flouriſhing.</p>
               <p>In Bolton, and the diſtrict of Berlin, there is a ſociety of friends, or quakers, conſiſting of a large number of moſtly wealthy families; their houſe of worſhip ſtands within the limits of Bolton, near to Berlin line.</p>
               <p>We ſhall proceed to give ſome Geographical Deſcription of Bolton. The town in general is
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:026481_0178_0FD0570789DB48F0"/>
good land, not level, nor yet has it any very high hills. The higheſt lands in the town are rich and moiſt; excellent for orcharding and paſture land. It is not very rocky, however, there are ſtones ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to wall in all their farms. The people raiſe rye, wheat, Indian corn, barley, oats, flax, &amp;c. &amp;c. upon their lands, in ſuch plenty as richly to repay their labour in the cultivation thereof. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half a mile from the centre of the town, to the weſt, begins the great hill, known by the name of Wattoquottock Hill, which extends ſouthweſterly into Berlin. This long, large hill, is not very high; it is in general very good land, and there are div<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fine farms upon it. The great road from Lancaſter to Boſton paſſes over the north end of this hill, upon its declivity, where it is very moiſt, conſiſting of clay and loam, ſenſibly felt by trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellers in the wet ſeaſons of the year. On the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſide of this hill, about halfway from its foot to the ſummit, is a cavity opening to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, parallel with the main courſe of the hill, near the upper end of which is a pool, or ſmall pond of water, known by the name of Welch Pond. This pond is of a circular form about twenty feet in depth, and occupies the ſpace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one acre on its ſurface. It is ſuppoſed to have diminiſhed about one half, both in depth and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference within forty years paſt. People now mow conſiderable graſs, where they went with boats and canoes half a century ago. On the ſoutheaſterly ſide of this hill, and nearly oppoſite to W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h Pond, iſſue a number of rivulets, which
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:026481_0179_0FD056E2CA1FA4F0"/>
ſoon unite in the low lands, and form a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble brook, taking a ſoutheaſterly courſe, till it falls into Aſſabet River, in the northerly part of Marlborough. This brook has water ſufficient to carry two mills, in the wet ſeaſons of the year, at the diſtance of leſs than one mile from the hill. There is a glade of moſt excellent meadow on each ſide of this ſtream, its whole length, with but few ſmall interruptions, by hard land. The higher parts of theſe meadows, next the hill, are known by the name of Wattoquottock Meadows. At a ſmall diſtance from the northeaſterly foot of Wattoquottock, begins another large hill, with a gradual aſcent, which extends northeaſterly through Harvard into the boundaries of Lyttleton, in the county of Middleſex. By ſome, this is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bear Hill, by others Oak-Hill. This hill has been thought to contain mines and minerals, and has, conſequently, for a number of years engaged the attention of a reſpectable ſociety of mineſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but their expectations have far exceeded their gains: For though its bowels have been explored with much painful labour, and ſanguine hope, yet the mountain has not even to this day brought forth a mouſe. At the interſection, between this laſt mentioned hill and Wattoquottock, is a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bar of hard land, about fifteen rods in width; and on each ſide of this bar, is a ſmall piece of low, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

waters, and empties into <hi>Still River,</hi> ſo called, within the boundaries of Lancaſter. The rivulet on the ſoutheaſterly ſide runs an eaſterly courſe; the waters of which being augmented by ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, become ſufficient to carry mills, where much buſineſs is done, at the diſtance of two miles from their ſource, except in the ſummer months, and they are emptied into the river Aſſabet, about two miles ſoutheaſt from Stow meetinghouſe; previous to which, however, the road to Boſton croſſes this ſtream three times. On this brook are ſeveral bodies of meadow, but not equal in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thoſe beforementioned. In the northeaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part of Bolton, about two miles and an half from the centre of the town, is ſituated the large and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive hill, called Rattle Snake Hill, belonging to the heirs of the late Gen. John Whetcomb. In the ſouth ſide of this hill is a body of limeſtone; and here are annually made about one hundred and fifty hogſheads of the very beſt of lime. In the eaſterly part of the town is a large hill, known by the name of Long Hill. It lies cloſe on the ſouth ſide of, and runs parallel with the great road, about one mile and an half, to Stow line, with a gradual aſcent to the ſouth of about half a mile to its ſummit. There are two ſmall ponds, of a circular form, at the diſtance of about eighty rods from each other, in the eaſterly part of the town, ſuppoſed to cover, one about forty, and the other about thirty acres of ground. The largeſt of theſe lies near the weſt end of Long Hill, in ſight of the great road and known by the name of
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:026481_0181_0FD056E449D695D0"/>
Weſt's Pond, from a perſon of that name formerly living on its ſhore. In the northweſt angle of Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, mainly, is ſituated a large body of almoſt ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant water, and therefore called Still River, but might be more properly denominated a lake, or very long pond. It is various in its width and depth. It begins within the boundaries of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, in the great intervals (about twenty rods eaſt of the great bridge over the Naſhaway, after the junction of its two branches) and proceeds in a circular courſe, upwards of three miles, acroſs the northweſt corner of Bolton, into Harvard, from the north end of which there is a very ſmall outlet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the river Naſhaway. On the ſouth ſide of this lake, and between this and the river Naſhaway, is a very large body of moſt excellent interval land, part of which is within the limits of Bolton, uſed for tillage, mowing and paſturing: And which is often laid ſeveral feet under water by ſpring and fall floods, preſenting the appearance of a ſmall ſea.</p>
               <p>Various are the conjectures of people reſpecting Still River, Lake, or Long Pond, above mentioned. Some ſuppoſe the bed of the ſouth branch of Naſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away once was here, and that by ſome great freſhet it was cut off above, formed a new channel, and joined the north branch the ſooner, where the junction now is. Be this as it may, it is certain theſe branches have ſhifted their beds, in various places, and of conſiderable lengths, in the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ages. There are ſeveral rivulets fall into this lake on its eaſterly ſide; but there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let at its upper end, exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

directly out of the ground; and the great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is, that a ſtream, which begins in Bolton, feeds this Lake by a ſubterraneous paſſage; for while this ſtream is conſtant, briſk and lively, for half a mile, coming to a ſpot of pine, ſandy land, it diſappears, and no water is diſcernible for near two miles. There is a ſmall inlet into this lake on the eaſtern part of Lancaſter intervals, in wet ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but in the ſummer no water runs in this, and yet the lake appears no way to be affected thereby.</p>
               <p>Let us leave this lake, and finiſh our Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bolton.</p>
               <p>There are two pot aſh works in this place, and one of pearl aſh. Here are two famous brickyards where above two hundred thouſands of bricks are annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made. The town is very well wooded. On the high lands there is plenty of walnut, cheſnut, and oak of all ſorts: And here vaſt numbers of barrels and hogſheads are manufactured yearly; and great quantities of hoops are carried to market. In the low lands there is much maple, but little aſh, ſome birch. There are ſome plains covered with pitch pine, very little white pine.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, this is a town of rich, ſtrong and good land, and the people are increaſing in number wealth and reputation. They are now building a large elegant meetinghouſe, upon the modern conſtruction, with a ſteeple to it, to which Meſſrs.

               <p>THIS is ſtyled in the act for erecting the county of Worceſter, "The land lately grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeveral petitioners of Medfield," and many of the firſt ſettlers here were from the town of Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and hence the place was called Newmedfield, until its incorporation, which was, by an act of Court, on the 24th of June, 1738, when it received the name Sturbridge.</p>
               <p>This town is large in its dimenſions, containing by actual ſurvey, about 28929 acres. It is ſituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſouthweſt corner of the county, and is divided from Woodſtock and Union, on the ſouth, in the ſtate of Connecticut, by the ſtate line; and bounded weſt, on Holland and Brimfield, in the county of Hampſhire; on the north, by Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field; and on the eaſt, by Charlton and Dudley. The grant of this tract was made in the year 1729, in the month of Auguſt, but it was thought ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:026481_0184_0FD0570CB65FF3D0"/>
habitable by reaſon of its broken rough ſtate; and the ſoil, for the moſt part, requiring hard and great labour to render it productive; but the firſt ſettlers being a robuſt, reſolute, ſober and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious ſet of men, were determined to get an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt living, by "the ſweat of their faces," and, through the bleſſing of God, they ſoon converted this wilderneſs into a fruitful field. The original proprietors built a houſe for the worſhip of God, which was raiſed on the 20th and 21ſt days of June, 1733, and on the 3d of September following it was conſecrated by the Rev. Joſeph Baxter of Medfield, who preached from Iſaiah lxiii, and 5th. From that time the place increaſed faſt in the number of good and induſtrious people, who very quickly obtained to live comfortably; and like others of that age, early ſought for a teacher of piety and morality. On the 29th of September, 1736, the Rev. Caleb Rice was ordained to the paſtoral office over the church and flock of God in the place. He was a paſtor after God's heart; ſound in faith; a good preacher, endued with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent miniſterial gifts, and very exemplary in life, as well as ſocial and benevolent in his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He lived in great harmony with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the fore part of his miniſtry: But about the year 1747, a number of the brethren and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, conceiving they had received <hi>new light,</hi> different from what was common among their neighbours, ſeparated from him, which rendered his work more arduous, and his life uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. From ſeparatiſts they became anabaptiſts:
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:026481_0185_0FD056E74BDDF6C0"/>
But it pleaſed the Great Head of the church to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Mr. Rice from his labours, by death, on the ſecond of September, 1759, whoſe praiſe was then through all the churches, and his memory is ſtill dear to many. He was ſucceeded in the work of the goſpel miniſtry, in the congregational church and ſociety in Sturbridge, by the Rev. Joſhua Paine, who was ſeparated hereunto on the 17th of June, 1761, and ſtill continues the faithful and beloved paſtor thereof. The people here have ſurpriſingly flouriſhed and increaſed; for there are now about 1800 ſouls in the place. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational church is large, conſiſting of about 150 members of both ſexes. On the 29th and 30th days of June, 1785, they raiſed a large new meetinghouſe, which is elegant and well finiſhed; in which the firſt ſermon was preached by the Rev. Mr. Paine on January 7th, 1786, from firſt of Kings, viii. 27.</p>
               <p>There is in the town a very reſpectable ſociety of anabaptiſts, compriſing about one fifth part of the inhabitants. Theſe alſo have built them late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a handſome meetinghouſe. As great peace and harmony ſubſiſt between the two ſocieties, as can well be expected under ſuch circumſtances: Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſentiments, as to modes and rites of religion, ſcarcely injures good neighbourhood; nor does it prevent their mixing in families, or friendly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The inhabitants at preſent are induſtrious and frugal, charitable, and given to hoſpitality. The great precepts of the Chriſtian religion, moral vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

and the inſtruction of their youth, they make their ſtudy and care. They live in peace and love.</p>
               <p>However hilly, rough and uneven the town was at firſt, yet, by induſtry and frugality, the people are become wealthy, ſubſiſting chiefly by the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of the earth. By hard labour the ſoil is become fruitful. It is good for orcharding and grazing. Much butter and cheeſe are made here, eſpecially the former, which has obtained high credit in the markets. The land is pretty good for grain. The growth of wood is ſimilar to that of the towns in the vicinity, oak of all ſorts, walnut, cheſnut, pine in conſiderable plenty, eſpecially in its earlier days; aſh, beech, birch, maple, elm, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The town is in general well watered by ſprings, brooks, rivers and ponds. The River Quinebaug, which has its ſource in Brimfield, runs through this town near the centre, from weſt to eaſt. On this there are large bodies of good interval, and valuable meadow lands. There are valuable ponds in the town, well ſtored with the uſual ſorts of freſh water fiſh.</p>
               <p>Near one of theſe ponds, called Lead Mine Pond, a number of adventurers from Europe, ſome years paſt, dug deep for ore. A conſiderable quantity of which they carried with them to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but they have never returned to their purſuit.</p>

               <p>THE town of Holden was taken whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the town of Worceſter, being included in their original grants; and was the northweſterly part thereof.</p>
               <p>It was incorporated on the 9th of January, 1740, when the name of Holden was given to it to perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate the name and deeds of the Hon. Samuel Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the directors of the Bank of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and of his lady and their amiable daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who had been great and generous benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the literary and religious intereſts of this country.</p>
               <p>This worthy, benevolent man, tranſmitted to Newengland for charitable purpoſes, in books and bills of exchange, to the amount of 4847<hi>l.</hi> Neweng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land currency. After his deceaſe, Mrs. Holden and daughters ſent over in value, 5585<hi>l.</hi> for the ſame noble and pious uſes. With part of this latter ſum <hi>Holden Chapel,</hi> in the Univerſity of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, in Maſſachuſetts, was erected in the year 1745. There are nineteen volumes, chiefly octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos, in the hands of the Rev. Mr. Avery, given by Mrs. Holden and her daughters, to the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Holden, and his ſucceſſors. This town was ſaid to be laid out ſix miles ſquare, but it conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably exceeds that: From eaſt to weſt it is about ſeven miles acroſs: From the ſouth point at Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:026481_0188_0FD057288FDE83E8"/>
it is ten miles. It is bounded northerly, on Princeton and Sterling; eaſterly, on Worceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Boylſton; ſoutherly, on Worceſter, Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter and Paxton, and weſterly on Rutland and Paxton. We ſhall next preſent the reader with the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of Holden.</p>
               <p>The church of Chriſt in this place was formed on the 22d of December, 1742, and on the ſame day the Rev. Joſeph Davis was ordained their firſt paſtor. He was diſmiſſed from his paſtoral rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that people October 18th, 1772. Since that time he has been employed in preaching the goſpel in various places; and on Wedneſday the 2d day of January, 1793, he preached a ſpecial lecture to the people of Holden, as on that day half a century, from the imbodying the church and his ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>We go on to a Geographical Deſcription of the town of Holden. The ſoil of this town is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what various, yet in general of a loamy kind: The land in the outſkirts of the town is the moſt ſpringy and natural to graſs. The general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce is rye, Indian corn, ſpring wheat and oats. Some farms produce good barley. Flax is raiſed with various ſucceſs; when there is a failure of a crop, it is generally owing to other cauſes than the nature of the ſoil. Though the town is rather hilly and uneven, yet not very much ſo. Such
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:026481_0189_0FD04FF08C7E0750"/>
land is generally good for fruit; and, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, here are very large and valuable orchards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but they are chiefly at a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the centre of the town; the middle not being ſo fruitful, and more expoſed to deſtructive froſts. There is a brickyard two miles and an half northeaſt of the meetinghouſe, where are made annually about ſixty thouſands of bricks. The clay is very ſtrong and good. There are two pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh works about three miles eaſt of the meetinghouſe, one of them lately erected. The growth of wood in Holden is mainly cheſnut and oak of all kinds. In former years there was a great quantity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent white pine timber, but the moſt of it has been cut off. There ſtill remains, chiefly in the northerly part of the town, conſiderable yellow pine. There are other kinds of wood in various parts of the town. Some walnut, hemlock, horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam, white maple, aſh, and ſome valuable rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maple.</p>
               <p>At the northweſt part of the town there is a Pond called Quinepoxet, the greater part of which is in Princeton: A narrow fordable ſtrait of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter iſſues from this into a leſſer pond, perhaps fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rods in length; from this there is an outlet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſecond pond; from this ſecond an outlet into a third; and from the third, into a fourth pond. Theſe leſſer ponds are in Holden; and from them proceeds a river called Quinepoxet, which holds an eaſterly courſe, and paſſes out of Holden into Boylſton, where, quite on the weſt ſide of that town, it joins Still River which comes from the foot

There is another pond about two miles and three quarters northeaſt of the centre of the town, called Lily Pond, which has neither inlet nor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. There is a fine ſtream coming from the weſt and ſouthweſt parts of the town, part of which is derived from Aſnebumſkit Pond in Paxton, and croſſing the main road leading to Rutland, one mile and an half weſt of the meetinghouſe, joins Quinepoxet River about that diſtance north of it. On this ſtream are three ſaw mills and two griſt mills. Another ſtream, which has its r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was formerly called Cedar Brook. On this are two ſaw, and two griſt mills. On a branch which enters it, and about two miles ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt of the middle of the town, ſtands another ſaw mill. In the ſouth part of the town riſes a ſtream which holds a ſoutheaſterly courſe, and paſſes into Worceſter, called Turkey Brook. On this there is a ſaw mill, and alſo a griſt mill. There are no extenſive intervals in Holden; but yet, in ſeveral parts of the town, there are farms whoſe value is much enhanced by the meadows and pieces of interval which lie on the river and ſtreams mentioned above.</p>

The church here was imbodied on the 14th of September, 1743: And on the ſame day the Rev. John Rogers was ordained their paſtor. He was a ſenſible, worthy man, and uſed his nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural right to examine, think and believe, for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And what he thought to be the truth as it is in Jeſus, that he preached to his people; always appearing to act uprightly and conſcientiouſly.

                  </gap> council for advice in July 1757, conſiſting of fifteen churches. The council judged the brethren had reaſons for diſſatisfaction, but adviſed them to attend on Mr. Rogers's miniſtry for three months, and if he did not retract his errors, as they called them, in that time, then they adviſed the church to diſmiſs him; which they accordingly did, and ſhut him out of the meetinghouſe. Upon this Mr. Rogers preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch as were diſpoſed to attend on his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in his own houſe. At length Mr. Rogers ſued the town for his ſalary: And after a long conteſt in the law, the diſpute was compromiſed in this manner, viz. Mr. Rogers relinquiſhed all claims upon the town as their miniſter; the town to pay to Mr. Rogers whatever ſums of money his adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents had been obliged to pay towards ſupplying the pulpit after he had been ſhut out of it; and, finally, that all who wiſhed to have Mr. Rogers for their miniſter, ſhould be made a poll pariſh; about a fifth part of the town were accordingly
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:026481_0193_0FD04FF38AAE5448"/>
made a diſtinct, but poll pariſh, by an act of the Legiſlature; after this ſettlement of their unhappy controverſy, the church and town proceeded to the choice of a miniſter, and on the 22d of December, 1762, the Rev. Francis Gardner was ordained their ſecond paſtor; in whoſe miniſterial labours the people have been very happy for more than thirty years already; and during this period they have been peaceable and proſperous. And when the town, a few years ſince, erected a large and elegant new meetinghouſe, Mr. Rogers's adherents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed their full proportion to the building of it. The Rev. Mr. Rogers, having obtained help of God, continued to preach and adminiſter ſpecial ordinances to the people of his pariſh until the year 1788, when, finding his age and bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities ſo great, he wiſhed to be excuſed from the ſacred labours, to which his people conſented, and generouſly paid him three years ſalary in advance: Whereupon, by an act of the Legiſlature, this poll pariſh was diſſolved, and the whole town now form but one church and congregation under the miniſtry of the Rev. Mr. Gardner.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Rogers lived but a little while after he ceaſed from his publick labours. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life October, 1789, in the 47th year of his miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Let it now be obſerved, there was no way to avoid giving this particular detail, and yet mention the two religious ſocieties which for a time ſubſiſted in Leominſter. Our plan, truth, and impartial juſtice, required the mention of them. And
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:026481_0194_0FD0572D094F4D00"/>
nothing derogatory of any one has been ſaid. Nay, the deſign has been to pay tribute due to worthy characters, to Mr. Rogers and Mr. Gardner, and to the people, who once were two parties and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. The majority of the church and town diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed Mr. Rogers, that the truth and purity of the goſpel, as they thought, might continue with them. The friends of Mr. Rogers ſuppoſed him to be a good and faithful miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore adhered to him to the laſt; and treated him with all poſſible reſpect, kindneſs and generoſity, until the Great Head of the church was pleaſed to remove him from this world. And now he is gone to be here no more, we find the two ſocieties cordially receiving and embracing each other, and cheerfully attending upon and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting one and the ſame miniſter, the Rev. Mr. Gardner. The moral character of Mr. Rogers was never impeached. Had he lived in the preſent day, perhaps ſuch a controverſy would never have been heard of. We have ſeen in Mr. Rogers a uniform character, and an honeſt upright man, whoſe integrity, and firm attachment to what he thought were important truths, were ſuperior to the trials he met with, and by which perſons of more eaſy virtue might have been overcome.</p>
               <p>Some Geographical Deſcription of the town of Leominſter ſhall here be preſented to the reader. Leominſter contains about as much as five miles ſquare, and is ſituated in the northeaſtly quarter of the county, and is diſtant about nineteen miles from the courthouſe in Worceſter; and from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:026481_0195_0FD04FF50C323CF8"/>
it is a little to the northweſt at the diſtance of fifty miles. It is bounded on the north and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, by Fitchburg and Lunenburg; on the eaſt, ſoutheaſt and ſouth, by Lancaſter; and on the ſouthweſt and weſt, by Sterling, and a gore of land. This town is pretty plain and level in the middle of it, and for a mile and a half or two miles round the meetinghouſe, and indeed all the way ſouth of the meetinghouſe towards Lancaſter; to the north, towards Fitchburg, it is not quite ſo level; yet the land is pretty good, and the ſoil is clayey: Upon the eaſt, and eſpecially on the weſt, the land becomes hilly and more uneven, and the land is proportionably better. The farms in the middle of the town, are by no means poor; but thoſe in the ſkirts of the town are very excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and the land is equal to that in any town. The land is well adapted to all kinds of grain, and the hilly parts to graſs and paſturage; and the town abounds with famous orchards, and all kinds of fruit, and much cyder is made in the place. The land is not very ſtony and rocky in general, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be ſome particular part of ſome of the hills. Of theſe none are famous or worthy of particular notice, except one in the weſterly part of the town, called Wauhnooſnook Hill; this is about two miles in length, and a mile or more from the meetinghouſe in the neareſt place: It is pretty high and ſteep: And although there is ſome brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and unimproveable land upon it, yet there are many very fine farms thereon.

ſtone, of a grayiſh colour, pretty free, and eaſily ſplit and wrought, and ſome have natural faces, ſixteen, eighteen and twenty feet in length. This ſtore is perhaps inexhauſtible. In the ſouth part of the town there is a very large body of plain land covered with pitch pine; and there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable white pine within the town. But the main growth of wood conſiſts of oak of all kinds, cheſnut in plenty, much walnut, elm, butternut, ſhagbark, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The town is very well watered in every part, by numerous ſprings and rivulets. There are two ſtreams which claim a particular mention: One is Wauhnooſnook Brook, ſo called from the hill of that name, as it originates at the foot of this hill, at the north end, and runs all along on the eaſt ſide of the hill, and on the weſterly ſide of the town, and finally falls into the river Naſhaway. The other is the north branch of the river Naſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which coming in from Fitchburg, at the northweſt angle of the town, runs about a mile eaſt of the meetinghouſe, and at the ſoutheaſt angle of this town paſſes into Lancaſter. There is ſome good interval land on this river, but in many places the banks of it are high and very ſteep. There is but very little meadow land in the town. On this river and the ſtreams there are two griſt mills, five ſaw mills, one oil mill, and clothiers' works very excellent. There are only a part of two ponds fall within the limits of this town, and theſe were mentioned in giving an account of Lunenburg.</p>

                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:026481_0197_0FD04FF733E1BD00"/>It has been mentioned before that the ſoil of this town is clayey. There are indeed vaſt bodies of the beſt of clay in the town: And upwards of two hundred thouſands of bricks are made here in a year. Theſe bricks are ſaid to endure the fire longer than any made in the county. The people of Leominſter live moſtly by the cultivation of the earth; and their farms and buildings proclaim their induſtry, and indicate a good degree of wealth. They have all the mechanicks and tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in common with other places. And beſides, the manufacturing of combs is here eſtabliſhed, in two or three places, and the work is carried on to great perfection and profit. About twenty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons work, more or leſs at this trade; about ten are conſtantly employed therein, and they manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture about ſix thouſand dozen in a year. Mr. Jotham Johnſon, a trader here, employs five men in this work, who make twenty five hundred doz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en per annum. Among theſe, is one who makes ivory combs, equally good perhaps, as any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from any country. Here are ſeveral ſtores and ſhops filled with European, Eaſt, and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>india goods. There is much travel through this town, from the north part of the county of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and of Worceſter, by the way of Weſtminſter, and from Vermont State, and the weſtern part of Newhampſhire, by the way of Fitchburg; theſe roads unite in the northweſterly part of Leomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and come to the meetinghouſe, where they part again; one turns nearly eaſt, leading on through Harvard to Boſton; the other runs ſouth,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:026481_0198_0FD0573009DD44C0"/>
bearing a little to the eaſt into Lancaſter, and ſo on to Boſton. The county road from Leominſter to Worceſter runs ſouthweſterly through Sterling.</p>
               <p>Leominſter is a growing, flouriſhing town; it ſtands about the middle of the towns of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the proportion it pays to a ſtate tax; and when the late cenſus was taken there were 166 dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THIS town was taken from Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field Brimfield and Palmer, and was incorporated on the 16th of January 1741. In this place a congregational church was formed in the year 1743, and on the laſt of January, 1744, the Rev. Iſaac Jones was ordained their firſt paſtor. He died July, 1784, in the 67th year of his age, and 41ſt of his miniſtry. Mr. Jones was ſucceeded in the ſacred office by the Rev. Stephen Baxter, who was ſeparated hereunto March 9th, 1791.</p>

From Brookfield this road enters Weſtern on the northeaſt, about one hundred and twenty rods from the River Quaboag on the ſouth ſide thereof, and runs nearly parallel therewith for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſpace of two miles; then the road to Northampton parts from this, taking a northweſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly direction acroſs the abovenamed river. The left hand, or poſt road, bears a ſouthweſtern courſe to Springfield. The town does not lie in a ſquare and regular form.

The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in general, are farmers; and the lands, though rather rough, produce large crops of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:026481_0200_0FD0573189E9A0D0"/>
corn, rye, and oats; and ſome conſiderable wheat is raiſed in the town: But much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the land is beſt adapted to Engliſh graſs and paſturage. The ſoil is propitious to the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of fruit trees of all kinds; and the height and uneven ſurface of the lands; are a great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the grain and fruit from froſts. Weſtern has its proportion of unimproveable lands; ſome of which are dry and rocky; ſome almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely inacceſſible, by reaſon of vaſt ledges of rocks; yet almoſt all the unimproved and unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable lands are covered with wood and timber. On the high lands grow cheſnut, oak and walnut; and in the lower lands grow aſh, birch, maple, elm, pine, hemlock, &amp;c. &amp;c. Weſtern is ſufficiently watered by ſprings, brooks and rivulets, which run about in the valleys among the hills.</p>
               <p>The river Quaboag, from Brookfield, enters this town on the northeaſt, and paſſing through it about a mile weſt of the centre, goes out at the ſouthweſt angle, and falls into Chicabee. A great number of brooks and rivulets are emptied into Quaboag River in its courſe through Weſtern. Salmon were formerly taken from this river within the town; but now their courſe is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About a mile from the centre of the town, are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this river, two griſt mills, one ſaw mill, one ſcythe mill, one fulling mill, and one forge; and
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:026481_0201_0FD0570D88170F68"/>
the town affords ſome ore for the ſupply of the forge. Beſides the manufactory of iron, there is no other which claims a particular mention, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be that of ſilk. Several gentlemen are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their attention to the cultivation of mulberry trees. Col. Joſeph Jones, from about thirty trees, has for three ſeaſons paſt, fed upon an average a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 30,000 worms; their produce has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three and four pounds of raw ſilk annually. And when manufactured, after making all deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for labour and trouble, has yielded a clear profit yearly, of ſixty dollars, which is an annuity of two dollars per tree. A ſample of the ſewing ſilk, manufactured by Col. Jones, and preſented to the writer, is equal to any imported.</p>
               <p>There have been ſome veſtiges of the aboriginals diſcovered on an extenſive hill in the eaſterly part of this town, which was taken from Brookfield. On ploughing the ground a few years ſince, large beds of clamſhells were diſcovered under the ſoil, which appeared to be placed at equal diſtances from each other; theſe, together with Indian uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils found there, prove this was a place of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort and dwelling.</p>
               <p>This town is very flouriſhing, and is growing in number, and increaſing in wealth. When the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was taken two years ago, there were 124 dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſes, and 900 inhabitants in the place.</p>

               <p>The lands in this place were not ſo pleaſing and inviting as ſome others, and were therefore but ſlowly ſettled.

It lies 47 miles from Boſton, about ſouthweſt; and about ſixteen miles from the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in Worceſter, nearly ſouth. The lands of Douglaſs, in general, are better for the growing of Indian corn, rye, oats and flax, than natural to graſs. They are exceedingly adapted to the growth of apple trees, and all the other kinds of fruit trees common in this part of the country. The natural growth of wood in the town is, in the ſwamps and low lands, cedar, ſpruce, &amp;c. in ſome; in others, hemlock, white pine, aſh, birch, beech, hornbeam, and maple: On the uplands, walnut, gray, white and yellow oak, cheſnut, and cheſnut oak, (its leaves like the cheſnut, and bark like the oak) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, pine, elm, locuſts, balm of Gilead, ſo called, &amp;c. &amp;c. and almoſt every kind of tree, ſhrub, and buſh, which is to be found in any of theſe northern States.

Manchaug Pond, in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſterly part of the town, is about one mile long, and one quarter of a mile wide in Douglaſs, the remainder of it lies in Sutton.

Mumford River riſes in rocky woods, increaſing by ſtreams from the ponds and from ſprings, and runs eaſt into Uxbridge. There is a ſpring in rocky woods, a little ſouthweſt from Badluck Pond, which iſſues out of an apparently dry hill, and forms a ſtream, which runs ſoutheaſt, never dry, and never known to freeze. This paſſes one rod and an half ſouth of the great road, and is greatly admired for its pleaſantneſs and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature. The ſoldiers in the late war, called it the White Oak Tavern. There is conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval land on Mumford River; there are four hundred acres in one body, near the head of it; further down there are divers other pieces, ſome of them large: Alſo, on this ſame river, there are works for making refined iron, near to Uxbridge line, and a corn and ſaw mill, very profitable. There are four hills in the town, large and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeable. The firſt we ſhall mention is a little north of the meetinghouſe, large and conſiderable; originally well clothed with timber, but now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords good tillage, mowing, and paſture land. On the weſt ſide of this hill, at the bottom near a ſwamp, the Indians, in old time, had their Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams and a ſort, the remains of which are yet viſible, and their tools are ſtill found in the fields. About forty rods north of this hill, lies another hill, larger, but not cleared. Wallump Pond hill, near the pond of that name, in the ſouthweſt part of the town, is large but not very

The congregational church here was gathered November 11th, 1747, and on the 16th of December, the ſame year, the Rev. William Phipps was ordained their firſt paſtor.

This tract of land, together with a part of Brookfield, and a part of Hardwick, was incorporated January 31ſt, 1751, and the name

Newbraintree was given to it. The people who firſt ſettled this territory took early care for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the goſpel, and the enjoyment of all the inſtituted means of religion; they accordingly erected a houſe for the publick worſhip of God, and on the 18th of April, 1754, the church of Chriſt in this place was imbodied, and the Rev.

There is but one religious ſociety in the town, nor any ſectaries excepting only two families of anabaptiſts.

               <p>We ſhall now preſent a Geographical Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Newbraintree.</p>
               <p>This town contains about 13000 acres of land, and is bounded ſouth, on Brookfield; weſt, by Ware River, which ſeparates it from Hardwick; north, on the town of Barre; and eaſt, on the towns of Oakham and Spencer: It lays much in a triangular form.</p>
               <p>The town is neither remarkably hilly nor level; but agreeably interſperſed with moderate hills and valleys. There are two hills of name and note; one on the weſterly ſide of the town, and is ſteep, with large ledges of rocks on the eaſt ſide of it, called <hi>Rattle Snakes' Rocks,</hi> from the great number of thoſe venomous ſerpents, which, in the infancy of the town, inhabited them; but their race is now almoſt extinct. The other is ſituated in the ſoutheaſterly part of the town, and is called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk Hill.</hi> On the weſterly ſide of the town, is what is commonly called a plain, though not very level; its natural growth of wood is pitch pine; and it is excellent for grain, and good roads. The ſoil of the town is in general rocky, moiſt, loamy and warm, and genial to wheat, rye, barley, oats, Indian corn, peas, flax, hemp, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is moſt excellent for orcharding; and, for its bigneſs, rather exceeds, perhaps, any other town in the county in fine grazing lands, as is evinced by the
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:026481_0209_0FD057138D9D8CC8"/>
annual produce of the dairy and of beef. Before the ſettlement of this place, the fires made in the woods, had deſtroyed almoſt the whole growth of timber; and it was feared there would be a ſcarcity; but by the care and prudence of the inhabitants there have, within a few years, ſprung up fine groves of wood, and now there is a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The common timber upon the upland, or hilly parts, is oak, walnut and cheſnut; in the low lands, ſwamps and marſhes, there is maple, aſh, birch, hornbeam and ſome ſpruce and hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Newbraintree is very finely watered by rivers, brooks, rivulets and ſprings. Ware River runs along on the weſt ſide of the town, and is the boundary between Hardwick and this place. On the weſterly ſide of the town there is alſo a large brook, called Meminimiſſet Brook, which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On this brook there is an extenſive and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant meadow of ſeveral hundreds of acres, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meminimiſſet, the name given to it by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians when a hideous ſwamp: This was the head quarters, and the chief place of rendezvous of the ſavages, at the time when Brookfield was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and near which place eight brave men were killed, and three mortally wounded by the Indians, Auguſt 2d, 1675, as has been more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly related in the account of Brookfield: And hither Mrs. Rowlandſon was carried captive, who was taken by the enemy at Lancaſter, Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary

               <p>This meadow beforementioned produces exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great crops of moſt excellent hay. At the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly part of the town lie two very conſiderable tracts of meadow land, through which run two brooks which ariſe from ſprings; theſe brooks, one of which carries a corn mill, after paſſing ſaid meadows, and running near the ſouth line of the town, unite, and then carry a ſaw mill: This ſtream then runs into the north part of Brookfield, and after ſeveral windings and meanderings, and carrying two more mills, it again viſits the ſouth part of this town, and runs through another large tract of excellent meadow, called Ditch Meadow, and carrying another corn mill in Newbraintree, it leaves the town, and falls into a large pond in the weſt pariſh in Brookfield, called Wickoboaug Pond. The air of this town is accounted good and ſalubrious, and the people proſper, flouriſh and increaſe. Excepting a few of the uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks, and one or two traders in foreign goods, the people are farmers, and have the reputation of being good huſbandmen, frugal and induſtrious, and they live much independent. According to the late enumeration the number of ſouls amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 940; and their houſes are in general neat and commodious. This town is ſixty ſix miles from Boſton, a little to the ſouth of weſt; and it is nineteen miles from the courthouſe in Worceſter, a very little to the north of weſt.

               <p>THE whole of this town was included in the original grant of Leiceſter.

In this place a church was gathered May 17th, 1744; and over the flock of God in this place the Rev.

Mr. Eaton firſt turned his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the law, and was, for ſeveral years, an able and ſkilful attorney in the county of Worceſter, but choſe at length to forſake that gainful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, for the more high and honourable one of ſerving God in the goſpel of his Son.

               <p>Spencer is ſaid to be eight miles in length, and four miles in breadth, on a ſtraight line. The town is conſiderably uneven, abounding in hills and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, although there are no hills very high or large, or called by any particular names. It is an exceeding fertile townſhip, and the inhabitants are induſtrious, proſperous and wealthy. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more numerous and opulent than the town from whence it was taken, as it is larger in lands, becauſe ſeveral years after the incorporation of Spencer, the northweſterly part of Leiceſter was with the ſoutherly part of Rutland, ſet off to form the town of Paxton.</p>
               <p>This town is watered by many excellent peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſtreams which run through the ſeveral parts of it, ſome of which are ſufficient to carry mills, but none of them are large. There are three in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly part; one proceeds from a large and fine pond, which lays partly in Spencer and partly in Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, called Browning's Pond: Its courſe, for ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al miles, is ſoutherly. Another to the eaſtward of it, has its ſource in Rutland, and runs for ſome miles in the ſame direction with the former. A third iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues from a pond in the north part of Leiceſter; and running a weſterly courſe for a conſiderable ſpace, then unites with the ſecond; after this junction, turning ſouthweſt, they fall in with the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſtream.

ſtill being ſouthweſterly, they are emptied into Podunk Pond, ſo called, in Brookfield; whence iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues a river which runs into Chicabee River, which falls into Connecticut river, in the north part of Springfield. There are alſo in the ſouth part of this town, two ſtreams, one of which uniting with the ſtreams mentioned above, falls into Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut river; the other running ſoutherly, falls in with French River, which is emptied into the ſea at Newlondon, in the ſoutheaſt angle of the State of Connecticut. All theſe ſtreams have one or more mills ſtanding on them. There are likewiſe in Spencer, two clothiers' works, where much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is performed to great publick advantage; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, there are two potaſh and pearlaſh works.</p>
               <p>The growth of wood in the town is of the uſual various ſorts. On the high lands, oak, walnut and cheſnut are the chief. The ſwamps are cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered generally with maple, birch and elm. In the infancy of the town, there was a large quantity of excellent pine timber, but this is mainly worked up.</p>
               <p>The number of the people in Spencer, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the late cenſus, was computed at 1322, and the number of houſes was 192.</p>

               <p>THIS was an original grant made by the General Court, in the cloſe of the year 1732, or beginning of 1733, to John Bennett, Jeremiah Perley, and others, as a compenſation for ſervices performed by them in the Indian wars, under a Capt. John White of Lancaſter. The firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the grantees was held on the 10th of May, 1733. Some time after the grant was made, to quiet the Indians who claimed the ſoil, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors made them a ſatisfactory conſideration therefor. It is rather more than ſix miles ſquare. It had been a ſeat for Indians, and was called ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years by its Indian name, which was <hi>Nichewaug;</hi> and in the ſouth part of the town lies <hi>Nichewaug Hill,</hi> ſo called by the natives, whereon, as in ſome other parts of the town, they had formerly plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fields of Indian corn, of which there remained evident traces when the firſt Engliſh ſettlers began there.</p>
               <p>The original proprietors being ſome of them wealthy and enterprizing, they encouraged and drove on the ſettlement of this then infant planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although there were no ſettled towns nearer than Lancaſter on the eaſt, and Rutland to the ſoutheaſt, and Brookfield to the ſouth, except a few new ſettlers in Lambſtown, now Hardwick. But the land being excellent, divers perſons ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to work upon lots; the proprietors built a
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:026481_0215_0FD0571807C7F180"/>
meetinghouſe, and ſo early as the year 1738, they contracted with and ſettled a miniſter for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and who was ſupported by them until its incorporation. Although the proſpects from the ſoil were very promiſing, and ſettlers moved in faſt, yet they laboured under many and exceeding great diſadvantages, being then ſo remote from any white people, from whom they could procure the neceſſaries of life, or derive any aid and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. While in its infancy, and ſtruggling for life, ſo early as 1744, a French war broke out, and the Indians, being always in the intereſt of the French, they became hoſtile, and began to commit depredations in various parts of the land, which occaſioned the few inhabitants great fear, terror and danger, obliging them to build forts in different parts of the town, round certain houſes, into each of which a number of families moved for ſafety and defence, and ſoldiers were ſtationed there as a guard to the inhabitants, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitre the country. The people uſed to labour on their lands, in ſmall parties, changing works with one another, having their guns by them, and theſe alſo they were, for a long time, obliged to carry with them whenever they went to the houſe of God for religious worſhip, and alſo to place centinels at the doors. But although they were often alarmed, yet no white perſon was ever known to be killed in the place, When peace was ſettled between England and France, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and fear from the Indians ceaſed, the ſettlement of the plantation went on very rapidly, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:026481_0216_0FD0573D87616F50"/>
were become ſo numerous and able, as that the place was incorporated with all town privileges April 20th, 1754, and received the name of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſham. The church of Chriſt in this place was gathered, and their firſt miniſter, the Rev. Aaron Whitney, was ordained December, 1738, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until September 8th, 1779, when he died in the 66th year of his age, and the 41ſt of his miniſtry. The year following, October 25th, 1780, the Rev. Solomon Reed was ſolemnly ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated unto that office and work, and who ſtill continues therein. Here alſo is a ſociety of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, who have for their teacher Mr. John Sellon.</p>
               <p>The town of Peterſham has been one of the moſt proſperous and flouriſhing in the county, if not in the Commonwealth. Although the grant of the townſhip was ſubſequent to the formation of the county, yet it has ſo flouriſhed and increaſed that it is become one of the foremoſt towns in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for wealth and number. There are but ſeven towns who pay more to a State tax; it contains about 1520 ſouls, according to the late cenſus. The natural ſituation of the town is exceedingly beautiful; it is very high, but not hilly and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: The body of the town lies upon the higheſt land in it, which is a large long flat hill, upon the higheſt part of which the great road runs from the ſouth to the north, eight rods wide, and ſet with trees on both ſides, and for three or four miles in length affords a moſt commanding proſpect, not only of the whole town, but of all the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent towns; the houſes are large and well finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

ſtanding on either ſide of the ſtreet, from whence the land falls each way eaſt and weſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a mile and an half to a ſtream, and then riſes again, eſpecially to the eaſt, where it is fully ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled; is in clear view on the main ſtreet, and appears like another town. Here they have lately erected a large and elegant meetinghouſe, ſtanding on a moſt conſpicuous ſituation, ſo as to be ſeen from divers of the contiguous towns; ſoon after it was built, Mr. Eleazar Bradſhaw, now of Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, made them a preſent of a large bell, the weight whereof is 913<abbr>lb</abbr>, and the coſt thereof was 96<hi>l.</hi> 6<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> So noble and publick ſpirited a deed, ought to be perpetuated for the honour of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and to ſtimulate others to like generous acts.</p>
               <p>This town is thought by ſome to be the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anteſt, for an inland town, of any in the State, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording to the eye, a general, extenſive, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably variegated proſpect.</p>
               <p>The land in this place is exceedingly favourable to the growth of all kinds of fruit trees, being high and warm; and here are large and excellent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, and much cyder is made here, beyond what the inhabitants conſume; but they find a ready market for the ſurplus in the newer ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Having mentioned their fine orchards, I would duly notice one very remarkable natural curioſity relative to this ſubject. There is now growing in an orchard, lately belonging to my honoured father, the Rev. Aaron Whitney, deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, an appletree, very ſingular with reſpect to its fruit. The apples are fair and when fully ripe
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:026481_0218_0FD0573F090DEAB8"/>
of a yellow colour, but evidently of different taſtes, ſour and ſweet. The part which is ſour is not very tart, nor the other very ſweet. Two apples, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſide by ſide, on the ſame limb, will be of theſe different taſtes, the one all ſour, and the other all ſweet: And which is more remarkable, the ſame apple will be ſour on one ſide, end, or part, and the other ſweet; and that not in any order or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; nor is there any difference in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the one part from the other. And as to the quantity, ſome have more of the acid, and leſs of the ſweet, and ſo <hi>vice verſa.</hi> Neither are the apples ſo different in their taſtes, peculiar to any particular branches, but are found promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly on any and every branch of the tree.

It was a number of years after it had borne fruit, before theſe different taſtes were noticed; but ſince they were firſt diſcovered, which is upwards of thirty years, there has been conſtantly the ſame variety obſerved in the taſte of the fruit of this tree. For the truth of the above account, an appeal may be made to many perſons of diſtinction, and of nice taſtes, who have trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled a great diſtance to view the tree and taſte the fruit; but to inveſtigate the cauſe of an effect ſo much out of the common courſe of nature, muſt, I think, be attended with difficulty. The only ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution I can conceive is, that the corcula, or hearts

of two ſeeds, the one from a ſour, and the other from a ſweet apple, might ſo incorporate in the ground, as to produce but one plant, or that farina from bloſſoms of thoſe oppoſite qualities, might paſs into, and impregnate the ſame ſeed. But leaving this to the diſcuſſion of naturaliſts, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with our deſcription of Peterſham.</p>
               <p>The ſoil is rich and fertile, and the lands bear all kinds of grain, but moſt natural to graſs and paſturage, and from the appearance and face of the town, we muſt judge the inhabitants to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and wealthy, who ſubſiſt mainly by the cultivation of the earth. Though the town lies very high, yet the land is not dry, but ſtony and moiſt, abounding with ſprings and brooks of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; there are, however, but two noticeable ſtreams: Swift River, which riſes from ſprings in Gerry, runs to the ſouthweſt, through the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly and ſoutherly part of Peterſham, into the northweſt part of Hardwick.</p>
               <p>Weſt Brook, a conſiderable ſtream, riſes in the northweſterly part of the town, and runs through all the weſt ſide of it, and then enters Greenwich, in the county of Hampſhire. On each of theſe there are both corn and ſaw mills, and clothiers' works; and by the ſides of both there are conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable bodies of good meadow land. Here are works for making pot and pearl aſh, where much buſineſs is profitably carried on, and many perſons employed. On the high lands the growth of wood is oak, more cheſnut, and a great deal of walnut of later years. In the ſwamps and low
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:026481_0220_0FD05740C4105820"/>
lands, there is birch, beech, maple, aſh, elm, and hemlock.</p>
               <p>This town is ſituated ſixty ſix miles from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, nearly weſt, and about twenty eight miles from the courthouſe in Worceſter to the northweſt, and is bounded on the north, by Athol; on the eaſt, by Gerry and Barre; on the ſouth, by Barre and Hardwick; and on the weſt, by Greenwich and Newſalem, in the county of Hampſhire.</p>

               <p>We proceed to a Topographical Deſcription of Charlton.</p>
               <p>This town was not in high repute at firſt, and was thought by ſome to be hardly worth ſettling upon: As it was very rough in its natural ſtate, and hard to ſubdue. But ſuch land is almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found to be ſtrong and to wear well. This being the caſe with Charlton, from ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and an inconſiderable figure, it has riſen up, in the ſpace of thirty or forty years, to renown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the towns of the county. It is computed to be nearly ſeven miles ſquare, being much larger in extent than Oxford from whence it was taken, and in general a better tract of land. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are become very numerous, there being 1965 ſouls in the place when the cenſus was taken in the year 1791, which is more by ſeveral hundreds than any town in the county, except Brookfield, Sutton and Worceſter, and it is become exceedingly
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:026481_0222_0FD05742079E8FC0"/>
wealthy, as in the laſt State tax there were but ſix towns which paid more. There are 300 dwelling houſes in the town. The people ſubſiſt chiefly by the cultivation of the earth; and they have great encouragement to labour, for the ſoil is ſtrong and rich, and the lands are fertile and very productive: Here they raiſe grain of all kinds in plenty; beef and pork are fatted; butter and cheeſe are made in quantities equal to, if not ſurpaſſing any other town in the county. The lands are well and nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally adapted to orcharding and fruit of all kinds. The hills are moiſt and ſpringy; the hills and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys are well proportioned and agreeably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed. The town is well watered by ſprings, brooks and rivulets, none of which claim particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mention: But there is one large river in the weſtern part of the town, near to Sturbridge, which runs from the north to the ſouth, and is called Quinebaug. This river is almoſt an inconceivable advantage, not to Charlton only, but to many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent towns, by ſupplying great plenty of water for all the mills and water works in the drieſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. On this river, within the limits of Charlton, there are ſome rich interval, and good meadow lands.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral hills in this town worthy of particular mention; one by the name of Ponnakin. Another called <hi>Maſhymuggett</hi>; this is high, for on its ſummit buildings in about twelve adjacent towns may be diſcerned. This hill is ſituated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three quarters of a mile from the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional meetinghouſe. There is a third, known by

the name of <hi>Blood's Hill.</hi> The fourth and laſt we ſhall mention, is called Craige's Hill.</p>
               <p>There are no ponds in the town worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, nor mines or minerals as yet diſcovered.</p>
               <p>The wood and timber which grow in Charlton is white, black, and red oak, and walnut and cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut in great plenty; ſome white pine, and ſome pitch pine: In the low lands there is aſh, birch, maple, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In Charlton there are a few dealers in Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and India goods, as is uſual in country towns; and they have alſo all the common tradeſmen and mechanicks. But there are two tanners in the town to be noticed, who carry on their buſineſs to a very conſiderable degree, and in the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous manner, viz. Capt. Iſrael Waters, and Mr. Aſa Corben; and eſpecially the former, in the northerly part, who carries on his work to great perfection. He has an excellent bark mill, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by water, and upon a new conſtruction, whereby he grinds all his bark. On the ſame ſtream, a little below, there is a gin ſtill, a brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, malt houſe and corn mill, under the ſame roof, the property of Mr. Eli Wheelock, who erected ſaid works in the year 1792, and where he carries on each branch of buſineſs very largely to his own and the publick intereſt. On the ſame ſtream there are ſeveral griſt and ſaw mills, and other water works, and moſt of the mechanicks live in this north part of the town. There are alſo a number of pot and pearl aſh works in different parts of the town, where large quantities of pot and

                  <pb n="226" facs="unknown:026481_0225_0FD0571F8E8B09A8"/>The firſt meeting of the proprietors of this grant (who conſiſted chiefly of the inhabitants of Cambridge, Charleſtown, Watertown, Weſton, Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Newton, Medford, Malden and Reading) was held December 3d, 1733, when all officers were choſen neceſſary to manage the affairs of the proprietors. The firſt committee of the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Narraganſet No. 2, were John Cutting, James Lowden, and Joſeph Bowman. From this time, to the year 1737, little was done to forward the ſettlement of the place. In March this year, Capt. Fairbanks Moor moved his family into it. He was the firſt planter. In June, Deacon Joſeph Holden moved his family into the place. Theſe two families contained fifteen ſouls. It being an expoſed plantation, ſettlers moved in but ſlowly. In the year 1739, the proprietors erected a decent meetinghouſe, which was dedicated at a proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors' meeting, June 6, 1739. The few ſettlers were deſirous of, and forward for ſettling a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter; accordingly, on the 4th of Auguſt, 1742, they made choice of Mr. Eliſha Marſh, in which
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:026481_0226_0FD0574507674380"/>
the proprietors concurred. The church of Chriſt in this place was formed, and the Rev. Eliſha Marſh was ordained their firſt miniſter October 20th, 1742. Mr. Marſh continued with them but a few years. An unhappy controverſy ariſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the people, he was diſmiſſed from his paſtoral office, 1757. Mr. Marſh was afterwards Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Cheſhire, in the State of Newhampſhire; and died but a few years ſince, at Lancaſter, being on a journey.</p>
               <p>The town remained in a broken ſtate until Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober 16th, 1765, when the Rev. Aſaph Rice was conſecrated paſtor, the ſecond in ſucceſſion, of the church and congregation here, and ſtill continues in that office; and in peace and love with his people.</p>
               <p>Previouſly to his ſettlement in Weſtminſter, Mr. Rice had been a miſſionary among the Indians.</p>
               <p>At the time of Mr. Marſh's ordination, the place was in its infancy, few in number, ſtruggling for life, and expoſed to Indian depredations, and its population went on ſlowly. About the year 1743, the General Court granted 400<hi>l.</hi> to fortify the place, with which ten forts were erected, and ſoldiers ſtationed there for the defence of the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants. In 1746, ſome of the people of the place were put under pay, as a town ſcout. From 1744, to the cloſe of the year 1748, the ſettlers met with great diſcouragements, and endured ſevere trials, although no perſon in the place was ever cut off by the enemy.</p>

                  <pb n="228" facs="unknown:026481_0227_0FD05721078B6198"/>After that period, the people increaſed, and the place flouriſhed exceedingly, ſo that in the ſpace of half a century, notwithſtanding their dangers, diſtreſſes and difficulties, and the ſmallneſs of their firſt number, only fifteeen ſouls, they have ſpread and extended their branches, and covered the town, and are become a great people, as at this day; having, when the cenſus was taken in 1791, 177 dwelling houſes, and 1176 inhabitants. The original grant was ſix miles ſquare; however, the meaſure was rather large, for by actual ſurvey, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding ponds, rivers, &amp;c. it contained 27000 acres; but of late, 7000 acres of land, with the inhabitants thereof, were ſet off to aid in forming the town of Gardner, to the northweſt. This town is ſtill large, and is bounded on the weſt and the northweſt by Gardner, on the north by Aſhburnham; on the northeaſt by Fitchburg; on the eaſt, by ſome farms not belonging to any town; on the ſouth by Princeton; and on the ſouthweſt, by Hubbardſton.</p>
               <p>Weſtminſter is ſituated on the height of land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the rivers Merrimack and Connecticut, having ſtreams ariſing in the town, and running into both. The town is interſperſed with hills and valleys; and with ſprings, brooks and rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, very convenient for watering the land, and for carrying of mills. The northweſterly part of Watchuſett hill falls within the limits of this town. And what is called the middle of the place, or centre of the town, is a large and high hill, the top of which is nearly level; this is a ſquare of

ſix acres, left by the proprietors, as a convenient place for a training field, and for the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. A little north of the centre of this ſquare ſtands their new, large and elegant meetinghouſe, directly in front of which paſſes the great road from Connecticut River to Boſton. At the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt angle of this ſquare ſtands an elegant houſe belonging to the Hon. Judge Gill; on the weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſide of the ſquare ſtands the miniſter's houſe. On the ſides of this ſquare are ſhops well ſtored with Engliſh and Weſtindia goods. In the town they have all the uſual tradeſmen and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks. Here alſo are three griſt mills, three ſaw mills, one oil mill, one fulling mill, one clothiers' works, and one trip hammer; alſo works for cutting nails, and works for the manufacture of iron are now erecting. The ſoil of this town is ſtrong, rich and fertile; the high lands are well ſtored with ſtones, ſuitable and ſufficient for wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the farms, and are good for orcharding, and almoſt all kinds of fruit.

A ſtream iſſues from the northweſterly end of this pond, and runs norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the eaſterly part of Weſtminſter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſeveral ſtreams in its courſe; and leaving the town it runs in a northeaſterly direction into Fitchburgh, forming a conſiderable branch of the Naſhaway, or Lancaſter River. Another very ſmall ſtream runs at the northeaſt corner of the pond, and running ſoutheaſterly falls into a ſtream, riſing out of a large body of meadow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing its courſe, empties into Stillwater River in Sterling. There is a ſtream ariſing in another body of meadow land, which falls into this pond, on its ſouthweſterly ſide. This pond is fed and ſupplied chiefly, perhaps wholly, by ſprings and rivulets iſſuing from the great hill <hi>Watchuſett.</hi> There is another large pond, near the centre of the town, in front of the hill, on which the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe ſtands; this is called Long Pond, being one mile and twelve rods in length, and about half as much in width. This being a very rocky pond, is not well furniſhed with fiſh. No conſtant ſtream empties into this pond: A ſmall ſtream iſſues from the ſoutheaſterly corner of it, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eaſterly, unites with the ſtream which runs out of Watchuſett Pond.

Pond. The fourth pond is in the northern border of the town: No ſtream of any conſequence runs into it; a ſmall one iſſues from it, and running ſouth, falls into a large ſtream, which riſes in Weſtminſter, and running eaſterly, is known by the name of North River; and continuing an eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern direction, unites with the ſtream which comes from Watchuſett Pond. There is another ſtream, called the Moſt Northerly River, which riſes in Aſhburnham, and running through the northerly part of Weſtminſter, receives various brooks and rivulets in Weſtminſter, and helps to form the northerly branch of the river Naſhaway. The laſt ſtream which deſerves our notice, is called Otter River, which iſſuing from a ſwamp or low land in Hubbardſton, runs northerly, through the weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part of Weſtminſter, into Gardner, receiving ſeveral ſtreams in its way, then turning, runs weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly through the north part of Templeton, Athol, Warwick, and the ſoutherly part of Northfield, and falls into Connecticut River. This ſtream unites with Miller's River in Winchendon, as may be ſeen more particularly in the deſcription of Templeton.</p>
               <p>Weſtminſter is large, and become populous, and is continually increaſing in number and wealth. It is ſituated about fifty five miles from Boſton, a little to the north of weſt, and about twenty two miles from the courthouſe in Worceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nearly north.</p>

               <p>ON the 20th of October, 1759, the General Court of Maſſachuſetts paſſed an act for incorporating the eaſt wing, ſo called, of Rutland, together with ſundry farms, and ſome publick lands, contiguous thereto; and gave the place the name of Princeton, to perpetuate the name and memory of the late Rev. Thomas Prince, colleague paſtor of the old ſouth church in Boſton, and a large proprietor of this tract of land, whoſe daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and only ſurviving child the Hon. Judge Gill married for his firſt wife.</p>
               <p>The town contained about 19000 acres: And at the time of its incorporation there were about twenty families in the place. It was in the month of May, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon the 14th of April, 1755, a child of his, named Lucy, aged four years and eight months, attempting, as was ſuppoſed, to follow her ſiſters, who had gone to Watchuſett Pond, about a mile diſtant, and having nothing but marked trees to guide her, wandered out of her way in the woods, and was never heard of afterwards. The people for nearly thirty miles round collected immediately, and in companies traverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the woods, day after day and week after week, ſearching for her, but never made the leaſt diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. Many journeys were taken by the father, in conſequence of reports, but all in vain. Various were, and have been the conjectures of people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the fate of this child. Divers concurring circumſtances render the following moſt probable, that ſhe was taken by the Indians, and carried into their country, and ſoon forgat her relations, loſt her native language, and became as one of the aborigines.</p>
               <p>Let us return to Princeton. The people who had ſettled in this town laboured at firſt under very great difficulties, by reaſon of the mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, rocky, and naturally moiſt ſtate of their lands, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rom want of paſſable roads, and by reaſon of the prodigious quantities of heavy timber with which the ground was covered, (ſure indications of a rich and fertile ſoil,) however, they attended to their roads, and increaſed in number, and on the 30th of June, 1762, raiſed the frame of their preſent meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, hired preaching, and were attentive to their religious intereſts.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of Auguſt, 1764, the church of Chriſt was imbodied in this town, and after vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fruitleſs attempts to ſettle a miniſter, the Rev. Timothy Fuller was ordained their firſt paſtor on the 9th of September, 1767. In about eight years a general diſaffection to Mr. Fuller took place, which ended in a diſſolution of the paſtoral rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between him and the people of Princeton on the 19th of April, 1776. Various attempts for a reſettlement of the goſpel miniſtry were unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:026481_0233_0FD05725879DB8E8"/>
until the 28th of June, 1786, when the Rev. Thomas Crafts was ordained paſtor of the church and flock of God in this place. In the ſpace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three years, Mr. Crafts's health failed, and for nearly two years he was unable to preach, when all hope of his being recovered, ſo as to carry on the work of the ſacred miniſtry being cut off, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral relation between him and his people was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icably diſſolved at his ſpecial requeſt, on the 14th of March, 1791. The people remain without a ſettled miniſter.</p>
               <p>In Princeton they have a very handſome ſocial library eſtabliſhed, of the value of upwards of 70<hi>l.</hi> ten pounds whereof were given by the Hon. Judge Gill.</p>
               <p>In a little more than thirty years from its incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, Princeton is become very conſiderable among the towns of the county. It has ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly increaſed in number and wealth. When the cenſus was taken in 1791, there were 144 dwelling houſes, and 1016 inhabitants in the place. The ſoil being excellent, people had ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery encouragement from that conſideration, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and cultivate the lands; and their farms are moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly large and good. The land is naturally moiſt and ſpringy, hilly and rocky, exceedingly well adapted to paſturage, and the growth of Engliſh graſs: Hence the fineſt of beef is fatted here, and vaſt quantities of butter and cheeſe are produced in the town: Some parts of the place afford grain in plenty; and from the appearance of their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and farms, we muſt judge the people are very
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:026481_0234_0FD0574B0789D710"/>
induſtrious. Many of their houſes are large and elegant.</p>
               <p>This leads to a particular mention, that in this town is the country ſeat of the Hon. Moſes Gill, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who has been from the year 1775 one of the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas for the county of Worceſter, and for ſeveral years a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of this Commonwealth. His noble and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſeat is about one mile and a quarter from the meetinghouſe, to the ſouth. The farm contains upwards of 3000 acres. The county road from Princeton to Worceſter paſſes through it, in front of the houſe, which faces to the weſt. The build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſtand upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The lands on which theſe buildings ſtand, are elevated between 1200 and 1300 feet above the level of the ſea, as the Hon. James Winthrop, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> informs me. The manſion houſe is large, being fifty by fifty feet, with four ſtacks of chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: The farm houſe is forty feet by thirty ſix: In a line with this ſtand the coach and chaiſe houſe fifty feet by thirty ſix: This is joined to the barn by a ſhed ſeventy feet in length—the barn is two hundred feet by thirty two. Very elegant fences are erected around the manſion houſe, the outhouſes, and the garden.</p>
               <p>The proſpect from this ſeat is extenſive and grand, taking in an horizon to the eaſt, of ſeventy miles at leaſt. The blue hills in Milton, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable with the naked eye, from the windows of

When we view this ſeat, theſe buildings, and this farm of ſo many hundred acres, now under a high degree of profitable cultivation, and are told that in the year 1766 it was a perfect wilderneſs, we are ſtruck with wonder, admiration and aſtoniſhment.

Upon the whole, this ſeat of Judge Gill, all the agreeable circumſtances reſpecting it being attentively conſidered, is not paralleled by any in the Newengland States; perhaps not by any on this ſide the Delaware.</p>
               <p>Return we to our more general deſcription of Princeton. Having ſaid the ſoil is rich, ſtrong, and very productive; it is to be added, the

growth of wood is oak of the various kinds, cheſnut, white aſh, beech, black birch, and maple; and near the Watchuſett hills, ſome butternut is to be ſeen, as alſo ſome walnut, which will undoubtedly increaſe and ſpread.</p>
               <p>The hills of Princeton merit a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; they are three. Firſt, <hi>Pine Hill,</hi> ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated about two miles from the centre of the town, contains perhaps about thirty acres, and is moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unimproveable; but its bowels afford a very great quantity of moſt excellent ſtones for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, is Little Watchuſett Hill, this is ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated near the centre of the town, perhaps half a mile diſtant, to the northward. This contains 237 acres, chiefly paſturing; though ſome parts of it, being ledgy and mountainous, are unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable.</p>
               <p>The third, is the Great Watchuſett Hill, or Mountain. This is ſituated about two miles from Princeton meetinghouſe, to the north; the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſterly part hereof falls within the limits of Weſtminſter. This is an exceedingly high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and is ſome of the firſt land diſcovered by people on board veſſels at ſea, when making for any of the ſea ports in Maſſachuſetts; and it is to be ſeen from the higher lands, in a greater part of the towns in the Commonwealth, eſpecially in thoſe between the ſea and Connecticut river.

               <p>This town is exceedingly well watered by ſprings and rivulets, as is generally the caſe with hilly, rocky land; but there are no ſtreams of any great bigneſs, although ſeveral large and fine rivers have their ſources here. One branch of the Naſhaway begins at the foot of Watchuſett Hill, and runs through Sterling and Boylſton to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter. Piſs River, ſo called, ſprings up at the foot of this mountain, on the weſterly ſide, and runs through Hubbardſton, and joins Ware River. There are ſeveral places in the town where ſprings iſſue and the waters divide, running ſome into Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimack, ſome into Connecticut river. There is but little meadow land in Princeton, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with towns in general, but there are conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable tracts of interval which afford good hay; however, the greateſt part of their hay is produced from upland mowing. There are two ponds on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this town, or rather a part of two: Watchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett Pond, about three miles north from the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe, at the north end of that mountain; it covers about one hundred acres, only about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which are in Princeton, the greater part in Weſtminſter. It is fed by ſprings from the hill; its outlet is in Weſtminſter. Quinepoxet Pond is ſituated in the ſouthweſt part of the town, ſome of which falls within the limits of Holden.

               <p>The church of Chriſt in Athol was imbodied in the preſence, and under the countenance of three neighbouring paſtors and churches, Auguſt 29th. 1750; and the Rev. James Humphrey was

conſecrated their firſt paſtor on the 7th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember following. The Rev. Mr. Humphrey, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerving the church and people of this place faithfully upwards of thirty one years, was, at his requeſt, diſmiſſed from his paſtoral relation to them on the 13th of February, 1782, on theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, viz. The inhabitants voted to free his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and eſtate from all kinds of taxes during his natural life; and gave to him and his heirs a good pew in the preſent meetinghouſe, ſo long as it ſhould ſtand.</p>
               <p>The town remained deſtitute of a ſettled paſtor until November 21ſt, 1787, when the Rev. Joſeph Eſtabrook, was ſolemnly ſeparated unto the work of the goſpel miniſtry, as ſucceſſor to the Rev. Mr. Humphrey.</p>
               <p>There are about ten families of anabaptiſts in this town, but there is no church, nor any ſtated teacher of this denomination in the place: There are alſo three families of univerſaliſts, and one of epiſcopalians here.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now go on to ſome Geographical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Athol. This townſhip was originally granted to ſixty proprietors, with a reſerve of a right of land for the firſt ſettled miniſter, a right for the uſe of the miniſtry, and one for a ſchool: It was to contain as much as ſix miles ſquare. A part of the town was ſet off, at the ſoutheaſt angle, to aid in forming the town of Gerry, and a part at the northweſt corner, to help form the diſtrict of Orange; but ſtill the town of Athol is more than five miles ſquare, and contains 16000 acres of land.
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:026481_0245_0FD057540978D1E8"/>
It is very uneven, rocky, and hilly, though there are no famous or remarkable hills in the place; nor any with names, except one in the eaſt part of the town, called <hi>Walnut Hill,</hi> from the conſiderable quantity of walnut wood and timber growing thereon. The ſoil of this town is not ſo good as ſome: It is rather cold, conſequently not extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for grain of any kind, for orcharding, or for mowing: It is ſaid to be very good for grazing; and much beef is annually fatted in the place. There is ſome pitch pine plain in the north part of the town; there is alſo conſiderable white pine remaining in the weſterly part of the place; but oak, cheſnut, aſh, beech, birch, hemlock, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, conſtitute the principal growth of wood. The town has its full ſhare of water. Miller's River, ſo called by the Engliſh, in conſequence of a man by the name of Miller, who was drowned herein, well towards a hundred years ago, in attempting to paſs this river in his way to Northfield: But the natives called it Payquage or Bayquage—this river is large, and its current in many places rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id; it comes into Athol in the northeaſterly quarter of the town, and paſſing within half a mile of the meetinghouſe, it runs weſterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Connecticut River; in the ſouthweſterly part of Athol, there is ſome good meadow on this river. The next ſtream for bigneſs is Tully Brook; (or rather <hi>River</hi> if its appellation had not been eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed) this has its origin in Fitzwilliam in the State of Newhampſhire, comes through Royalſton into the northerly part of Athol, and joins Miller's
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:026481_0246_0FD05778192E22F0"/>
River about one mile northweſt from the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. On this ſtream, and after the junction, there are ſome very good meadows. Mill Brook, ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its having upon it many convenient ſeats for mills, riſes from various ſprings in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſterly part of the town, and runs northweſterly, and falls into Miller's River in the weſt part of Athol. In the ſoutheaſterly part of the town riſes a brook ſufficient to carry mills, which runs to a pond of thirty acres or more, which the line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Newſalem and Athol croſſes in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt part, and from this pond there is an outlet which runs north, and empties into Miller's River. There is alſo another pond in the north part of the town, from whence there is an outlet into Tully Brook: This is ſmall, covering perhaps twenty or thirty acres.</p>
               <p>Upon the rivers and ſtreams abovementioned, there are in the town, four griſt mills, ſix ſaw mills, one fulling mill, and one trip hammer. We muſt not omit to mention, there is a very fine ſpring in this town, which iſſues out of a high bank upon the ſide of Miller's River, (perhaps twenty feet above the ſurface of the river) the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof is medicinal. Many perſons who have drank freely thereof, have found it operate as a gentle cathartick; and ſome who have been poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have been ſpeedily cured by waſhing the parts affected therewith. Several who have been afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rheumatick complaints, bathed in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this ſpring, in a ciſtern, ſome few years ago provided to receive them, and found great relief.

And what is worthy of notice is this, theſe waters have the ſame efficacy and virtue without ſoap, in waſhing of perſons, which other waters have with. We cloſe the account of Athol with ſaying, it is ſituated in the northweſtern extremity of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, about thirty five miles from the courthouſe in Worceſter, to the northweſt, and from Boſton it is ſeventy two miles, a little to the north of weſt. It is bounded on the north, by Royalſton; on the eaſt, by Gerry; on the ſouth, by Peterſham; on the ſouthweſt, by Newſalem; and on the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, by Orange. The number of inhabitants in this town, when the cenſus was taken, was 850.</p>

There are no remarkable hills, nor any extenſive plains in the town. The produce is, Indian corn, wheat, rye, flax, &amp;c. &amp;c. and whatever is common to this country. The land is well accepted to orcharding, and all kinds of fruit trees; for it is high, ſweet, and in general not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to froſts. The growth of wood and timber is oak of all ſorts, abounding eſpecially in white oak, walnut, cheſnut, and whatever is common to the high and low lands in other towns.</p>
               <p>Some parts of the town are high and rather dry; nevertheleſs, the lands bear a drought well; and in general there are ſufficient ſprings, rivulets, and ſtreams of water. There is one river which has its ſource in the eaſterly part of the town, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Five Mile River</hi>; it runs from the north to the ſouth; it is not large, yet there is one corn, and one ſaw mill ſtanding thereon in the ſoutherly part of the town; and on this ſtream there is ſome meadow land.

There is but one other meadow in the town of any conſiderable bigneſs; this is ſituated about a mile ſoutheaſt from the meetinghouſe, and is known by the name of Clammour Meadow.

               <p>THIS place was originally a part of the town of Lunenburg, and wholly included in the grant made to the proprietors of Turkey Hill. It was made a diſtinct and ſeparate town on the 3d of February, 1764. A part of Fitchburg, to the north, was ſet off in the year 1767, to aid in forming the town of Aſhby, in the county of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex.

On the eaſtern part it is not ſo very une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, reſembling Lunenburg, from whence it was taken; but in the other parts of the town, the hills are large, high, and ſteep; however, on them there is not much broken, poor and waſte land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In general the ſoil is excellent; and the town in many reſpects is ſuperior to Lunenburg. By the late cenſus the dwelling houſes were found to be 166, and the inhabitants 1151, ſpread over a territory not much exceeding 13000 acres.

The appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance encourages a hope that there are valuable mines, either of gold or ſilver, or both, imboſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there. Attempts have heretofore been made to explore and poſſeſs them; but for want of wealth or perſeverance in the undertakers, they have not obtained the deſiderata. All valuable mines in this part of the world, as in moſt other parts, lie deep in the bowels of the earth, and much labour is neceſſary to reach them. In the preſent ſtate of our population, riches, in theſe northern parts, are with much greater facility procured from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth, by the various inſtruments of

This tract was to be laid out into ſixty three equal ſhares; one for the firſt miniſter, one for the uſe of the miniſtry, and one for the uſe of a ſchool; the others, for ſixty proprietors. As theſe all, excepting eight, belonged to <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> in the county of Eſſex, in Maſſachuſetts, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> was called Ipſwich Canada, until its incorporation by an act of the General Court, which paſſed June 14th, 1764, when it was made a town, and called Winchendon. The proprietors received this grant on conditions of erecting ſixty ſmall houſes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:026481_0255_0FD04FEF860EA0F0"/>
with a ſuitable, convenient meetinghouſe, and ſettling a learned and orthodox miniſter in five years from the laying out of the townſhip. Theſe conditions were not punctually fulfilled; however, in the year 1752, ten families had fixed down here. But the ſettlement of the place was immediately retarded by what is commonly called the laſt French war. Moſt of the ſettlers left the place; they who remained were obliged to keep in garriſons. The proprietors ſet up the firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe, thirty five by forty five feet, in the ſpring of the year 1762. The church of Chriſt in this place was imbodied, and the Rev. Daniel Stimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ordained their firſt paſtor, on December 15th, 1762. Mr. Stimpſon continued not ſix years in the miniſtry; the Great Head of the church ſaw fit to remove him hence by death, July 20th, 1768. He was ſucceeded in the paſtoral office by the Rev. Joſeph Brown, who was ſeparated here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto May 24th, 1769. Mr. Brown continues in his work, and enjoys the affection and eſteem of his people. The firſt houſe for publick worſhip being too ſmall for the inhabitants, they on the 24th and 25th of May, 1792, erected a large new one, fifty by ſixty feet, and having completed it, met in it for the firſt time January 1ſt, 1793, when it was ſolemnly dedicated to the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>In this town a foundation is already laid for a ſocial library, which bids fair to be large and very conſiderable in time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="unknown:026481_0256_0FD05780482A9B50"/>When this townſhip was firſt located it was ſuppoſed to extend northerly to New hampſhire, but upon running the line afterwards between the two States, it was found there was a mile in width for the whole length of this town left to Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts. Upon the granting of Royalſton, ſome years after, this ſtrip of land was annexed to that town, and called Royalſton Leg. When a number of families had got ſeated thereon, at their requeſt, it was in 1780 ſet to Winchendon. It contained 3840 acres. In June, 1785, a piece of land of 3680 acres, was taken from the ſoutheaſterly part of this town, to help form the town of Gardner; Winchendon, however, ſtill remains more than ſix miles ſquare.</p>
               <p>The preſent extent and boundaries of Winchen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don are as follow. Beginning at the northeaſt angle of the town, on the State line, thence ſouth twelve degrees weſt, five miles and an half on Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham line, to the northeaſt corner of Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Thence weſt twenty eight degrees ſouth, three miles and eighty five rods on Gardner line, to a corner in Templeton line: Thence north thirty ſix degrees weſt, two miles one hundred and forty four rods on Templeton line, to a corner: Thence north ſeventy eight degrees weſt, ſix hundred rods on ſaid Templeton line, to a corner in Royalſton line: Thence north twelve degrees eaſt, on Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alſton line, five miles two hundred and ſixty rods, to the northeaſt corner of ſaid Royalſton, on the State line, or the line between Winchendon and Rindge: Thence eaſt twelve degrees ſouth, ſix miles on the State line, to the firſt mentioned bound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="unknown:026481_0257_0FD0575B89510668"/>The ſoil of Winchendon is deep and good, and produces rye, barley, oats, flax, and all kinds of vegetables: Wheat is not raiſed here in ſo great plenty as in ſome other towns; yet more at preſent than formerly. Indian corn is not ſo eaſily raiſed, as the land is rocky, and ſome of the extreme parts of the town are much ſubject to froſts. The town is not very uneven, and there are no remarkable hills in the place.</p>
               <p>The general growth of wood on the high lands, is red oak, beech, rock maple, and black birch, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed with white pine and hemlock. On the low lands, white pine, hemlock, hacmatack, aſh of all kinds, and yellow birch, interſperſed with red oak and beech. On ſome of the loweſt lands, there is little or nothing but pine, hemlock, and hacmatack. In ſome parts of the town there is cheſnut, and in other parts pitch pine, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them in plenty.</p>
               <p>Mines or minerals, none as yet have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the town: There are two or three ſprings, however, of the mineral kind; one eſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ially in the northerly part of the town, which is thought by phyſicians and others acquainted with ſuch things, to be equal to many in great repute for their healing virtue. It is certainly of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal kind, and rather ſeems of a chalybeate quality. There is but one pond which is wholly within the limits of this town, called <hi>Deniſon</hi>'s <hi>Pond,</hi> it covers perhaps as much as one hundred and fifty acres. It has an inlet from the north, and an outlet towards the ſouth into a river which runs
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:026481_0258_0FD05781CB5D4570"/>
within an hundred rods of ſaid pond. It abounds in fiſh of various kinds. There is one river, known by the name of Miller's River, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſource whereof is a large pond, lying chiefly in the northeaſterly part of Rindge, a ſmall part only falling within the bounds of Winchendon, where the outlet is. This pond is known by the name of <hi>Monomenock Pond.</hi> The outlet from this pond, together with ſome ſmall ſtreams from ponds in the northweſterly part of Aſhburnham, uniting in the northeaſterly part of Winchendon, form Miller's River, which runs weſterly, ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſterly and ſoutherly, half round the town; in no place nearer than one mile of the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and in ſome places three miles and more from it. It leaves this town in the ſouthweſterly part thereof, not far from the pond above deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the outlet of which, as we have ſaid, falls into this river. Otter River, ſo called, which runs through the northerly part of Templeton, juſt touches on Winchendon, in the ſouthweſterly part thereof, and runs nigh the bounds of the town about a mile and a half, and unites with Miller's River, but juſt before it leaves Winchen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. There are two large ſtreams in the weſterly part of this town, taking their riſe in Fitzwilliam. One of them joins Miller's River in Winchendon, near to Royalſton: This is not diſtinguiſhed by any particular name. The other, ſtill larger, runs into Royalſton, and ſome conſiderable way in the eaſterly part thereof; then turns and enters Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chendon, and after running ſeveral miles, joins
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:026481_0259_0FD0575D09A24F00"/>
Miller's River juſt above Deniſon's Pond. This ſtream might have been denominated a river from its largeneſs, had it not early received the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Prieſt's Brook. This name was given to it from the circumſtance of its running through a tract of land, now lying in Royalſton, formerly granted by the General Court of Maſſachuſetts to a Joſeph Prieſt, to induce him to ſet up an houſe of entertainment for the benefit of travellers from this ſtate to the Aſhuelots (Keene and Swanſey) and to No. 4 (Charleſtown) in the ſtate of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampſhire. The houſe of this Prieſt, was called <hi>The Half Way Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two ſtreams, eſpecially the latter, abound with ſalmon trouts. This ſort of fiſh is alſo found in many parts of Miller's River, as alſo pickerel and perch.</p>
               <p>Beſides the abovementioned, there are many other ſtreams and rivulets running in every part of this town, whereby it is exceedingly well watered.</p>
               <p>There is but little meadow land, perhaps not more than one hundred and fifty acres in the town of Winchendon.</p>
               <p>Interval land on Miller's River there is conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable, and what is improved is of a very good quality. But of this there is not ſo much as might have been expected; for the high lands in moſt places ſhut down quite cloſe upon the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Upon the rivers and ſtreams in the town there are two griſt mills, ſix ſaw mills, and one clothier's works. There are alſo in the town, two potaſh works.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="unknown:026481_0260_0FD0578348F89D98"/>Roads in various directions centre at, or near the meetinghouſe. The greateſt road is from Boſton, through Winchendon, and ſo on through Fitzwilliam to Charleſtown; this road a ſtage paſſes weekly through the ſummer ſeaſon. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother road leads from Winchendon, through Gardner, Weſtminſter, and ſo on to Worceſter. Another runs ſouth through Templeton; another weſterly through Royalſton, and another norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through Rindge. Winchendon is ſituated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixty two miles from Boſton, by the neareſt route, to the northweſt: And from Worceſter courthouſe it is thirty five miles, a little to the weſt of north. When the cenſus was taken, there were in the place 150 houſes, and 950 inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and it will no doubt ſtill greatly increaſe and multiply.</p>

               <p>THIS is, as to the original grant and ſettlement, doubtleſs by many years, the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt town in the county. It was in the year 1752, or very ſoon after, granted to the Hon. Meſſrs. Hubbard, Erving, Royal, Otis, and others, and was to include all the unappropriated lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Newhampſhire line, on the north; Warwick,
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:026481_0261_0FD0575E8AFF8570"/>
on the weſt; Athol and Templeton, on the ſouth; Winchendon, on the eaſt and ſouth; and Aſhburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, on the eaſt. This grant was known by the name of Royalſhire, until its incorporation, which was on February 16th, 1765, when it was called <hi>Royalſton,</hi> in compliment to the late Col. <hi>Iſaac Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> one of the original proprietors. Before the laſt French war, ſome who intended to ſettle here, began to work upon their lands, but the breaking out of that war put an entire ſtop there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Towards the cloſe of that war ſome people began to work here again; and in the year 1762 ſeveral families moved into the place; the firſt of which came in, in the month of June. Its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe was truly ſurpriſing, for in leſs than three years, it was incorporated with diſtinct town priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ileges; and in the cloſe of the year 1767, there were about forty families in the town. The number of families at this time is 195, and the number of ſouls about 1130; beſides that, there were a number of families with their eſtates ſet off to aid in forming the diſtrict of Orange, in the county of Hampſhire. As early as the year 1766, on the 13th day of October, a congregational church was imbodied here, under the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and in the preſence of the churches in the vicinity; and on the 19th of October, 1768, the firſt and preſent paſtor, the Rev. Joſeph Lee, was ordained to the work of the goſpel miniſtry among them.</p>
               <p>There were nine or ten families of the baptiſt denomination among the firſt ſettlers. At what
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:026481_0262_0FD04FED8D3AA478"/>
time they imbodied into a church ſtate is not known to us. A Mr. Eliſha Rich was their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but he was never ordained among them. He was ſucceeded by Mr. Whitman Jacobs, who was inſtalled December 13th, 1770. He lived in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol, to which town part of his ſociety belonged, and there he now reſides. Mr. Moſes Kinney is now the ordained teacher of the baptiſts in Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alſton.</p>
               <p>The lands in this town conſiſt generally of hills and valleys; and the ſoil is very excellent, being ſuitable for tillage, paſturage, mowing and orchard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The natural growth of wood is of various kinds, as oak, cheſnut, beech, aſh, white, black and yellow birch, maple, or ſugar tree, baſs, alder, and the ever greens, as pine, hemlock, hacmatack and ſpruce, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This town is exceedingly well watered by riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, rivulets and ſprings. Miller's River runs through this town from the eaſt. And there are a number of conſiderable brooks or ſtreams, which uniting, form what is called Tully River in Athol. In the ſoutherly part of the town one of the ſtreams which helps to form Tully River, has very obſervable falls. In the courſe of forty or fifty rods, the whole fall of water is more than a hundred feet. In one place it is twenty feet, or more. On theſe ſeveral ſtreams before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are large quantities of rich interval, or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meadow lands.</p>
               <p>There are two ponds in the town; one ſmall, a little weſt of the meetinghouſe; the other about

a mile further weſtward, called <hi>Long Pond.</hi> A ſmall ſtream runs out of the leſſer into the greater.</p>
               <p>Although the diſtance between theſe ponds is but little more than half a mile in a direct line, yet the little pond is at leaſt an hundred and fifty feet higher than the other.

               <p>ON the 10th of June, 1735, a grant was made by the General Court, to Thomas Tile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and others, for and in conſideration of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices done by officers and ſoldiers of the ancient town of Dorcheſter, in the expedition to Canada in 1690, under Capt.

<pb n="265" facs="unknown:026481_0264_0FD05787CFBACB60"/>
incorporation, which was on the 22d of February, 1765, when it received its preſent name. To the original grant were afterwards added Lexington farm of a thouſand acres, Cambridge farm of a thouſand more, Rolfe's farm of ſix hundred, and another of about a thouſand acres.</p>
               <p>The church of Chriſt in Aſhburnham was gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered April 23d, 1760, and the ſame day the Rev. Jonathan Wincheſter was ordained their firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. This gentleman was ſomewhat advanced in life when he was ſettled in the work of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and he continued but a ſhort ſpace therein, leaving the world November 25th, 1767. To him ſucceeded in the ſacred office and work, the Rev. John Cuſhing, who was ſolemnly conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereunto November 2d, 1768. In the town there are about twenty families of baptiſts, who manifeſt far greater catholiciſm than formerly. The whole number of families is about 150, and of inhabitants about 970, beſides a number who were ſet off to Aſhby, in the county of Middleſex, with about 3000 acres of land, and a number to the town of Gardner, with about 2000 acres more.</p>
               <p>In this town are ſituated two large hills, or mountains, <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Little Wetatick.</hi> Great Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick lies in the northeaſt part of the town, and Little Wetatick to the ſouthweſt from it.</p>
               <p>There are ſeven ponds within the limits of Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham, which divide it nearly into two equal parts, north and ſouth. Two of them are large, viz. Great and Little Naukheag. The others are not diſtinguiſhed by any particular names. Here
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:026481_0265_0FD057618809F3F0"/>
are no rivers; but theſe ponds are ſources of ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſtreams, which take different routes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the formation of ſeveral large rivers. From Little Naukheag, which is near the centre of the town, a rivulet empties into Great Naukheag, whence a ſtream iſſues to the weſt, which makes part of Miller's River. About three quarters of a mile eaſt of Little Naukheag begins another ſtream, which runs ſoutheaſt, and joining in Fitchburg with another ſtream from Weſtminſter, and other ſmall ſtreams, helps to form the north branch of Naſhaway River. Northeaſt from this laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſtream, ariſe two more, which, joining ſoon, run through Aſhby into Newipſwich, in the State of Newhampſhire, and become a large branch of Souheagan River, which empties into the great river Merrimack. Hence it appears that this town is upon the height of land between Connecticut river on the weſt, and Merrimack on the eaſt. And what is worthy of particular notice is this, that ſcarce any water runs into this town: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conjectured that all which comes in, from all quarters, would paſs through a man's boot. On ſtreams iſſuing from three of the ponds in Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham, there are mills, and a fine ſeat for more on the ſtream which runs out of Great Naukheag, not yet improved. On the banks of Little Nauk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heag is a white ſand, equal in ſineneſs and white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to that on the banks of Capeanne, and which it is judged would make glaſs.</p>
               <p>There is much broken land in this town. Some parts abound in hemlock, ſpruce, white and pitch
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:026481_0266_0FD0578947D1CCF0"/>
pine; this is the caſe more eſpecially in the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern part; however, there is much good land for graſs. Where the growth of wood is oak, hard and ſoft maple beach, birch and cheſnut, the land is moiſt and good for grazing. It has been a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place for lumber: The beſt pine timber is moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worked up: There yet remain great quantities of white and pitch pine, ſuitable for boards. There are five ſaw mills, and four corn mills in the town. Here are potaſh works, and have been from its infancy; and the firſt complete ton of this article carried into market was from Aſhburnham. Here are no remarkable ſprings, or other natural curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. They have an elegant new meetinghouſe. The former houſe of publick worſhip was, about twenty years ago, wrecked by an hurricane, and moved three or four feet to the north and eaſt; a barn, about ſixty rods to the ſouth, was torn down, while the owner within it eſcaped unhurt. This hurricane paſſed from the weſt to the eaſt, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about half a mile in width, and upon the hills ſwept all before it. The town enjoys a fine air, and is remarkably healthy.</p>
               <p>Its diſtance from Worceſter, is thirty miles to the north; and from Boſton, by the neareſt route, is fifty five miles, but through Lancaſter and Stow, it is ſixty miles, and lies to the northweſt.</p>
               <p>Aſhburnham is bounded on the north, by the State line; on the northeaſt, by Aſhby; on the eaſt, by Fitchburg; on the ſouth, by Weſtminſter and Gardner; and on the weſt, by Winchendon.</p>

               <p>THIS was taken from the towns of Leiceſter and Rutland, in nearly equal parts; and was incorporated on the 12th of February, 1765, when it received its name.</p>
               <p>The eccleſiaſtical ſtate of this town has been ſomewhat ſingular, from the gathering of the church of Chriſt in the place, to the preſent time, as will appear by the following account.</p>
               <p>The church in Paxton, was imbodied September 3d, 1767. The Rev. Silas Biglow was ordained their firſt miniſter the ſame year, viz. October 21ſt, 1767. He was much beloved and reſpected by the people of his charge, but the Great Head of the church ſuffered him to continue but a little more than two years in office, being removed by death, November 16th, 1769.</p>
               <p>He was ſucceeded in the work of the goſpel min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry by the Rev. Alexander Thayer, who was ſolemnly ſeparated hereunto on the 28th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1770. Mr. Thayer continued not quite twelve years with the people, being diſmiſſed from office Auguſt 14th, 1782.</p>
               <p>They were deſtitute, after this, of a ſettled min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter for more than three years, until September 8th, 1785, when the Rev. John Foſter was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their third paſtor; at which time the town was in a moſt unhappy divided ſtate, there being but a bare majority for Mr. Foſter; the other party
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:026481_0268_0FD0578AC9866678"/>
diſſenting, and proteſting, utterly refuſed to hear him, and were by law exempted from contributing to his ſupport. In this ſituation the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ople re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for three years and a half, until April, 1789, when Mr. Foſter was diſmiſſed from his paſtoral relation to the people.</p>
               <p>Mr. Foſter was, in about three years after, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled at Taunton, in the county of Briſtol.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Foſter's removal from Paxton the parties amicably reunited, and are in a way for the happy reſettlement of the goſpel miniſtry among them.</p>
               <p>If the people do but continue united, they are able to ſupport the goſpel in a very honourable, generous manner: For the town, though not large, is well ſettled, being an excellent tract of land, and the inhabitants in general are induſtrious, good, and wealthy farmers. It is pleaſant, although uneven, having many hills and valleys; but the ſoil is rich and productive: It is good for all kinds of grain, and well repays the labour beſtowed upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: It is peculiarly good for graſs and paſturing, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for orcharding. The high lands are moiſt and ſpringy, not too rocky; and the lower lands are ſwamps or meadows, but eaſily drained. The wood which grows on the higher lands, is oak, much walnut, ſome cheſnut; and in the lower lands, are found birch, beech, maple and aſh. It is truly noticeable that the wood in this town, when cut down, never ſprouts again, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which they are threatened with a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of fuel.</p>

                  <pb n="270" facs="unknown:026481_0269_0FD057648A7BD680"/>The town is exceedingly well watered by ſprings from the hills; and by ſmall ſtreams, on which they have both corn and ſaw mills. From the ſame ſpring, about half a mile north of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe, waters iſſue, which ſoon divide and take quite different and contrary directions; part runs northeaſterly into the river Naſhaway; part runs ſouthweſterly into Connecticut river. There are two hills in the town of great height, and worthy of particular mention: One is called Turkey Hill, near Rutland line, this is large, and affords good farms; and eſpecially fine paſture land: At the foot of this hill, on the weſt ſide, lies Turkey Hill Pond, large, and well ſtored with fiſh; and from this pond runs a ſtream which empties into Chica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee River, and from thence into Connecticut river. On the eaſt ſide of the town, and in that part which was formerly Leiceſter, is ſituated what is called Aſnebumſkit Hill, the foot of which, on the eaſt ſide, falls within the bounds of Holden. This is a large and high hill, containing ſeveral hundred acres, the land is rich and good; eſpecially adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for paſturage. It lies about twelve miles ſouth of Watchuſett great hill, and except that, overtops all other hills within forty or fifty miles of it. Around this hill the vapours gather ſo plentifully, or become ſo denſe the evening preceding a rain, that it appears at a diſtance as if it rained upon its ſummit. To this hill many of the farmers, in the vicinity, look at evening, or a little before the ſetting of the ſun, in the time of making hay, that they may be able to determine with a good degree
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:026481_0270_0FD0578C4A7FF918"/>
of certainty, what the weather will be the next day. Near the foot of this hill, is ſituated Aſnebumſkit Pond; which is a fine large pond, and well ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fiſh: From this pond there iſſues a ſtream, which runs to the northeaſt through Holden, and joining the ſtream from the foot of Watchuſett Hill, helps to form the ſouth branch of Naſhaway River. From ſprings, on the northweſterly part of Aſnebumſkit Hill, a ſtream is formed, which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſoutherly, paſſes through Leiceſter, and ſo to French River. The above obſervations ſhew us that Paxton is ſituated on the height of the lands between the ſea, on the eaſt and ſouth, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut river on the weſt.</p>
               <p>In Paxton, works for making potaſh have lately been ſet up: And here a ſmall number of cotton and wool cards are annually made.</p>
               <p>The number of inhabitants in this town was found in 1791, to be 558.</p>
               <p>Paxton is ſituated eight miles weſt from Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and about fifty five from Boſton, a little to the ſouth of weſt. It is bounded on the north, by Rutland; on the eaſt, by Holden; on the ſouth, by Leiceſter and Spencer; and on the weſt, by Oakham and Rutland.</p>

               <p>THIS was the north part of the town of Weſtborough, the main part whereof was ſet off from Marlborough in the year 1717. It was made the ſecond precinct or pariſh of Weſtborough by an act of Court, on the 20th of October, 1744.</p>
               <p>The church of Chriſt was gathered in this place May 21ſt, 1746, and on the ſame day the Rev. John Martin was ordained their firſt paſtor, who continued to miniſter unto them in holy things until April 30th, 1767, when after a ſhort ſickneſs he died in the 61ſt year of his age, and the 21ſt of his miniſtry. In ſix months and four days from his death, viz. on the 4th of November, 1767, the Rev. Peter Whitney was conſecrated their ſecond paſtor.</p>

reſigned his office, and retired to Northborough, and ſpent the reſidue of his days in the family of the late Rev. John Martyn. Mrs. Monis and Mrs. Martyn were ſiſters. He left ſomething very hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable and generous to the church in Northbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough. He bequeathed forty ſix pounds thirteen ſhillings and four pence, to be equally divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſeven of the miniſters then living in the vicin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity: Alſo, he left about an hundred and twenty ſix pounds as a fund, the intereſt whereof was to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed among widows of miniſters who were in indigent circumſtances; and the remainder of his eſtate, which was conſiderable, he gave to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn family.</p>

               <p>The town of Northborough lies in a kind of valley between the high lands of Marlborough on the eaſt, and thoſe of Shrewſbury and Boylſton on the weſt. On its eaſterly ſide it is about four miles long, and on its weſterly about five: It is on an average about three miles and an half wide from eaſt to weſt, containing about 90 dwelling houſes, upwards of an 100 families, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the late cenſus 620 inhabitants. It would doubtleſs admit of 150 or more families, were the large farms (ſome of which contain four hundred or five hundred acres) properly divided. This is beginning to take place, and in a few years proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly will be accompliſhed. The inhabitants are chiefly farmers, and wealthy: They have alſo traders in European and Weſtindia goods; and various tradeſmen and mechanicks, eſpecially an excellent maker of edge tools of various kinds; and conſidering its dimenſions and number, it is doubtleſs one of the ableſt pariſhes in the county. The pooreſt land in general appears as we travel the great road. The farms which lie off are good, and much of the land very fertile. The weſterly ſide
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:026481_0275_0FD0576909EE6778"/>
of the town riſes into high land, and the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt angle is very high; but the land is not rocky, and the farms are excellent, and from thence the proſpect is extenſive. There is one beautiful hill, called <hi>Liguor Hill,</hi> containing towards an hundred acres of land, very good, oppoſite the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and not more than ſixty or eighty rods from it, on the ſouth ſide of the poſt road. This is high, and ſeen from all the neighbouring towns; but it is not inacceſſible even to teams. Its ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit is covered with a fine growth of good wood at preſent. About one mile northeaſt from the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe is another hill, very ſimilar, called Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Hill. Upon the river Aſſabet, which runs through the eaſterly part of the town, are vaſt bodies of rich interval and good meadow lands. And upon the other ſtreams and rivulets there are large and good meadows, eſpecially on that called <hi>Cold Harbour,</hi> which riſes in the north part of Shrewſbury, and croſſing the ſoutheaſt angle of Boylſton, turns and runs ſoutherly, then turns and runs eaſterly, and paſſing between the poſt road and meetinghouſe, ſoon empties itſelf into the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Aſſabet. On the above named ſtream, in the weſterly part of the town, are a corn and ſaw mill, one a few rods below the other, and as there is a ſmall outlet from Rocky Pond, in the eaſterly part of Boylſton, which empties into this Cold Harbour ſtream, ſo the owner of thoſe mills, by means of a ſmall dam at the lower end of ſaid pond, furniſhes them with a rich ſupply of water, although diſtant a mile or more. In the north
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:026481_0276_0FD05790C92F8060"/>
part of the town are a corn and ſaw mill together, on North Brook, which coming from a pond in Lancaſter, and running through Berlin and the northeaſt angle of Northborough, falls into the river Aſſabet. A little north of the meetinghouſe runs a ſmall but laſting ſtream from the hills in the weſterly part of the town, on which is a ſaw mill which performs conſiderable work in the ſpring and autumn. In the town there are two ponds; one called <hi>Solomon's Pond,</hi> from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of an Indian of that name being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, by falling through a raft on which he was fiſhing. This is in the northeaſterly part of the town. It is not large; about ninety rods long, and ſeventy five rods wide; has plenty of fiſh: To this pond there is no viſible inlet nor outlet.</p>
               <p>The other is in the ſoutheaſterly part of the town, called <hi>Little Chauncy</hi>; this alſo is well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with fiſh. From <hi>Great Chauncy</hi> Pond, in the northeaſterly part of Weſtborough, there is a ſmall outlet which runs into <hi>Little Chauncy</hi>; and from <hi>Little Chauncy</hi> a brook runs northerly, and croſſing the poſt road on the line between Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough and Northborough, and the boundary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two counties of Middleſex and Worceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, empties its waters into Aſſabet River, On this ſtream are a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe works are the property of two brothers, Captains Samuel and Abraham Wood; but the buſineſs is performed at preſent by the latter only. On the oppoſite ſide of the road and river are works for the manufacture of iron, and where many tons have been made. There is in the vicinity a great plenty of ore, eſpecially of the bog kind. Near the forge are works for the making of potaſh, where large quantities are man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactured yearly. About a mile below, on this ſame river, is a griſt mill which fails not to grind through the year. Thus there are four corn, and four ſaw mills within the town.</p>
               <p>There are, in this town, curious works for the conveyance of water to a great diſtance, the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, contrivance, and execution of Major Hollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Taylor. I know not that there are any ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar works in the county, and would therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them.</p>
               <p>From ſprings iſſuing out of ledges of rocks on riſing lands, this gentleman has raiſed a ſmall pond, and from thence brings fine water (about ſeventy rods, through bored logs, under ground, not only in low lands, but in ſome places higher

lands, where the water repeatedly aſcends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends) into the back part of his houſe, into a large vat, near three feet in height, by a tube, from the laſt log, entering the bottom of the vat, which is, or may be kept conſtantly full, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over; and the ſuperfluous water is conveyed from the vat, by another tube, out on to the graſs land. As the water paſſes under ground nigh the barn yard by a tube from a log, entering the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a large trough, he has a rich ſupply of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a great ſtock of cattle; and ſuch is the qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the water that it has ſeldom ever been known to freeze in trough or vat.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>As this account may be read by ſome not much acquainted with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral philoſophy, and who therefore may think it incredible that water can be made to paſs over riſing grounds, and through low lands, alternately, as in this caſe, and then riſe to ſuch a height in the houſe; (for theſe logs are carried along under ploughed fields and mowing lands;) for the ſake of ſuch it ought to be obſerved, that water may be conveyed any where, to riſe exactly to the height of the fountain or pond from whence it proceeds; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot be carried to a greater height in its way to the place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                     <p>Should any perſons wiſh to convey water in this manner, they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that yellow or pitch pine logs are much beſt for the purpoſe; they are harder and more durable; thoſe of cheſnut are too ſpungy and porous.</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>The general growth of wood in the town is cheſnut, walnut, the ſeveral ſorts of oak, ſome white pine, and large quantities of pitch pine, which of late years, is in great demand, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wood for fuel.</p>
               <p>Northborough lies about thirty ſix miles from the Statehouſe in Boſton, and is eight or nine degrees to the ſouth of weſt; and is ten miles from the courthouſe in Worceſter, a few degrees to the north of eaſt. This town is greatly benefited by
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:026481_0279_0FD0576C46483338"/>
the publick roads, which in different directions paſs through it. Beſides the poſt road from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton to Worceſter, (and ſo to the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) which runs through it but a few rods ſouth of the meetinghouſe; there is another from New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampſhire State, and the northern part of the county of Worceſter, and coming through Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter or Harvard, and Bolton and Berlin, paſſes directly through this town, juſt by the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and croſſing the poſt road, leads on to Mendon and Providence. The road alſo from Worceſter and Shrewſbury, through Framingham to Boſton, paſſes through the ſouth part of the town into Weſtborough. There is alſo a road of much travel from Hubbardſton, Princeton, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Sterling, and eſpecially Boylſton, which coming in upon the northweſterly part of the town, paſſes directly in front of the meetinghouſe, and then in the ſpace of about fifty rods, falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poſt road.</p>
               <p>Another great benefit the town reaps, is from the great reſort of people from all the neighbouring towns to the corn and ſaw mills, to the fulling mill and forge, and to the blackſmiths', for their works of various kinds, as well as to the ſhops and ſtores.</p>
               <p>Northborough is bounded on the north, by Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin; on the eaſt, by Marlborough and Southbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough; on the ſouth, by Weſtborough; and on the weſt, by Shrewſbury and Boylſton.</p>

               <p>THIS was called "the northeaſt quarter of Rutland," being wholly included in the original grant of that town, and was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated on the 13th day of June, 1767, and called Hubbardſton, to perpetuate the name and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the late Hon. Thomas Hubbard, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Boſton, who had been ſometime ſpeaker of the houſe of Repreſentatives; after that, ſeveral years a counſellor of the then province, and for many years treaſurer, and of courſe a member, of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of Harvard Univerſity in Cambridge. He was a large proprietor of lands in this place.</p>
               <p>The congregational church in Hubbardſton was imbodied on the 13th of June, 1770, and on the ſame day the Rev.

               <p>We proceed to a deſcription of this place. It is about ſix miles ſquare; and is bounded weſt, by Barre; ſouth, by Rutland; eaſt, by Princeton: northeaſt, by Weſtminſter; and north, by Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Templeton and Gerry. The town is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly interſperſed with hills and valleys. Perhaps about a twelfth part of it is meadow and interval. The uplands are generally, excellent for grazing and ſome conſiderable part very good for the
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:026481_0281_0FD0576D87FAA5F8"/>
growth of Engliſh graſs. The land in general, is not the beſt for grain; though in common years a ſufficiency is raiſed for the inhabitants. It is rather too cold for orcharding, although there are a number of flouriſhing orchards in the town, and ſome years a conſiderable quantity of cider is made. Hills there are ſeveral in the town, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but two which we ſhall notice: The largeſt, in the northweſterly part of the town, extends quite through it, from Templeton to Barre; this is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Burnſhirt Hill, and is moſt excellent land. The other is called Read's Hill, ſituated about one mile and an half eaſt from the centre of the town; this is alſo very good land.</p>
               <p>It is ſuppoſed this town is rich in iron ore, at leaſt; there is a hill in the north part of it, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Templeton,<note n="*" place="bottom">See this alſo noticed in the account of Templeton.</note> where a number of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from Boſton and other places, wrought near fifty years ago. They dug ſeveral rods into the hill, in queſt of a ſilver mine; but whether it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their expectations or not, was not divulged. A war commencing put a ſtop to their purſuit, and it has never ſince been reaſſumed.</p>
               <p>The town is finely watered by ſprings, ſtreams and rivers; There are five rivers and ſtreams no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeable, which paſs through the town from north to ſouth. The moſt eaſterly of theſe is called Piſs River, part whereof comes from Weſtminſter, and part from the weſt ſide of Watchuſett Hill in Princeton. The next is called Ware River, which heads in Hubbardſton. The next is a ſmaller ſtream, called Meadow Brook, which takes its riſe
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:026481_0282_0FD05796381E2E30"/>
in the north part of the town. Further weſt is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſtream called Conneyſtow Brook, which has its ſource in Templeton. The moſt weſterly ſtream is known by the name of <hi>Burnſhirt River,</hi> the principal branch of which comes from Gerry. All theſe ſtreams running a ſoutherly direction, unite in the eaſt part of Barre, where their names, as well as waters, are ſwallowed up in Ware Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Otter River,</hi> ſo called, which riſes in Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, runs in the north part of this town, and then turning, falls back into Templeton, and at length, unites with Miller's River.<note n="*" place="bottom">See this more particularly deſcribed in the account of Templeton.</note> On theſe rivers and ſtreams, within the town of Hubbardſton, there are eleven ſaw mills, five griſt mills, and one clothiers' works. There are alſo works for making potaſh in the town.</p>
               <p>There are three ponds in Hubbardſton. The largeſt of theſe, known by the name of the Great Aſnaconcomick Pond, is about two miles from the centre of the town, to the eaſt: It is a mile and a half in length, from north to ſouth; the breadth is various, from half a mile to five rods, ſuppoſed to cover about three hundred acres. About half a mile further to the northeaſt, is ſituated Little Aſnaconcomick Pond, of a circular form; and what merits particular notice is this, that for a conſiderable part of the way round this pond, there is every appearance that once a ſtone wall was built, or building. In ſome places it is two feet and an half in height, as if laid up by the hands of men; and where there is not one
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:026481_0283_0FD0576F081296E0"/>
ſtone upon another, the appearance is as of a large ſtone wall thrown down. If this was the work of art, when and by whom it was performed, or wherefore, perhaps can never be aſcertained. Both the Ponds before deſcribed are fed by ſmall ſprings. There is a ſmall outlet from each. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſmall pond is ſituated about a mile north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt from the centre of the town; it is called <hi>Natty Pond,</hi> which has both an inlet and an outlet. The growth of wood in this place is chiefly white pine and pitch pine in great plenty, hemlock, beech, maple and oak; there is but little of any other ſort.</p>
               <p>The town is ſettled in general, with induſtrious farmers; and they are become numerous, and are increaſing in wealth. There are about 150 fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and near 1000 ſouls in the place.</p>
               <p>Hubbardſton is ſituated ſixty miles, nearly weſt, from Boſton; and twenty from the courthouſe in Worceſter, to the northweſt. A road much uſed, leads through the town from the ſouth to the north, in which people paſs from Rhodeiſland, &amp;c. &amp;c. to the weſtern part of Newhampſhire, and to the State of Vermont. It is alſo in contemplation to open a road from the towns on Connecticut river, in the county of Hampſhire, through Peterſham, to Hubbardſton, and ſo on through Princeton and Lancaſter, to Boſton. This undoubtedly, would be the neareſt route, from Hadley and towns adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, to the metropolis of the Commonwealth.</p>

               <head>NORTHBRIDGE.</head>
               <p>THE town of Northbridge takes its name from its ſituation and bearing with reſpect to Uxbridge, from which it was chiefly taken; five or ſix families only being ſet off to it from Sutton ſouth or firſt pariſh. It is about five miles in length, and about four in width; and is bounded, by Uxbridge, on the ſouth; by Sutton, on the weſt; by Grafton, on the north; and by Mendon and Upton, on the eaſt and northeaſt. It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated on the 14th of July, 1772. It is not large, having, at the time of the late enumeration 83 houſes, and 570 inhabitants. The congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional church here was imbodied, June the 6th, 1782, and on the 25th of June, 1783, the Rev. John Crane was ordained their paſtor. Here alſo there is a ſociety of Baptiſts of about ten families; at preſent deſtitute of any ſettled teacher. There are alſo within the town twelve families of Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and two or three of the Univerſaliſts.</p>
               <p>We ſhall proceed to ſome Topographical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this place.</p>
               <p>It is uneven and ſomewhat rocky and rough; but the land and ſoil, in general, rich, ſtrong and good. As it has alternately, high and low lands, it is well calculated for orcharding, for paſture and graſs land, and bears rye, Indian corn, oats, flax, &amp;c. Hills there are none high, or, on any account remarkable. The meetinghouſe ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſtands on an eminence, and commands a good proſpect for four or five miles round. As the lands in general are high, the air is ſalubrious, and the inhabitants have been bleſſed with great health from the firſt ſettlement of the place.</p>
               <p>There are no ſtagnant waters or ponds in the town: But it is finely watered by ſprings, ſtreams and rivers. Two of theſe are noticeable: Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone River, which originates in Sutton, and paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the weſterly part of Grafton, enters this town, and runs from north to ſouth the whole length of the town, on the weſterly ſide thereof. This is a large and fine river; and upon this there are great bodies of very excellent interval lands: Some of theſe are high, and bear corn and flax; the lower are good for graſs.</p>
               <p>There is another river, not ſo large, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters this town in the ſouthweſt part from Douglaſs, and joins Blackſtone River. On this river there is a quantity of valuable meadow: But the land ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining the meadow is not the moſt fertile.</p>
               <p>There are within the town, two corn mills, one ſaw mill, and one forge, where much work is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>The growth of wood, on the high lands is very valuable, conſiſting of walnut, oak and cheſnut; that on the low lands is leſs valuable, but like that of other towns in general; the quantity of pine timber is ſmall.

               <head>BARRE.</head>
               <p>THIS was the northweſt part of Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Original Grant; it was made a diſtrict by act of the Legiſlature in the year 1749, and called Rutland Diſtrict, until June 14th, 1774, when it was made a town, and the name of <hi>Barre</hi> was given to it, as a token of reſpect to a great and worthy friend of America, at that time a member of the Britiſh Houſe of Commons. Barre is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the north, by Peterſham: on the eaſt, by Hubbardſton; on the ſoutheaſt, by Rutland; on the ſouth, by Oakham; on the ſouthweſt, by Newbraintree; and on the weſt, by Hardwick.</p>
               <p>The church of Chriſt in this place, was gathered July 30th, 1753, and the Rev. Thomas Frink was

He continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the miniſtry at Barre, but about thirteen years, being diſmiſſed from his ſacred office, by advice of an eccleſiaſtical council July 17th, 1766. He was ſucceeded in the paſtoral office at Barre, by the Rev. Joſiah Dana, who was conſecrated hereunto October 7th, 1767. Mr. Dana con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in the work of the goſpel miniſtry in this place, and in peace and eſteem with the people of his charge.</p>
               <p>The following ſorrowful occurrence took place in this town. In March, 1780, the houſe of Mr. Peter Bent was conſumed by fire in the night, with almoſt every thing contained therein, and two of his children, a ſon and daughter, of adult age, periſhed in the flames.</p>
               <p>The town of Barre is large in extent, being rather more than ſix miles ſquare: And it is one of the beſt townſhips of land in the county; the ſoil is exceedingly rich and ſtrong. The land in general, is very hilly and uneven. The hills, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are not ſo very high, but ſome are ſteep, and being ſomewhat rocky, the roads are not ſo good: But this is commonly the caſe in moſt towns where the ſoil is excellent, and moiſt: The town is well watered by numerous ſprings and rivulets, and the people enjoy great advantages for turning
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:026481_0288_0FD057AF8B50CA20"/>
and conveying the water over their graſs land. The ſoil is peculiarly adapted to mowing and paſturage; and here they fat great multitudes of cattle, and make the beſt of beef. Here alſo they have many and large dairies; and it is ſuppoſed that more butter and cheeſe is carried from hence into the market, annually, than from any other town of the ſame extent. The ſoil bears Indian corn well; but it is not ſo well adapted to Engliſh grain as ſome other places. However, they raiſe a ſufficiency of all kinds for themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for exportation. As the town is uneven and hilly, it affords no large and commanding view of itſelf, but from the hills there is an extenſive proſpect into other towns. The pleaſantneſs of Barre conſiſts in the richneſs and fertility of the land, and the large, handſome, well finiſhed build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of all kinds; but from no one place can many of them be ſeen at once. The farms are large, and very productive: The people are induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, and they have great encouragement to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Their modes of huſbandry are good, and there are ſure indications of wealth and opulence all over the town.

an unuſual proportion of white oak; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cheſnut, ſome walnut; birch, beech, aſh, white pine, pitch pine, ſome hemlock, &amp;c. There is one large river, called Ware River, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Templeton, through the weſterly part of Hubbardſton, paſſes through the eaſterly and ſoutherly parts of Barre, and then runs into Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick. There is alſo a ſtream originating in Gerry which runs through the town on the eaſterly ſide, within a mile of the meetinghouſe, called Pleaſant Branch: This falls into Ware River, in the ſouth part of the town. In the north part of the town, on the weſterly ſide, riſes another ſtream from ſprings, which is called Mooſe Brook, which runs into Hardwick, and there empties itſelf into Ware-River. On theſe ſtreams there are ſome meadows, and very good interval lands on Ware River in the ſoutherly part of the town. On this river, and on theſe ſtreams there are four griſt mills, ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſaw mills, and clothiers' works.</p>
               <p>The people in Barre ſubſiſt, mainly, by farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; here are, however, all the uſual tradeſmen and mechanicks, and two or three dealers in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean, Eaſt and Weſt India goods; here alſo the pot and pearl aſh works are carried on.</p>

               <p>THIS place was not an original grant, but was taken from ſeveral other towns, as Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Oxford, Sutton and Leiceſter, together with a gore of land lying between Oxford and Leiceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not previouſly belonging to any town. On the 23d of June, 1773, this place was erected into a poll pariſh, and commonly called the ſouth pariſh of Worceſter. The pariſh was limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bounded in the following manner: It was to extend three miles into Worceſter, as the roads were then trod; three into Oxford, and three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Leiceſter by their roads, and one mile and an half into Sutton, from the meetinghouſe place. This place as above deſcribed, was incorporated and made a diſtinct town, and veſted with all the privileges which other towns enjoy, by an act of the Legiſlature, April 10th, 1778, when it received the name of Ward, as a compliment to the Hon. Major General Artemas Ward, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Shrewſbury, and now Repreſentative of this county in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the United States of America. The town is bounded northerly on Worceſter; eaſterly, by Grafton; ſoutheaſt, by Sutton; ſouth, by Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; and weſterly, by Leiceſter.</p>
               <p>The church of Chriſt in Ward was imbodied on the 25th of January, 1776; and on the 3d of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,

               <p>We ſhall now preſent the reader with a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical Deſcription of the town of Ward.</p>
               <p>It is conſidered, by good judges, as a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tract of land: The ſoil in general is fertile, rich and ſtrong, ſuitable for orcharding and all kinds of fruit; well adapted to paſturage and mowing, and produces large crops of rye, oats, wheat, barley, Indian corn, and flax. It is not very rocky; but affords ſtone ſufficient for fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the farms: It is not level, but rather une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, abounding in hills and valleys. The hills, however are not high; but the lands on them are good. Part of the hill, called Proſpect Hill, to the ſouth, lies within this town; alſo part of the hill, called <hi>Boggachoag,</hi> to the north; and part of the hill, called <hi>Graſſy Hill,</hi> to the ſoutheaſt of the meetinghouſe. On and near theſe hills, there are very fine farms. The general growth of wood is oak of the various ſorts, cheſnut, walnut, on the high lands; and in the lower lands, pine, maple, cedar, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The town is as well watered, by ſprings and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennial rivulets, as perhaps any other town in the county. The courſe of the ſtreams is circuitous, and ſo meandering as greatly to benefit the town. The principal ſtream is that which is called French River. There is another called Kettle Brook, which paſſes through the town. On theſe ſtreams there are four ſaw mills and two griſt mills, within
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:026481_0292_0FD057B28840EA40"/>
the town, alſo one clothiers' works; beſides which there is a wind mill erected on <hi>Proſpect Hill,</hi> which does conſiderable work.</p>
               <p>There are three or four ſmall ponds in the town, the largeſt of which covers perhaps, about thirty acres, ſituated about a mile ſouth of the meetinghouſe. There is an outlet from this pond, to the north, uſually called Dark Brook; and there is an inlet from the ſouth, while the pond is in its natural ſtate, but by an artificial raiſing of this pond about four feet, the current in the inlet is reverſed and the diſcharge of water is to the ſouth.</p>
               <p>The town is not large, but it is wealthy; there are about 80 houſes; about 90 families, and when they were numbered there were 473 ſouls: It is ſituated fifty five miles from Boſton, a little to the ſouthweſt; and five miles from the courthouſe in Worceſter, almoſt ſouth.</p>

Soon after it was made a pariſh, a congregational church was here gathered, viz. on the 15th of April, 1741, conſiſting of twenty ſix male members; and on the 21ſt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, 1743, the Rev. Amariah Froſt, was ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emnly inveſted with the paſtoral office in the place. Some time after the ſettlement of Mr. Froſt, a ſeparation took place here; a Mr. Hovey preached to the diſaffected, and was ordained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. He tarried but a few years; ſince his time preaching by itinerants and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and meetings held occaſionally on the ſabbath, have been continued among them. A number, not large, believing in the ſalvation of all men, have kept up publick meetings, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had preaching. There are a few anabaptiſts in this place, and but one family of friends or quakers. The Rev. Mr. Froſt continued the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and faithful paſtor of the congregational church in Milford, until March 14th, 1792, when he died in the ſeventy ſecond year of his age, and the forty ninth of his miniſtry.</p>
               <p>An addition to, and a general repair of their meetinghouſe was made in 1792, and it is now a very decent and convenient building.</p>
               <p>There has been greater candour and moderation of late between thoſe of different ſentiments in this town, than formerly was diſcovered; and it is hoped greater unanimity will take place in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettlement of the goſpel miniſtry among them.</p>

               <p>The town of Milford is not a level, champaign tract of land, neither yet is it very hilly and uneven; there is indeed, one large hill, a little from the centre of the town, to the ſoutheaſt, called Bear Hill. This is moſtly very good land. The whole of the north part of the town is high and good land; it riſes by a gradual aſcent; and from the higheſt places there is a large and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated proſpect; from theſe heights may be ſeen the Watchuſetts and Monadnock mountains, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the hills ſouth of Boſton. This northern part was a purchaſe from the Indians, by the proprietors of the ancient townſhip of Mendon; and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the North Purchaſe. This part is the moſt diſtant from the meetinghouſe in Milford; and in this quarter, the ſectaries in the town have uſually held their religious meetings. The northern and weſtern parts of the town, eſpecially, are rough and rocky; but the ſoil is generally ſtrong and good; and well adapted to orcharding, graſs and paſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and ſuffers but little by a dry ſeaſon. They raiſe grain here of all kinds in ſufficient quantities

moſt commonly for themſelves; but their articles of produce for market, are chiefly butter, cheeſe, pork, beef, &amp;c. perhaps equal in quality to any in the county. There are but few mechanicks in the place, and ſeldom more than two traders in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean and India goods. The people ſubſiſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the buſineſs of huſbandry, and are induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and good livers. The town is ſuppoſed to contain about as much as five miles ſquare. There are 135 dwelling houſes, and 840 inhabitants in the town, according to the late cenſus.</p>
               <p>There are two rivers running through this town, from north to ſouth, nearly parallel with each other, about one mile and an half diſtant, in ſome places not ſo much; one on the weſt, the other on the eaſt ſide of the town: Theſe have their ſources in the high lands beforementioned, in the borders of Hopkinton. That on the weſt is called Mill River, the name by which this place was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignated until its incorporation, this is large, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the eaſterly part of Mendon, it paſſes to Providence. That on the eaſt is a principal branch of Charles's River, which ſoon turns and runs eaſterly, and falls into the ſea in Boſton har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Mill River is the outlet of a large pond, ſaid to be a mile in length, partly in Milford, but principally in Hopkinton and Upton, called North Pond. There is another pond, a little more than a mile from the centre of the town, called Cedar Swamp Pond; this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this pond. There are very good meadows, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval lands upon the borders of both the rivers deſcribed before, as well as ſmall pieces in other parts of the town, which are a ſingular advantage to the farmers. The town abounds in ſprings, rivulets and brooks in all parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And on the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſtreams they have four griſt mills, three ſaw mills, one clothiers' works, and one trip hammer within the limits of Milford.</p>
               <p>The growth of wood in this town is oak of all ſorts, cheſnut, walnut, &amp;c. there is very little pine or cedar at this day.</p>
               <p>The roads in this town are not good, eſpecially for carriages; but they may be made in time, much better than at preſent.</p>
               <p>We ſhall cloſe our account of Milford, with mentioning, that in this place was born Alexander Scammell, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who graduated at Harvard Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, A. D. 1769; who was appointed a ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of maſt timber, &amp;c. in Maſſachuſetts, and province of Maine, under the Britiſh government; was Brigade Major in the American army, in 1775; a Colonel in the year 1777, at the taking of Gen. Burgoyne, and Adjutant General of the army at Yorktown, where he was unfortunately wounded in reconnoitering, September 30, 1781, juſt before the ſurrender of Lord Cornwallis, of which wound he ſoon after died.</p>

               <p>THIS was for many years, the ſecond pariſh in Lancaſter, and was commonly called <hi>Chockſet.</hi> It was made a ſeparate pariſh in the year 1743, and remained united with Lancaſter until April 25th, 1781, when it was incorporated by act of the Legiſlature, and received its preſent name, in compliment to Lord Sterling, of Newjerſey, who ſerved as a General in the American army, in the late war between Greatbritain and theſe United States. This is a large, populous, and wealthy town; is about ſeven miles in length, from north to ſouth, and ſix in width from eaſt to weſt. It is ſituated about five miles from Lancaſter, a little to the ſouth of weſt, on the road to Princeton. It is bounded by Holden and Princeton on the weſt; eight miles from Holden, and ſeven from Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, ſix miles from Boylſton, which lies to the ſouth of it; and from Leominſter, on the north, it is ſeven miles.</p>
               <p>This town is rather hilly and uneven, though there is very little broken, or waſte land in it. It is not very rocky, but a moſt excellent, fertile ſoil, producing in rich abundance, to repay the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman for its cultivation. The high lands are excellent for all kinds of fruits, eſpecially apples; and here are large orchards; alſo, for graſs and
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:026481_0298_0FD057B707D8CA00"/>
grazing; for the land is naturally moiſt, and by the help of the rivulets, the water may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the ſides of moſt of the hills. As the town is very uneven, there is no extended proſpect. Nevertheleſs, the fertility of the ſoil, the high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of cultivation, and the interſperſion of hills and valleys, afford peculiar gratification to the eyes of obſerving travellers. The meetinghouſe is in a valley; and on the road, in this valley, there is a large collection of tradeſmen and mechanicks and they are lively, active and induſtrious.</p>
               <p>But the bulk of the people are large farmers, and, as the bounteous Author of Nature has bleſſed them with a fruitful ſoil, they have great encouragement to labour. Though the town be hilly, as above obſerved, yet there are bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This lies about a mile from the meetinghouſe, on the road leading from Sterling to Lancaſter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is called Juſtice's Hill, which is ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated about four miles northweſt from the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe, on the road leading to Weſtminſter.</p>
               <p>There is but one river in the town, called <hi>Still River,</hi> from the ſlow motion of its waters; for after it enters this town, it runs in a vale for ſev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The weſtern branch iſſues from the foot of Mount Watchuſett, in Princeton, and after various meanders, and receiving acceſſions by ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral rivulets, which originate in the eaſtern ſide of
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:026481_0299_0FD0504B4DECAE98"/>
Princeton hills, joins the others a little north of the road leading from Sterling to Princeton. This branch bears the name of <hi>Hartwell</hi>'s <hi>River,</hi> upon which are ſeveral valuable mills. The middle branch originates in <hi>Gardner</hi>'s <hi>Meadows,</hi> which are in the northeaſtern part of Princeton; This is the largeſt of the three branches; and carries ſeveral mills. The eaſtern branch which is called <hi>Juſtice</hi>'s <hi>River,</hi> has its ſource in the ſouthweſterly part of Leominſter; and taking its courſe, through juſtice's Meadows, which lie on the weſt ſide of Juſtice's Hill, and receiving ſeveral brooks, emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties itſelf into the main ſtream, or <hi>Still River.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the confluence of theſe branches the river takes a ſouthern direction along the weſtern ſide of Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for ſeveral miles, until it enters Boylſton, thence taking a circuitous route through the weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and northerly parts of Boylſton, loſes its name in Naſhaway, or Lancaſter River. On the banks of this river in Sterling there is ſome pitch pine plain, ſome meadow and interval land.</p>
               <p>There is one conſiderable ſtream in the northerly part of the town, which running an eaſterly courſe, empties itſelf into the north branch of Naſhaway.</p>
               <p>There are two conſiderable ponds in Sterling; one lies by the county road to Worceſter; the other, a little to the ſoutheaſt of this: Theſe are divided by a neck of land of about forty rods, in width, at the narroweſt place; through this neck a ſmall ſtream runs, affording a paſſage for the fiſh from one pond to the other. From the weſtern pond iſſues a conſiderable ſtream, ſufficient to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:026481_0300_0FD057B88C562848"/>
a mill, which goes from November to May, but no longer, as the mill pond would flow a large body of meadow. Theſe are called <hi>Wauſhacum Ponds:</hi> They are very deep in ſome places. Each pond, upon the moſt exact computation, is about one mile, and a quarter in diameter. The eaſtern is the largeſt; but the weſtern the moſt pleaſant, on ſeveral accounts; as it is not ſurrounded with hills like the eaſtern; and as it has in it an iſland, containing about half an acre of land, where fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties often repair to regale themſelves with fiſh, which theſe ponds afford in plenty.</p>
               <p>There are two or three things, not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in giving the hiſtory of Sterling: One is, that near the neck of land which divides Wauſhacum Ponds, on the ſouth ſide, was formerly an Indian fort; and near this, there was a place where they buried their dead. The ruins of the fort, and the graves were very diſcernible, until within a few years paſt, when by ploughing the ground thoſe veſtiges of antiquity and barbariſm have diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. On this very ſpot was the palace, and Royal ſeat of Sholan, Sachem of the Naſhaways, and proprietor of Naſhawogg.</p>
               <p>Another thing to be mentioned is this; that about three miles northweſt from the meetinghouſe, on the road leading to Weſtminſter, is a place called <hi>The Indian Fight,</hi> in conſequence of a moſt bloody battle fought there between the Engliſh and Indians, on Auguſt 19th, 1707; the particulars of which we gave in the account of Lancaſter, to which the reader is referred.</p>

                  <pb n="302" facs="unknown:026481_0301_0FD05059905DF8D0"/>A third thing not to be omitted, and a moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Providence indeed, is the burning of the houſe of Mr. Joſiah Wilder of this town in Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 1740; in which conflagration his wife, (preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and near the time for her delivery) with four ſmall children beſides, periſhed; another child, a ſon, the father plucked as a brand out of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The growth of wood in Sterling is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and of the following ſorts, oak of the ſeveral kinds, walnut, cheſnut, on the high lands; and the uſual ſorts in the low lands and ſwamps, as birch, maple, aſh, &amp;c. The white pine timber is chiefly cut off, and there is not much pitch pine remaining, and at this day, but little of the yellow pine.</p>
               <p>We proceed to give ſome account of the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical ſtate of this town.</p>
               <p>The church of Chriſt here, was imbodied on December 19th, 1744, and on the ſame day their firſt miniſter, the Rev. John Mellen, was ordained, who continued with them until December 14th, 1778, when his paſtoral relation to them, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, by mutual agreement. Soon after, the Rev. Mr. Mellen was inſtalled paſtor of the church and people at Hanover, in the county of Plymouth, where he continues to great acceptance. To Mr.
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:026481_0302_0FD057BC8DD3A470"/>
Mellen, ſucceeded in the ſacred work of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, the Rev. Reuben Holcomb, whereunto he was ſolemnly ſeparated on the 2d of June, 1779, and who ſtill continues their paſtor.</p>
               <p>In Sterling died Mr. Sebaſtian Smith, a native of old Spain, on the 24th of March, 1765, in an advanced age. He came young into this country and living a ſingle life, he devoted his conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate to pious and charitable uſes. Several years before his death he gave to the ſociety, a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio Bible, that a portion of the holy ſcriptures might be read, on Lord's days, to the congregation. He gave much to the poor in his life time; and by will alſo: And likewiſe furniſhed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion table, with two ſilver tankards; and gave one hundred pounds ſterling as a fund for ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more indigent children and youth. As ſuch deeds come up as a memorial before God, ſo they ought to be kept in remembrance among men.</p>
               <p>Sterling is diſtant from Boſton, about forty ſix miles, nearly weſt; and from the courthouſe in Worceſter, it is twelve miles a little to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt. At the time of taking the cenſus in 1791, there were in the town 209 dwelling houſes, and 1428 inhabitants.</p>

               <p>ON the 13th of April, 1778, an act paſſed the General Court, incorporating a ſecond pariſh in the ſouth part of Bolton. And on the
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:026481_0303_0FD05799CB320EF0"/>
16th of March, 1784, this precinct was erected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diſtrict by the name of <hi>Berlin,</hi> at which time ſeveral families, with about five hundred acres of land, were added, from the northweſt corner of Marlborough, and annexed to the county of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter. Since that time, a few families have been added to this diſtrict from the ſoutheaſt part of Lancaſter. This diſtrict is inveſted with all the immunities and privileges of a town, excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of ſending a repreſentative to the General Court; but it has the liberty of joining with Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in the annual choice of repreſentatives. Here a church was imbodied, under the direction of an eccleſiaſtical council, by a covenant bearing date April 7th, 1779; and on September 26th, 1781, the Rev. Reuben Puffer was ordained to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral care thereof.</p>
               <p>There is one pond in the eaſt part of the diſtrict, called <hi>Gate</hi>'s <hi>Pond,</hi> nearly a mile in length, and from a quarter to half of a mile in width; it abounds in the uſual pond fiſh; and a good ſand is taken up near its ſhores: No brook empties into it, but at the ſouth end there is a ſmall outlet, which falls into the river <hi>Aſſabet.</hi> There is alſo a large ſwamp, containing many hundred acres, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſtly within this diſtrict: It is a low, ſunken tract of land, but bears, however, ſpruce of a great height, and in ſome parts of it, white pine timber. The moſt valuable uplands are ſeated on ſeveral hills, which afford excellent paſturage and orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arding. Wheat has been raiſed on ſome of them to great advantage. One lies near the above
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:026481_0304_0FD057BD4D6EFED0"/>
named pond, and contains a number of very fine farms. The others are a broken range of hills, which, beginning about a mile ſouth of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe, run weſterly until they meet with North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough hills, then ſtretching in a northern direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cover, with a few interſections, all the weſt and north parts of the diſtrict, and thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue through Bolton and Harvard, to Littleton in the county of Middleſex. A few of the bluff points of theſe high lands have been diſtinguiſhed with arbitrary names, but no name applies to the whole range. The culture of hops has lately been introduced here, and by the experiments already made, bids fair to prove a profitable branch of huſbandry. On the farm of the Hon. Samuel Baker, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in the northerly part of the diſtrict, is found a quarry of moſt valuable ſtone, of a light gray colour, out of which that gentleman has built a handſome, large manſion houſe. Theſe ſtones are remarkable for an excellent quality which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the effects of fire.</p>
               <p>The principal ſtream, and the only one worthy of particular mention, is called <hi>Northbrook</hi>; it is formed of two ſmall ſtreams, from the ſouthweſt, and northweſt which uniting about a mile and an half weſt of the meetinghouſe, afford a convenient ſeat for ſaw and griſt mills, where conſiderable buſineſs is performed. Taking thence a ſoutheaſterly direction, it runs upwards of two miles, through a large and rich interval, and after paſſing through the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt corner of Northborough, where there are alſo mills, it ſoon falls into the river Aſſabet at the
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:026481_0305_0FD0579B5541E118"/>
ſoutheaſt angle of the diſtrict. Northbrook is from two to three rods in width, and of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble depth; and formerly it yielded great quantities of the various ſorts of freſh water fiſh, but they are of late exceedingly diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>The diſtrict conſiſts of ninety two families, of which fourteen are of the ſect called quakers. The latter are moſtly induſtrious, and ſome of them wealthy farmers. The number of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, by the late cenſus, was 512. It lies thirty four miles from Boſton, nearly weſt, and fifteen miles from the courthouſe in Worceſter, to the northeaſt.

               <p>GARDNER is a town which was taken from the towns of Weſtminſter, Templeton, Winchendon and Aſhburnham, and is accordingly bounded by them, in the following manner; by Weſtminſter, on the ſouth and ſoutheaſt; by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton, on the ſouthweſt and weſt; by Winchen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, on the north and northweſt; and by Aſhburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham on the northeaſt.</p>
               <p>It was incorporated, and made a diſtinct town on the 27th of June, 1785. It is not large in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:026481_0306_0FD057BEDCA121D0"/>
its contents being about 14000 acres, but yet capable of making a good and wealthy town; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already 85 dwelling houſes, and 530 inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, according to the late cenſus.</p>
               <p>The church in Gardner was gathered on the 1ſt of February, 1786, and the Rev. Jonathan Oſgood was ordained as paſtor thereof, October 19th, 1791.</p>
               <p>This town was called Gardner to perpetuate the name and memory of the late famous Col. Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Gardner of Cambridge, near Boſton, who was killed in the memorable battle upon Bunker's Hill, in Charleſtown, on the 17th of June 1775, gallantly fighting in defence of the liberty and rights of his country.</p>
               <p>The general face of this town is uneven, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſmall hills and valleys; and though the land be ſomewhat rocky, yet not in general, too much ſo; the ſoil is good, rich, ſtrong and fertile. It produces wheat, rye, Indian corn, barley, oats, flax, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is peculiarly adapted to graſs and paſturage, being naturally moiſt and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſprings, rivulets, ſtreams, brooks and rivers, whereby they can water the lands at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>There is one river, called <hi>Otter River,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See this river more particularly deſcribed in the account of Templeton.</note> running from the ſouth to the north; coming from Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardſton, through a part of Templeton to Gardner, it is ſome way a boundary between Gardner and Templeton, and, in Winchendon, falls into Miller's River. There are ſeveral brooks and ſtreams, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out names, except two; theſe are called Pen Brook, and Spectacle Brook; all the waters run north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:026481_0307_0FD0579DACE86238"/>
and northweſterly, and are finally emptied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Connecticut river. Upon theſe ſeveral ſtreams, and the river beforenamed, there are conſiderable bodies of good meadow land; and a number of ſaw and griſt mills; but no other water works at preſent. There are two large and fine ponds in the town, but without names; theſe have, each of them, ſmall ſtreams running from them. They have here the uſual artificers and traders; and here alſo are potaſh works. The general growth of wood in this place, is ſimilar to that of other new places of like kinds of lands, both high and low, as oak of ſeveral ſorts, birch, rock maple, white and red aſh, hemlock, white pine, and hacma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. There are two county roads leading through the town; the principal one, is that which leads from Connecticut river, through Peterſham, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Templeton, on to Boſton.

               <p>This town is not a very large tract of land; and it does not lie in the moſt regular form; it contains 14396 acres by ſurvey, not being five miles ſquare.</p>

               <p>We ſhall now attempt ſome deſcription of the town of Boylſton.</p>
               <p>It lies in general, high, deſcending to the north, and northeaſt; but the land is not ſo high in the middle, and round about the meetinghouſe, as it is on the eaſt, ſouth and weſt. It is rather hilly, rough and uneven; although there are ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable plains, covered with pitch pine. The hills on the eaſt ſide, adjoining to Northborough, are large and high, and pretty ſteep where the road paſſes; and although there is conſiderable broken land in the town, yet none but what is good for, and well covered with wood, of which there is a plenty. The wood which grows on the high and hard land, is of all the ſorts of oak, ſome walnut, plenty of cheſnut, ſome ſaſſafras; in the ſwamps and ſwales, grow ſome aſh, birch, maple, ſpruce, juniper, ſome white pine and ſome hemlock. The prickly aſh alſo, is a native of this place; it is a buſh or ſhrub, ſeldom growing more than ſix or ſeven feet in height; though it grows in moiſt, yet not in cold land; it poſſeſſes ſome ſingular qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities and virtues, and its bark and ſeeds are highly eſteemed, and much uſed, by Phyſicians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="unknown:026481_0310_0FD057C189A8DAC8"/>The ſoil in this town is generally good, rich and fertile. There are good arable lands; but it is very excellent for orcharding, for paſturage and graſs; and here are ſome of as large and good farmers, as perhaps any where in the county, who keep great ſtocks of cattle. The people raiſe all kinds of country produce, eſpecially beef, pork, grain, butter and cheeſe, vaſtly more than they conſume, and carry more into the market, than perhaps, any other town of its bigneſs and number. The town enjoys a fine healthy air, and the place has been famed for the longevity of its inhabitants. There are really no ſtagnant waters. There are two ponds, but the waters are kept in motion by a current, in conſequence of inlets and outlets. Rocky Pond, ſo denominated from its general ſtony bottom, and more ſtony ſhore, is ſituated in the eaſterly part of the town from whence there is an outlet at the ſouth end, into Cold Harbour Brook, and ſo into the river Aſſabet, in Northbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough. This is a fine pond for all kinds of ſmall fiſh, eſpecially pickerel. It covers about thirty ſix acres of ground as appears from actual ſurvey; and by the dam at the ſouth end, the pond is raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo as to cover thirty acres of meadow. Sewall's Pond, ſo denominated from a family of that name, who owned the lands round it, lies in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt part of Boylſton, towards Worceſter. This is large, covering a hundred acres of land perhaps, or more. It is well ſupplied with all kinds of pond fiſh; there are two rivulets, from ſprings which run into it, from the north and northeaſt;
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:026481_0311_0FD057A08917F508"/>
and at the ſouth is the large outlet, which croſſing the roads to Rutland and Worceſter, in Shrewſbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, falls into Quinſigamond, or Long Pond. There are three ſmall brooks in the town, which originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſprings in Boylſton, run northerly into the ſouth branch of the river Naſhaway. Gates's Brook empties into the river in the weſt part of the town, near to Major Beaman's. Muddy Brook empties in about a mile weſt of the meetinghouſe. On this brook there is a ſaw mill, and a body of meadow. Mill Brook, on which there is alſo a ſaw mill, riſes and falls into the river in the eaſterly part. The great ſouth branch of the river Naſhaway runs through Boylſton from the northweſt, and paſſing ſoutheaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly, till it comes within about a mile of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe, then turns and runs northeaſterly, into Lancaſter. This river is formed by the junction of two large ſtreams or rivers. One comes from the eaſt ſide of Watchuſett mountain, and paſſing through the ſoutherly part of Sterling, and called Still Water River, is, on the road at the bridge, the boundary between Sterling and Boylſton, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſoutheaſterly about a mile in Boylſton, is joined by Quinepoxet Stream, ſo called: This runs from a pond, called Quinepoxet on the ſouth ſide of Princeton, partly in Holden, and running ſoutheaſt in Holden about two miles, turns and runs northeaſt, until it joins Still Water, on the weſt ſide of Boylſton. After the confluence of theſe ſtreams, there are four large bridges, on the river within Boylſton; two of them are good, handſome ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="313" facs="unknown:026481_0312_0FD04FFD39888FB8"/>
weſt ſide of the town, after the two ſtreams unite, there is a ſaw mill; alſo a corn mill with two pair of ſtones; likewiſe a fulling mill, and clothiers' works, where a vaſt deal of buſineſs is performed. In the northeaſt part of the town, on this river, are two corn mills, a ſaw mill, an oil mill, and fulling mill, together with a trip hammer, all cloſe togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Theſe are famous for their conſtruction, and for the work they do.</p>
               <p>On this river, within the town of Boylſton, are large bodies of moſt excellent and rich interval lands, to the number of 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>00 acres; about 1000 in one body. On theſe lands the people raiſe vaſt quantities of Indian corn, flax, and ſome hemp, beſides the immenſe quantities of hay and feed they yield. The wood yet remaining on theſe lands is butternut, buttonwood, ſhagbark, ſome aſh and maple.</p>
               <p>There is a ſmall eminence a little ſouthweſt from the meetinghouſe, which overlooks all the high lands in the town, called Diamond Hill, from the great number of ſtones upon it which look like diamonds, and with which they have actually cut glaſs; and which might be of uſe and importance if properly attended to. There are, in ſeveral parts of the town, large quarries of ſtone which are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dug up, and many of them ſplit, of all ſhapes, ſizes, and lengths; they have excellent faces, for underpinning to houſes, and for door ſtones, and ſteps, but they are too hard to admit of being much wrought upon. Many of them are of a great length, and far ſuperior to any hewed ſtones. It was
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:026481_0313_0FD057A2082DEEE0"/>
both pleaſing and aſtoniſhing to ſee the collection of theſe ſtones, in their natural ſhapes, which they collected for the underpinning of the new meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe they have lately erected.</p>
               <p>Manufactories they have none, except of potaſh. Roads they have two or three called county roads of conſiderable travel, leading to Worceſter, to Providence, and alſo to the Boſton market. The people ſubſiſt chiefly by farming; and many of them are become very wealthy indeed. It may be ſtyled a rich town, for they are not only clear of debt, but have ſeveral hundreds of pounds in their treaſury, which, with proper management, would, in a few years, produce an adequate fund for the ſupport of a publick teacher of piety, religion and morality. And if they continue united and peaceable, they will ſoon vie with the town from whence they were taken; nay, they would ſoon equal almoſt any of the towns in the county. There are 150 families in the place; and when the cenſus was taken, there were 840 inhabitants, A ſocial library has lately been eſtabliſhed here. It is in its infancy; but bids fair to be ſomething conſiderable in a little time. Upon the whole, if this be not ſo pleaſant a place as ſome others, the people are induſtrious and proſperous, and there are ſure indications of wealth and independence among them; and they may be happy if it be not their own fault.</p>

There is an eminence on this hill which overlooks all the high lands for many miles round: And from hence are ſeen in a clear air, without the help of glaſſes, the meetinghouſes in eight or nine different towns. On this hill, there are many noble farms. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this town except the uſual mechanicks, ſubſiſt by farming, and the lands richly repay their labour.

in this hiſtory. In order to give full ſatisfaction upon this ſubject, the following account muſt be ſubjoined. The ſettlement of the line of juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut, though divers times attempted, was never fully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted until the year 1713. As early as the year 1636, the firſt ſettlers upon Connecticut river re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from Maſſachuſetts, and took poſſeſſion of the country upon, and near the river on both ſides, from Springfield as low as Wethersfield, incluſive of both, and managed their affairs by virtue of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the General Court of Maſſachuſetts. However, theſe lands were claimed by the patentees of Connecticut. But, in 1638, the inhabitants of Springfield (which included what was afterwards called Suffield, below on one ſide the river, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field on the other ſide) having no doubt they were within the limits of the Maſſachuſetts patent, petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the General Court that they might be ſeparated from the other towns below, and be received and continued as part of the colony, which was granted, and juriſdiction exerciſed accordingly. In the year 1642, by order of the General Court, two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Woodward and Saffery run the then prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince line. This line ſeems to have been, for ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral years, acquieſced in. And in 1662, Mr. Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>throp obtained from king Charles II, a charter for the colonies of Connecticut and Newhaven unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the north line whereof is intended to be the ſame with the ſouth line of Maſſachuſetts. From this time, until after the incorporation of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts by a new charter in 1691, we hear nothing
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:026481_0318_0FD057C6CA6D9610"/>
about bounds. In the year 1686, many of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Roxbury pitched upon a tract of land to ſettle upon, which was bounded on the ſouth by Woodward and Saffery's line, and it was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by the Maſſachuſetts government, and took the name of Woodſtock. After the new char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Connecticut made a more ſerious affair of what was called the Maſſachuſetts encroachments. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter various unſucceſsful attempts to compromiſe this matter, commiſſions paſſed the ſeals of each government with ample powers to ſettle the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. The Maſſachuſetts were intent upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the property to ſuch perſons to whom they had granted lands and the juriſdiction of thoſe towns which had been ſettled by them. Suffield, Enfield and Woodſtock were the only towns which could be affected. Connecticut was alſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that part of the town of Simſbury, which had been ſettled by that government, might fall within the Maſſachuſetts. It was therefore ſettled as a preliminary, that the towns ſhould remain to the governments by which they had been ſettled, and the property of as many acres, as ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon a balance to have been gained by one government from the other, ſhould be conveyed out of other unimproved lands as a ſatisfaction or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent; only, as there were about two miles which Windſor claimed upon the town of Suffield, there having been a long conteſt between theſe two towns concerning the validity of the reſpective grants, it was agreed thoſe two miles ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Connecticut if they fell within their line.</p>

               <p>"It appeared, by the report of the commiſſioners, that 107,793 acres of land were due from the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, who accordingly made a grant thereof to Connecticut.

               <p>The foregoing account is given upon the author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and, chiefly, in the words of Governor Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in his Hiſtory of Maſſachuſetts.</p>
               <p>The lands granted to Connecticut were what are now called Pelham, Belchertown, &amp;c. in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Hampſhire.</p>
               <p>Though the lands were granted to Connecticut, the juriſdiction thereof was to remain to Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts.</p>
               <p>After this equitable and amicable ſettlement in 1713, Suffield and Enfield, in the county of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and Woodſtock, in the county of Worceſter, were conſidered as belonging to Maſſachuſetts, were taxed by, and paid their taxes to this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and ſent repreſentatives to our legiſlature until the year 1748, when they revolted, and their repreſentatives were, by a bare majority, admitted to ſeats in the General Aſſembly of Connecticut.

when this Commonwealth ceaſed to claim them.</p>
               <p>The lands of theſe three towns, undoubtedly, fell within Connecticut patent; and Maſſachuſetts had no right to grant them away: Yet, after ſo fair and equitable an agreement as was made between the two then colonies, and actual ſatisfaction made by Maſſachuſetts to Connecticut, it may be queſtioned, whether the inhabitants of thoſe towns acted gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly and fairly in revolting, or the colony act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed honourably in receiving them. Be theſe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions anſwered as they may, by their revolt the line between the two States is now a ſtraight line, running due weſt, from the northweſt corner of Rhodeiſland, until it meets Newyork State line.— Thus ends the hiſtory of Woodſtock.</p>

The other ſource is a pond in Aſhburnham, called Naukheag. Theſe two branches, with various ſtreams and rivulets from the adjacent country, which fall into them, unite in the northeaſterly part of Winchendon, and form Miller's River, which runs an almoſt weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſe through the ſoutheaſterly part of Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, Athol, and between Wendell and Erving's land, and falls into Connecticut River between the towns of Northfield and Montague. Part of the waters of Aſhburnham, Templeton and Gerry, and all of Gardner, Winchendon, Royalſton and Athol, paſs into this river. It is a large and beautiful ſtream, though in ſome places very rapid. This Mrs. Rowlandſon croſſed while a captive with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. In her narrative ſhe calls it <hi>Bayquage River.</hi> By a late act of cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a number of gentlemen are made a body corporate, for the purpoſe of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bridge over this river near its mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="unknown:026481_0322_0FD057C9C7CD73A8"/>In the next place, a large branch of Souheagan River originates in Aſhburnham; this runs north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſterly through Aſhby, at the northweſt angle of the county of Middleſex; then into Newipſwich in the State of Newhampſhire, through Maſon, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſt, and between the towns of Merrimack and Litchfield is emptied into Merrimack River. This is a large ſtream, having its waters continually augmenting, by various ſtreams, before it falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the river Merrimack.</p>
               <p>The third in our courſe is the river <hi>Naſhaway.</hi> This is formed by the junction of two main branches. The north branch comes, partly, by a ſtream from ſprings in Aſhburnham, and runs ſoutheaſterly into Fitchburg; and, partly, from Watchuſett Pond on the north ſide of that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which ſtream runs northerly, through the eaſterly part of Weſtminſter, into Fitchburg, and there unites with the ſtream from Aſhburnham; then turns and runs ſoutheaſterly through Leom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſter into the middle of the town of Lancaſter within a few rods of the meetinghouſe. The ſouth branch of the Naſhaway is alſo compoſed of two ſtreams: One from the eaſt ſide of Watchuſett Mountain runs ſoutheaſterly, through the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſterly part of Sterling, into the edge of Boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton; this is called Still River. The other comes from Quinepoxet Pond, partly in Holden, and runs northeaſterly into Boylſton, and uniting with Still River, on the weſterly ſide of Boylſton, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the ſouth branch of Naſhaway. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues an eaſterly courſe until it comes within a
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:026481_0323_0FD057AA4BC7BF40"/>
mile and a half of Boylſton meetinghouſe; then it takes a northeaſterly direction, through the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly part of Lancaſter, and there, in about half a mile eaſt of the meetinghouſe, forms a junction with the north branch. After the confluence of theſe two main branches, the river Naſhaway runs northeaſterly, between Lancaſter and Harvard, and between Harvard and Shirley, into Groton and Pepperell in the county of Middleſex, then into Hollis, in the State of Newhampſhire, and through Dunſtable, and there falls into the river Merrimack. Naſhaway is the largeſt and fineſt river which originates in the county of Worceſter, and has the moſt rich and valuable interval and meadow lands upon its borders.</p>
               <p>The next river we ſhall deſcribe is <hi>Ware River</hi>; this originates in Gerry from a pond, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eaſterly into Templeton, joins another ſtream, and runs ſouth into Hubbardſton, from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Barre; and then it becomes a boundary between Hardwick and Newbraintree, and receiving Swift River from Peterſham, it paſſes through the towns of Ware and Belchertown, and Kingſton, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Quaboag River, which comes from Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, it thence takes the name of Chicabee, and falls into Connecticut River in the north part of the town of Springfield. The waters of Gerry, part of the waters of Templeton and Princeton, all the waters of Hubbardſton and Peterſham; of Barre and Newbraintree; part of the waters of Rutland, Paxton, Leiceſter and Spencer; and all
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:026481_0324_0FD057CB4736D128"/>
of Brookfield, are emptied into Connecticut River, in the town of Springfield.</p>
               <p>The river Quinebaug riſes in the town of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, in the county of Hampſhire, and runs eaſt into the county of Worceſter, through Sturbridge and Charlton, and then, ſoutheaſt, through the weſterly part of Dudley, and ſo on into the State of Connecticut, where it joins French River.</p>
               <p>French River has its principal ſource in Holden, and runs ſoutherly through Worceſter and Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and the eaſterly part of Dudley, then paſſes into the State of Connecticut, through Killingſley, Pomfret, Canterbury to Norwich, where joining other rivers, it takes the name of Thames River, and falls into the ſea, or Longiſland Sound, at Newlondon. Hence, the waters of Sturbridge, Charlton, Dudley, Oxford, and part of the waters of Holden, Worceſter, Leiceſter, and Spencer, are emptied into the ſea at Newlondon.</p>
               <p>Blackſtone River riſes in the town of Sutton, and firſt runs northweſt through Ward into Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and takes in various ſtreams and rivulets in its courſe, then it turns and runs ſoutheaſt, and receiving the river which comes from Shrewſbury Long Pond, it paſſes through Grafton, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge and Uxbridge, into Rhodeiſland State, where with its various acceſſions of Swift River, Weſt River, and Mumford's River, it takes the name of Pawtucket, or Narraganſett River, and paſſes to Providence. All the waters of Sutton, Ward, Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs, Northbridge, Uxbridge, Upton, and part of the waters of Worceſter, Shrewſbury, Milford
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:026481_0325_0FD057AC9BE910B8"/>
Mendon and Grafton, paſs to Providence, and ſo on to the ſea below Rhodeiſland.</p>
               <p>The river Aſſabet has its ſource in Grafton, and running acroſs the northweſt angle of Weſtbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, enters Northborough in the ſouthweſt part of the town, and running about half of a mile eaſt of the meetinghouſe, paſſes off through the northweſt angle of Marlborough, and running through the ſoutheaſterly part of Stow, and the ſouth part of Action it enters the weſterly part of Concord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving various ſtreams and rivulets in its progreſs, and there is called the north branch of Concord River. All the waters of Northborough, and part of thoſe of Grafton and Weſtborough, and of Shrewſbury, Boylſton and Berlin, paſs in this riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Aſſabet. The ſouth branch, or Sudbury River, riſes from a pond, and a large Cedar Swamp, in the ſoutheaſt part of Weſtborough, runs into Hopkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, is the boundary between Southborough and Hopkinton, then paſſes through the middle of the town of Framingham into Sudbury, and ſo to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, running a northeaſterly courſe, and about one mile northweſt from Concord meetinghouſe, joins the north branch, then taking the name of Concord River, it paſſes through the northweſt part of Bedford, and through the town of Billeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, about half of a mile weſt from the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and between Chelmsford and Tewkſbury, falls into the river Merrimack. On the north ſide of Merrimack, are part of Tyngſborough, the towns of Dracut, Methuen, Haverhill, Almſbury, and Saliſbury: On the ſouth ſide, are the other part
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:026481_0326_0FD057CE1E1F6D00"/>
of Tyngſborough, and the towns of Chelmsford, Tewkſbury, Andover, Bradford, Newbury and Newburyport, where this river falls into the ſea.</p>
               <p>Charles's River has its proper ſource in Hopkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and runs ſouth into Milford and Mendon, then turning, runs ſoutheaſt, through a part of Bellingham, then takes a northeaſterly courſe through the other part of Bellingha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and is the boundary between Franklin and Medway, as alſo between Medfield and Sherburne, and then paſſes through Natick and Needham, and between Weſton and Waltham, on the north, and Newtown on the ſouth; it alſo runs through Watertown, about half of a mile ſouth of the meetinghouſe, then into Cambridge, about half of a mile ſouth of the College, and ſeparating Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury from Cambridge, and Boſton from Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, it falls into the ſea in Boſton harbor. Thus all the waters of the county fall into the rivers Merrimack, Connecticut, Newlondon, Providence and Charles's River. The height of land is in the towns of Aſhburnham, Weſtminſter, Princeton, Holden, Paxton, Leiceſter, Spencer and Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge; on the weſt of theſe towns, all the water runs into Connecticut River only. In Aſhburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham the water runs three ways, weſt, northeaſt, and ſoutheaſt: In Weſtminſter and Princeton the water runs eaſt and weſt; from Shrewſbury and Grafton, the water runs to Providence and Merrimack Rivers; very little paſſes out of this county into Charles's River.</p>
