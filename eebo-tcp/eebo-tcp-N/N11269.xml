            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF we were to credit the complaints of the faction at Boſton, we muſt think them the moſt oppreſſed people in the world; if we were to judge of them from their own behaviour, we muſt believe them the moſt factious and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſubjects in the univerſe. They and their Agents loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that they are a PACEABLE PIOUS and LOYAL people: but their tranſactions impreſs upon us no other idea than that of a people in an open ſtate of rebellion. The praiſe with which they bedaub themſelves is, undoubtedly, a ſtrong proof of their modeſty; and the outrageous abuſe they throw out againſt Government, is a ſtricking inſtance of their good temper, good ſenſe, and moderation. It ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot be deemed unfair or unjuſt to compare their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and their actions together: By their PROFESSIONS we ſhall be able to determine what ſort of folks they would wiſh us to believe them to be; by their ACTIONS we ſhall be convinced what kind of people they really are.</p>
            <p>The Boſton Faction, or more properly Doctor Franklin's Faction at Boſton, have profeſſed themſelves to be of a PACE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ABLE and QUIET SPIRIT, and to act always according to Law. As a proof of this declaration, they pulled down and plundered the Lieutenant Governor's houſe, broke open the Secretary's houſe, and demoliſhed the Stamp and Admiralty Offices. Notwithſtanding this evidence againſt them, they ſtill averred that they were influenced ſolely by the ſpirit of Law, and the ſpirit of Meekneſs, and that all the miſchief committed amongſt them was done by Boys and Negroes.

               </gap>y deny it.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now give an example of Boſtonian PIETY. Boſton Smugglers are far above lurking on the coaſt, and running their goods clandeſtinely. Under the cheriſhing wings of the Faction, they boldly puſh along-ſide the wharfs, walk deliberately to the Cuſtom houſe. TAKE THE NECES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SARY OATHS with the utmoſt compoſure and unlade their cargoes: If any Officers of the Revenue attempt to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere, the whole Board of Commiſſioners, Collectors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers, and Inſpectors, all are knocked down, or driven put of town. Upon this they affirm, that as theſe Officers have abdicated, as they call i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, they have no right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and that all their buſineſs ſeemed to be to diſturb the peace and quiet of the town. The pious Boſtonian derives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is right of cheating the Revenue, and of perjuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from the example of his fathers and the rights of nature.</p>
            <p>As to their loyalty their continued oppoſition to acts of Parliament afford full conviction of it. Beſides, when troops were ſent to protect the King's Officers in the execution of the Laws, they publiſhed and diſperſed over a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Inſtead of the deſperate oppoſition they had ſo often threatened, they had recourſe to the WAR OF WORDS; in News-Papers, under the direction of the Faction, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Soldiers were reviled in the moſt oppr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>brious language; it was ſaid they were only ſent to vex and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs them, and to contaminate their morals. The Officers laughed at all the abuſe thrown out againſt them, and kept the troops quiet. This good order diſappointed the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they wanted to excite the Soldiers to ſome outrage, in order to around a pretence for their removal. Finding rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ineffectual, they proceeded to perſonal inſults and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal attack; when an Officer or Soldier was met with at night, he ſeldom eſcaped without very barbarous treatment. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> difficult to diſcover the offenders, and if diſcovered, the influence of the Faction preſerved them from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Several inſtances of this occurred; when ſome of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:014255_0004_0F9358CF63E7E118"/>
theſe Boſton Rioters were apprehended, numbers of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer witneſſes offered themſelves, and always ſwore that the Soldiers were the aggreſſors From trials of this kind in which they always met with impunity, they advanced to inſults and aſſults in open day, urged on by a notion that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>roops would not fire upon them without the orders of a Magiſtrate; and they all knew, that, let them act ever ſo outrageouſly no Magiſtrate would proceed to ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, many of them being of the Faction, and the reſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated by the weakneſs of Government. Urged on by this notion, they thought it would be an eaſy matter to diſarm the Soldiers, and turn them out of town. They began their operations by a concerted attack on the Centinel at the Cuſtom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Houſe; the Soldier, when almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered, made a ſignal to the main guard; the Captain of the guard marched with a few men to his reſcue; but the Faction continuing the assault with redoubled violence, and ſome of the Soldiers being knocked down, and their muſkets nearly wreſted from them, fired, and killed and wounded ſome of the Rioters.</p>
            <p>The conſequence of this inſurrection was, that the troops were, by ſome <hi>very deep ſcheme</hi> of politics, ordered down to Caſtle Iſland, and the Laws and Officers of the Revenue left to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Since the above period, the Faction have kept the town in a continued ſtate of diſorder, confuſion, and riot. By a variety of artifices, they have gained the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives.

their intereſted deſigns. The act lowering the duty on the tea from England, contained in itſelf a powerful reaſon for their oppoſing it. The bringing tea cheap from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, would have at once annihilated their exorbitant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits While importation of tea from England was interdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Almighty Boſton Committee, that very conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Committee ſold their own ſmuggled ſtuff at the very moderate profit of <hi>cent per cent.</hi> From this true ſtate of the caſe, the deſtruction of the Eaſt India Company's tea is not ſurpriſing. It arrived in a town where the laws had no force, where they were even condemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d; where the faction had repeatedly declared to all the world that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed England and her Acts of Parliament; in a town from whence they had baniſhed his Majeſty's Civil Officers with every mark of contumely; from whence even his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's troops had been diſmiſſed with diſgrace; where no Magiſtrate durſt appear but on the ſide of faction; where thoſe who did appear were themſelves the faction, abetted by the Repreſentatives and the Council. In ſuch a ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is not to be wondered at, that the faction finding themſelves omnipotent at Boſton, committed that daring act of inſolence and rebellion.</p>

               </gap>l the above enumerated outrages and rebellions, are, what the Faction at Boſton call ENGLISH LIBERTIES<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which they have often as fooliſhly as impudently declared, they would die in defending.

            <p>I think at the concluſion of the laſt peace, we found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves loaded with an enormous debt of <hi>One Hundred and Forty Millions;</hi> one half of which we contracted in protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and defending America<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now to pay the intereſt of it, we all are, from Beggars to Peers annually taxed Yet they poſitively aſſert, that they have always been at the charge of their own eſtabliſhments, and that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways protected and defended themſelves and that we never were at any expence on their account And all this we muſt ſwallow without a wry face, upon their ſingle <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe their GREAT MEN, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Their doctrine is both ingenious and convincing.

            <p>They too have found out a NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS. A Mr. Rome goes over to America to collect £50 000 ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Houſe in London. The Judges there, in league with the debtors, render his errand abortive. He complains of this in a letter to a friend.

            <p>Another Houſe in London ſent him powers to demand £.26 000 of debts long due to them; but when he conſulted his lawyer, he received the following ſhort advice, <q>Not to put himſelf to any expence, until Parliament had made a proper alteration in their government.</q> Will not this convince the Engliſh merchant, that the American Judges ſhould be rendered independent of the people? and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of London would have done a much wiſer act four years ago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if inſtead of petitioning parliament to take off <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Taxes,</hi> they had implored Parliament to REFORM AMERICAN CHARTERS.</p>
            <p>The late bankruptcy of the oldeſt and moſt conſiderable American Houſes in Briſtol, and perhaps in England, is the melancholy effects of American outſtanding debts.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh merchants have but dreary preſpects from the other ſide of the Atlantic; they know that every veſſel from that quarter brings a renewal of diſappointments, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of promiſes, which latter never will be fulfilled Their caſe is affecting but it was not unforeſeen nor unforetold; ſeveral years ago they were warned publicly and repeatedly of the ruinous ſtate of American credit. They were told; that the MILLIONS which this generous kingdom laviſhed laſt war on the wilds of America, had raiſed pedlars and ploughmen to the rank of merchants; that this ſudden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of wealth had turned the heads of theſe dunghill traders;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014255_0008_0F9358D3170D8CE0"/>
that a few years of peace had reduced theſe muſhroom mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to their primitive inſignificancy; that the Americans were over ſtocked with Engliſh goods; that the Engliſh merchants might be convinced of it from looking into their public prints, from the daily auctions advertiſed in every quarter of every great town on that continent; that moſt of thoſe who now traded on credit were either faſt declining, or raw ſtriplings juſt out of their apprenticeſhip; that Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can commerce, which had overflowed ſo extenſively, was now reverting faſt back to the more contracted channel in which it had glided before the war; therefore that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh merchants ſhould be cautious who they credited. But experience is the beſt teacher. And sorry I am to ſay it, that the banks of the Ohio and Miſſiſippi will be cultivated at the expence of the Engliſh merchants, and with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of unpaid Engliſh goods.</p>
            <p>What an unhappy deluſion have we laboured under for near two centuries! How many millions have we ſpent in the cauſe of an ungrateful people! And has not the blood of our brav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt men ſtreamed through all their continent, from the icy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

No, he will never forget them; neither, while memory laſts, will he forget American gratitude!</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a worſe than Egyptian bondage; it is even unſafe to be neutral. One muſt either take an active part in all the rebellious meetings and actions of the faction, or at leaſt ſeem to countenance them, otherwiſe he is branded as an enemy to the country, and his effects, perſon, and family, in danger of being ſacrificed. Indeed the moſt loyal of us are convinced, by what we have already ſeen, and by the riſk, we have already run, that it is better for us ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to coincide with the faction, than to be tarred and feathered, to have our houſes pulled down, our goods plundered, and ourſelves and our families totally ruined. This terrifying ſituation has ariſen from parliament taking up our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſeriouſly, and then dropping them after a few ineffectual reſolves.</p>
               <p>It is to be ſure time for us to be quiet; for after ſeeing the factious ſmugglers ſurpriſe and burn his Majeſty's ſhips, deſtroy the Eaſt India Tea, and not only deny, but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the authority of parliament with impunity, we have no choice left.</p>
               <p>I am loſt in amazement, and can hardly form a rational conjecture, why parliament ſhould overlook ſo many fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant inſurrections. Here it has had a very unhappy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: we are preſumptuous, becauſe we think we are ſafe. The inattention of parliament has made the faction arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and inſolent beyond all bounds. The recent deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tea may convince all the world of it; and yet according to cuſtom, after the commiſſion of any miſchief, they are now dreadfully frightened. But I make no doubt they will receive the uſual comforting letters from their agents in London, that their friends are increaſing, and that they have nothing to fear from the miniſtry or the parliament. Indeed if parliament allows us to go on as we have done for ſome years paſt, his Majeſty will not have one real ſubject in theſe colonies, for the faction will force every perſon to join and act with them, and what is ſtrange, I have ſeen ſome of theſe preſſed men become more violent and turbulent than the veterans of the faction.</p>
               <p>The Moderator of one of the Town meetings about the time the tea was deſtroyed, was called a Tory ſome years ago, and in ſuch diſrepute with the faction, that when his houſe was on fire, the Liberty Boys ſwore that he and it might burn together, if it was not for the danger the reſt of the town would be in. Now is he ſet at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

no doubt of his kinſman Dr. Franklin. At preſent the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs of the lower people is almoſt inſufferable: If you employ a tradeſman he will at leaſt charge you double, and you dare not complain for fear of having your windows broke, and yourſelf inſulted and pelted in the ſtreets as an enemy to the country. In ſhort, a perſon who inliſts with the faction, though formerly a Tory, a knave, or an Atheiſt, inſtantly becomes a Whig, an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man, and a Saint. Faction here, as well as with you in London, covers all ſins. One of our moſt bawling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues and voluminus writers is a crazy Doctor, whom ſome years ago they were going to baniſh out of Town for profeſſing himſelf an Athieſt.</p>
               <p>But the principle man amongſt them was once our Tax Gatherer, and ſpent about two thouſand pounds lawful money belonging to the Town; but he was forgiven this and made repreſentative, and clerk to the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, on account of his ſeditious writings. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great patriot not long ago brought milk into Town to sell. From theſe ſpecimens you may judge what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled fellows and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I am not ſurpriſed that their Agents ſhould write ſuch accounts from London as they know will be agreeable, without regarding the conformity of them to truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are paid for it. But that ſuch a man as Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, one who was ſo univerſally deſpiſed and ridiculed while our Governor, ſhould contribute his mite to keep up the fire of rebellion, is to me incomprehenſible. It is conjectured here that he wants to come out again Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, but if they were weak enough to appoint him at home, he would find little comfort or caſe here, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his vanity may induce him to think. Our Faction on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes a tool of him, and whatever encouragement their letters may give him he would be thoroughly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to hear the fooliſh dirty anecdotes that are given of him here. In the pamphlet incloſed, intitled <hi>The Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Sir Thomas Brazen,</hi> you will find ſome account of him. When he was ordered home he prevailed upon the Houſe of Repreſentatives (who then were ready enough to vote what did not belong to them) to compliment him with the Province ſhip of war to carry him to England, but the body of Merchants to whom the veſſel belonged.

               <p>I ſhall be much obliged to you, if you will let me know by the firſt opportunity, if Parliament are likely to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for us. If the many inſurrections and rebellions amongſt us, for theſe laſt nine years, do not work a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and amendment in our Charter this winter, thoſe who have hitherto reſpected the mother country will be forced, for their own ſafety, to join the faction, or to fly the province.</p>

            <p>THE Americans and their advocates would wiſh to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people of England that they are not under the controul of Parliament, nor bound in duty to obey its Acts. Under the ſpecious pretext of combating againſt ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, a pretext which has a ſingular effect on Engliſhmen, they imagine we will always continue blind to our own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and to their inſidious deſigns.</p>
            <p>The reaſons they give to prove themſelves an independent people, are founded on the moſt extravagant and impudent abſurdities. According to them, <q>the Laws of England do not reach America.</q> This extraordinary doctrine ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly needs a refutation; its weakneſs and want of ſolidity is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident without inveſtigation. An Engliſhman leaves Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and ſettles in North America, a country diſcovered by an Engliſhman, and appertaining to the crown of England, and therefore American logic places him out of the line of our legiſlature.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver this ſeriouſly, is either folly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, or madneſs. An inhabitant of Middleſex by mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Iſle of Man or the iſlands of Scilly might, with as good authority, declare himſelf out of the dominions of England.</p>
            <p>But let us grant them their aſſertion: If Americans are not of this kingdom, why do they claim the priviledges of Engliſhmen? why do they claim the protection of England? Why have they put this kingdom to the expence of ſo many MILLIONS to defend them? But I ſuppoſe, when they reſorted to this defence againſt taxation it was the firſt that occurred to them, and they did not reflect on the objections
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014255_0012_0F9358D78115D500"/>
that might be raiſed againſt it; and they alſo ſurely forgot that old maxim of Law, Reaſon, and Juſtice, quoted by their own dearly beloved Farmer, the celebrated Mr Dick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon, one of their greateſt Champions,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Qui ſentit commodum, ſentire debet et onus.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>They who feel the benefit, ought to feel the burthen.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Driven from one idle appeal, they are accuſtomed to ſet up another; they ſay <q>they cannot be legally taxed by the Britiſh Legiſlature, becauſe they are not repreſented in the Britiſh Parliament; for that taxation and repreſentation cannot be ſeparated</q> This has been often refuted The large manufacturing towns of Mancheſter, Brimigham, Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and the millions of people in the kingdom who have no votes in the election of members, are unanſwerable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt this aſſertion.</p>
            <p>Their next ſilly defence is, <q>that Government ought to make a requiſition of a ſtipulated ſum, and their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies would grant it if they were able and thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to their ability, we know and have ſeen the common porters in that country, living, as to all kinds of proviſions, much more luxuriouſly than the firſt merchants here; and as to the higher orders among them, they enjoy the preſent moment, leaving futurity to care for itſelf. Their having large families does not furniſh them with reflection; they ſwim along thoughtleſs, with the tide of faſhion, in profuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and gaiety, abandoning their offspring to providence and the fertility of the ſoil. This is the reaſon that ſo many of them die inſolvent, and that ſo many heavy debts remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid to the Engliſh merchants. Now if taxes were raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them equivalent to their incomes in trade, it would have the happy effect of rendering them more punctual, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, and induſtrious.</p>
            <p>As to expediency, it has been tried, and they did not think it even expedient to ſend us an anſwer. Though the circumſtance of the Mother Country applying to all her dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent petty colonies is rather humiliating and diſgraceful, yet even this has been done. The reſult is too well known to be denied. The Colony Agents were acquainted by Mr. Greenville, <q>that a revenue would be required from them to defray the expences of their protection</q> The Houſe of Commons to forward this juſt and reaſonable meaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, "That a ſtamp duty might be neceſſary." Mr. Greenville earneſtly recommended to the Colonies the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grants by their own aſſemblies; or if they diſliked ſtamp
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014255_0013_0F9358D9712B2880"/>
duties, to propoſe any other effectual made of raiſing money, and carry it into execution themſelves; but all in vain. The Colonies raiſed no fund among themſelves, they made no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, no grant, nor laid any tax. Parliament therefore paſſed the ſtamp act next year.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of the altercations and complaints concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this act, the Americans held forth upon every occaſion, the doctrine, <q>that repreſentation and taxation ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company each other:</q> Upon this ſeveral hints were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that even on that ground any propoſals would be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and candidly attended to. Then they flew from their own clamourous exception, and ſhamefully declared, <q>that their local ſituation effectually debarred them from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation in the Britiſh Parliament;</q> and their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adherents, both at home and abroad, moſt vociferouſly and violently declaimed againſt the abſurdity of the idea, though they themſelves were the very firſt people that ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and enforced that idea.</p>
            <p>To purſue them through all their incoherences, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, tergiverſations, and complaints, is mere children's play. Their firſt declaration is, that they are not Engliſh ſubjects; when this is diſproved, then they agree that they are Engliſh ſubjects but that they ought not to be taxed. When it is urged, why do they claim the benefit and reject the burthen? Becauſe, they ſay, they are not repreſented. When repreſentation is held forth to them.—Oh, then their locality is an inſuperable hindrance; but when England wants money from them, a requiſition ſhould be made to their Aſſemblies. A requiſition was made by Mr. Greenville and they did not grant a ſhilling; and the whole empire was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed and diſguſted with their ſcurrilous complaints, their vainglorious threatenings, and their mean oſtentatious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>-applauſe Like a termagant woman they thought to gain their point, from their inceſſant clamour and raving. Indeed ſo ridiculous are their aſſertions and their claims, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation would not be neceſſary, but for the credulity of ſome good people, who think that they muſt be aggrieved becauſe they complain.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the Americans do not doubt either the right or power or juſtice of England in taxing them; they are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſcious of all theſe things in their own minds, and will often confeſs them in private, though they deny them in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. Their aim is, to keep their money and their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

In reply to this confeſſion, their duty and gratitude to the Mother Country, and a regard to their own peace, were urged; but our merchant ſaid laughingly, they were all very well agreed to keep their money, and to make the moſt of their preſent advantages in trade, as long as they poſſibly could and that they would not ſubmit till they were forced; in the mean time ſome commotions might ariſe in Europe, or ſome diſturbances in England, or their friends might come into the miniſtry, either of which would ocaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſcountenance of the taxation ſcheme; that there were many chances in their favour, if they ſtrenuouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in oppoſition; but if they once acquieſced, they could never renew the ſtruggle with any proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>

IT is thought that Dr. Franklin's new Colony Grant has not yet gone through all the neceſſary forms of office, and if that is the eaſe, and it ſhould ſtick in the paſſage, ſo much the better for Britain; we have already more Colonies than we can manage; ſhould the Grant be cancelled, this art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcheme of the Doctor's to accelerate the independency of his beloved country, we hope will never be brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward again. As to this Colony in idea, it is ſo happily ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated as to be totally out of the reach of Britain, and if we ſhould be ſo very good natured as to credit our Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to people ſettled there, it would be hardly poſſible to ſend them to this American Paradiſe, but at an expence ten times exceeding the original value. Their abſtracted ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in this new world, would neceſſarily impel them to manufacture for themſelves, and they would afford an aſylum for every vagrant and runaway from the other Colonies. Was a man in debt, he might ſell off his ſtock and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber over the American Alps with the money in his pocket, and there he would be nearly as ſafe from his creditors in England a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It was lately aſſerted in a morning paper, that his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was now fully convinced of Dr. Franklin's innocency.

            <p>This poor man having retreated to the upper floor of the houſe he had taken ſhelter in, was followed by the mob and ſeized; a rope was fixed round him, and he was lowered out of the garret window to the riotous multitude below, then ſtript naked, annointed with tar, covered over with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and placed in a cart, in which he was driven through the principal ſtreets of the town, and after that a mile out of town to the gallows, to which he was tied, cruelly beat and whipt. When the man was almoſt expiring, it being the middle of the Winter, they carted him back again, and left him in the ſtreet to the mercy of whoever chuſed to take care of him.</p>
            <p>This attrocious deed, barbarous as it is, is far from being uncommon at Boſton. That seditious town has been in the very ſame diſorder for theſe laſt <hi>ten</hi> years.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014255_0017_0F9358E38D0FAC78"/>
arrival of the tea: of a petition of the conſignees to the council of the Maſſachuſett's, praying <q>that they and their property might be taken under their protection,</q> with the abſolute denial of the council (obſerve, of his Majeſty's Council) to afford the leaſt ſupport or aſſiſtance, or even a promiſe of it; of notes from the India Houſe; of letters from the Admiral commanding in Boſton harbour, and from Lieutenant Colonel Leſlie, of the 64th regiment, in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks at Caſtle William; of a proclamation of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's againſt the factious meetings of the inhabitants, which they treated with ineffable contempt; of copies of <hi>treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> papers printed in America; of a copy of the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Maſſachuſett's council, condemning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the tea, and adviſing legal proſecutions againſt the perpetrators, which they well knew no perſon would dare to carry on, and expreſſing their own abhorrence of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable dead, although they would not take any previous ſtep to prevent it, even when petitioned for that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>So far relative to the MASSACHUSETT's.</p>
            <p>The papers written and printed from the other Colonies are exactly of the ſame nature. They are the regular of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial informations of the different Governors tranſmitted to the American Secretary of State, with copies of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory fugitive Papers, Hand Bills, Alarms, Reſolves of Town Meetings, and Minutes of Council. In ſhort, the whole budget of abuſe that has been vented againſt Parliament and the miniſtry from New England to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolinas, was read to themſelves on Saturday laſt.</p>
            <p>As there was no outrage committed but at Boſton, it would be ſuperfluous to narrate all the incendiary ſcribbling and printing in the different Colonies; it may ſuffice juſt to obſerve, that all the printed bills read were fully larded with the phraſes of "deſperate plans of deſpotiſm," "mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial deſigns to ruin their Liberties," "Slavery," "galling fetters," "forging infernal chains," "Popery," "deſpotic rule," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Maſſachuſett's council appeared in a very Jeſuitical point of view: They would not give the leaſt aſſiſtance or protection to the <hi>Conſignees,</hi> or to the Eaſt India Company's property: They would not even take into conſideration the landing and ſcuring the teas. By their replies it would ſeem, that they rather <hi>rejoiced</hi> in the oppoſition formed by the faction; and if they did not openly range themſelves on its ſide, at leaſt by their neutrality, and the purport of their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014255_0018_0F9358E3C8162120"/>
anſwer, it was ſufficiently evident, that they did not even wiſh to interpoſe as mediators. The Conſignees <q>prayed to reſign themſelves and the property entruſted to their care, to the council, not only as their guardians and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, but alſo thoſe of the people at large.</q> But theſe worthy gentlemen thought proper to have nothing to do with them; and rather hinted that the tea ſcheme was calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſturb the peace of the town and province.</p>
            <p>The letters from the different Governors contain a minute and regular detail of the ſtate of their different provinces, but particularly of the <hi>Capitals</hi> of each, from the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of teas being ſhipped at home, to its arrival in America and return back or deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Above all the reſt of the advices, Governor Hutchinſon's letters are the moſt preciſe, exact, and circumſtantial. He endeavoured both to ſoothe and intimidate the faction. It was he himſelf who adviſed the Conſignees to apply to the council for their perſonal ſafety, and ſecurity of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; for his two eldeſt ſons were two of the Conſignees. He alſo, during the height of their turbulent, unlawful and ſeditious aſſemblings, before the deſtruction of the tea, ſent the ſheriff to the town meeting at Boſton, commanding them to break up and depart. When the ſheriff Mr. Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leafe arrived in the Hall, and intimated <q>that he had a paper to read from the Governor,</q> the faction put it to vote "whether he ſhould be permitted to read it or not?" After ſome debate; permiſſion was granted, and the ſheriff accordingly pronounced the Governor's orders for them to diſperſe. The inſtant he had finiſhed, the faction ſaluted him with an univerſal hiſs, which continued, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him out of doors. The proclamation was afterwards publiſhed in the Gazette from whence it was copied into the other papers, and criticiſed and commented upon with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mark of contempt and indignity. Before the arrival of the tea, the Governor, who is very inſinuating, appeared to have taken every meaſure that prudence could ſuggeſt both for the ſafety of the India property and the ſafety of the Conſignees. The principal leader of the faction was applied to; he commanded the Governor's Company of Cadets, but it was not to be expected that the leader of the faction would muſter the Cadets to oppoſe his own party and his own plots The applications, of courſe, had no effect. Perhaps acquieſcence was not expected, though it might be deemed proper, in point of duty, to make the requeſt, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

By Governor Hutchinſon's letters, the people of the town, or the faction, obliged Mr. Rotch, the owner of Captain Hall's veſſel, to demand a clearance outwards from the Cuſtom-Houſe, in order that the tea might be carried back. Mr. Rotch reſiſted a long time, but his perſon being threatened, nay his life, at laſt made him comply. The Cuſtom Houſe refuſed to grant him an illegal clearance, the Governor was then applied to for a paſs, without which the veſſel would have been ſtopped at Caſtle William; but this was alſo refuſed to Mr. Rotch, becauſe it was totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the duty of a Governor to grant a paſs to a veſſel that had not been regularly cleared at the Cuſtom-Houſe. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>negociation, or inſurrection, or rebellion, came to a criſis about the middle of December. The fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſitting in town-meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heard the account of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſals above mentioned, from Mr. Rotch. It appears they expected ſuch anſwers, and were prepared for the event; for immediately after Mr. Rotch's account, ſignals were given both from within and without the meeting. A number of men, diſguiſed, boarded the veſſels containing the tea, and, as it is ſaid, threw the whole into the ſea, though ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers may think that not a little of it might be purloin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that MADAM THETIS had not ſo ſtrong a diſh of tea that evening as ſome people may imagine.</p>
            <p>This is a recollected Summary of what was heard with regard to to the facts, as they happened in regular progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The opinions of the Writers, as far as may be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what is expreſſed in their letters, now come to be mentioned.</p>
            <p>Upon the face of the whole tranſaction, in every colony where the tea arrived, it is evident that the Governors acted with the utmoſt prudence and circumſpection. It happened the ſhip bound for Boſton was the firſt that reached her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined port: Every civil precaution ſeems to have been tried to preſerve the peace of the town; his Majeſty's Council, the Cadets, and the Militia, were all applied to without effect; the ſheriff read a proclamation to the factious, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to diſſolve their aſſembly, and this proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was immediately afterwards inſerted in the Gazette: Both the ſheriff and the proclamation were treated with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. The people of Boſton ſeem, on this occaſion, to have been fairly tried; the Governor ſeems to have taken, from the beginning, a determination not to call either on the Naval or Military Force, then in the Bay and at Caſtle Iſland. The loyal and peaceable people of that town were
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014255_0020_0F9358E5291B0688"/>
altogether left to the exerciſe of their own judgment, and they have given all the world a notable proof of it, by wantonly deſtroying a valuable property, when all they had to do was to keep firm in their reſolution, not to buy or drink any of it; they will, however, pay for their outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſtime; they muſt make good the loſs; and they will feel the indemnification the more bitter, as they muſt pay for a commodity which they declare they did not taſte, and which they pretend to abhor.</p>
            <p>The other Governors, after the accompliſhment of the Boſton exploit, wiſely agreed to let the tea be carried back, as what had already happened was ſufficient to rouſe the Engliſh nation and parliament; and by this prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct they put it out of the power of the people under their Government to act in the ſame fooliſh and frantic manner as the people of Boſton.</p>
            <p>As to Governor Hutchinſon, if it had not been for his reſolution not to irritate the people, by calling in the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Navy, the tea would have been ſaved; but, as the Boſtonians always made great complaints of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Navy and Army, and not only declared, but SWORE, they had always begun every diſturbance, every rational man will be glad to find that their Governor gave them no ſuch plea on this occaſion: They were left to their own will and pleaſure, and behaved ten times worſe than ever.</p>
            <p>It appears, by all the letters from America, that nothing can be done there by Officers, Civil Military, or Naval, to effectuate the re-eſtabliſhment of peace in that country; they can make no movement, even the moſt trifling, but what is exclaimed againſt by the licentious Boſtonians, as an infringment of their Liberties. They have therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, for theſe laſt three years, in total inactivity, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the inſults of faction with the moſt patient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance, in hopes that Parliament, by an alteration and regulation of their abſurd Charters, will at leaſt relieve them, and all the reſt of his Majeſty's good ſubjects in the Colonies.</p>
            <p>Governor Hutchinſon's ſettled opinion is, <q>that no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the Colonies by any body of men civil or military, can remove the evils that now reign amongſt them. It is Parliament, and Parliament only, which can reſtore that turbulent country to peace, and bring order out of confuſion.</q> And it is ſaid, that his letters for theſe

            <p>IT is a certain fact that all the old American merchants are of late become very cautious whom they credit in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica Their loſſes have taught them wiſdom. They have left off that general and indiſcriminate credit, which they had ſome years ago ſo injudiciouſly plunged into; now they truſt only their old tried cuſtomers; and they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of recommendations, even from them, of any new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, unleſs theſe recommendations are accompanied with ſecurities to the full extent of the credit required. The decreaſe of our exports to America has not ariſen from their boaſtful reſolves not to import our goods, but from their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclination to pay for what we have already ſent them; for the <hi>greateſt patriots</hi> are thoſe very merchants who are <hi>moſt backward</hi> in their payments. It is a very diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtance for a capital houſe here to fail for want of remittances from Boſton, that very patriotic and honeſt town; but it is not ſurprizing that patiots do not pay their debts. Men who dedicate their whole time to the intereſt
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014255_0022_0F9358E694DAD630"/>
of the community, are far above attending to their own private intereſt, or to the intereſt of their creditors; and an American reſolution not to import our goods, always implies a reſolution not to pay for thoſe they have already import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That a merchant of this city, a man of ſpirit, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, acuteneſs, and induſtry, ſhould be obliged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a voyage to the land of Patriotiſm, civilly to aſk a great Patriot to pay nine or ten thouſand pounds long due to him, is probable enough, and it is alſo very probable, that after the utmoſt exertion of his ingenuity, and reſiding in the town of Boſton for ſome months, that at laſt he ſhould find himſelf obliged to return without bringing a ſingle farthing of the debt along with him. The debtor at the ſame time reputed the richeſt man in Boſton, and alſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively known to be one of the principal leaders of the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a notorious detected ſmuggler.</p>
            <p>The merchants of England, when they hear of a New England inſurrection, liſten to it as they would to any other article of news, never reflecting what a fatal effect American uproars and rebellions may have on their trade. For till that country is brought into ſubjection to the laws, their Charters taken away and new modelled, and their Judges, Counſellors, and Governors appointed by the King neither peace nor loyalty will inhabit Rhode Iſland, Connecticut, nor Maſſachuſett's, nor will the merchants reſiding there pay their debts due here. This is fully exemplified in Rhode Iſland, where 76, 000<hi>l.</hi> pounds is due only to two houſes in London, and in the three Provinces, at leaſt a million more may be added on a moderate computation. The reaſon why the debts cannot be recovered, is paticularly ſtated in the printed letters from America. The Judges are choſen annually by the people; they muſt therefore act in ſuch a manner as to preſerve the good will of the people, otherwiſe at the next election they are turned adrift. Is it to be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ſuch Judges will give judgment in their Courts in favour of an Engliſhman, againſt their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>electors? If the merchants of England wiſh to have a chance for recovering their American debts, let them petition Government for an amendment of American Charters.</p>
            <p>As ſmuggling is one of the many cauſes of American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, it would be adviſable in Government to ſtation a number of ſmall veſſels of little draught of water along the coaſt of America, on purpoſe to make captures of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>When their licentious conduct requires reprehenſion or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, then they are the moſt miſrepreſented people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven; and they obteſt the whole world to be witneſſes of their orderly and holy deportment, and of the grievous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vactions and oppreſſions of their enemies. This is always the whining cant of hypocriſy. They do not expect that people, who are really well acquainted with their mutinous actions and treaſonable plots, ſhould give credit to their own account of themſelves, but by their piteous complainings, they think to impoſe on the compaſſionate, and on that part of the public who are uninformed of their real character.</p>
            <p>Uneaſy and arrogant, they left their native country, under the pretence of enjoying civil and religious liberty. Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in America, they perſecuted, baniſhed, or hanged all that differed from them in opinion: That liberty which they claimed in England, they denied to others in America; and after having fled from perſecution, they themſelves became Perſecutors. In the very firſt year of their ſettlement they manifeſted their hatred to the religion of their Mother Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and forcibly baniſhed ſome of their companions who wiſhed to follow and practice the rites of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Impriſonment, baniſhment, and death, ſoon rid them of all diſturbers and opponents; and the commotions that ſoon after followed in England, gave them leiſure to model their government on the fulleſt principles of INDEPENDENCY.</p>
            <p>After the reſtoration, this generous country afforded them every aſſiſtance; we were proud and pleaſed with our grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children; we admired even their independent notions, their turbulent petulance, and their declared oppoſition to our laws. In fact, like over-fond parents we ſpoilt our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we ourſelves encouraged them to rebel againſt us, and now we are reaping the fruits of our fooliſh indulgence.</p>
            <p>The New Englanders plead an exemption from taxation, as if they were not ſubjects; and they bring forward their

CHARTER granted by our Kings, as a proof of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence. The moſt contemptible argument often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes an impreſſion on ſome people. The claims of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica at one time gained ground in this kingdom, not from their validity, but from the impudence with which they were urged. The generality of people did not know that at firſt the Colony of New England was governed by a Council e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed at Plymouth; and that the Hudſon's B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Eaſt India Company, or any other chartered Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, might as well arrogate to themſelves an independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on this kingdom, as the vain and bluſtering Boſtonians. Their firſt Charter <q>only freed them from Taxes, Subſidies, and Cuſtoms, in New England, for SEVEN years; and from Taxes and Impoſitions on goods imported or export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for twenty one years;</q> and this they and their wiſe and modeſt partizans here conſtrue into a compleat INDEPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCY.</p>
            <p>This requires only to be mentioned; the appeal is made to their Charter; let it be conſulted; conviction muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of courſe.</p>

            <head>LETTER VII.</head>
            <p>IT has already been proved from the firſt Charter of the Maſſachuſets, itſelf, that the Colony of New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was to be governed by a Company eſtabliſhed at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, in the County of Devon, and that the New England<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were' to be freed from Taxes for the firſt <hi>Seven</hi> years on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:—This to be ſure is a ſolid foundation on which to build their independency.</p>
            <p>From the firſt moment of their ſettlement they diſplayed their fractious and refractory ſpirit, as appears by an order of the Lords of Council in 1632. <q>Whereas his Majeſty hath lately been informed of <hi>great diſtraction</hi> and <hi>much diſorder</hi> in the Plantations in the parts of America called NEW ENGLAND.</q> It alſo appears, that in their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly days they were accuſtomed to contradict the charges brought againſt them, juſt as they do at preſent, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſays that "moſt of the things informed were denied:" yet they were allowed to eſcape, leaſt the ſettlement ſhould be diſcouraged; <q>their Lordſhips not laying the <hi>faults</hi> or <hi>fancies</hi> of ſome <hi>particular men</hi> on the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> The next year, 1633, we find them in the ſame diſorderly ſtate, from another order of the King in Council, which mentions, that <q>ſuch confuſion and diſtraction is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014255_0025_0F9358E9B96B4B88"/>
grown there, as beſides the ruin of the Plantation, cannot but highly tend to the ruin both of the Church and the State here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When they were at peace with the Indians, and were not occupied in railing at the Mother Country, their reſtleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable diſpoſition ſhewed itſelf in internal commotions. In 1634 they quarrelled with Mr. Winthrop their Governor and their God almighty, <q>concerning his receipts and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements for the public;</q> but he vindicated himſelf with great honour, and concluded his defence with <q>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily bleſſing the Lord our God for his gracious acceptance of his ſervices for his Church and people, which he eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an abundant recompence.</q> They have ſince often ſhewn the ſame ingratitude to many of their beſt friends.</p>
            <p>Searching their hiſtory about this period, we find their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of independency openly profeſſed. They imagined they had a right to plant Colonies, to eſtabliſh what order of government they thought proper, and to form a new State as fully to all intents and purpoſes as if they had been in a ſtate of nature: and on that account they ſtiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a COMMONWEALTH. They denied the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of England over them, becauſe, as they ſaid they were out of the realm, yet they very <hi>conſiſtently</hi> claimed an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Colony of Connecticut, becauſe the fettlers there had formerly reſided ſome time among them, though they were then evidently without the juridiction of Maſſachuſſets.</p>
            <p>The Boſtonians have inceſſantly peſtered us with their great merit in cultivating the barren wilderneſs; but we all know, that we do not owe this to their good will, but to their fears: They would not ſtay, and face danger along with the men of ſpirit of their own party at home, but made off to hide themſelves in the woods of America. Mr. Cotton their Prophet, immediately after the emigration, when high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blamed by his friends in England for deſerting them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that it was the duty of the young and able bodied to run away, if they had opportunity, for that God called only the old and infirm to witneſs to the truth unto death.</p>
            <p>In 1635 his Majeſty, on account of the factious ſtate of the Maſſachuſets, thought proper to grant a Commiſſion for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the Plantations to ſeveral of the principle Officers of State. Theſe Commiſſioners were empowered to inflict puniſhment on all offenders, eccleſiaſtical or civil. <q>either by impriſonments or other reſtraints, or by loſs of life or members, the Royal Aſſent being firſt had and obtained; they were, to new and growing evils and perils to apply
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014255_0026_0F9358EA7A69C410"/>
remedies, ſo often as they ſhould appear to them neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and expedient: they were to remand all Officers or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors to England who did not ſuppreſs ALL REBELS; they were to examine the Letters, Patents, or other writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, granted by the King or his predeceſſors, and if, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on view thereof, it appeared they had been ſurreptitiouſly or unduly obtained, or that any of the priviledges or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties therein granted were hurtful to the Kingdom, the Crown, or Prerogative, they were to cauſe the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws and cuſtoms of our realm of England, to be revoked, him to do all other things which ſhould be neceſſary for the wholeſome government and protection of the Colonies, and our people therein biding.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident from this Commiſſion, that in the moſt early days of our Colonies there were <hi>offenders</hi> and <hi>growing evils,</hi> and that the Letters Patent or Charters granted them were even then ſuſpected to be contrary to the Laws and Cuſtoms of England: After one hundred and fifty years conviction, it is now ſurely time to apply the proper remedies; forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and affection on our part, have hitherto only rouſed, in Maſſachuſets, preſumption and defiance; and though our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Navy may bring the rebellious Boſtonians to ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet, till their Charter is vacated, and another given them, more ſuitable to our Conſtitution, every other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient will only be temporary.</p>
            <p>THE inſtigators and promoters of the rebellious Boſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, after having led them to commit the moſt outrageous exceſſes, think now by bluſtering to ward off merited venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The Charter of Maſſachuſets with them, is too ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to be touched by our legiſlature. Before they promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated this impudent doctrine, they ſhould have reflected that ſubjects, when they have acted in defiance of all law, juſtly forfeit every priviledge granted them; for certainly perſons who infringe the rights of the community, and by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages endanger its welfare, inſtead of favour and protection have nothing to look for but diſgrace and puniſhment. If their Charter as they ſay, authoriſes them to oppoſe the power of Parliament, and places them above its juriſdiction, it muſt immediately occur to every rational man to enquire from whom they received this extraordinary Charter? Why then they tell us they had it from the King. But they ſhould conſider that the King is only a third part of our legiſlature, and that he cannot alienate any part of his dominions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the whole. If therefore the King has
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014255_0027_0F9358EB15033620"/>
granted a Charter which militates againſt the good of the ſtate, it is both juſt and neceſſary that he ſhould recall it, and that another ſhould be given them more conformable to the conſtitution of his kingdom. That Parliament may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs his Majeſty on this important occaſion, and that the Attorney General may be directed to bring a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt this very ſurpriſing Boſton Charter is greatly to be wiſhed. The threats of an old factious Agent, who vomits out his venom in the news papers are utterly contemptible; he owes his ſafety not to his innocence, but to the lenity of our laws. In a neighbouring kingdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>It is an old cuſtom for the moſt depraved characters to take merit to themſelves by addreſſing the truly reſpectable, as if they were the ſupporters of their opinions. <hi>Rationalis</hi> therefore, or, in other words, the Boſtonian traitor, appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

No two characters ever before exhibited ſuch a contraſt; the one the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous citizen of England, and the other the moſt worthleſs of America. The noble Yorkſhire Baronet, it is known, is not an admirer of Colonies; hiſtory and experience have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him that they are rather detrimental than ſerviceable to the parent ſtate: Hence his refuſal to ſit a member of the Eaſt India committee in the Houſe of Commons—But, to return to the modeſt Boſtonian: He ſays, <q>it is ſcurrility to aſſert the ſupremacy of Parliament over America, and that, if his Majeſty was to make a trip to Boſton, thoſe loyal peaceable ſubjects, if his Majeſty would make known his wants, would give and grant ſupplies, as well as the Parliament of Ireland.</q> Can any man, who reads this, believe that <hi>Rationalis</hi> is any other perſon than that worthy Boſtonian who inſiſts that <q>England muſt ſoon become a province tributary to America;</q> who urges the exemption of Boſton and the Colonies from taxes, though we are now <hi>Seventy Millions</hi> in debt on their account; and who now tells us, that Boſton wont pay a ſhilling towards their own defence and protection, unleſs his Majeſty <q>takes a <hi>ſhort trip</hi>
               </q> (as he calls it) to that Town, and makes known his wants. The Doctor, in his compariſon between Boſton and Ireland, ſeems to have forgot that Ireland, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, is ſtill a kingdom of itſelf, and that his rebellious Townſmen have not yet arrived at the dignity of a ſeparate

ſtate; they are Engliſh ſubjects, and under the controul of Parliament as much as the unrepreſented ſix millions of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dwelling in this Iſland; and his Majeſty might as well be ſent to every petty corporation in England to aſk their conſent to ſupplies, diſtinct from Parliament, as to the piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful oſtentatious Boſtonians.</p>
            <p>WE muſt give up the evidence of our own ſenſes whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Boſtonian pleaſes to inſiſt upon it. When he is detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſmuggling, we muſt believe him to be a fair trader; when he perjures himſelf at the Cuſtom Houſe, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain no doubts of his piety; when he knocks down the King's Officers, and tars and feathers them, he is the moſt peaceable ſubject in all his Majeſty's dominions; and he is then moſt faithful and loyal when he acts in direct oppoſition to the laws of his country. Let him pull down a houſe, and carry off the furniture, and the very next moment he will aſſure you, he is the moſt honeſt man in the world; let him, along with the reſt of his townſmen, aſſemble expreſly for the purpoſe of deſtroying the Eaſt India Company's Tea, and let him do it before your face, and then he will gravely tell you it was deſtroyed by a parcel of Mohawks. But if you are reſolved to credit the conviction of your own ſenſes, and will not implicitely believe all that he tells you, why then you are a friend to tyranny and oppreſſion, he inſtantly votes you an enemy to the rights and liberties of the great town of Boſton, and if you are not very alert, hoiſts you into his cart of tar and feathers, and drives you to the gallows, at the ſame time moſt hypocritically baw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In the Houſe, oppoſition itſelf has given up the cauſe of the rebels. They are conſcious, that if they were in power they would ſupport government and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme right of Parliament; without doors the people at large are very ſenſible that the miniſter is ſupporting their own cauſe. They feel the heavy load of debt under which we are all labouring, and at the ſame time reflect that it was contracted in the defence of America. In ſhort, on one ſide there are only two or three hired Agents of the Boſtonian rioters, and on the other, Kings, Lords, and Commons, and all the people of England.</p>

A late writer very juſtly obſerves that the Coloniſts ought to bear a proportionable ſhare of all national burthens impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſupreme legiſlature The taxation of the Colonies, therefore, may be reduced to the four following Articles:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the exports and imports in the Colonies ſhould be brought as near as circumſtances will admit to the ſame rates as thoſe in Great Britain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That no tax ſhould ever be impoſed on the American Colonies by Parliament, without one of the ſame kind being impoſed on Great Britain in a proportionable degree.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Land-tax ſhould be ever at the ſame rate both in the Mother Country and in America.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That taxes of luxury, or ſumptuary taxes, ought ever to be the ſame in both countries, under which claſs ſtamp duties may very properly be ranged, independent of their great utility in regulating many domeſtic concerns.</p>
            <p>Certainly the Coloniſts, as they enjoy the priviledges and protection of this country, ought in reaſon to bear a part of our national Taxes.</p>
            <p>Every real well-wiſher of England hopes, that the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Town of Boſton will not be reſtored, till theſe fooliſh vapouring ſubjects have, in their General Court not only paſſed an act to make good the damage done the Eaſt India Company, but alſo another, expreſsly acknowledging the full power and authority of this kingdom to make laws and ſtatutes of ſufficient force and validity to bind the people of America, ſubjects to the crown of Great Britain, in all caſes whatſoever.</p>

            <p>But to proceed with the curſory account of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets:</p>
            <p>In 1636. Mr Vane afterwards the famous Sir Henry Vane, was choſen their Governor; for at that time they had the priviledge of electing their own Governors. Theſe diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied people were greatly pleaſed with him at firſt, but they ſoon manifeſted their reſtleſs diſpoſition, his Government was only to laſt one year; he was a man of their own choice, and yet they were weary of him in ſix months. He offered to reſign; the Boſton Church made objections to his reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſignified them to the Court then ſitting. Cautious of occaſioning an internal rupture in the Colony, he agreed to preſide there for the ſhort remaining time; but ſailed for England two months after the expiration of his government.</p>
            <p>The jealouſy of Mr. Winthrop, their former Governor, and then Deputy Governor, contributed to haſten his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The religious as well as the political doctrines of theſe two men very widely differed. Mr. Winthrop was ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for denying admittance to all Engliſh ſubjects, who were ſuſpected to differ from them in opinion, and encouraged the moſt factious in their ideas of forming an independent ſtate. Mr. Vane, on the contrary, very juſtly aſſerted the right that every Engliſh ſubject poſſeſſed, of reſiding in any part of his Majeſty's dominions, and of moving from any one part of theſe dominions to another, as beſt ſuited him, whilſt he continued in ſubjection to the laws; for that, by purſuing Mr. Winthrop's plan, the Colony would exceed the limits
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014255_0031_0F9358EE1EBA7868"/>
of his Majeſty's grant, and forfeit the priviledges, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and lands, which they challenged to be their own.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſubſtantial reaſons had no effect on thoſe ſtubborn independents; and immediately after his departure for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, every perſon, man or woman, who were ſuppoſed to be of his opinion, were <hi>disfranchiſed, impriſoned,</hi> and <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finding themſelves poſſeſſed of power, they were above giving any reaſons for their deſpotic exerciſe of it; and they even conſidered the queſtioning their authority as an inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inſult. This was ſtrongly examplified in the trial of Mrs. Hutchinſon, who held both the religious and political opinions of Mr. Vane: She was examined before the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Aſſiſtants and Clergy, and ſentenced to be baniſhed, and impriſoned till ſhe could be ſent away.</p>
            <p>During her trial ſhe urged, <q>that, as the clergy were her principal accuſers, they ought to give their evidence on oath.</q> One of the Judges, in reply to her demand, ſaid, <q>admit they ſhould miſtake you in your ſpeeches</q> (for ſhe was tried only for her opinions, amongſt which tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in religion was her capital offence) <q>you would make them to ſin, if you urge them to ſwear.</q> Another of her Judges was very angry with her, for <q>not believing al the Godly Miniſters without an oath.</q> The Deputy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſaid, <q>he was ſure ſhe was deluded by the devil, and that they ſhould be all ſick with faſting.</q> And when the Governor pronounced, <q>The ſentence of the Court is, that you are baniſhed out of our juriſdiction, as being a woman not fit for our ſociety, and are to be impriſoned till the Court ſhall ſend you away,</q> ſhe very naturally aſked, <q>I deſire to know wherefore I am baniſhed?</q> to which the mild ſagacious Governor replied, <q>
                  <hi>Say no more! the Court knows wherefore, and is ſatisfied. </hi>
               </q>
            </p>

            <p>At preſent, however, the rebellious Boſtonians proceed in a more ſummary way; thoſe who deny their independency, and who believe in the ſupremacy of the Britiſh legiſlature, are driven out of their holy and peaceable town, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called even to town meeting; and if, unfortunately, they ſhould be ſlow in their retreat, they are ſeized, ſtript naked, beſmeared with tar, ſtuck all over with feathers, then cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to liberty tree, or to the gallows, and after having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone

            <p>Thus we ſee the Boſtonians have proceeded from bad to worſe; inſtead of reforming they have degenerated; the ſons far outdo their forefathers in rioting and rebellion; and inſtead of a public mock trial, they give a public <hi>Mob Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return again to their anceſtors.</p>
            <p>In the year 1637, after the expiration of Mr. Vane's Government, as many people of his way of thinking were expected from England, the general court of Maſſachuſett's aſſembled at Boſton, and paſſed a very extraordinary act. <q>A penalty was laid on all perſons who ſhould entertain in their houſes, any ſtranger who came with an intent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, or ſhould allow the uſe of any lot or habitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three weeks, without liberty from one of the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing council or two other aſſiſtants. The penalty on pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons was <hi>forty pounds,</hi> and twenty pounds beſides for every month they continued in the offence; and any town which gave or ſold a lot to ſuch ſtranger, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a penalty of one hundred pounds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of old the Boſtonian Puritans by this law denied their fellow-ſubjects admittance to their ſanctified diſtricts; and in our days, their ſons refuſe acceſs to our goods, and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to our laws. Yet, in the face of this conviction, their advocates have the modeſty to affirm, <q>that a perfect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony always reigned between them and Great Britain, till the errors and innovations of his preſent Majeſty's miniſters.</q> Can folly or impudence go farther?</p>
            <p>That the above recited law might be all powerful, they immediately paſſed another <q>to puniſh any perſon by fine, impriſonment, or baniſhment, who ſhould defame any court, or any of their ſentences.</q> By this act, even <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſpeech</hi> was adjudged criminal by the Government of Maſſachuſett's. This new law drove numbers into volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary baniſhment; others were formally disfranchiſed, and baniſhed by the court. The ruling party, prayed and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed GOD for having rid them of their enemies, and they aſſured HI<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that they inflicted puniſhment ſolely <q>
                  <hi> for his honour and glory, and for the firm eſtabliſhment of his Kingdom.</hi>
               </q> And to compleat their great <hi>work,</hi> tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was every where preached againſt, as a damnable ſin in rulers, which, if permitted, would bring down the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of heaven upon the holy land.</p>
            <p>Previous to the above laws the New Englanders earneſtly

To theſe new comers a milk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>cow was ſold at 25% or 30% which enriched the firſt planters; but when the ſtrangers effects were nearly exhauſted, or when any of their leading men grew jealous of their abilities, they were tried for broaching tenets contrary to the Kingdom of GOD in New England, ſentenced to be baniſhed, and their goods were confiſcated for the expences of their condemnation, and to keep them alive in priſon till they ſhould be ſent away.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding a very great oppoſition, the new laws, as already mentioned, were paſſed, and violently carried into execution; for the complete eſtabliſhment of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent commonwealth weighed more with the majority, than the advantage of the ſtrangers money.</p>
            <p>Such laws and practices would be deemed by men of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, upright minds, never to have had a being, if they were not upon record. Mr. Vane, in his anſwer to Mr. Winthrop, diſcloſes their iniquitous proceedings; they were not for baniſhing any perſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Yet if we chuſe to liſten to the clamours of hypocriſy and deceit, and to believe them too, there are people who will publicly aſſure us, <q>that the Boſtonians always were, and at this time are, a mild, equitable, Godly, loyal, and humane people; that they never committed any illegal acts, any unjuſtifiable outrages, any wanton cruelties, any deliberate barbarities; and that all the flagrant and attrocious inſurrections and enormities with which they are charged, are merely the vile ſuggeſtions of Satan, and their enemies, who envy and perſecute the poor people of GOD, even in the <hi>howling wilderneſs.</hi>

            <p>FROM the firſt eſtabliſhment of the Maſſachuſett's colony to the preſent times, every information concerning the ſettlers there, as well as their own public acts, evince their intention of forming <hi>an independent ſtate,</hi> and of throwing off their allegiance to this kingdom. In a letter from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, written in the laſt century, we are told, <q>that it was not new diſcipline which they aimed at, but Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty; and that it was accounted perjury and treaſon in their general court, to ſpeak of <hi>appeals</hi> to the King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:014255_0034_0F9358F11F546A90"/>
It was alſo an avowed doctrine of theirs one hundred and forty years ago, <q>that as their common wealth was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by free conſent, every member thereof was tied to ſeek out and entertain all means that might conduce to the welfare of the incorporation.</q> To this it was rationally and judiciouſly replied, <q>that they ought not to ſeek out all means that might conduce to the welfare of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation, but all lawful and due means, according to the Charter they hold from the King.</q> Such replies as this mightily offended them, and all who owned allegiance to England were fined and baniſhed their dominions. In our days we find their offspring holding the ſame principles, for every loyal ſubject is driven out of their territories.</p>
            <p>About the year 1646, a <hi>Que Warranto</hi> was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Charter, in which all their different illegal and oppreſſive acts are enumerated; amongſt the reſt, that of their taking ſums of money for admiſſion into their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and disfranchiſing whom they pleaſed and turning them out of the company. This alluded to the members of the church of England, and to thoſe who allowed their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the Crown and ſtate of England. How then can the Boſtonian agents aver that perfect harmony always ſubſiſted between the Maſſachuſett's and this country till within theſe laſt ten years? Is their baniſhing the members of the church of England, and thoſe who owned allegiance to England, after ſtripping them of their effects, a proof of this perfect harmony? Surely the worthy Boſton Agents muſt have loſt all memory and recollection when they advanced ſuch a known public untruth.</p>
            <p>They were required to ſend home their patent ſoon after the Quo Warranto was brought againſt it. Then they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the ſame hypocritical ſubmiſſion and the ſame rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious diſpoſition that they do at this preſent time. In one part of their anſwer, they ſaid, they <q>humbly proſtrated themſelves at the footſtool of ſupreme authority;</q> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part they declared, that <q>if their patent ſhould be taken from them, the common people would conceive themſelves freed from their allegiance and ſubjection, and thereupon would be ready to confederate themſelves under a new Government; and which would be a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous example to other plantations.</q> The troubles which aroſe in England immediately after prevented the neceſſary regulations then intended. Indeed by our diviſions and quarrels at home, Government has always been prevented
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014255_0035_0F9358F1DAD49760"/>
from paying due attention to the proper regulations of the colonies.</p>
            <p>There never was any thing more evident than that the people of Maſſachuſett's intended to eſtabliſh a ſeparate ſtate, and to exerciſe a deſpotic power over the neighbouring co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies. All means that tended to forward this plan were greedily taken hold of.</p>
            <p>In 1641, they gave ſome of their people who were remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their colony, a very ſurprizing commiſſion. They confeſſed in the preamble to this commiſſion, that the lands deſigned to be taken poſſeſſion of, were without the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the Maſſachuſett's, and that certain noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages in England challenged juriſdiction there by virtue of a patent from the King; yet as they thought it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take poſſeſſion of that country, they granted au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to their people to ſettle upon thoſe lands, which they acknowledged did not belong to them, to form a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to make war with every other power, civil and military.</p>
            <p>To elucidate this extraordinary conduct (tho' no appolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy can be made for their ſeizing and occupying lands which they agreed belonged to others of his Majeſty's ſubjects) it is neceſſary to obſerve, that they obliged every inhabitant of their colony to take an OATH of FIDELITY to THEIR COMMONWEALTH; and it was gravely determined in their general court, that this Oath of Fidelity ſhould be binding; even though the perſons ſhould no longer reſide within their limits. It was upon this principle that they granted the above-mentioned ſtrange commiſſion to the Connecticut ſettlers, tho' at the very ſame time they declared, as they themſelves were out of the realm of England, it could claim no juriſdiction over them. From this, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching, rapacious, and rebellious diſpoſition is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They denied allegiance to the mother country, where it was due, and voted themſelves, and uſurped an authority over a neighbouring colony, where they themſeves, in their own commiſſion, confeſs they had no right, tho' afterwards, in defiance to their own commiſſion, they voted in their own general court, they had a right. Inconſiſtency, ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and robbery, they never minded, provided it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their purpoſes of ſelf-intereſt. Many inſtances of the ſame ſpirit occur in their hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Every perſon who refuſed to coincide with their opinions, either religious or political, was treated in a moſt ſavage and inhuman manner. A Citizen of London happening to come to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014255_0036_0F9358F29BE0BBE8"/>
Boſton, and differing in ſome trivial points of religion from the profeſſing godly there, was ſummoned before their court of inquiſition, and ſo terrified, that he thought it moſt prudent to remove to Plymouth, a town about forty miles diſtant; there however Boſtonian recommendations followed him, and he was publicly whipped and driven to Rhode Iſland. His perſecutors ſtill following him with their kind chriſtian recommendations, at Rhode Iſland he was firſt impriſoned, then whipped, and afterwards baniſhed; from thence he fled to the town of Providence; but his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions were not at an end, the Boſtonians ſent what they called a warrant or notification to all the people of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, requiring them to ſubmit to the juriſdiction of the Maſſachuſets. To this it was replied, that they had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over Providence. But the poor diſtreſſed man, with ſome others, to be out of the reach of Boſtonian cruelty, and to avoid further ill-treatment, went into the country, and purchaſed ſome lands of an Indian Chief, for which he paid forty pounds. Even to this retreat did the malice of his enemies purſue him. The Boſtonians ſet up a claim to the lands purchaſed, and ordered him and his company to appear at the court of Boſton. After the barbarous uſage they had received, it is not to be ſuppoſed that they would willingly comply with this order. They ſent back there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a meſſage, <q>that they were out of the Maſſachuſets juriſdiction, and would acknowledge ſubjection to none but the ſtate and government of Old England.</q> This declaration exaſperaſed the Boſtonians; they ſent an armed force, which after reſiſtance carried them captive to Boſton, where a charge was exhibited againſt them in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Upon much examinantion and ſerious conſideration of your writings, with your anſwers about them, we do charge you to be <hi>blaſphemous enemies of the true religion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his holy Ordinances, and alſo of civil authority among the <hi>people of God,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this juriſdiction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This charge brings to our memory a tranſaction that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſeveral years ago in the iſland of Jamaica. A Scotch Officer, with ſeveral others of his corps, engaged in a bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liard match with ſome Jews. The children of Iſrael, it ſeems, were much too expert at that game for the Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian and his companions. The latter; after having loſt ſome money, muſtered their whole joint ſtock, and ſtaked it againſt the Sons of Circumciſion: The game was played; the Scot loſt; but he ſwept the ſtakes into his hat, drew his

ſword, and protected by his friends, retired, calling out, <q>

               </q>

            <p>But to return to the people of God in New England.</p>
            <p>The perſecuted Londoner and his companions were brought before the merciful Boſtonian Court; their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were produced againſt them; the Governor agreed with them in their explanation of their writings, and ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to acquit them, but was oppoſed by the reſt of the court. Their ſentences will ever remain a record of infamy againſt the town of Boſton</p>
            <p>They were condemned to work in jail, to wear ſuch bolts and irons as might hinder their eſcape, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they broke confinement, or maintained any of the blaſphemous abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hereſies with which they had been charged by the general court, or ſhould reprove the Churches of our LORD JESUS CHRIST in theſe united colonies, or the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, upon conviction thereof, and trial by jury, they ſhould ſuffer death.</p>
            <p>The Boſton hypocrites, even in their own ſentence, ſay that their general court charged them with blaſphemy, but they do not ſay that they proved it.</p>
            <p>They were confined one winter, then baniſhed the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Maſſachuſets, and the lands they had purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Indians, their goods when they were taken priſoners, were ſeized, ſold, and diſpoſed of as follows: To the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who took them captive, and deſtroyed their ſettlement; to pay the expences of their trial, and to ſupport them in priſon.</p>
            <p>In 1665 they preferred a petition to the commiſſioner ſent by the King to regulate the plentations, for redreſs of their wrongs, alledging that, beſides all the cruelties they had ſuffered, eighty head of cattle had been taken from them. The Boſtonians, in their anſwer, charged them with <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical tenets,</hi> and ſaid that the goods ſeized did not pay for their proſecution; yet they could not vindicate themſelves for ſeizing perſons and goods without the limits of their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. The poor ſufferers, however, never obtained any redreſs.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that the manners of large bodies of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and nations change greatly in a century or two: But this cannot be ſaid of the Boſtonians; they ſtill are cruel oppreſſors and perſecutors of all who deny their Sovereign Authority, or who acknowledge any dependance on Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: Beſides the unjuſtifiable injuries committed on the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014255_0038_0F9358F417D99F10"/>
property and perſons of individuals, they have treated with the moſt daring inſults both the Officers of Government and the acts of the State. Can the ſecurity of property, or perſonal ſafty, be expected in a colony where the laws of the parent ſtate have no vigour nay, even where they are ſpurned at? Can redreſs be looked for by injured individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, when the ſupremacy of the Legiſlature itſelf is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſputed, but denied and oppoſed?—In ſhort, a thorough reformation muſt be made in the conſtitution of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets, or the authority of this kingdom will be covered with contempt.</p>
            <p>The dreadful bravadoes and threats of the Boſtonians, when vigorous meaſures are taken with them, will all eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate in <hi>ſmoke;</hi> inſtead of boldly and rebelliouſly manning their batteries, they will ſkulk to their town meeting, and there with religious grimace and holy phraſe, they will vote us all, Enemies of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and of the <hi>great town of Boſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THROUGHOUT all nature it is obſervable, that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of cruel and deceitful diſpoſitions are the leaſt ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of gratitude. This obſervation may with juſtice be carried into human life. It has been exemplified in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonians. The merchants, not only of London, but over all the Britiſh Dominions, in the year 1766, ſtrenuouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted all their intereſt to obtain the repeal of the Stamp Act. To this ſtruggle they were principally excited by the piteous complaints of the Boſtonians, who held forth to them fallacious views of emolument. Unhappily their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions were ſucceſsful; they, and their country, have ſince felt it; and now are convinced of it. The miſtaken mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, adminiſtration, and the whole kingdom, expected gratitude would be deeply rooted in the breaſts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonians for the ſignal ſucceſsful effort they had made in their favour. But the obligation was too great for their narrow ſouls to comprehend in its full extend; adminiſteration wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Boſtonians to receive the repeal, granted at the earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt requeſt of the whole mercantile body of Great Britain, with moderation and thankfulneſs. The merchants of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, impreſſed with the ſame ideas, wrote cautionary letters to their principal correſpondents, not to ſhew any undue ſigns of exultation. But the repeal had been granted, and their monitions were treated with contempt. Their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Negroe ſlaves, who neither by themſelves in perſon, nor by repreſentatives of their own free election ever gave conſent to their preſent ſtate of bondage. That this great Town of Boſton, which contains about 3000 able, but not willing men to fight has diſturbed the whole Britiſh empire for theſe laſt ten years with their ſeditious clamours is certainly fact. This however is not aſſerted in praiſe of our vigour, but in praiſe of our moderation. Like cowards unoppoſed they have puſhed their inſurrections and treaſons to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and are now awaiting their puniſhment. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their bravadoes, the faction there does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a fourth part of the inhabitants. If there had been any vigour in the magiſtracy many of their outrages might have been prevented; but there unhappily prevails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the moſt loyal ſubjects of that town, an opinion that they can do nothing of themſelves, without the intervention of the ſupreme legiſlature here. So that the faction, tho' ſmall when compared to the reſt of the inhabitants, have hitherto carried every thing before them. Their late mad action has brought their affairs to a criſis; and no man can be a friend to his country who oppoſes their puniſhment. Indeed puniſhment it cannot be called, they are only at preſent to pay for the tea they have wantonly deſtroyed. But it is ardently wiſhed by every lover of peace and good order, that ſome ſalutary regulations may take place in the Maſſachuſetts.</p>

            <p>ALTHOUGH the original pretences which the Boſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans held forth for their emigration from this country, were the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, yet we have ſhewn that they not only denied the enjoyment of theſe liberties to many of their fellow ſubjects, but that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them in the moſt illegal, oppreſſive, and unrelenting manner.

            <p>But the exerciſe of their oppreſſions and cruelties were not confined to individuals.

General Court, impoſing a duty upon the other Colonies, of which the following is an extract.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It is therefore ordered by this Court, and the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, that all goods belonging or any way appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any inhabitants of the juriſdiction of Plymouth, Connecticut or Newhaven, that ſhall be imported within the Caſtle, or exported from any part of the Bay, ſhall pay ſuch cuſtom as is hereafter expreſſed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> all ſkins of beaver, otter, mouſe, mouſe deer, &amp;c. two pence per ſkin; and all goods packed in hogſheads or otherwiſe, ten ſhillings a ton; corn and meal two pence a buſhel; biſcuit ſix pence per hundred, on pain of forfeiture.</p>
            </q>
            <p>We ſhall now give a comentary on this extraordinary uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of ſupreme power over the adjoining Colonies, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by one of their own hiſtorians. Had, ſays he, the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets laid a duty on goods from Connecticut only, as they had the diſpute with them, they might have had at leaſt a colour to juſtify them; but to extend their reſentment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other two colonies, no excuſe can be framed for it. It was a mere exertion of power, and a proof of their great ſuperiority, which enabled them in effect to depart from the union or combination of the Colonies for their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual defence, whenſoever they found it for their intereſt; and if done by a ſingle magiſtrate would have been pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced tyrannical and oppreſſive.</p>
            <p>Upon the paſſing this law, the two Colonies of Plymouth and Newhaven, being too weak to contend with the power of the Maſſachuſetts, obſerved in reply, that a burthenſome cuſtom had been impoſed on them, though they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the diſpute, but had interfered at the requeſt of the Maſſachuſetts, and had impartially conſidered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and given their opinion; therefore they recommended it to the General Court of the Maſſachuſets, ſeriouſly to conſider whether ſuch proceedings agreed with the law of love, and the tenor and import of the articles of their confederation.</p>
            <p>This is ſtrong evidence of their graſping, encroaching, and deſpotic principles. The troubles then in England left them at full liberty to act as they pleaſed, and to exerciſe their ſovereign authority over their neighbours, as beſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their will and pleaſure. In our days, we find them ſtill deceitful and oppreſſive. Four years ago they ſtopped all intercourſe with New Hampſhire and Rhode Iſland, becauſe theſe provinces imported goods from England publickly, whilſt they themſelves, the profeſſing Boſtonians, imported
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014255_0042_0F9358F82473F090"/>
a thouſand times the quantity privately, and were anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing and driving out of their hypocritical town every perſon who refuſed to join in their unwarrantable meaſures.</p>
            <p>Another "principal end of their plantation" according to their own profeſſions, was the glorious propagation of the Goſpel among the poor Heathen Their methods of converſion were truly Spaniſh; they propagated the Goſpel by the ſword; they ſeized the Indian lands, that theſe poor Heathen might have nothing to care for but their ſalvation, and then cut their throats for the good of their ſouls: Even the tenderneſs of females was no protection, no ſafeguard, againſt the rapacious inhuman cruelty of thoſe holy hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; men and women, without diſcrimination, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pity, fell ſacrifices to their luſt of acquiſition. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their firſt intruſion they took ſeveral captives; the men were put to the ſword upon the ſpot, and the Indians in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with them claiming the women, they murdered them alſo to end the diſpute.</p>
            <p>The treatment of <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> a famous Indian Sachem, will ſufficiently diſplay New England treachery and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Under the pretence that he was their enemy, and was plotting their ruin, they exhibited articles of complaint againſt him, and required him to come to Boſton to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. <hi>Miantonimo</hi> poſſeſſed a noble and manly ſpirit; he came in perſon to the Court, and demanded, <q>that his accuſers ſhould be brought face to face, and that, if they failed in their proof, they ſhould ſuffer death as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would have deſerved that puniſhment, if he had been guilty</q> His compoſed, ingenuous and ſpirited <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our confounded his accuſers; the Connecticut people, to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the trial, were going to fall upon him and deſtroy him, but were prevented by the Maſſachuſetts. Thus he was ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this time, but marked out for future murder.</p>
            <p>About three years after, he was unfortunately taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner by the Indians, and carried alive as an acceptable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the New Englanders. The Commiſſioners of the united Colonies were then aſſembled. After keeping him a conſiderable time in priſon, they ordered the Indians to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him out of their juriſdiction, and ſlay him. This ſentence was immediately executed, ſeveral of the New Englanders accompanying the Indians to ſee the murder duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he remained in priſon he was fed with the hopes of life, provided his ſubjects would contribute a ſufficient ranſom. The poor Indians had nothing but their wampum
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014255_0043_0F9358F9132D8FA8"/>
and their furs; of theſe they raiſed to the value of forty pounds: the whole was brought to <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> and by him given to the deceitful New Englandmen; who after having cheated and ſtript the ſubjects of their property, infamouſly murdered their Prince.</p>
            <p>Such deceitful barbarity rouſed the reſentment of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. The Commiſſioners of the Colonies to prevent a war, entered into what they called an examination of the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt themſelves; and the following is what they thought proper to publiſh in defence of themſelves and their countrymen.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Some looſe diſcourſe had paſſed, that for ſuch quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of wampum, and ſuch parcels of other goods, to a great value, there might have been ſome probability of ſparing his life; yet no ſuch parcels were brought, not any ranſom agreed, nor ſo much as any ſerious treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, to redeem their impriſoned Sachem: and as to the wampum and goods, they were but ſmall parcels, and ſcarce conſiderable for ſuch a purpoſe, ſo they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by <hi>Miantonimo</hi> himſelf, to ſundry perſons, for courteſies received during his impriſonment, and upon hope of future favour.</q>

            <p>THERE is ſuch a ſuperlative degree of effrontery in the faction of Boſton, and in their defenders here, that if we had not the fulleſt proofs of their outrageous treaſons, we very probably might be led to conceive that all the truths told us of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

They declare, that the meaſures of Parliament to bring back the Boſton rebels to their duty are worſe than Star Chamber proceedings, adopted without accuſation, or even ſhadow of evidence. Surely the flowery agent who hazarded theſe aſſertions, imagined that his ſingle anonymous affirmation would outweigh truth itſelf. Has not the town of Boſton been the ſeat of ſedition, riot, and robbery, for theſe ten years? Have not the rebels there pulled down and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed houſes, expelled the King's Officers, deſtroyed a valuable property, and denied the authority of the laws? Yet after all thoſe villanies and treaſons we are told, there is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt them. There is one thing, however, in which every rational man will agree with Mr. Agent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, that <q>the tea was deſtroyed by the avowed enemies of the town of Boſton;</q> for no ſet of men but the faction at Boſton, who have always been the avowed enemies both of their town and country, would have, for theſe many years back committed ſo many cowardly and infamous acts of abuſe and oppreſſion. Knaves and traitors are always enemies to the community in which they reſide. It would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely injudicious in the Governor to have called in either Military or Naval aſſiſtance. If he had been ſo unwiſe, the Boſtonians would have had their old excuſe, <q>that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the ſoldiers and ſeamen irritated the inhabitants and brought on the deſtruction of the Tea, and the ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, tarring, feathering, and whipping of the Cuſtom Houſe Officers; for that till they were called upon by the Governor, the town had been in perfect peace</q> Former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they complained that their orderly behaviour was diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the troops, and now they complain that their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly conduct was not prevented by the troops. Faction will always be clamorous, and will utter the groſſeſt abſurdities and contradictions, rather than be ſilent. The governor

would have been unpardonable, had he required the aſſiſtance of the Admiral The Boſtonians in their Town Meeting, in their Houſe of Repreſentatives, and even in his Majeſty's Council, have always publicly declared that the <hi>Poſſe Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus</hi> was ſufficient to preſerve good order and to enforce the laws; the Governor therefore wiſely left the regulation and protection of the Town to the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus</hi> aſſembled at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

There after annulling the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment relative to the Tea, by a vote of their own, in a moſt unanimous and reſpectable manner, they proceeded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Tea; and then, by way of celebrating their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the Mother Country, they indulged themſelves in the old recreation of tarring, feathering, and whipping the Revenue Officers. After having committed any miſchief, the Boſtonians always reſult to the miſerable ſubterfuge of proteſting their innocence and their peaceable behaviour, and throwing the blame of their own villany on ſtrangers, Boys, Negroes, and Mowhawks. Thus after a daring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in the laſt century, Darforth, one of the Council, wrote to their Prophet, Dr. Mather, <q>

Nor are we, in this caſe, to ſtand upon the juſtice of the quarrel.</q>—Human nature ſhrinks back with horror, on the peruſal of ſuch diabolical doctrines.

            <q>
               <p>Now (ſays he) for the point of danger. There is no courſe or voyage undertaken by us, but may expoſe the undertakers to peril, and may occaſion diſpleaſure and danger to us from abroad; but ſuch dangers have not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deterred us from any probable way of our ſafety or advantage, nor have we ſuſtained any harm, hitherto, by eaſting ourſelves upon the LORD and his <hi>good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in ſuch caſes. I will remember you of ſome: When we firſt ſet up reformation in our church-way, did not this expoſe us to as great an hazard as we could run, both from abroad and at home? Did not our friends in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land forewarn us of it, ere we came away? Did not ſome amongſt ourſelves, and thoſe no mean ones, incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our inevitable dangers at home; from no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany left out of Church Fellowſhip, and Civil Offices, and Freedom, hitherto? Yet we truſted in GOD, though there appeared no means of ſafety, and went on our way, and the Lord hath preſerved us, and fruſtrated all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and attempts againſt us.</p>
               <p>Again, when, upon grievous complaints againſt us to the Lords of the Privy Council, of ſuch civil innovations amongſt us as we could not juſtify by the laws of that ſtate, a ſtrict order and command was ſent on us to deliver up our Patent, or elſe to expect to have it fetched by force. What greater danger could there be towards us, than appeared in not obeying this command? Yet we had then courage enough to return an anſwer, without our patent.</p>

            <p>And now for the venerable forefathers of the loyal Saints of Boſton.</p>
            <p>The tyranny, iniquities, and rebellious conduct of the venerable patriarchs of New England, as well as of their hopeful progeny, the preſent Boſtonians, have already been ſtrongly elucidated. From their own public declarations we have ſeen, that to ſerve their own plundering inhuman purpoſes they brought the ſacred Commandments of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to authoriſe their depradations and cruelties towards the poor Indians. They firſt proved, to their own ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Indians were not their neighbours; and then they proceeded to "rob and kill them," as opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p>When the minds of theſe venerable miſcreants were load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a weight of oppreſſive guilt, it is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they would boggle at trivial crimes. Their continued
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:014255_0052_0F935907AD45DFD0"/>
tyrannic exertions, exerciſed in an inferior degree, ſerved to alleviate and deaden the recollection of their more dreadful barbarities. Conſtant action was abſolutely neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſtem the inceſſant tide of heartrending reflection. Their unjuſtifiable oppreſſions of thoſe who followed the rites of the Engliſh Church were therefore to them a relief from care, and ſerved as a mere paſtime.</p>
            <p>In 1646, ſeveral perſons of note, members of the Church of England, preſented a petition to the General Court at Boſton, complaining <q>That the fundamental laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were not owned by the Colony as the baſis of the Government; that they were denied the enjoyment of their religious privileges; that they were debarred from all civil employments, without any juſt cauſe, not being permitted to hear the leaſt office, though it could not be denied they were well qualified; that they had not even a vote in chooſing magiſtrates, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We at leaſt intreat, that the bodies of <hi>us</hi> and <hi>ours</hi> may not be <hi>impreſſed,</hi> nor our goods forcibly taken away. Further, that none of the Engliſh nation be baniſhed, unleſs they break the laws of England.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Under ſuch circumſtances of oppreſſion as the petitioners laboured, ſurely their grievances could not be more mildly expreſſed, or more rationally enforced: They claimed only the legal privileges which all good ſubjects ought to enjoy, whilſt they act in obedience to the laws—perſonal ſafety, ſecurity of property, and liberty of conſcience. All theſe are undoubted privileges of every Engliſhman reſiding in any

part of his Majeſty's dominions. The perſecuting indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Maſſachuſets, however, entertained far different opinions But it is candid to allow them a fair hearing, and they ſhall ſpeak for themſelves.</p>
            <p>The General Court of the Maſſachuſets, ſitting at Boſton, iſſued the following declaration, in anſwer to the above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited petition.</p>

            <p>The above declarations of the Great and General Court of the Maſſachuſets conveened at Boſton is, at once, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, laughable, and deteſtible.

The Rebels of Maſſachuſets impudently declared, that their conſtitution was framed according to the laws of England, at the very moment they refuſed the Petitioners leave to worſhip God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Church of England. And what was ſtill more arbitrary, the Epiſcopalians were fined every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day five ſhillings if they did not attend the Boſtonian inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent meeting houſes, to hear their own church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and religious principles reviled in the groſſeſt terms of abuſe. The Petitioners in the General Court declaration are called impudent ſlanderers, becauſe they could not charge the profeſſing Saints with any thing morally evil: Yet it is plain the Petitioners had charged them with vile imoralities, for one part if the reply of the Godly Boſtonians is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>

            <p>The unanimity, therefor of the public, relative to the meaſures purſued by Parliament, for the indemnification of the India Company, and for the regulation and preſervation of the province of Maſſachuſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, is far from ſurpriſing; it is natural, and from the beginning of the buſineſs, was reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to be expected. The people of Boſton themſelves have preſſed upon us full and repeated proofs of their dangerous commotions, inſurrections, and unjuſtifiable acts. They have even forced conviction upon thoſe, who were moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to believe any thing to their prejudice—their beſt friends.</p>
            <p>Granting compenſation for the tea deſtroyed is but a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of juſtice to the India Company; blocking up the port of Boſton till the inhabitants ſay they are peaceable and return to their duty, is a juſt, but a temporary expedient. The conſtitution of their internal government muſt be altered, that the people hereafter may be reſtrained within the due bounds of law; for all liberty without the circle of the law, is licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>To accompliſh the great purpoſe of reſtoring the laws to their primitive vigour and operation, the Charter of the Maſſachuſets muſt be annihilated. It is conſtructed on princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples much too democratic, and ſubverſive of all peace, good order, and government; it is held forth to us by the Boſtonian rioters not only as their warrant for the commiſſion of all ſorts of criminal violence, but alſo as their ſhelter and defence againſt juſt chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>This Charter, upon which ſo many flagrant riots and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections have been grounded and vindicated, ſhould ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undergo proper reviſion and alteration. The Governor by this Charter, conſidered as diſtinct from the Council, has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o power. The Council conſiſts of twenty eight members, annually choſen by the Houſe of Repreſentatives; without the advice and conſent of ſeven Counſellors the Governor cannot act. To the appointment of Judges, Commiſſioners of Oyer and Terminer, Sheriffs, Provoſt Marſhlls, Juſtices of the Peace, and other Officers belonging to the Council and Courts of Juſtice, the Governor muſt have the voice of ſeven Counſellors: now, though theſe Counſellors to his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Governor are ſworn to the due and faithful performance of the duties of their office, yet as they are annually choſen by the people, on every emergency they act rather as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of the mob, than as ſupporters of law and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:014255_0059_0F93590D95E6A4C8"/>
The choice of the Council ought therefore moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be ſolely veſted in the crown, as it is in moſt of the other provinces</p>
            <p>Another neceſſary regulation is the aboliſhing of Town Meetings: the herd of Fools and Knaves collected together in Faneuil Hall, we have been convinced are capable of the moſt rebellious reſolutions; they have ſhewn the will, but happily they wanted the power actually to revolt. They ſhould only be authoriſed once a year to meet to chuſe their Town Officers; this is ſufficient employment for the rabble that muſter in the Town Hall at Boſton, and is in fact their only proper buſineſs when aſſembled there; but the ſmugglers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and the deſperadoes of faction here, have taught them to repeal acts of our ſupreme legiſlature. Indeed the Boſton Town Meeting has only been the tool of the learned Agent, who is himſelf the tool of the infatuated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealers of the Stamp Act.</p>
            <p>The Town Meeting at Boſton is the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of ſedition.</hi> It is there that all their dangerous inſurrections are engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; it is there that the flame of diſcord and rebellion was firſt lighted up and diſſeminated over all the provinces; it is therefore greatly to be wiſhed that Parliament may reſcue the loyal inhabitants of that town and Province from the mercileſs hand of an ignorant mob, led on and inflamed by ſelf-intereſted and profligate men.</p>
            <p>As the Town Meetings are only frequented by the ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers and the ſeditious, it may eaſily be conjectured what ſort of men are choſen to ſerve on juries. The Town Meeting at preſent poſſeſſes the power of electing Jurors. The moſt factious, abandoned, and ſhameleſs are therefore always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to this Office, ſo that they often fit on the grand Jury, to examine evidences againſt themſelves, and on the petit Jury, to try their own miſdemeanors and crimes. The iſſue of the trial cannot be doubted. There is no ſuch thing as publiſhing an adherent of the faction. It would be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full indeed if a knave and plunderer was to give a verdict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>About ſeven years ago, one of the preſent repreſentatives of the Town of Boſton, and alſo one of their ſelect men, and the idol of the faction, thought proper to exerciſe the Boſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man liberty of running a cargo of Madeira wine. This breach of the laws was carried on in the moſt open audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner. Two Cuſtom Houſe Officers on board the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel were put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="59" facs="unknown:014255_0060_0F93590E665556D8"/>
till this exertion of general freedom was accompliſhed; next day the veſſel was ſeized; but the faction muſtered their rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamuffins, attacked the Cuſtom Houſe Officers, knocked down with brickbats and bludgeons the Collector and his Son, the Comptroller and Inſpector. The firſt, an elderly, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable gentleman, has not to this day recovered their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons treatment.</p>
            <p>As this aſſault and riot was committed in open day, the perſons concerned were well known; it was reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them in law: but the faction effectually put a ſtop to this intention; at Town Meeting they choſe the Rioters themſelves Grand Jurymen: the proſecutions were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn of courſe, for it would have been ridiculous to have expended time and money in a cauſe where the delinquents were to be their own Judges.</p>
            <p>The Jurors ought to be appointed by the Sheriff.</p>
            <p>Can peace, obedience to the laws, and loyalty be expected amongſt people under ſuch an abſurd injudicious conſtitution of government? where criminals are placed by their guilty companions on the ſeat of judgment in order to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; where his Majeſty's Counſellors are choſen by the people, and unreſtrained even by the ſolemnity of their oaths, always vote in direct oppoſition to his authority and to the authority of the laws Similar would be the abſurdity if our Houſe of Commons were annually to elect our Houſe of Peers. The Upper Houſe depending on the Lower Houſe for its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical exiſtence, would inſtantly loſe all its dignity, weight, impartiality and independence. Thus his Majeſty's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors in the Province of Maſſachuſets, are only the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable and willing tools of the factious independents and ſmugglers.</p>
            <p>For all theſe reaſons, and that good order and government may be eſtabliſhed in that long diſtracted Provinces, their Town Meetings ſhould be aboliſhed, their Juries ſhould be choſen by the Sheriffs, his Majeſty's Counſellors by himſelf, and their preſent fooliſh inconſiſtent Charter, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect indelible diſgrace on them who penned and paſſed it, ſhould be cancelled, vacated, and anihilated, and another granted them more conformable to the conſtitution of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>

Never was a truth of this kind ſo ſtrongly examplified as in the preſent diſpute betwixt the Engliſh nation and the dirty Mechanics and Smugglers of Boſton. The adherents of the Boſton rabble, with the moſt intrepid effrontery declare <q>that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony between Great Britain and the Colonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued untill it wad diſturbed by the errors and innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his preſent Majeſty's Miniſters.</q> If to deny the authority of the King and Parliament of this kingdom, and to baniſh, plunder, and murder Engliſh ſubjects, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were old London Grocers and citizens of London, and becauſe they acknowledged alleigance to the Mother Country, is a proof of perfect harmony, theſe modeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent hirelings are in the right. That ſuch were the atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious practices of the venerable forefathers of the preſent Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonians have been proved from the public acts of their Great and General Court.

                  <p>I told his Lordſhip that his Majeſty's ſubjects in New England were a virtuous induſtrious people, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally loyal.

                  <p>I prayed his Lordſhip to inſtance in what we had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was anſwered,</p>
                  <p>That we denied the right of the Crown to the woods.</p>

                  <p>That we treated the King's commands as waſte paper, particularly in not ſettling a proper ſalary on our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, which the reſt of the King's Provinces had done, and which had been often and earneſtly recommended to us by the Crown.</p>

            <p>Their Agent, thought it was evidently his intereſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his conſtituents, in every point, of their bad conduct, totally gives them up with regard to their bad uſage of their Governor, their not appointing him an adequate ſalary, their treating his Majeſty's commands as waſte paper, and their votes and reſolutions of Independency.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Negative power, and the right of the King to the woods, which Mr. Agent declared the aſſembly might be juſtified in denying, no doubt, in order to preſerve their favour, the beſt anſwer that can be given will be to quote the Charter itſelf.</p>

            <p>The above letter, and ſome other wholſome advice ſent the Great and General Court, ſo exceedingly diſpleaſed them, that the Houſe of Aſſembly diſmiſſed Mr. Dummer, without paying ſeveral years ſalary which they owed him; and, notwithſtanding he publiſhed a pamphlet in defence of their Charter, on purpoſe to ingratiate himſelf into their good graces, all the compenſation he had was a vote of their Houſe, declaring <q>that it was not for the intereſt of the province to continue him their Agent.</q>

            <p>Whenever the Agents of the Boſtonians fail in procuring the ſubmiſſion of England to their mad ſeditious claims, they are all diſcarded as unſkilful, and unfaithful negotiators.

What their ſucceſs will be, time only can determine; but from the hungry growlings and grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the News-papers, one would be apt to imagine, that the holy men of Boſton had forgot to make remittances.

            <p>TO be reduced to the miſerable neceſſity of combating known and eſtabliſhed facts, is of all ſituations the moſt diſtreſſing; yet ſuch is the voluntary unhappy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the defenders and agents of the rebellious Boſtonians. The promiſed and expected pay of their traiterous employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers wholly depends upon their vigorous efforts here; and what caſe can be more humiliating and deplorable than that of theſe men whoſe intereſt and party engage them to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a cauſe in direct contradiction to their own reaſon and feeling! not poſſeſſed of honeſty and ſpirit ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the infamous taſk, they continue to labour and to drudge in the fruitleſs and ſhameful defence of their treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous and perfidious aſſociates and conſtituents. Virtuous humanity muſt pity, and rigid honour ſpurn at ſuch deep depravity. The Boſtonian writers in the News-papers, and the Boſtonian Speechifiers in Parliament may be both juſtly included in the above deſcription.</p>
            <p>Leaving then the public to the recollection of the enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and barbarities already laid before them, committed by the holy men of the Province of Maſſachuſets, it ſhall be the preſent buſineſs to examine the conduct of theſe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loyal ſubjects, reſpecting their allegiance to the Crown of England.</p>
            <p>During the adminiſtration of that enlightened ſtateſman, Lord Carteret, we find that his Majeſty's ſubjects in New England were as virtuous and univerſally loyal as they are at preſent.</p>
            <p>They denied the right of the Crown to the woods, though that right was expreſsly reſerved to the Crown by the Charter.</p>
            <p>They invaded the prerogative of the King in refuſing the Governors negative power to Laws, Statutes, and Acts of Government, made or done by the Council or Aſſembly, though ſettled and veſted in him by the Charter.</p>
            <p>They voted and reſolved themſelves to be a people Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on England, though they were Engliſh ſubjects,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:014255_0066_0F935912EBF26590"/>
ſettled in a country diſcovered by an Engliſhman, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the Crown of England.</p>
            <p>They treated the King's commands as Weſt Paper.</p>
            <p>They would not ſettle a proper ſalary on their Governors, though it had been often and earneſtly recommended to them by the Crown.</p>
            <p>They at that time treated Colonel Shute, the King's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, with great contempt, as they have ever ſince done all their Governors, becauſe they were not nominated by themſelves.</p>
            <p>And when their Agent was called upon and examined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to their treaſonable intentions, votes, and actions, without entering into a particular vindication of their crimes, he, like their preſent Agents, made, to uſe his own words, <hi>"the beſt excuſe he was able,"</hi> by confidently aſſerting <q>that they were a virtuous people, and univerſally loyal.</q> And this vague, general, falſe aſſertion, was by them always deemed a ſufficient apology for all their rebellious acts.</p>
            <p>When the virtuous and univerſally loyal Saints of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets made the above daring encroachments on the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the Crown, and manifeſted their deſigns to throw off their allegiance, Colonel Shute was their Governor; and if any Governor ſent from this country could have pleaſed them; he certainly would have been the man. He and his family were diſſenters; he had ſerved under King William and the Duke of Malborough, and had been wounded in one of the principal battles in Flanders; he was univerſally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed amongſt his acquaintance, and at Court, and like a true Engliſh ſoldier, was open, and generous, humane; and a <hi>friend to liberty.</hi> But all his good qualities had no effect on the hypocritical traitors of Boſton.</p>
            <p>At this time theſe loyal ſubjects made another flagrant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack on the rights of the Crown. The Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives directed the Governor to give orders to all the<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>During this time they were at war with the Indians.</hi>
               </note> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in command to pay proper deference and obedience to the votes and orders of the Houſe concerning the regulation and management of the forces. This authoritative uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Governor juſtly excepted againſt, and made it a charge againſt the Houſe to the King.</p>
            <p>The malignity and villainy of the profeſſing Saints will be clearly diſcovered by the following fact. As they could not bend the Governor to their purpoſes they were determined to murder him. <q>As he ſat in one of the chambers of his
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:014255_0067_0F935913AAB5DE50"/>
houſe, the window and door of a cloſet being open, a bullet entered through the window and door paſſages, and paſſed very near him.</q> This was called by the righteous <hi>an accident.</hi> But the truth is, that it was a <hi>deſigned villainy</hi> to prevent him from going home to repreſent their uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and treaſons. Immediately after this horrid attempt he embarked ſecretly, and, on his arrival in England exhibited the following articles of complaint againſt the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives for encroaching on his Majeſty's prerogative.</p>
            <p>Their denying the right of the Crown to the trees reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for maſts for the Royal Navy though expreſsly mentioned in their Charter.</p>
            <p>Refuſing to admit the Governor's negative upon their choice of a ſpeaker.</p>
            <p>Aſſuming power to appoint days of faſting and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>Adjourning themſelves to a diſtant day by their own act.</p>
            <p>Diſmantling forts, and directing artillery and warlike ſtores to other than the cuſtody of the Captain General, or his order, and uſurping the command of the forces, the ſole right of the Governor as repreſentative of the King.</p>
            <p>Suſpending military Officers, and refuſing their pay.</p>
            <p>Appointing Committes of their own to direct and muſter his Majeſty's forces.</p>
            <p>Their then houſe (like many of their late houſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, who have aſſumed the liberty of repealing acts of Parliament) voted the above complaint groundleſs, tho' ſubſtantially proved from their own public votes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and ordered the amazing ſum of one hundred pounds ſterling to be remitted to their Agent, to enable him to var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh over the rebellious proceedings of the houſe, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them as well as he was able.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cooke, who had been the principal adviſer, and at the head of all the meaſures complained of in the above me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, was aſſigned the very difficult taſk of defending his traiterous confederates. His notorious abilities, and the one hundred pounds, were, by the Houſe of Repreſentatives, ſuppoſed fully adequate to the accompliſhment of this grand point.</p>
            <p>The light in which his Majeſty's Miniſters viewed Mr. Cooke and the traitors of Maſſachuſets, will be evidently ſeen by the peruſal of the following:</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr. Cooke.</hi> The Report of the Attorney and Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor General is drawn up by men of learning; and, as <hi>I</hi> do not pretend to expreſs myſelf in a ſuitable manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch great men, I hope your Lorſhips will allow me to make uſe of learned Counſel to defend the Province.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lord Preſident</hi> of the Privy-Council. Had you not Counſel allowed you, when your matters were heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Attorney and Solicitor General?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr. Cooke.</hi> Yes, my Lord; but I hope to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that Mr. Attorney and Solicitor General have made ſome miſtakes in their report, if your Lordſhip will allow me to be heard by Counſel.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lord Preſident</hi> of the Privy-Council. Have you any thing new to offer, which has not been offered to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney and Solicitor General?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr. Cooke.</hi> Yes, I have ſomething to ſay about a certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate from the Secretary of the Province, ſworn to by one Mr. Armſtrong, concerning Governor Shute's ordering the Committee to be paid for muſtering the forces.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lord Townſhend,</hi> Secretary of State. Hark you, Mr. Cooke! I ſpeak to you now as a friend. If you inſiſt on being heard by Counſel, no doubt the Lords will hear you; but then I adviſe you to think well of it before you aſk it, for I cannot anſwer where it may end. The expence and trouble you will bring on yourſelf will not be little, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it come into Parliament; and you will play a very bad game, if, ſeeking to be Solemnly heard, you have nothing but trifles to offer in excuſe of a Province that has invaded the King's prerogative in every article of Government, both Civil and Military.</p>
                        <p>You have taken upon you to demoliſh forts, to march armies, to muſter troops, and to disband them when you pleaſe, without any regard to the King's authority.</p>
                        <p>Depend upon it you will find yourſelf miſtaken, if you
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:014255_0069_0F935916541FC390"/>
think a certificate about one ſingle circumſtance will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe all your undutifulneſs to the Crown.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr. Cooke</hi> I hope, my Lord, it will appear that the people of New England are as loyal as any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubject,!</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lord Townſhend.</hi> How does that appear, when you are every day affronting the King in his governor, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the orders of the Government, from hence, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt?</p>
                        <p>As to Colonel Shute he is out of the caſe: You have brought things to that paſs that the queſtion now is, <hi>who is King of New England?</hi> Whether the King, or your houſe of repreſentatives?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr. Cooke.</hi> Sir, I hope we have no ſuch inclination as your Lordſhip ſuppoſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lord Townſhand.</hi> Why all that you have ſaid in your juſtification, ſo far as appears in the papers now read to the Lords, makes againſt you.</p>
                        <p>How do you excuſe the province as to the things laid to your charge? You bring Precedents to ſhew that they have done the ſame things in twenty inſtances before, ſome of which are more criminal than the things complained of. This is a very odd way of juſtifying the conduct of your repreſentatives; and depend upon it the blame will fall very heavy ſomewhere, if you have nothing to offer but trifles in your vindication.</p>
                        <p>As I ſaid before, if you inſiſt on being heard, no doubt the Lords will grant it; but aſſure yourſelf, you will play a very bold game to urge being heard without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very material to ſay in the juſtification of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr. Cooke.</hi> My Lords, if we have made any miſtakes, or taken any wrong ſteps, I hope it will be imputed to the conſtruction we thought we had reaſon to put upon the Charter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lord Townſhend.</hi> As to your Charter you have forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every article of it over and over. There is not one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle that you have not broke through, whenever it ſtood in the way of carrying on your encroachments on the King's prerogative.</p>
                        <p>Pray, Mr. Cooke, let me aſk you, are you that Eliſha Cooke ſo often mentioned in the papers read to the Lords?</p>

            <p>Notwithſtanding all the ſtrong proofs againſt this turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Province, nothing more was done by adminiſtration than to paſs an explanatory Charter, expreſsly declaring the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's power to negative the Speaker of the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, which was thought not to be ſufficiently clear i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Charter itſelf.</p>
            <p>This explanatory Charter the General Court readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and ſubmitted to. They were afraid that the whole controverſy would be carried into Parliament; they knew they were generally condemned in England, that the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

were highly diſpleaſed with them, and they dreaded that the conſequence of a Parliamentary enquiry would be an act to vacate the Charter of the Province.</p>
            <p>A BAD cauſe confounds the beſt advocates; it cannot then be ſtrange to find American writers perplexed, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing arguments which ſerve to deſtroy their own cauſe. They tell us that ſince the American Tea act the Coloniſts have turned ſmugglers, and have furniſhed themſelves with Teas from the French and Dutch, and not only with Teas, but with Wines, Brandy, Silk, Spices, Cambricks, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen printed and plain. And becauſe their Conſtituents have thus acted illegally, and in defiance of the Laws, they wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſe the Britiſh legiſlature to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For the Supreme Legiſlature to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render all its authority, and humbly to proſtrate itſelf to a parcel of American ſmugglers, is to be ſure a new way of ſecuring the obedience and dependance of the Colonies, and effectually proves to us the great m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>deſty and the great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Boſton writers. Since the people of America, from the public confeſſion of their own writers, are ſuch uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſmugglers, a very different method of proceeding with them will very naturally ſuggeſt itſelf to every ſenſible man, and that is, vigorouſly to ſupport the revenue Officers in the ſtrict and vigilant performance of their duty. Their having been hitherto left without protection to the tender mercies of the riotous Boſtonians, has been the true cauſe of the great increaſe of ſmuggling When part of the Revenue Officers were driven away, and the reſt of them intimidated, ſmuggl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It is a well known fact, that beſides va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſorts of goods run into the port of Boſton from France and Holland, and from many of the French and Dutch iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, that in the year 1769, no leſs than <hi>Eight Hundred Cheſts of Tea</hi> were ſmuggled into that Province from St. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatia. The ſmugglers when poſſeſſed of this Tea, by their ranting ſpeeches about oppreſſion and ſlavery, perſuaded the ignorant populace to mob all the merchants, except them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who imported from England, and to take the Tea into cuſtody. By this artful manoeuvre Tea ſoon became ſearce, and as the ſmugglers only produced theirs in ſmall
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:014255_0072_0F93591821DD6B18"/>
quantities at a time, as the remains of what they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported before the non-importation agreement, the price of Tea roſe in a very ſhort ſpace of time, from two ſhillings and three pence, to four ſhillings and ſix pence a pound. This was proved by authentic letters read in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in 1770, when American affairs were the ſubject of debate. It was worth the attention of the ſmugglers to be at ſome trouble in raiſing riots, when the conſequence was to be a continuance of their exorbitant gains. It was curious too that they made the very people, whom they cheated, the inſtruments to cheat themſelves.</p>

            <p>EVER ſince the firſt ſettlement of the Maſſachuſets, the inhabitants of that Province have evidently manifeſted a deſign to throw off their alleigance to the Crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>Government here were far from being inſenſible of their intentions; for the ſeveral adminiſtrations of this country, for theſe <hi>hundred and forty years</hi> paſt, have heartily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to provide and to guard againſt ſuch a fooliſh, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, and diſloyal attempt. Yet, unhappily for this kingdom, the proviſions of our former miniſters were always temporary: Provided they obtained a momentary quiet they were ſatisfied, or appeared to be ſo; they plumed themſelves on the preſent efficacy of their meaſures, and they left future miniſters to ſtruggle with the difficulties in which they had involved the ſtate. Thus the compleat regulation of the turbulent and rebellious New-Englanders was always left as an encumbered legacy to their ſucceſſors. They acted like timid men, who juſt aſſert their claims that their right may not expire, but who leave the trouble, the expence, and the danger of the conteſt to their heirs. Such has been the weakneſs, the timidity, and the pitiful procraſtination of all our former Miniſters.</p>
            <p>As the people of New England found, that amidſt all their daring encroachments and their breaches of alleigance, the good men of England were eaſy to be deceived by hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal profeſſions of loyalty; they were always provided with a plentiful ſtock of verbal obedience, whilſt at the very ſame time they were aſſidiouſly endeavouring to lay the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their independency.</p>
            <p>To be over-reached by the fineſſe of our natural enemies as negociators, has always been the characteriſtic of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:014255_0073_0F935918D65D8660"/>
nation; can it then be wondered at that we have ſo long been trepanned by the holy diſſimulation of our own off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring?</p>
            <p>The indolence of our Miniſters, or rather the dread of giving riſe to even unjuſt clamours againſt themſelves, has foſtered the pride of the Boſtonians, that now they have not only inſolently aſſerted their ideas of their own independence, but alſo have proceeded to overt acts of oppoſition to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of this kingdom.</p>
            <p>That the Boſtonians have ever been turbulent and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, appears not only from the Acts of our King in Council, and from Acts of Parliament, but from their own Acts.</p>
            <p>The Town of Boſton was firſt ſettled in the year 1630, and two years afterwards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> were great diſturbances and diſorders amongſt them, though at that time the Town con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of but a few houſes.</p>
            <p>Next year there were both religious and political confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſtractions among them, and ſuch as had nearly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the plantation.</p>
            <p>In 1634 they raiſed a violent commotion in Boſton, and brought their own Governor, whom they had choſen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to a public trial.</p>
            <p>At this period they called themſelves a Commonwealth; and threw off their alleigance, though their Charter, which only exempted them from taxes for ſeven years, was but five years old.</p>
            <p>It was found neceſſary in 1635 to appoint ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Officers of State Commiſſioners, who were empowered to examine Charters granted by the King or his preceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuance of this Commiſſion, a <hi>Quo Warranti</hi> was brought againſt the Maſſachuſets Charter, in 1636, for their oppreſſive, illegal, and rebellious acts, which are enumerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sir John Banks, the then Attorney General.

            <p>After this the Lords of the Council ſent an order requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to ſend home their patent.</p>
            <p>To this letter they made their uſual anſwer, that is, <hi>great profeſſions</hi> of <hi>loyalty</hi> and godlineſs, which ſerved their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at that time, and they were allowed to retain the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>After this eſcape the wars in England prevented them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended to, and they ſpent the forty enſuing years in quarrelling amongſt themſelves, in robbing and murdering the Indians, in oppreſſing the neighbouring Colonies, and in eſtabliſhing their independency.</p>

               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:014255_0075_0F93591A69666B50"/>
In 1679 they paſſed a law declaring <q>the acts of trade an invaſion of their rights, liberties, and properties, they not being repreſented in Parliament,</q> For this law they ſuffered the loſs of their Charter, notwithſtanding they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated all their former hypocritical profeſſions of duty and loyalty, and appointed many days of faſting and prayer, to obtain the King's favour, and the ſmiles of Heaven.</p>
            <p>To defend their Charter, they ſent home Agents who in their firſt letter acquainted them, <q>that his Majeſty was greatly provoked, and deſired the General Court to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether it was beſt to hazard all rather than ſatisfy his Majeſty as to the mode of Submiſſion to the laws for regulating trade.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In 1683, the QUO WARRANTO arrived, accompanied with a declaration from the King, that if the Colony would make full ſubmiſſion, he would regulate their Charter for his ſervice and their good, and with no further alterations than ſhould be neceſſary for the ſupport of the Government there.</p>
            <p>This favourable declaration had no effect; they refuſed to ſurrender the Charter, and therefore, in 1684, judgment was entered up againſt it.</p>
            <p>Even in the height of the diſobedience they had the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful aſſurance to aſk favours of the King; but they were told by their correſpondents in England, that it was not probable any thing would be done for them till the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Charter, and that the Colony was brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch an actual dependence upon the Crown as became his Majeſty's ſubjects</p>
            <p>They remained without a Charter till after the revolution, when they ſent over Agents to procure the reſtitution of their old Charter, but without ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>A draught of a new Charter was made out and ſhewn to the Rev. Mr. Mather, their Agent, who was ſo diſſatisfied with it, that he declared he would ſooner part with his life than conſent to it. Reply was made to him, <q>that the conſent of the Agents was not deſired; the Agents of New England were not <hi>plenipotentiaries from a Sovereign ſtate;</hi> if they declared they would not ſubmit to his Majeſty's pleaſure, the King would ſettle the country, and they might take what followed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the Charter was granted, Mather accepted it, but Cooke, the other Agent, refuſed. It was, however, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Province, and from its inaccuracy, confuſion, and ill conſtruction, has been one of the principal cauſes of all
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:014255_0076_0F93591B2785B0E8"/>
the commotions and diſturbances in Maſſachuſets for theſe laſt eighty years.</p>
            <p>From this period to the year 1722, the Province was a ſcene of diſſention, and in a continued ferment. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter they then held in England, and with adminiſtraton, may be ſeen in the opinions of Lord Carteret, and the Lords of Council, already printed, by which it is fully proved againſt them, that they had uſurped upon every article of the King's prerogative.</p>
            <p>At this time they had great occaſion for their old canting profeſſions, and accordingly made great uſe of them. Their anſwer to every charge brought and eſtabliſhed againſt them was, <q>that they were a virtuous, godly people, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally loyal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this anſwer, ridiculous, impudent, and falſe as it was, it ſeems, had its effect, though abſolutely contradicted by the whole tenor of their conduct,. for near a century back. For with all this cloud of evidence before them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more was done by the miniſtry than to confirm to the Crown the power of negativing the Speaker of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, which when ſo much was neceſſary to be done, was in a manner doing nothing.</p>
            <p>Indeed adminiſtration all along ſeemed to be exceedingly willing to get rid of them and their affairs, and therefore were content to put up with their deceitful promiſes to be quiet and dutiful.</p>
            <p>From this time till the adminiſtration of Mr. Grenville, many were the inſtances they gave of their refractory and ſeditious ſpirit. Their criminal exceſſes need not at preſent be recounted. In the midſt of their inſurrections Mr. Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville loſt his place, and unhappily for England the men who afterwards were ſo infatuated as to repeal the Stamp Act, ſucceeded. To try to obtain a temporary quiet, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to ſubmit to the mandates of the Boſton rioters, and daſtardly gave up their country's beſt and deareſt rights.</p>
            <p>The following motion made by Mr. Rigby, together with Mr Charles Townſhend's Speech, will ſhew their opinion of the Boſtonians and of American Charters.</p>

            <p>Notwithſtanding this ſpeech, which neither needs eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation nor commentary, nothing was done for the regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Maſſachuſets Charter or any other American Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>By ſuch weak inconſiſtent procraſtination, former Miniſters have tranſmitted down to the preſent miniſter, "the holy Boſtonians," with all their accumulated falſhoods, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and rebellions about them.</p>
            <p>THE great men who ſupport the cauſe of the righteous at Boſton are always convicting themſelves. The more they ſtruggle to veil over their cauſe, the more they expoſe its nakedneſs to public view. Becauſe the Colonies raiſed ſome thouſands of men in the height of their fears to help to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, during the laſt war, it is ſaid that they have borne their full proportion of expence at all times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſupport of the ſtate. It is impoſſible for any aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be more unjuſt and fallacious than this; for the Agents themſelves in their impudent publications confeſs, that England reimburſed the Americans. Granting however that they were at ſome expence to defend themſelves laſt war, is that to be pleaded and ſuſtained as an exemption from
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:014255_0079_0F93591E14A752B0"/>
their bearing any part of the public charge in time of peace? Or is it to weigh with us as an exculpation of their inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and uniform reſiſtance to the authority of the King in Parliament. If it was poſſible to prove, which however it is not, that they bore their ſhare of expence in the laſt war, to what would ſuch a proof amount? Why merely to this, that to preſerve themſelves, they had acted in their own defence. Therefore, to produce the fooliſh ſtory of their having raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men to aſſiſt in protecting themſelves, in order to vindicate their denial of the Supremacy of the Legiſlature of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is weak and contemptible in the higheſt degree, and a giving up of their cauſe.</p>

            <p>FROM the review of tranſactions of Maſſachuſets, from the year 1764 to 1769, it appears, by the report of the Lords Committees, that the people of that Colony have, during that period, acted in conſtant oppoſition to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of his Majeſty, in his Parliament of Great Britain, over that Province.</p>
            <p>They in defiance of the Laws, publicly carried on illegal traffic; they voted, in their Aſſembly, their right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine againſt Acts of our Legiſlature; they admoniſhed the other Colonies to follow their example; they declared they ought not to be taxed, becauſe they were not repreſented; they immediately after inſiſted that they could not be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Parliament, and therefore that they ought not to be taxed, they claimed all the immunities and privileges of Britiſh ſubjects, whilſt they denied the authority of Britain over them, and they voted money to promote a Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Laws of Britain; they, in their Town Meetings, in their Houſe of Aſſembly, and in their Council, openly encouraged and protected thoſe Criminals who had been guilty of the moſt unjuſtifiable enormities, and they as openly proſcribed and condemned all the Crown Officers who had exerted themſelves in the execution of the Laws; they, in their Houſe of Aſſembly, paſſed an act of free and general pardon and indemnity to the Miſcreants who had pulled down and robbed houſes and public offices, and burnt the public records; they alſo voted, in their Houſe of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, that Acts of Parliament were infringements of their natural rights; they, in their Council, ever refuſed aſſiſtance and protection to his Majeſty's Revenue Officers; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gave advice, encouragement, and ſupport, to thoſe who
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:014255_0080_0F93591EF868BC20"/>
acted in direct violation of the Laws of Trade; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Governor to diſmiſs the ſhips of war from the harbour, as theſe ſhips interrupted their clandeſtine trade; and they paſſed votes, ordering the inhabitants of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to arm themſelves, on purpoſe to oppoſe the landing of his Majeſty's troops in the Town of Boſton.</p>
            <p>All theſe facts are taken from the report of the Lords Committees, and are incontrovertible.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of theſe many complicated crimes and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, his Majeſty, in a ſpeech from the Throne in 1768, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the concurrence and ſupport of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to defeat the miſchievous deſigns of thoſe turbulent and ſeditious perſons, who under falſe pretences had but too ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully deluded numbers of his ſubjects in America; and whoſe practices, if ſuffered to prevail, could not fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the moſt fatal conſequences to his Colonies immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the end to all the dominions of his Crown.</p>
            <p>The addreſs of the Lords, in reply, mentioned, that they had felt the moſt ſincere concern tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eignedly gave his Majeſty the ſtrongeſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances that they ſhould ever zealouſly concur in ſupport of every juſt and neceſſary meaſure to repreſs that daring ſpirit of diſobedience, and to enforce a due ſubmiſſion to the laws, and that they conſidered it as one of their moſt eſſential du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to maintain inviolate the ſupreme authority of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature of Great Britain over every part of the dominions of his Majeſty's Crown.</p>
            <p>A few days after, all the American papers were laid before the Houſe of Peers, and their Lordſhips reſolved,</p>
            <p>That the votes, reſolutions, and proceedings of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of Maſſachuſets, reſpecting ſeveral late Acts of Parliament were, ſo far as they imported, a denial of the power and authority of his Majeſty in Parliament to make laws and ſtatutes of ſufficient force and validity to bind the Colonies and people of America ſubjects to the Crown of Great Britain, in all caſes whatſoever, illegal, unconſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, and derogatory of the rights of the Crown and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of Great Britain.</p>
            <p>That the reſolutions of the ſaid Houſe of Repreſentatives of Maſſachuſets, to write letters to the ſeveral Britiſh Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies on the Continent, deſiring them to join with the ſaid
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:014255_0081_0F935920EE10ADC8"/>
Houſe of Repreſentatives of Maſſachuſets, to deny the right of Parliament to impoſe duties and taxes upon his Majeſty's ſubjects in America, are proceedings of a moſt unwarrantable and dangerous nature, calculated to inflame the minds of his Majeſty's ſubjects in the other Colonies, tending to create unlawful combinations repugnant to the laws of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſubverſive of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>That the Town of Boſton, in the Province of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, has been in a ſtate of Great diſorder and confuſion, and that the peace of the ſaid Town has been diſturbed by riots and tumults of a dangerous nature, in which the Officers of his Majeſty's Revenue have been obſtructed by acts of violence in the execution of the laws and their lives endangered.</p>
            <p>That neither the Council of the ſaid Province, nor the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrates, did exert their authority for the ſuppreſſing ſaid riots and tumults.</p>
            <p>That in theſe circumſtances the preſervation of the public peace, and the due execution of the laws, became impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable without the aid of a military force to ſupport and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the civil Magiſtrates, and the Officers of his Majeſty's Revenue.</p>

are diſtinguiſhed for their duty and loyalty to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country and Sovereign. Now when they convince us that loyalty and rebellion are the ſame, we ſhall certainly believe them.</p>
            <p>They have given us many ſpecimens of their loyalty in the <hi>Appeal to the World,</hi> publiſhed by order of the Town of Boſton. In this Appeal they ſet out with abuſing Governor Bernard, General Gage, Commodore Hood the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of the American Board of Cuſtoms and all others who, from their employments, were unfortunately obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide amongſt them.</p>
            <p>A few of their aſſertions may be entertaining.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Nothing can be more falſe and malicious than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent this Town as diſaffected to his Majeſty's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>That the people ſhould entertain the higheſt diſguſt of a Board, inſtituted to ſuperintend a revenue to be raiſed from them without their conſent, which was, and ſtill is, exacted with rigour, is natural.</p>
               <p>But it cannot be ſaid, with the leaſt appearance of truth, that they ſet at defiance the King's Authority.</p>
               <p>Governor Bernard's declarations to his Majeſty's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are grounded on vague, idle reports</p>
               <p>The ordering two regiments from Halifax to this Town, for a purpoſe for which military power was certainly never deſigned—a very dangerous purpoſe, and abhorrent to the Britiſh conſtitution, and the ſpirit of a free Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, namely, to ſupport the civil authority.</p>
            </q>
            <p>They give the following account of a riot, in which they nearly murdered the Collector and Comptroller of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Collector and Comptroller indeed repreſent it as a numerous mob, but they being particularly intereſted, their fears might deceive them. It was occaſioned by the unprecedented and unlawful manner of ſeizing a veſſel.</q>—What they call unlawful manner, was the aſſiſtance given by a man of war's boat. After they had driven the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners out of Town, they called their enforced abſence a "voluntary exile," though the faction had aſſembled pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely at Liberty Tree, as their own Notification expreſſed, <q>to clear the land of the Vermin which were come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In defence of their Town Meetings, they ſay,<q> Such an Aſſembly has ever been the Dread—often the Scourge of Tyrants.</q>
            </p>

               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:014255_0085_0F935926DF282A70"/>
But the moſt capital part of this Appeal, not to the King or the Parliament, but to all the world, is, their declaration againſt all Acts of the Britiſh Parliament. It ſhall be given in their own words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Their rights are invaded by theſe Acts, therefore untill they are all repealed, the cauſe of their juſt complaints cannot be removed. In ſhort, the grievances which lie heavily upon us, we ſhall never think redreſſed, till every Act paſſed by the Britiſh Parliament is repealed, till the American Board of Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, the troops recalled, and things are reſtored to the ſame ſtate they were in before the late extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of adminiſtration.</p>
            </q>
            <p>After reading this Manifeſto againſt all Acts of Parliament for raiſing a revenue amongſt them, no perſon will wonder at their various commotions and inſurrections, but will be ſurpriſed that the regulation of ſuch a rebellious people wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the obſervations of the Merchants of Boſton on ſeveral Acts of Parliament ſhall be taken into conſideration. The Merchants of Boſton form a part of thoſe ſeditious herds of Fools and Knaves which aſſemble on all important occaſions in Faneuil Hall, in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, or in the Council Chamber, at Boſton; in which places, with the moſt ſanctified countenances, they preface their wiſe and learned harangues, and their treaſonable Votes and Reſolves, with humbly beſeeching the Almighty to ſtand forth the champion of rebellion,</p>
            <p>This being the caſe, it is not ſurpriſing that the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the merchants ſhould coincide with the ſeditious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the above mentioned Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>The Boſton Merchants ſet out with telling us, that <q>their repreſentative body have fully and repeatedly remonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſeveral Acts of Parliament paſſed in the fourth, ſixth, and ſeventh years of his preſent Majeſty's reign, as unconſtitutional, and as infringing the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the ſubject.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Acts are deemed by the Boſton Merchants unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional,

and an infringement of their rights, becauſe they are calculated to impede their clandeſtine traffic, and becauſe they raiſe a ſmall revenue on them and the other Colonies, amounting nearly to fifteen thouſand pounds yearly, which is again ſpent amongſt themſelves, whilſt England is at more than twenty times that expence yearly for their protection and defence.</p>
            <q>
               <p>By theſe Acts certain rates and duties are impoſed on Molaſſes, Sugars, Wines, Tea.

            </q>
            <p>All this is exceeding plain, theſe Acts of Parliament great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtrain their illicit trade; and as Government is at a greater expence in guarding their coaſt than the revenue col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by theſe Acts, they modeſtly propoſe that theſe Acts ſhall be repealed that England may bear the whole burthen herſelf. An Engliſhman, however, will not think in this manner; he will naturally be of opinion, that it is but juſt and reaſonable that additional taxes ſhould be laid upon the Americans, in order that they may pay all the charges of their own Government.</p>
            <q>
               <p>When the duty on Molaſſes was ſix pence ſterling a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, as there was no appropriation made of that duty, it was well known in England the Officers of the Cuſtoms connived at the importation; but ſince the duty on mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes has been reduced, the whole, though grievous, has been regularly paid.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Granting this inſinuation of the diſhoneſty of the former Cuſtom Houſe Officers to be true, and that they connived with the Boſton ſmugglers in running Molaſſes; the truth of ſuch connivance is ſurely not a good argument to obtain a licence to continue it. It operates clearly on the oppoſite fide of the queſtion, and is a ſtrong reaſon for more ſtrictly enforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and executing the laws of trade. The duty on molaſſes was at firſt ſix pence a gallon; on the repreſentations and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of the people of Boſton it was lowered to three pence; ſtill they were unſatisfied, but ſaid, if the duty was reduced to one penny a gallon, the ſmallneſs of the duty would take away all inclination to ſmuggle that commodity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the revenue would increaſe. This requeſt was alſo grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and now they tell Parliament that the molaſſes Act
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:014255_0087_0F93592BACCFB5D0"/>
is grievous, unconſtitutional, and as infringement of their rights.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The duty of the five ſhillings per hundred on brown, and twenty-two ſhillings on white ſugars, is a great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on our trade to the foreign Iſlands: That, ſhould we be allowed the free importation of foreign ſugars, even for our own conſumption, the trade of Great Britain would not be injured, but greatly benefitted; for in this caſe more of the ſugars made in the Engliſh Iſlands might be carried to Great Britain, and what they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume would be exported from thence to foreign markets.</p>
            </q>
            <p>With the Boſton Merchants, every regulation, reſtriction, or tax, is a grievous unconſtitutional burden: <hi>one penny,</hi> as well as five ſhillings, is a great burden. If they were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the free importation of foreign ſugars, it might probably be advantageous to them; ſo might the free importation of tea and cordage from Holland, and open trade with all the world: But if the Engliſh ſugars now conſumed in Britiſh America were all brought to England, on account of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans ſupplying themſelves from the French, the market would be glutted, the commodity would become a drug, and our Weſt-India Planters would be ruined.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Cuſtom-Houſe bonds, certificates, oaths, and fees, are alſo great diſcouragements and embarraſſments to the trade of America.</p>
               <p>The appointment of an almoſt incredible number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Officers, as Tideſmen, Boatmen, Waiters, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is another cauſe of complaint.</p>
               <p>The liberty theſe fellows take, of ſearching veſſels, is not only illegal, but impudent.</p>
               <p>Another intolerable grievance is, the appointment of Officers of the Cuſtoms on board the men of war, cutters, and other armed veſſels.</p>
            </q>
            <p>That Smugglers ſhould think bonds, certificates, oaths, and fees, intolerable grievances, and wiſh to be relieved from all legal reſtraints, is natural enough; but that they ſhould write a pamphlet, on purpoſe to convince England that their unlawful goods ſhould be protected from the jaws of theſe devouring monſters, Cuſtom-Houſe Officers, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly manifeſts a moſt extraordinary degree of aſſurance and folly.</p>

               <p>What the Coloniſts have a right to expect is, a Repeal of all the Acts impoſing duties on any kind of goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into the Britiſh Colonies, for the purpoſe of raiſing
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:014255_0088_0F93592C5821FA80"/>
a revenue in America, as being inconſiſtent with their rights as free ſubjects.</p>
            </q>
            <p>If the Boſton merchants will be pleaſed to conſider the heavy load of debt under which England labours, they, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Repeal of all the Acts of Trade and Revenue, have a right to expect that Parliament will paſs a few more, in order to raiſe from amongſt themſelves a ſum ſufficient to pay for their own defence.</p>
            <p>What follows, is the concluſion of this very curious pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Boſton merchants.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The embarraſſments, difficulties, and inſupportable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, under which this trade,</q> (no doubt meaning their illegal trade)<q> has laboured, have already made us prudent, frugal, and induſtrious; and ſuch a ſpirit in the Coloniſts muſt ſoon, very ſoon, enable them to ſubſiſt without the manufactures of Great Britain, the Trade of which, as well as its Naval Power, has been greatly promoted and ſtrengthened by the luxury of the Colonies, conſequently any meaſures that have a tendency to injure, obſtruct and diminiſh the American Trade and Navigation, muſt have the ſame effect upon that of Great Britain, and in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability prove her ruin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Boſton Merchants diſplay a filial affection towards us, for having luckily diſcovered, that if England forces them to contribute ever ſo ſmall a pittance to the ſupport of the ſtate and their own protection, that ſuch conduct will in all probability prove her ruin; they have been at the great trouble and expence of writing a twelvepenny book on purpoſe to inform us of our approaching danger.</p>
            <p>In ſome reſpects, however, the Boſton Merchants differ widely in ſentiment from the reſt of the Saints. The generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people of Maſſachuſets have for the beſt part of two centuries declared, that they were a pious, prudent, frugal, and induſtrious people, but the Boſton Merchants aſſert, that till the fourth year of the preſent reign they were imprudent, prodigal, idle, and luxurious. Theſe accounts rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict each other, and there appears no other way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining them, than by believing that the Boſton Saints and Boſton Merchants will ſay any thing rather than port with their money and their clandeſtine trade.</p>
            <p>Reſpecting their manufactures, Great Britain has nothing to fear from them. It is not to be ſuppoſed that their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures will be very formidable, till unoccupied lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dear and ſcarce, of which there is at preſent but a very diſtant proſpect. It is true they have a large Manufactory
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:014255_0089_0F93587CE986F758"/>
Houſe at Boſton, but the principal Manufacturer ever they had in it was an old Iriſhman, a Manufacturer of Twine, which he himſelf hawked about the ſtreets, and not being able with all his induſtry to procure a livelihood, he fitted up part of this houſe of labour for the accommodation of a Spouting Club, and this Club was ſucceeded by a Dancing Aſſembly, conſiſting of the Boſton Saints and Patriots, who, having quarelled with the Commiſſioners, left them in poſſeſſion of Concert Hall, and metamorphoſed their Boaſted Houſe of Induſtry into a temporary reſidence for diſſipation and intrigue.</p>

            <p>IN the year 1645, a civil diſſention diſturbed the whole Colony of Maſſachuſets, for when they were at peace with their neighbours they always quarrelled amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It was occaſioned by a difference in ſentiment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the identity of <hi>a ſwine</hi> which was claimed by a poor woman as having ſtrayed from her ſome years before, and her title being diſputed by a perſon of more conſequence, not the Court only, but the whole country were divided and inflamed. The identity of the famous Martin Guerre was not more controverted in France in the preceding century. Pity for the poor woman influenced the common people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt right. At laſt the Magiſtrates, who ſupported the oppoſite ſide, for the Magiſtrates were divided too, prevailed upon the right owner, who had recovered judgment, to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the animal that the public tranquillity might be reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>This Hog Controverſy brought on a political conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Aſſiſtants or Council and Deputies or Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, but as each Houſe was equally tenacious of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, they could not come to an agreement: The matter, in diſpute, which reſpected their manner of voting conjunctly, and the executive powers exerciſed by the Aſſiſtants or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors during the receſs of the General Court, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore referred to the ſerious conſideration of their wiſe and holy Saints and Prophets the Parſons, whoſe determination was acquieſced in by both Houſes as they began to be ſick of the contention.</p>
            <p>This ſame year they ſtill continued to perſecute all thoſe who differed from them either in religious or political opinion. The celebrated Sir Henry Vane, afterwards beheaded for being one of the Regicides, in a letter to Governor Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp,

            <p>The mildneſs ſhewn in this letter is the more remarkable, as Winthrop had forced Sir Henry Vane to leave the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Maſſachuſets, and this letter was written when Sir Henry's intereſt in Parliament was very great.</p>
            <p>Next year a complaint was exhibited in England againſt the Colony, by a number of members of the Church of England, for having taken the undue liberty of preſenting a petition to the General Court of the Maſſachuſets, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
            <p>That they might be allowed the free exerciſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, according to their own mode of worſhip:</p>
            <p>That they might be freed from the heavy Taxes impoſed upon them:</p>
            <p>That they might be freed from the illegal impreſſes made of them, their children, and ſervants, into the war:</p>
            <p>That the fundamental laws of England might be made the baſis of their Government, according to the Charter:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:014255_0091_0F93587E85C2F9C0"/>
That they might be ſuffered to enjoy Civil and Religious Liberty.</p>
            <p>This petition rouſed the wrath of the Phariſees and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of Maſſachuſets. The petitioners were apprehended, tried, and convicted of the High crime of preſenting the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. Their houſes were rifled, their papers ſeized; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Mather thundered reproaches againſt them from the pulpit, calling them Hamans, Judaſes, and ſons of Korah; he intreated the Lord to confound them, and then, as if he had received immediate inſpiration from Heaven, he denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the judgments of God upon them. The conſequence of their conviction was, heavy fines and impriſonment, for the Saints of Boſton always had a precious regard for the money of thoſe they oppreſſed; and they alſo ſecured their perſons, that they might not have an opportunity to complain.</p>
            <p>Some of the petitioners, however, made their eſcape, and drew up a repreſentation of their caſe and ſufferings, to which they added the following queries:</p>
            <p>Whether the patent of the Maſſachuſets was confirmed by Parliament, and whether it was not neceſſary it ſhould be?</p>
            <p>Whether the Court may forfeit their Charter?</p>
            <p>Whether, if treaſon be uttered in the pulpit, or in the Court, and not queſtioned, the Court do not conſent to that treaſon.</p>
            <p>Whether it be not high treaſon, as well in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as in Ireland, to endeavour to ſubvert the fundamental laws of England, to take away the liberties of the Engliſh nation, to ſay the Maſſachuſets is a free ſtate?</p>
            <p>Whether the oath of allegiance be not binding in New England?</p>
            <p>Whether the Boſton miniſters may publicly vilify the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nation and laws, and not be queſtioned?</p>
            <p>Whether the petitioners ought to be hindered from ſettling in a church way, according to the churches in England?</p>
            <p>From the above petition, and the queries ſubjoined to it, the tyrannic and rebellious acts of the venerable forefathers of the Boſtonians clearly appear; and it may not be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to add, that the preſent traitors are worthy of ſuch progenitors.</p>
            <p>The Boſton hypocrites inſtructed their agent to make the beſt defence he could againſt theſe petitioners. The diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtate of England prevented any relief being granted the petitioners, or any regulation undertaken for the better go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that refractory Colony.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, that tyrant, Governor Winthrop died, it
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:014255_0092_0F93587F78D15578"/>
was obſerved, that at the firſt ſettlement of the Colony he was of a more tolerant and catholic ſpirit than many of his aſſociates, but that every day he grew more contracted, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goted, and perſecuting. Under the cover of religious zeal and perſecution, he puſhed all his political views. The man however had ſome virtues, the Boſtonians called him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the country; and though he put in execution all their oppreſſive ſchemes, yet they at times both traduced and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated him, which made a deep impreſſion on his mind. The year before his death the <hi>firſt witch</hi> was executed. On his death-bed he was ſtruck with remorſe for his manifold oppreſſions and cruelties, and gave ſtrong proof of it before he expired, by refuſing the Lieutenant Governor, who was preſſing him much to ſign an order for the baniſhment of an heretic, ſaying, <q>He had done too much of that work al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</q>

Theſe enterpriſing gentlemen have no notion of confining their genius, for Way and means, to their own Hemiſphere; they are more adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous, and range the Globe in queſt of prey: To them a voyage of three thouſand miles to the land of good nature is the pleaſanteſt of all employments; their heads teem with ideas of the riches they ſhall acquire, and bags burſting wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thus a Perſon Wheelock will plan a Connecticut Indian College, and detach to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land a Whitaker, his confederate, along with his tawny In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Occum, whom he had taught to preach and to pray, as a juggler learns a dog to play at Cards, a Monkey to walk a minuet, or a Bear to dance a hornpipe, in order to levy contributions on the public. To ſee and hear a converted Heathen, a man in the colour of the Devil, ſpeaking Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and ſolemnly from the pulpit expounding the ſacred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, was altogether irreſiſtable. The plan was well laid—well executed—had its effect—The White American preacher, and the Black American preacher, after having
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:014255_0093_0F93587FEA6D34C0"/>
ranſacked England, Scotland and Ireland, retreated happy with their plunder, leaving the inhabitants of three king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to wonder at their own folly. It would have ſaved the deluded people of this country ſome thouſands, if the ſooty intepreter of the Scriptures and his deceitful guide had met with the ſame fate which befel an ingenious Boſtonian artiſt many years before their pious and profitable expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This artiſt toiled aſſiduouſly a whole twelvemonth in carving an image in wood of the famous Mohawk, King Hendrick. When this great work was finiſhed it was the admiration of the Boſtonians, and the ladies themſelves view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rapture a naked male figure nine feet high, though ſurrounded with the implements of riot, murder, and war. To have circumſcribed ſuch a proof of genius, within the continent of Britiſh America, would have been extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious; his own countrymen would gape and wonder, but they never willingly part with the Caſh Warm there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with hopes of an immenſe fortune, he embarked for England, and in due time arrived at Plymouth, landed his wooden monarch, and diſtributed his hand bills; but O dire misfortune! there happened to be a hot preſs. Mr Welſh being threatened to be laid hold of as a vagrant, and forced <hi>againſt his conſent</hi> to ſerve his living Majeſty King George the ſecond, inſtead of voluntarily exhibiting his deceaſed Majeſty King Hendrick of America, thought proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp. But it would be great injuſtice to the Americans to reſt all their merits on their Indian preachers and their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of images; they are poſſeſſed of many other talents; they are Merchants or Miners, whenever they meet with any credulous gentlemen that will ſell them goods, for which they never will pay, or who will purchaſe of them ſhares of New England Mines, to the amount of ſeveral thouſands of pounds, which Mines never will be worked. This will, no doubt, both ſurpriſe and ſhock many gentlemen, who have within theſe three laſt years, advanced conſiderable ſums to a ſuppoſed American Mine proprietor. The Mines lay no where but in his tongue, and with that he undermined them. It is true, he produced ſpecimens of rich ore, but it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, to ſpeak in Doctor Franklin's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He was proprietor of all ſorts of Mines: If the perſon he was treating with wiſhed to purchaſe a ſhare in a Copper Mine, he had the richeſt in the world; if another choſe a Silver Mine, the anſwer was the ſame; thoſe who were for Lead or Gold, were alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated: whether in London or in the Country, he diffuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed general ſatisfaction; and, in a ſmaller degree, the South Sea and Miſſiſippi ſchemes were revived. In confirmation of all he ſaid, his rich ſpecimens were ſhewn, and he left his fooliſh purchaſers indulging in golden dreams, whilſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with their real property. With merchants he was a merchant, which ſome will unhappily feel the effects of. In his tour through this iſland he happened, at a large manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factoring Town, to meet in company a Merchant, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to retire from trade as ſoon as he could ſell off his ſtock: The moment our Miner heard this, he was one of the moſt extenſive merchants in America; he dealt in every thing, and could diſpoſe of any thing: Thus, the Merchant being ready to ſell, and the Miner as ready to buy, a bargain was ſoon ſtruck, and all the ware<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>houſe full of goods, to a very great amount, was packed up, old and new, wholeſale and retail: They were immediately after ſhipped for America, but the remittances are yet to come.

               </note> and a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Souls the Reverend Mr. Ewing. The important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which theſe gentlemen have taken the trouble to viſit us upon, is, that at Philadelphia, Dr. Franklin's reſidence, when in America, they have an inclination to build a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and to endow it; they do not want learned men and Profeſſors, for theſe are already prepared amongſt themſelves;
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:014255_0095_0F9358819BBE8618"/>
they only want magnificent apartments and good ſalaries; and to obtain theſe neceſſary comforts of life, they have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſked the dangers of the Atlantic On week days, the Phyſical gentleman is to talk us out of our money, if he can; and on Sundays the Reverend gentleman is to preach us out of it, if he can. The American AEſcuſapius is the leader and conductor of this great, wiſe, and modeſt expedition; and of all men amongſt the loyal and dutiful inhabitants of Philadelphia, one more unfit could not have been found. He may, perhaps, be quite profound in his profeſſion, but however that may be, he is almighty in politics: He holds it as incontrovertible, that England has no authority over the Colonies: He talks with a ſneer of contempt of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutiveneſs of this Iſland, and with a tone of authority of the vaſt magnitude of America; he ſpeaks with feigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret of the approaching downfall of Britain, and, with an air of protection and triumph, offers its inhabitants ſhelter in the Colonies; and, notwithſtanding all this, he thinks that he acts with the greateſt prudence and circumſpection, becauſe he does not condeſcend to enter into an argument: Reaſon he will not; but after delivering his ſentiments with oracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pompoſity, he gathers himſelf up in his chair with an air of the greateſt importance, erects his head, and looks over his long noſe at the reſt of the company, with a ſerenity and dignity of countenance only becoming a Gulliver amidſt his Lilleputians. Thus the loyal and conſiſtent Conſtituents of Doctor Franklin, at Philadelphia, who deny the authority of our ſupreme Legiſlature, who refuſe to contribute a farth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards their own protection, who call us tyrants and plunderers, and who, at this very time, are eſtabliſhing ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Poſt-Offices, in oppoſition to thoſe of Government, that they may lay their hands on all our letters private as well as public, have ſent over a couple of their wiſe and holy men to abuſe us to our faces, and then to beg our money; which obtained, they will retire to their beloved America, and there with their aſſociates, they will wanton in luxury at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Engliſh Generoſity.</p>

                  <head>STATE PAPER. Copy of a letter from Edward Winſlow, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Agent for the Province of Maſſachuſets Bay, to the Commiſſioners of the United Colonies.</head>

                  <p>Yeſterday, as I am informed, Mr. Coddington had ſomething done for him at the Council of State; which I believe was his Patent confirmed. The truth is, ſince I perceived by letters from Plymouth, that, after another years warning, nothing is likely to be done in reference to the old order of the Lords and Commons ſent over in 1647, as I take it, I looked upon it as a vain thing to ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtream, when as indeed that was the material main objection, above a twelvemonth ſince; and if I could not then anſwer it, how much leſs now, after another year if not eighteen months expiration; but the will of the Lord muſt be done! However, I ſuffer in my reputation here; to make ſo great a buſtle at firſt, and then to let all fall at laſt; had I not received particular inſtructions from Plymouth herein, I had never ſtirred in it; but I ſhall be more wary hereafter, how I engage in buſineſs of that nature; yet, when I have ſaid it, ſhall not dare to neglect the leaſt ſervice wherein any or all of the United Colonies are concerned.</p>
                  <p>Here is great murmuring at the great proviſion of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſhot; the ſeveral ſhins get licence for, year after
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:014255_0097_0F935882E6C15748"/>
year, forty barrels of powder, and fifty barrels is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary proportion to a ſhip, nay ſometimes a hundred, and lead and arms proportionable.</p>
                  <p>It is laid to our charge, that, being Cuſtom free, we enrich ourſelves by furniſhing Barbadoes and Virginia, though enemies, with that and other commodities; and there hath been, on that very account, a ſerious debate about revoking our free Cuſtom and Exciſe.</p>
                  <p>I have laboured in it, and ſatisfied many of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament and Council of State of your care not to ſuffer any powder, more than ſhips ſtore, to be tranſported away; that we are fain to land all we bring hither, for fear of firing the ſhips in the river, and we muſt get licenſe for that alſo, upon return; that the Maſter is forced to take licenſe for more than he buys, that he may bear out his paſſengers particular ſtores.</p>
                  <p>I have ſhewed them, that we only had ſuffered with and for them; and, for their ſakes, were hated of all the Engliſh abroad.</p>
                  <p>This hath made a preſent ſtop: But I aſſure you it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the country to take notice of it, and be careful that our merchants, and ſuch as trade thither, abuſe not the freedom we enjoy; nor know I better to whom to impart it than to you, the Commiſſioners, that are Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the united Colonies.</p>
                  <p>I pray God direct you herein, amongſt other the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty occaſions of the country.</p>

            <p>By this authentic letter we find, that the confederated New England Colonies paid as little reſpect to the orders of the Lords and Commons, during the time of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as they now pay to Acts of Parliament. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Lords were, to ſend home their Patent for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If this Agents of theirs was not the moſt clear and diſtinct writer, at leaſt he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

his reputation, and a due ſenſe of honour, by his complaints of the conduct of his conſtituents, even to themſelves: But rightly judging that his injured character would receive no reparation from them, like an honeſt ſenſible man, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he will be more cautious, in future, how he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes any buſineſs for them, and then, like a good Chriſtian, reſts his caſe with the Lord.</p>
            <p>Indeed, whenever their Agents implicitly followed their directions, they always involved them in falſehoods, in dirty work, and in diſgrace. They never were ſo well provided in that reſpect as they are at preſent; they have got a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man of their own, and one of a mind congenial with themſelves.</p>
            <p>At this period of time Barbadoes and Virginia held out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Commonwealth, yet we find that the Boſtonians ſupplied them with powder, ſhot, and arms, which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſerious debates in Parliament, and the Council of State, about revoking their free cuſtom.</p>
            <p>By their Charter they were only freed from paying or yielding any cuſtom or ſubſidy, either inward or outward, for the ſpace of ſeven years, from its date, which was March the 4th, 1629, ſo that their exemption from cuſtoms and ſubſidies was expired about fifteen years.</p>
            <p>Their Agent ſeems to have made a very ingenious excuſe for their exporting ſuch great quantities of powder and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warlike ſtores, but unluckily happened to be miſtaken; for the Commiſſioners for the United Colonies confeſs, in their reply, dated September 11th, in the ſame year, <q>with reſpect to the trade of powder, we cannot but fear it hath been too exorbitantly managed by ſome, though the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Colonies in many reſpects are deeply concerned and hazarded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If they were hated, as they tell us themſelves, in the laſt century, by all the Engliſh abroad, it may be ſaid with the greateſt truth, that in our days, their general character is univerſally deſpiſed over all the Continent of Britiſh Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Though the other Colonies will confederate with them againſt the payment of taxes, yet that does not obliterate the contempt and deteſtation which they entertain for the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Saints of Boſton.</p>
            <p>Their Agent takes leave with a very proper admonition to the merchants, not to abuſe the freedom which they enjoyed, and prays GOD to direct them. Inſtead of taking his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they continued to break through all reſtraint, and have till this hour continued refractory and rebellious.</p>

            <p>IN the days of Oliver, the Boſtonian Phariſees and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors out canted that long practiſed and through paced Hypocrite himſelf. As they ſtiled themſelves the family of God wreſtling with the wants of a wilderneſs, in the ends of the earth, Cromwell took compaſſion upon them, and having entirely conquered Ireland he was very deſirous of removing the dear Saints of God, from their barren deſarts, to the Iriſh Canaan, which he had juſt ſubdued.</p>
            <p>Upon this occaſion the Boſtonian Hypocrites were caught in their own ſnare Their complaints, concerning their poor and mean condition, were not deſigned to obtain a removal and a new ſettlement, but were intended to impreſs the ſtate with an opinion of their poverty, in order that they might preſerve themſelves from paying Cuſtoms and Taxes, as the years of their exemption from both, by their Patent, were long expired.</p>
            <p>The Family of God having thus, by their hypocritical whimpering, brought themſelves into ſuch a dilemma, they were under the neceſſity of aſſembling together, for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying purpoſe of contradicting all their paſt repreſentations, on purpoſe to prevent their re-tranſportation.

                        <p>That we did profeſſe we came into theſe remote partes of the earth to enjoy the Liberties of the Goſpel, in their puritie, which hitherto, we have, through the Grace of Chriſt, had, without reſtraint, theſe twenty-three years and above.</p>
                        <p>That God hath bleſſed the country with plentie of food of all kindes, generallie through the land, inſomuch that there are many thouſands of buſhels of graine, and other proviſions of beef and pork, yearly tranſported to other places. And where there be any poore people, through age, or weaknes, or loſſes by fire, or other hand of God upon them, or their eſtates, the churches, or towns, or both, doe contribute to their wants. So that povertie cannot, truly, be alleaged to be a ground of remouall.</p>
                        <p>That God is pleaſed hitherunto to maintayne unto us all his Ordinances, both in Church and Commonwealth, whereby ſpreading errors in judgement are ſuppreſſed.</p>

Suppoſing Oliver really to be an Enthuſiaſt, the General Court of the Maſſachuſets ſet out very artfully; they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that through the holineſs of their life they had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great influence with the Almighty, the God of Battles, and that out of Gratitude for Oliver's tender care of them, they would uſe their intereſt with Jehovah, that all his great and godly undertakings might proſper. Setting aſide the blaſphemous impudence of this pretenſion—what could be better calculated to gain the favour of a religious and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Enthuſiaſt?</p>
            <p>It has always been the practice of the people of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets, when the ſtate here undertook to regulate them, to ſay, that the information, upon which Government pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, was given by their enemies, when, in truth, it was founded on their own authentic publications and public acts. At this time, however, it was neceſſary for them to deny all that they had publiſhed of the barrenneſs of the wilderneſs they inhabited, that they might, with the better grace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the invitation given them of tranſplanting themſelves to Ireland.</p>
            <p>Now, therefore, the barren d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſart was inſtantly transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a land flowing with milk and honey. God had bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them with plenty of food of all kinds, and that in ſuch ſuperabundance, that they yearly exported thouſands of buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of grain, and other proviſions of beef and pork. They could ſupport all their aged, their ſick, and their poor. They could afford to re-eſtabliſh all thoſe who ſuffered by fire, or other accidents, by contributions. So that poverty could not truly be alleged as a reaſon for tranſplanting them. The preſent Hypocrites and Rebels of Boſton proceed exactly in the ſame manner at this time. When Parliament lays a tax upon them, they cry out bitterly, that <q>the Revenue Officers are devouring monſters, who ſuck their very life blood while it is ſtreaming from their veins;</q> and yet, ſoon after, they tell us, with an air of diſdain, <q>that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had better repeal the Tax, as the duty does not pay the expence of raiſing it.</q> A Boſtonian never minds what contradictions and falſehoods he utters, provided he can carry his point.</p>
            <p>As to the Liberties of the Goſpel, they might have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in as great purity in Ireland.</p>
            <p>It is true, that they maintained all their Ordinances, both in Church and Commonwealth, by fining, impriſoning, whipping, baniſhing, or hanging, all who diſſented form
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:014255_0102_0F93588766307958"/>
them in matters either civil or religious; which was their method of ſuppreſſing errors in judgment.</p>
            <p>Previous to Cromwell's invitation, whilſt they were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Indians for the ſake of their lands, they always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> bewaild their own dangerous ſituation, expoſed, as they were, to the ravages and cruelties of the barbarous Heathen Savages; but now, when a propoſal was made for their removal to Ireland, where there were no Indians, and where they could live in ſafety, theſe bloody Barbarians of Indians were, in a moment, converted to the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt; they could read and write Engliſh comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and they could alſo pray and prophecy, in a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, with great gravity, reverence, and zeal.</p>
            <p>As the Commonwealth Parliament had, at this very time, ordered, that all proceſſes ſhould be in their name, and that the Maſſachuſets Patent ſhould be ſurrendered, and a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of it accepted, as a proof of the ſubmiſſion of the Colony to their authority; the dear Saints of God incloſed, in their letter to Oliver, a copy of their petition to Parliament, in which they refuſed to ſubmit to either to theſe orders, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they did not diſcern the need of obeying ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions: In order to ward off puniſhment for ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed diſobedience, they beſeech Oliver to uſe his intereſt in their behalf, that the Work of God in the Wilderneſs might not be obſtructed, and, in return they promiſe their intereſt with the Captain of the Hoſt of Iſrael, the God of Armies. Whether Cromwell, on account of this pretended intereſt with the God of Battles, gave up his own project, and uſed his influence with the Parliament, or whether the civil war, which ſtill continued, and the other very important objects they were engaged in, diverted their attention, cannot be ſaid poſitively,—but as to this period we hear no more of tranſplanting the Saints to Ireland, or of recalling their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>IF your correſpondent, who ſigns himſelf a White man, had attended to the very firſt line of the Speculation relative to American Adventurers, he would not have charged the Writer with general reflections on a whole country; for in that firſt line, the modeſty and merit of <hi>ſome</hi> of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can gentlemen are mentioned; now <hi>ſome</hi> cannot mean the <hi>whole,</hi> and therefore cannot be a general reflection. It is readily allowed, that there are many gentlemen of integrity, abilities, and loyalty, in the various parts of Britiſh Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and eſpecially in the Maſſachuſets; but it is as certain,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:014255_0103_0F9358881B9AB238"/>

            <p>Concerning the money-collecting expedition of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend triumvirate, the two White Parſons and the Black one, their deſign in raiſing contributions might be pious, but the uſefulneſs of it may be doubted The American Clergy have been drawing money from this good natured country for more than a century paſt, for the laudible purpoſe of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelizing the Heathen, and they have indulged us, at laſt, with the ſingle and ſingular exhibition of that Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Indian, the Sooty Mr. Occum. After all, it is not ſo much the miſapplication of the money when collected, that is found fault with, as the folly of our having contributed to it.—Reſpecting that "ingenius Impoſtor," the Miner, your correſpondent of Saturday is probably miſtaken, with regard to that rogue's having no recommendations; for it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fact, that he was fitted out by that wiſe head of the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mr. Hancock, who alſo complimented him with the uſe of the cabbin of one of his veſſels bound to this country: So that we are obliged to that great Boſton patriot for whatever honour and advantage we received from the viſit of his townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the American Phoenomenon. If we had money to ſpare, if the Americans were dutiful, if all our own poor were only provided with bread, excluſive of learning, Doctor William<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and his Reverend Companion (who is really a good ſort of man) might have ſome plea for aſking ſubſcriptions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eſtabliſhment of a "Seminary of Literature" at Philadelphia: But circumſtanced as we are at preſent—Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica in rebellion, ourſelves bending under the heavy load of taxes incurred in defence of America, and numbers of the moſt induſtrious members of our community, with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, begging in the ſtreets—in ſuch a ſituation to part with our money, on purpoſe to inſtitute a ſeminary of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in America, would not be a proof of our generoſity and wiſdom, but of our blindneſs and folly.—That the money, when collected, would be applied to the purpoſe for which it was raiſed, need not be doubted: It is not the miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the money, but the collection of it which is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is true that the Doctor and his Reverend companion are out of England, becauſe they are at preſent in Scotland, no doubt with an intent, as the General Aſſembly is now ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to procure its ſanction and recommendation to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:014255_0104_0F935888D55A2BD8"/>
of the different pariſhes throughout that kingdom, that collections may be made in all the Churches, as was the caſe in Whitaker and Occum's expedition. But if the Scotch, amidſt the wreck of their affairs, and whilſt their very Banks are becoming bankrupt, contribute a farthing towards the Doctor's ſcheme, we ought to rebuild the Roman wall, and confine them with their folly and their paper credit, to their own barren mountains That men, ſuppoſed to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe ſhould plan ſuch an excurſion, and think to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, conſidering our preſent ſituation with regard to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is really unaccountable and marvelous. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans refuſe to contribute either to their own protection, or to the ſupport of the State; and yet they ſend off a party to beg our money for the inſtitution of a College. If all was right in America, it would be but juſt in us to aſſiſt them, even if by that aſſiſtance we ſhould be put to ſome difficulties our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. That ſuch time may ſoon arrive muſt be the ſincere wiſh of every good ſubject. When peace and unanimity are reſtored, every individual in the Mother Country will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their affection for the Colonies; for the generoſity and humanity of the Engliſh nation are boundleſs as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
            <p>THE Saints profeſſing loyalty and godlineſs at Boſton, ſend us, by every veſſel from their Port, accumulated proofs of their treaſons and rebellions. That mighty wiſe Patriot, Mr. John Hancock, from the old South Meeting Houſe, has lately repeated a haſh of abuſive, treaſonable ſtuff, compoſed for him by the joint efforts of the Reverend Divine Samuel Cooper, that Roſe of Sharon, and by the very honeſt Samuel Adams, Clerk, Pſalm-finger, Purlonier, and Curer of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. This great and honourable Maſter Hancock is very well known in London to many; indeed, unfortunately for them, too well known; for they would now eſteem themſelves happy, if they had never heard of him before this fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Oration. When he was in London about twelve years ago, he was the laughing-ſtock and the contempt of all his acquaintances: inſtead of attending and puſhing his mercantile intereſt, viſiting the different curioſities in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Town, and forming reputable connections, as a young man of his great fortune ought to have done, he kept ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lurking about the kitchen of his uncle's correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, drank tea every day with the houſe-maid, and on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days eſcorted her to White Conduit Houſe. People unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Mr. Hancock's natural condition thought, that his
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:014255_0105_0F935889A4ACEE68"/>
cloſe attendance and attention aroſe from an amorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection; but his old ſchool-fellows and intimates knew, that though nature had beſtowed upon him a human figure, ſhe had denied him the powers of manhood. The girl was therefore in perfect ſafety, though unconſcious of it. The ſenſe of his incapacity could not however hinder him from thinking; perhaps the Fair Sex took poſſeſſion of his head, and no doubt he loved them as well as he was able. When he arrived in America, his uncle, who knew his weakneſs and want of capacity, kept him at a diſtance form company; but as ſoon as he died, Flatterers, Rogues, and Knaves of all ages and all profeſſions, flocked about him, as Vultures, Cormorants, and Carrion Crows flock abaut a dead Carc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe: It is a melancholy conſideration, that good natured folly ſhould be plundered and ſtript by ſuch a neſt of Villains as he aſſociates with. His fortune has long been in the wane. Such is the character, and ſuch the ſituation of this ſimple Creature, who has been perſuaded to form the extravagant ſcheme of conquering England in the Pulpit of the Old South, and in the Deſk of the Boſton Town Hall. This Boſtonian Orator ſets out with telling the ſeditious Starers and Gapers around him, with what awe, their attentive gravity, their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable appearance, and the dignity on their countenances, ſtruck him! It will readily be believed that they were very attentive to their own praiſe, with which it muſt be ſaid he plentifully beplaſtered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>; but it may be ſuſpected, that the venerable appearances were nothing more than the grins of grey headed folly. As to this dignity in their countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it would have been an entertaining and highly ludicrous ſight, to have ſeen the greaſy rebellious Rogues ſwelling themſelves up, and ſtruggling to aſſume an air of conſequence. We agree with the Orator, when he confeſſes his want of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and unworthineſs, which is one of the few truths in his traiterous Oration. This ſpeechifying Fool aſſures his Rebel Audience, that it would be to the laſt degree vicious and infamous in them to attempt to ſupport the Government of England; that a traiterous plot is deviſed by the mother country againſt them; that Great Britain has omitted no means of procuring their deſtruction; that Great Britain has declared ſhe has full power to make laws of ſufficient va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity to bind the Colonies; that ſhe has exerciſed this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended right by impoſing on them a Tax; that ſhe has ſent her fleets and armies to enforce her mad pretenſions; that he himſelf glories in publicly avowing his eternal enimity to Britiſh tyranny; that he prays perpetual infamy may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed

upon that villain who adviſed the execrable meaſure of taxing them, and of ſending troops to enforce obedience to Acts of the Britiſh Parliament, which neither God nor man ever empowered them to make: That the Soldiers were unfeeling ruffians, who viciated their morals—who broke in upon their ſolemn devotions in their temples, on the day hallowed by Heaven, and ſet apart by God himſelf for his peculiar worſhip—who taught their youth idleneſs and luxury, extravagance and effeminacy; and that he was compelled to acknowledge that even the nobleſt, faireſt part of all the lower creation did not entirely eſcape the ſnare.—Such a train of falſehood, madneſs, and rebellion, needs neither commentary nor explanation. The ringleaders ought to be taken up, and hanged round their own Town Hall; and, if there is a man in this kingdom ſo infamous, and ſo loſt to all ſenſe of loyalty, as to ſtand forth their champion, he ought to be treated as the parricide of his country.</p>
            <p>When Orator Hancock, the nominal head, yet the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and plundered tool of the Boſton rebels, charged the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with enſnaring their wives and daughters, he ought to have eſtabliſhed the fact, by producing, at leaſt, one evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of it; but the truth is, that this aſperſion was only thrown out to abuſe the troops, and to keep up the averſion of the people; for ſo far from giving the Officers and Soldiers acceſs to their houſes, their wives, and their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the factious profeſſing Saints would not even provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of quarters for the regiments—no, not even a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not a common ſhed, from the inclemencies of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. After a long, deſultory, falſe, and treaſonable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, the <hi>prompted idiotic Orator</hi> proceeds to the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which occaſioned his appearance in the pulpit of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, <q>on that diſmal night when Hell was ſuffered to take the reins, when Satan, with his choſen band, opened the ſluices of New England's blood, and ſacraligiouſly pollut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the land with the dead bodies of her guiltleſs Sons.</q> Theſe guiltleſs ſons were five of the faction, who aſſembled with many hundereds of their confederate rebels, to drive the ſoldiers out of town, and to plunder the Cuſtom-Houſe cheſt of all the Revenue raiſed in America. One of them, who lived ſome days after he was wounded, repeatedly and ſolemnly declared, on his death bed, that he had often ſeen riots in Ireland, but that he had never in his life time ſeen ſoldiers ſuffer ſuch a violence of attack, and ſuch an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of bad uſage ſo long, without firing. In ſhort, the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:014255_0107_0F93588B1FD3FEB8"/>
whole was a villianous plot of the faction; they imagined that the troops would not dare to fire without the orders of a magiſtrate, and therefor, that they would be able to turn them out of Town without any danger. Theſe guiltleſs Sons had knocked down ſome of the ſoldiers, were wreſting their muſkets from them, and were puſhing into the Cuſtom Houſe at the time they were fired at; and one of theſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, immortal, free-born ſons of New-England, was an able bodied Moiatto ſlave. The faction at Boſton, although they had fomented and conducted the inſurrection and attack on his Majeſty's troops and Cuſtom houſe, yet they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the evidence and perjuries of upwards of fifty of the rioters themſelves, to eſtabliſh a proof that the ſoldiers were the aggreſſors; but the perjuries were ſo contradictory, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, and glaring, that they failed in this their wicked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Upon this failure they tried another attrocious vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy, which was to prove againſt ſome Cuſtom-houſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, that during the aſſault on the troops, ſeveral of the Officers had fired on the rioters from the Cuſtom-houſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and for this damnable purpoſe they ſuborned ſeveral of their adherents to perjure themſelves; and likewiſe by threats, impriſonment, and promiſes of reward, ſo intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated a ſervant of one of the Revenue Officers, as to oblige him to ſwear that his Maſter, and ſeveral others, fired from the windows of the Board of Cuſtoms. But all theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned and perjured evidences were controverted, in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt ſatisfactory manner, by poſitive proofs being brought that the Officers charged, were long before the time of the firing, at the time of the firing, and long after it, at a houſe half a mile diſtant from the Cuſtom-houſe: other witneſs a proved, that the Officers were not in the Cuſtom-houſe that night; and beſides, ſeveral of the moſt reſpectable merchants in Boſton, one of whom was ſhot through the arm, gave in evidence, <hi>"that they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But this puniſhment could not

Therefore, Orator Hancock's long rebellious Oration, in commemoration of this traiterous inſurrection, and of the ſhocking deſigned villainy and perjury of the faction, only ſerves to keep alive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their own moſt deteſtable infamy and proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p>In the General Court's letter to Oliver, excuſing themſelves from removing to Jamaica, they ſeemed to be aware of theſe <hi>juſt complaints,</hi> which they ſtiled according to their preſent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, <hi>clamours</hi> and <hi>calumnies;</hi> and they promiſed Oliver never to ceaſe praying for him, provided he continued to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all they ſaid, and to befriend them.</p>
            <p>They alſo wrote a letter to Mr. Hopkins, a gentleman in great favour with Oliver, aſſuring him, that though they had not hitherto returned him their grateful acknowledgments for the many ſingular expreſſions of his faithful love, yet their beſt deſires at the throne of grace had not been wanting to implore a rich recompence of reward on his head and heart, as well as on many others whom the Lord had ſtirred up to wiſh well to his exiled ones in theſe parts; that they were not without hope that the Lord would more and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, according to the mercies he received; and that the Lord, who was and would be a rich paymaſter in the end, put into his hands opportunities of acting for his ſervice whilſt here. They then beg his continued helpfulneſs and aſſiſtance to Leveret, their Agent, in promoting their affairs with his Highneſs the Lord Protector, and his honourable Council, and conclude with telling him, that they offer up daily prayers for his proſperity.</p>
            <p>Vindicating the oppreſſions and perſecutions of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees of Maſſachuſets, giving credit to the excellent charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they gave of themſelves, and refuſing redreſs to the many juſt complaints preferred againſt them, was in their

            <p>As their uſurpations were numerous, ſo were the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations againſt them. This occaſioned the General Court to draw up inſtructions to their Agent, ſome of which are as follow:</p>

Such replies and vindications as theſe to be ſure are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing. When they ſeize a province to deſire their Agent to make the beſt anſwer he can, and when they invade every prerogative of Majeſty to tell him to make the beſt excuſe he is able, was always their method of procedure, and when joined to their common phraſe, that they were a virtuous, godly and uninverſally loyal People, was all the defence they ever made for their many crimes and treaſons.</p>
            <p>THE Select men of Boſton, who have fomented ſo many dagerous and traiterous inſurrections, and who have given ſuch continued trouble to our ſupreme legiſlature, are after all the moſt ignorant, aſſuming, and deſpicable fellows in the Creation. One of them is a Bankrupt Merchant; a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a noble Tinman; a third, an old retailer of Wine and Cyder, but who now acts as Shopman to his wife; a fourth, that poor plucked gawky, Orator Hancock; and a fifth, a redoubtable Taylor, who ſhall be the ſubject for the day, This valiant Taylor had the honour, a few years ago, to be Lieutenant Colonel of the Boſton Militia, whoſe ragged figures and aukwardneſs far outſtrip our City Train Bands. At that time an Engliſh gentleman in Boſton had a curioſity to obtain a liſt of certain Toaſts, which were given in the Council Chamber on his Majeſty's Birth Day, and having ſome knowledge of this warlike Taylor, ſent a Card to him, requeſting a copy of the Toaſts in writing.

This fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of the Boſton Faction is alſo ſingularly notorious, for many very extraordinary mercantile exploits, both on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Continent, and in the Weſt India Iſlands.

            <p>TO induce us to ſubmit to the knaves and rogues who lead or drive the geeſe, calves, and aſſes, that compoſe the Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Faction, their hoary hireling, the learned Doctor Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, of Philadelphia, avers, that if we decline to acquieſce in ſuch meaſures as he ſhall dictate to us from his rebellious conſtituents, that the Empire of Britain ſhall diſappear from before the face of other nations, like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion, and that ſhe ſhall ſink, never more to riſe; yet according to this learned Gentleman, we may, in a moment, not only make the rebels at Boſton quiet, but affectionate; to reſtore peace, force is unneceſſary; as he tells us, in his "intended Speech before the Houſe of Lords," that we have only to indulge the Boſtonians in doing whatever they pleaſe, and then they will favour us with their good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that by ſuch means we gained and long preſerved their affection; and that we loſt that affection when we required them to pay a <hi>trifle</hi> towards their own ſupport. Can any thing be more reaſonable than what this wiſe Philoſopher aſks for his conſtituents; They will condeſcend to ſpeak well of us, if we will be ſuch fools as to defend them againſt all their enemies, without inſiſting that they ſhall pay any part of the expence. It is ſurely a concluſive argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt taxing America, to tell us, that former Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons never thought of it, that England had always been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral to the Americans, had granted bounties on many of their commodities, had reimburſed them the expences of laſt war, and had, at all times, defended them againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, at an expence ruinous to herſelf:—All theſe, on the contrary, are powerful reaſons why the people of America ſhould not be allowed to remain any longer untaxed; nothing can be more juſt and equitable, than that they ſhould pay

Mr Rome's letter, publiſhed by the fooliſh Traitors of Boſton themſelves, fully evinces, that an Engliſh Creditor had no chance of obtaining a verdict againſt a New-England Debtor, when the Judges were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the New-England Debtors. Of this unjuſtifiable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct other inſtances may hereafter be given.—The opinion that the Speechifier has expreſſed, of our diſhoneſty, will certainly tend to make us believe, the more readily, all his arguments: His Threats, Flatteries, Prayers, Prophecies, his ſtating the Maſſachuſets as a ſeperate nation and a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate, and his many contradictions are ſo frequent, ſo glaring, and ſo ridiculous, that any farther obſervation upon them, than this, is unneceſſary—That, on account of the oppreſſive threepenny duty on Tea, Heaven is to interpoſe in favour of the Boſton Saints, and to puniſh us for our impiety, in preſuming to tax the Seed of Iſrael, the Choſen of the Lord, the Mighty in Battle—In reply to this anathema (as we, like, good Chriſtians, ought to return bleſſings for curſes, and good for evil) we ſhall frequently pray, that Old Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, whoſe upper ſtory ſeems, by his writings, to be much out of repair, may, in God's own time, be reſtored to his right mind; and that, when he has repented of all his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Yet this Gentleman, whom they had ſo illiberally and unjuſtly treated, and voted an enemy to their Town, Province, and Continent, they have received with the utmoſt demonſtrations of reſpect and ſubmiſſion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, on his firſt appointment, abſtracted from his intimate and thorough knowledge of the Boſtonians it was thought a fine ſtroke of Policy, and a puniſhment in itſelf, in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to make choice of a Gentleman to preſide over that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Province, which had ſo unjuſtly abuſed him. Thoſe who were beſt acquainted with the diſpoſition of the Boſton Faction, and who have a regular correſpondence with many in that Colony, though they never imagined that the Boſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians would reſiſt unto blood, yet they as little thought that the new Governor would be received with every appearance of joy and exultation, and that he would be complimented, and treated at the expence of the rebellious Saints. Many ſenſible people in England were afraid that ſome blood would be ſhed on the arrival of General Gage; for they had no conception that people deſcended, from Engliſhmen would, after ſo many dreadful rhodomontadoes, ſhrink into Boba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dils: They were led into this miſtake by not knowing the education which the Holy Warriors of Boſton receive in their youth; the generality of the young Boſtonians are bred up hypocrites in religion, and pettifoggers in law, moſt of them are poſſeſſed of a Bible, and a Provincial Law Book,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:014255_0117_0F93589BA1226FE8"/>
and it is well known, that whenever hypocriſy takes root, and is further ſupported by a conſtant practice of the loweſt and moſt infamous chicaneries, common to petty practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in law, that all the good and manly qualities given us by nature are ſoon eradicated.

               </gap>, have now changed their method of procedure, and attack us in ſhilling and eighteen-penny pamphlets. One of thoſe ingenious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions the author has thought proper to entitle, <q>A Speech intended to have been ſpoken on the Bill for alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Charter of the Maſſachuſets Bay;</q> and he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo choſen to circulate a report, that the intended Speaker was, that Right Reverend Father in God the Biſhop of St Aſaph, who laſt year, to the utter aſtoniſhment of the Society for the propagation of the Goſpel in foreign parts, delivered to them, from the pulpit of St. Mary le Bow, a factious politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſermon, inſtead of informing them of the progreſs of the Church of England in America, and inſtead of inſtructing them by an illuſtration of that portion of Scripture which he had taken for his text. It is, however, more probable, that the intended Speech is the fruits of the midnight labours of the great and loyal Doctor Franklin, who has only played off the Biſhop upon us, as a literary deception, in order to give the greater currency and weight to his own wild reveries and lucubrations. The reaſons for imputing this intended ſpeech to Doctor Franklin are, that it contains all that low cunning which ſo peculiarly marks his writings; that affected mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; that feigned regard for peace; that compaſſion for the madneſs of Britain in refuſing to humble her neck to the feet of the Boſtonian rebels; that grave impudence, which always places America in the light of a ſeparate, independent, powerful State; that falſe prophecying, which croaks out
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:014255_0118_0F93589C598E1570"/>
threatenings of ruin to our peace, commerce, and kingdom, if the ſmalleſt tax is laid on his darling America; and that fooliſh aſſurance, which promiſes us more wealth and power, and permanent greatneſs than the world ever ſaw, if we will only fall down and worſhip his rebellious conſtituents—For all theſe reaſons the Speech ſhall be conſidered as Doctor Franklin's. In the advertiſement prefixed to the Speech, the modeſt Author aſſures us, that, prompted by <q>a warm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſerving his country, he will ſuggeſt ſome uſeful truths, which great men are apt to overlook.</q> The firſt uſeful truth he tells us is, that <q>he has the misfortune of differing in opinion from ſome men of as much virtue and ability as this kingdom affords.</q> To this uſeful truth we may readily ſubſcribe; and we may alſo naturally ſuppoſe that, reſpecting the late acts for regulating the Maſſachuſets, the men of virtue and ability are in the right, and that our Speechifier is in the wrong. He next ſuggeſts a doubt, <q>whether any point ought to be purſued, which cannot be carried by perſwaſion.</q> When the legiſlative body of Great Britain are converted to the religion of the <hi>Yeas</hi> and <hi>Nays,</hi> and have taken their degrees at Philadelphia, we may then, and not till then, expect them to be influenced by ſuch a doubt. Mr. Greenville tried to perſwade the Americans ſo contribute a ſmall pit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

So much for the Advertiſement.—Our author, in his Speech, ſets out with telling us, that he hopes to contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards a reconciliation <q>between the Colonies and this unhappy country:</q> And, gentle reader, what do you think his charitable contribution amounts to?

            <p>THE numerous and well-founded complaints laid before the King in Council ſoon after the reſtoration, againſt the Colony of the Maſſachuſets, for their various oppreſſions and murders, and alſo their contumacious diſobedience and reſiſtance to every order and regulation of Government, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Agent of that Colony to be aſked, by the Lords of the Council, in the courſe of his examination before them, Whether the Maſſachuſets if they durſt, would not throw off their allegiance and ſubjection to the Crown of England? To which queſtion he only replied, That his conſtituents were honeſt men; and that if he entertained ſuch a thought of them he ſhould be very uncharitable.</p>
            <p>When, likewiſe it was proved againſt him, upon oath, that he ſaid the Maſſachuſets, rather than allow of appeals from their Courts of Juſtice to England, would ſell their country to the Spaniards; the ſame Agent both denied and confeſſed the charge; which drew the following obſervation from their Lordſhips, that they did not conſider the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſpeech ſo much his own, as the ſpirit of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>When the Agent ſent his conſtituents intelligence of this examination, and of the opinions formed of their conduct in England, the General Court, dreading that their Charter would be vacated, immediately proclaimed Charles the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which they had not hitherto done; they a ſo voted an addreſs to his Majeſty, and reſolved to ſend home two addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Agents to attempt to varniſh over their crimes moral and political.</p>
            <p>Their addreſs is in the ſame canting hypocritical ſtile of all their other addreſſes.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty was <q>the beſt of Kings; one of the Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, who delighted to conform himſelf to the God of Gods; they preſented to his compaſſionate eye a bottle full of tears waſhed in their Jeſhimon; their Churches ſat
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:014255_0120_0F93589F0F4DD0F0"/>
in ſackcloth, until he held forth to them the ſceptre of life; they prayed that God might preſerve his Majeſty from all emiſſaries agitated by an infernal ſpirit; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was enthronized in their conſciences; he was their Lord and their Saviour; they were again poor Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth prejudicially miſrepreſented, praying to be permitted ſtill to ſing the Lord's ſong in a ſtrange land; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed for their innocence to God, to Angels, to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and to all good men; and laſtly, they prayed, that the Lord might be with his moſt excellent Majeſty, and make his throne both greater and better, than the throne of David.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The above vile nonſenſe the General Court voted to be ſent home to his Majeſty, deeming it a ſufficient exculpation of all their uſurpations, perſecutions, and illegal acts.</p>
            <p>The ſame year two Agents (<hi>Mr. Bradſtreet and the Rev. Mr. Norton</hi>) were ſent home to Petition, the Lord the King, for a confirmation of their privileges: They were alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them as loyal and obedient ſubjects; to take off all ſcandal and objections which had been, or ſhould be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; to do nothing prejudicial to the Patent; and to give a regular account of their proceedings. Theſe are the whole inſtructions given their Agents on their departure; by which it is evident, that the Colony relied more upon the abilities of their Agents, than upon any proofs or atteſtations of their innocency—of theſe laſt, indeed, they had none to ſend—their whole plea, in ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enuation of their guilt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of ſtale profeſſions of loyalty and Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>Their Agents ſet out with fear and trembling, uncertain what would be their fate when they arrived in England; in fact, they could hardly be prevailed upon to embark. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many delays and objections, which were all obviated by the Committee of the General Court, Parſon, Norton, the moſt terrified of the two, played off a moſt pious artifice; he feigned ſickneſs; took to his bed, and informed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, "that his voyage as yet ſolely depended upon God." Upon this the Committee drew up ſeveral letters, which they addreſſed to ſundry noblemen, and others in England, and apologized for not ſending Agents according to his Majeſty's deſire, with declarations, that after they had made choice of two meet perſons, <q>it was the good pleaſure of him who ruleth all things, to fruſtrate their deſigns, by viſiting one of the Meſſengers with ſickneſs; but it ſeems the ſecond day after the Lord was wonderfully pleaſed to encourage and ſtrengthen the heart of the Reverend Mr. Norton,</q>
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:014255_0121_0F93589F818AE9A8"/>
ſo that he was perſwaded to embark, and the veſſel inſtantly ſailed.</p>
            <p>A few months after their Agents ſailed, the General Court voted and publiſhed what they called,</p>

            <p>Their Agents met with a very favourable reception at Court, which far exceeded their warmeſt expectation, and were, in a ſhort time, ſent back with a moſt gracious letter from his Majeſty.</p>

                  <p>That although the licence of the late ill times had an influence on the Colony of the Maſſachuſets, in which they had ſwerved from the rules preſcribed, and even from the government inſtituted by the Charter, yet we do moſt graciouſly rather impute their deviation to the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the time, than to the evil intents of the hearts of thoſe who exerciſed the government there.</p>
                  <p>And we do further publiſh and declare our free and gracious pardon to all our ſubjects of that our Plantation, Provided always, and be it in our declared expectation.</p>
                  <p>That all ſuch Laws and Ordinances as are, or have been, made there, which are contrary or derogatory to our authority and Government ſhall be annulled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>

adminiſtring the Oath of Alleigance, be henceforth duly obſerved.</p>
                  <p>That the adminiſtration of Juſtice be in our name.</p>
                  <p>That ſince the principle and foundation of that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was and is the freedom of liberty of conſcience, we charge you that liberty be given to all who deſire to uſe the Book of Common Prayer, and to perform their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the manner eſtabliſhed in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; that they be admitted to the Sacrament, and their children to Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>That although we have declared that the Charter ſhall be obſerved, yet, if the number of Aſſiſtants be found to be inexpedient, as we are informed it is, we then diſpenſe with the ſame, and declare our will, for the future, that the number of the ſaid Aſſiſtants ſhall not exceed eighteen, nor be leſs at any time than ten.</p>

            <p>From this it appears, that they had broke through their Charter; but that his Majeſty pardoned them on condition that they repealed their illegal and preſumptuous Acts, which were derogatory to his prerogative and his authority in Parliament; that they, in future, adminiſtered faithfully the Oath of Alleigance; that they conſtituted their Courts of Juſtice in his name; that they ceaſed perſecuting the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of England; that they acquieſced in the regulation of the number of their Counſellors; that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected men of integrity, and not the adherents of Faction; that they allowed all Freeholders to vote, and that they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited

their conditional pardon, and his future favour, by their duty and obedience.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee how well the Maſſachuſets deſerved his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's gracious pardon for all their crimes, and how well they fulfilled the conditions of that pardon.</p>
            <p>It is true, they publiſhed the letter, but they not only put off the conſideration of the requiſitions contained in it, but alſo ſubjoined to the republication of it, the following cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary remark; <q>That inaſmuch as the letter hath influence on the Churches as well as Civil State, all manner of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in relation thereto, ſhall be ſuſpended until the next General Court.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At the next Seſſions of the General Court, all we find they did in compliance with his Majeſty's letter, was giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, that the adminiſtration of Juſtice ſhould henceforth be in his Majeſty's name. And theſe graſping and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful independents of Maſſachuſets, becauſe their Agents could not procure them all the extraordinary and undue liberties, which, out of their great modeſty, they had choſen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, were ſo diſſatisfied, that they cenſured and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with having laid <q>the foundation of the ruin of their liberties. </q>This unmerited abuſe greatly affected the Reverend Mr. Norton, whoſe voyage to England had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably enlightened him; he ſaw the evil ſpirit of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and told them in the General Court, <q>that if they complied not with the King's letter, the blood that ſhould be ſpilt would lie at their door.</q> Soon after he grew me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and died ſuddenly.</p>
            <p>Every perſon, who was a good ſubject and a well-wiſher to England and to this refractory Colony, whether in or out of Office, ſeems to have been ſenſible of the turbulence of the Maſſachuſets, and of the intention of that people to throw off their dependence on the Crown of England. A gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (<hi>Sir John Wolſtenholme</hi>) having occaſion to write to the Secretary of the Maſſachuſets on public buſineſs, reſpecting the Act of Navigation, againſt which the Maſſachuſets grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly complained judiciouſly obſerves, that <q>if we do not maintain here the honour and reputation of his Majeſty and the nation, which muſt be by our navigation and ſhipping, which are our walls, the Plantations will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be devoured by ſtrangers: and, therefor, he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired them to preſerve and keep them faithful to his Majeſty's Crown, and in ſubjection, as true Engliſh men to the civil government.</q>

            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the ſeveral acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſed in the 12th 15th, 22d, 23d, and 25th years of the reign of Charles the ſecond, for the better ſecuring the plantation trade to this kingdom, yet the Maſſachuſetts, finding the breach of theſe laws more profitable than the obſervance of them, ſtill continued their illicit trade with many of the nations of Europe.</p>
            <p>To remedy this diſorder, as well as many others, Mr. Randolph was diſpatched in 1676 to New England with a letter from his Majeſty to the Governor and Council of the Maſſachuſetts, commanding them to ſend home agents to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the complaints made againſt them particularly thoſe relating to their uſurpations of the province of May<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The reception Mr. Randolph met with from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Council, will be beſt ſhewn by his own account tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Majeſty, of which the following is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</p>

                        <p>On his arrival at Boſton, he immediately waited on the Governor, Mr. Leverett, acquainted him with the cauſe of his coming, and that he had brought a letter from his Majeſty to the Magiſtrates of the colony.</p>
                        <p>The ſame day he attended the Governor and Council, and delivered his Majeſty's letter; after the peruſal of which, the Governor obſerved to the Council, that the matters therein contained were very inconſiderable things, and eaſily anſwered, and it did no way concern the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to take any notice thereof.</p>
                        <p>Soon after his arrival, a report was artfully raiſed to amuſe and diſtract the people about domeſtic troubles in England, that the Duke of York and many of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had left the Court diſcontented, had applied to the city for aſſiſtance, and that all was in confuſion at home: This intelligence was reported with much confidence, was ſaid to come from ſome very good people in London, and therefore muſt be true.</p>
                        <p>The next viſit he paid the Governor he told him, that ſeveral ſhips were arrived at Boſton from France, Spain,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:014255_0125_0F9358A28DD59C58"/>
the Streights, and from other parts of Europe, and alſo from the Canaries, contrary to his Majeſty's laws for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging navigation, and regulating the trade of the plantations.</p>
                        <p>To this the Governor made anſwer, that the laws made by his Majeſty in Parliament obliged them to do nothing but what conſiſted with the good of the colony; that the legiſlative power reſted ſolely in them, to act and make laws by virtue of their charter; that all matters in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were to be concluded by their final determination, without any appeal to his Majeſty; that his Majeſty ought not to retrench their liberties, but might enlarge them if he pleaſed; and that his Majeſty could do no leſs in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than let them enjoy their liberties and their trade.</p>

                        <p>That the principal inhabitants of the province of Mayne, belonging to Mr. Gorges, but now called York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, ſince ſeized by the Boſtoners, made the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to him as thoſe of New Hampſhire; that they had intreated him to repreſent their condition to his Majeſty, ſeveral of them having been ſuffered to be rui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>That he alſo viſited the colony of New-Plymouth, at the requeſt of Governor Winſlow, a gentleman of great courage, conduct and loyal principles, who expreſſed great diſlike at the carriage of the Magiſtrates of Boſton
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:014255_0126_0F9358A347786A20"/>
towards his Majeſty's perſon and government; at their encroaching upon the rights, trade, and poſſeſſions of the neighbouring colonies; at their laying what rates they pleaſed on the commodities and products of the other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies imported into their harbours; and their daily breach of his Majeſty's laws concerning trade and navigation; at their trading with and encouraging all nations to trade with them, to the great prejudice and detriment of his Majeſty and his kingdom; and that New-England could never be ſecure, flouriſh, nor be ſerviceable to his Majeſty, until the ſeveral colonies and plantations were reduced under his Majeſty's immediate government; and that the colonies of New-Plymouth and Connecticut would readily and willingly ſubmit to his Majeſty's pleaſure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, in the diſpoſal and ſettlement of their civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                        <p>That, during his reſidence at Boſton, the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants complained of the arbitrary government and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their Magiſtrates, and hoped his Majeſty would free them from their bondage, by eſtabliſhing his royal authority among them, and governing them according to his laws.</p>
                        <p>That upwards of an hundred of the principal inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, about ten years ago, had ſubſcribed and preſented to the General Court a petition, confeſſing his Majeſty's right of juriſdiction and ſovereignty over them and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubmiſſion of the Court to his Majeſty's orders; for which loyal petition they received a ſevere check, their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was voted ſcandalous, they were ſtiled the betrayers of the liberties of that colony, and ill affected to that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and ſome of them, for this petition, ſuffered greatly in their eſtates, and ever ſince had been ſubject to many inconveniencies, not being admitted to any offices of the government, or to the choice of the Magiſtrates; and that by deſire of the chief perſons, he had ſent his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a copy of this petition.</p>
                        <p>That before his return to England, he waited on the Governor for his diſpatches, who entertained him with a ſharp reproof for publiſhing the contents of his Majeſty's letters to the inhabitants of Boſton, New-Hampſhire and Mayne, telling him that he deſigned to make a diſturbance and mutiny in the country, and to withdraw the people from their obedience to the Magiſtracy of that colony, and the authority thereof; that the Governor then gave him a letter directed to the Right Honorable Mr. Secretary Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:014255_0127_0F9358A40AD88128"/>
ſaying to him, that was the anſwer which the Council thought ſit to give to his Majeſty: So that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his Majeſty had named him, in his royal letters, to ſolicit a determination of the buſineſs depending, yet he muſt wholly refer to their own letter, they not having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the contents.</p>
                        <p>And that at his departure both the Governor and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſeverally intreated him to give a favourable report of the country, and the Magiſtrates adding, that thoſe that bleſſed them God would bleſs, and thoſe that curſed them God would curſe; and that whatever reports were raiſed againſt them by wicked and evil-minded men, yet they were a people truly fearing the Lord, and very obedient to his Majeſty.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Few obſervations need be made on the above letter to his Majeſty, it may only be obſerved, that the Magiſtrates of the Colony of Maſſachuſets diſplayed the ſame oppoſition to the laws and authority of the King in Parliament, which they had uniformly made for near half a century before; and that on this occaſion they alſo ſhewed their uſual abſurdity ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontery, and hypocriſy.</p>
            <p>To ſay that his Majeſty's commands were inconſiderable and eaſily anſwered, and yet that it no way concerned the Colony to take any notice of them, was acting conſiſtently with themſelves; their having uſurped two Provinces was quiet a trivial affair to them. Though the Governor and Magiſtrates treated his Majeſty's letter with ſuch indignity, they voted to thank his Majeſty for his gracious letter, at the very time they refuſed to obey its contents.</p>
            <p>Falſe rumours from ſome very good people in London they continue to circulate to this day, and theſe rumours always are true till experience contradicts them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are ſpread, adapted to the deſign of the factious.</p>
            <p>The Maſſachuſets Governor was, at leaſt, very open in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying acquieſcence to the Acts of Trade, and in aſſerting, that the Colony deciſions were final without appeal; but we cannot think him very modeſt for inſiſting, that his Majeſty in reaſon ought to allow them the enjoyment of their unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trade.</p>
            <p>What opinion the neighbouring Colonies entertained of their conduct, is ſufficiently obvious from the converſation with the Governor of New Plymouth, and he ſeems, at that very diſtant period, to have been inſpired with the ſame ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary opinions which actuated Parliament during the laſt Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</p>

It is not ſurpriſing that the Governor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Council, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, reprimanded Mr. Randolph ſeverely for complying with his Majeſty's inſtructions, which they ſaid, tended to raiſe a mutiny againſt their authority; but it may well be wondered at, that after ſhowing ſo much ill humour, both with the meſſage and the meſſenger of his Majeſty they ſhould have the effrontery to intreat him to give a favourable report of them; to promiſe him the <hi>rewards of Heaven</hi> if he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their requeſt, but if he refuſed, to denounce againſt him the <hi>Curſe of GOD;</hi> and to cloſe the whole in their impudent, hypocritical way, by aſſuring him, after their abuſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, that they were <hi>a People truly fearing the Lord, and very obedient to his Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee their own public Acts; the letters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of their beſt friends; the official papers of our different adminiſtrations; the examinations and orders of the Lords of the Council; the Acts of Parliament, and the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Sovereign himſelf, all contributing to form a maſs of inconteſtible evidence, illuſtrating the turbulent and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious diſpoſition of the people of Maſſachuſets, from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
