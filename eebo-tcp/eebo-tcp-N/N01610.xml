            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>WE are at this time concerned with a people profeſſing a <hi>Zeal for the Houſe of God</hi> that has <hi>Eaten up</hi> a Little part of their Eſtates, which they have devoted unto the Building of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> wherein We are now Aſſembled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him.

God,</hi> may be uniform, and be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, &amp; be juſtified. <hi>Hearken, my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Brethren.</hi> I do now ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than fetch a <hi>Red hot Stone</hi> from the <hi>Altar,</hi> for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to keep alive the <hi>Flame</hi> of your <hi>Zeal:</hi> I bring the pattern of our admirable SAVIOUR, Even, <hi>our God, who is a conſuming Fire.</hi> When the Pſalmiſt, who is Renowned in all Ages for the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of God,</hi> which was flaming in him, gave this Account of himſelf, <hi>The Zeal of thy Houſe hath Eaten me up,</hi> we may ſay, <hi>I pray thee, of whom ſpake the Pſalmiſt this? Of himſelf, or of ſome other Man?</hi> The Anſwer muſt be, He was a Type of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> in what he <hi>Spake.</hi> It was foretold of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> That <hi>the Lord ſhould come into His Temple, and act as a Refiner there.</hi> Our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR coming into the <hi>Temple,</hi> and purging the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-changers</hi> there, would have drawn the minds of the People unto the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001913_0005_0FB9D5EE1C7FFD70"/>
Conſideration of that famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. Whether it had this Effect or no, the minds of His Diſciples, were drawn to conſider <hi>another</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; and what was to be found in the <hi>Sixty ninth Pſalm</hi> concerning Him. Every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was to pay <hi>half a Shekel</hi> yearly to the ſervice of the <hi>Temple.</hi> When any Man brought a <hi>Shekel,</hi> to change for Two <hi>Half-Shekels,</hi> there was a <hi>profit</hi> Exacted by the <hi>changer:</hi> And when the <hi>Shekel</hi> was brought for Two, there was a <hi>Double</hi> profit Exacted for the change. The like <hi>unlawful gains</hi> were made by ſelling of Cattle for the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> there. Our SAVIOUR having His Holy Soul, inflamed with a juſt <hi>Zeal,</hi> againſt the <hi>Diſhonesties</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> committed by theſe <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Harpies,</hi> appears with a <hi>Scourge</hi>

The <hi>Zeal</hi> which our SAVIOUR Exerted on this Occaſion, made His Diſciples, to remember the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Holy SPIRIT had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Thouſand years before given of Him; in this paſſage, <hi>The Zeal of thy Houſe hath Eaten me up.</hi> I hope you obſerve, That they who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively Read the Word of God, will have the advantage from it; A Profitable and a Comfortable <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of what they have Read.

You alſo obſerve; That all the Characters of the promiſed REDEEMER, given in the <hi>Ancient <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But the principal Thing to be now obſerved is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001913_0007_0FB9D5F570168FE8"/>
The Zeal of the Houſe of GOD, will mightily poſſeſs them, who have an Heart after the Heart of GOD.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>David,</hi> who was a <hi>Man after the Heart of GOD,</hi> was one that could ſay, <hi>The Zeal of thy Houſe hath Eaten me up.</hi> The Antitype of <hi>David,</hi> and the Man who was GOD as well as Man, and had an <hi>Heart</hi> the moſt <hi>after the Heart of GOD,</hi> that ever was in the World, could much more ſay, <hi>The Zeal of thy Houſe ha's Eaten me up.</hi> Such a <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt be in every One, who would have his <hi>Heart</hi> found <hi>after the Heart of GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We will Enquire, firſt. What is meant by <hi>Zeal</hi> in General?</p>
                  <p>To this the Anſwer is; That <hi>Zeal</hi> is an Affection to the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of God in an <hi>Intenſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Zelus eſt Intenſus Gradus affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis.</hi> Every Good Man has his <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> towards God and the Things that pleaſe Him. Now, as the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001913_0008_0FB9D5F779B22058"/>
Word <hi>ZELE,</hi> comes from a Theme, that Signifies, <hi>To be Boiling hot;</hi> So, When our well-placed <hi>Affections,</hi> are <hi>Boiling Hot,</hi> or, when we are, what we read, Rom. XI. 11. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Spirit, Serving the Lord,</hi> then have we a <hi>Zeal of GOD.</hi> In <hi>Zeal,</hi> there is firſt, a <hi>Love</hi> to GOD: and a very Intenſe <hi>Love,</hi> But then this <hi>Love</hi> muſt operate in a <hi>Sorrow</hi> for, and an <hi>Anger</hi> at what is diſpleaſing to GOD; An <hi>Indignation</hi> againſt Every Thing, that is a <hi>Provocation</hi> to GOD. <hi>Zeal</hi> is a Compoſition of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Grief,</hi> and <hi>Wrath:</hi> an Holy mixture of all theſe paſſions, belongs unto it.</p>
                  <p>We will Enquire; Secondly, What is meant, by being <hi>Eaten up</hi> with <hi>Zeal?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Anſwer is; Beſure it intends, that the <hi>Zeal</hi> does <hi>mightily poſſeſs</hi> them in whom it is. Then does the <hi>Zeal</hi> of a Man <hi>Eat him up,</hi> when it makes an <hi>Entire oblation</hi> of his All unto GOD. The <hi>Fire</hi> did
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001913_0009_0FB9D5F88B6C3D78"/>
                     <hi>Eat up,</hi> what was upon the <hi>Altar.</hi> An Holy Man, does that thing, Rom. XII. 1. <hi>Preſent your ſelves unto GOD.</hi> He laies his <hi>All</hi> as on the <hi>Altar</hi> before the Lord, and <hi>Zeal</hi> comes like a <hi>Fire,</hi> ſo to conſume it all, that GOD only ſhall have the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards</hi> of all, the <hi>Uſes</hi> of all. The <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of GOD, muſt Engroſs all our <hi>Faculties;</hi> muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> all our <hi>Time,</hi> all our <hi>Strength.</hi> We are to <hi>Love the Lord our God with all our Heart;</hi> And the Intereſts of GOD muſt <hi>Swallow up</hi> all our Intereſts. Then the <hi>Zeal of GOD</hi> has <hi>Eaten us up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Our Main Enquiry is, <hi>What is the Zeal of the HOUSE of GOD, which is mightily to poſſeſs us!</hi> or, How are we to demonſtrate our ſelves <hi>mightily poſſeſſed,</hi> with the ZEAL of the HOUSE of GOD? You ſhall have the Anſwer to this, in theſe Articles.</p>
                  <p>I. We are to be <hi>Zealouſly Concerned,</hi> that we may Enjoy the <hi>Church</hi> of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001913_0010_0FB9D5FBA123A868"/>
our SAVIOUR, and have the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> which are in the Church adminiſtred unto them who wait upon Him. What is the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD? We are told; 1 Tim. III. 15. <hi>The Houſe of GOD is the Church of the Living GOD.</hi> There muſt be awakened in us a <hi>Zealous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,</hi> to have the <hi>Church-State</hi> of the Goſpel, Erected, Preſerved, Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among us. The <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of GOD</hi> is defective in us, if we delay to come into the <hi>Church-State</hi> of the Goſpel, and to join unto the Societies that aſſociate for the Worſhip of GOD our SAVIOUR. That ſuch a <hi>Church-State</hi> may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, we ſhould be willing to lay out what ſhould be Neceſſary. It muſt be <hi>nouriſhed</hi> with what we have: Elſe we cannot ſay, That the <hi>Zeal</hi> of it has <hi>Eaten us up.</hi> A Servant of GOD, was at much Expence, that ſo the Worſhip of GOD, might be maintained. It was He, who ſaid, <hi>The Zeal of thy Houſe hath Eaten me
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001913_0011_0FB9D5FDD6C42BB8"/>
up.</hi> And for this cauſe he alſo ſaid, 1 Chron. XXIX. 3. <hi>I have ſet my Affection to the Houſe of my GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, His <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> are diſpenſed. The <hi>Zeal</hi> of that <hi>Houſe</hi> muſt make us prize our <hi>Opportunities</hi> to be partakers of theſe <hi>Ordinances.</hi> We muſt be <hi>Glad,</hi> when we have <hi>Opportunities</hi> to draw near unto GOD in His <hi>Houſe;</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Exerciſes wherein GOD is to be there met withal. This was the <hi>Zeal</hi> of old ſo Expreſs'd; Pſal. CXXII. 1. <hi>I was glad, when they ſaid unto me, Let us go into the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> We muſt be <hi>Sad,</hi> when we are depriv'd of, debarr'd from, <hi>Opportunities,</hi> to meet with GOD in His <hi>Houſe,</hi> and there have <hi>our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father, and with His Son Jeſus Christ.</hi> So was the <hi>Zeal</hi> Expreſs'd of Old; Pſal. CXLII. 4. <hi>When I remember theſe things, I pour out my Soul in me; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the Houſe of GOD.</hi> Such ought our
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001913_0012_0FB9D6016EDF2D10"/>
                     <hi>Zeal</hi> to be for the <hi>Houſe of</hi> GOD, that we ſhould think much of <hi>no pains</hi> to come unto it. We ſhould have ſuch a Value for what is to be done, and heard, and had in the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the Faithful, that we ſhould begrutch no Labour, no Travel, for coming at them. A ſmall matter ſhould not be made our Excuſe for not Coming at them. We ſhould eſteem an <hi>Hour</hi> there, to be <hi>better than a thouſand elſewhere.</hi> Our Eſteem for what is to be found there, ſhould <hi>overcome</hi> all the <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> of Coming thither. Then does the <hi>Zeal</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> indeed <hi>Eat us up,</hi> when no Difficulties in the Way can ſtand before it. The <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of GOD,</hi> will Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Man to ſay with him, Pſal. XXVI. 8. <hi>I have Loved the Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy Houſe.</hi> It will make a man Delight in ſuch Devotions as are performed at the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD. It will give him a Delight in <hi>praying</hi> to GOD, in <hi>Hearing</hi> from GOD, in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001913_0013_0FB9D603478D1B00"/>
                     <hi>Praiſing</hi> of GOD, in ſitting at the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> and in obſerving all that our Lord has required there. And a <hi>Zeal for the Houſe</hi> of GOD, will be accompanied with a <hi>Zeal for the Day</hi> of GOD: The <hi>Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Day,</hi> which is a Day Principally ſet apart for theſe Devotions. 'Tis a welcome Day to a Man, who has the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe</hi> of GOD <hi>Eating</hi> him up. The <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> is a Delight unto him. When the <hi>Ordinances</hi> in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of our SAVIOUR, are more to us, than our <hi>Neceſſary Food,</hi> and our Souls feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, then the Zeal of His Houſe hath <hi>Eaten us up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. We ſhould be <hi>Zealouſly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> of our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR may be purified from all <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,</hi> and nothing that will <hi>Corrupt Religion</hi> may be remaining there. When was it, that our Saviour ſaid, <hi>The Zeal of thy Houſe hath Eaten me up:</hi> It was when He was chaſing out of the <hi>Temple,</hi> the Corruptions which had crept into it. There is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001913_0014_0FB9D605F09A3320"/>
now in the Minds of Men, a Natural Tendency to <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Folly.</hi> The <hi>Spirit which works in the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> improves the Tendency with a Curſed <hi>Efficacy.</hi> Hence it comes to paſs, that Things Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Holy GOD, Speedily and Eaſily get into His <hi>Houſe:</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> of GOD can't continue long undefiled; but <hi>Roots of Bitterneſs</hi> are continually ſpringing up in it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>many are defiled.</hi> Now, we muſt have in us a <hi>Zealous Concern,</hi> to ſee the Church reſcued from the <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi> which the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> or the <hi>Sin of Man, </hi> has introduced into it. The <hi>Zeal of the Houſe</hi> of GOD, is very notably to be employ'd on that work; Dan. VIII. 14. <hi>The Sanctuary ſhall be cleanſed. Zealous Reformers</hi> are they that have the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of GOD</hi> acting of them.</p>
                  <p>We muſt have a <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> of Abuſes that are got into the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD, and proſecute the <hi>Reformation</hi> with a <hi>Vigour</hi> in our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001913_0015_0FB9D60C0F6F4F28"/>
Application to it; with a <hi>Venture</hi> of our All for the Accompliſhment of it. When the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of GOD,</hi> was burning in the Soul of <hi>Elijah,</hi> he could ſay, 1 Kings XIX. 10. <hi>I have been very Jealous for the Lord of Hoſts; for the Children of Iſrael have forſaken thy Covenant, and thrown down thine Altars.</hi> The <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of</hi> GOD muſt make us Induſtrious to reſtore and preſerve <hi>Sound Doctrine</hi> there. We muſt Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the <hi>Truth,</hi> and Suppreſs <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> by uſing all proper Methods of Conviction upon them. Our Zeal is thus called for; Jude 3. <hi>Earneſtly contend for the Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints. Goſpel Truths</hi> muſt be precious to us. We are to <hi>buy the Truth</hi> at any rate, but <hi>ſell it</hi> at no rate in the World. We are to be <hi>Valiant for the Truth upon Earth;</hi> And ſtrive to an Agony rather than part with it, and ſpend All in the Defence of it, and ſuffer any Death rather than <hi>Deny</hi> it. The <hi>Liberties</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:001913_0016_0FB9D612126463A8"/>
of the <hi>Church</hi> are to be livelily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for, livelily adher'd to. We are to <hi>Stand faſt</hi> in them. If any make unjuſt Invaſions on them, we are to withſtand the <hi>Invaders.</hi> The <hi>Zeal of the Houſe</hi> of GOD muſt make us do our part, that the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of GOD may be there managed, only according to the <hi>Divine Appointments,</hi> and not be polluted with <hi>Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</hi> Our <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt Signalize our Diſlike of that Iniquity; Mat. XV. 9. <hi>In vain do they Worſhip me, teaching the Commandments of Men.</hi> We are to be for <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Worſhip;</hi> and go as far as we can, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go any thing rather than have our Conſcience polluted with any <hi>Falſe Worſhip</hi> whatſoever. The <hi>Zeal</hi> of the Great GOD Himſelf is peculiarly diſplay'd, in the matters of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment.</hi> And our <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt make us thoughtful, that the <hi>Images</hi> may not be brought unto the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, which may Violate His <hi>Holy Commandment</hi> there. Once
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001913_0017_0FB9D615D79C9DE0"/>
more: The <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of</hi> GOD muſt make us do our part that no <hi>Ill-manners</hi> may be prevailing and Indulged there; and that there may not be room for that complaint, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my People there are found Wicked Men.</hi> Our <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt be like that in <hi>Epheſus;</hi> Rev. II. 2. <hi>Thou canst not bear with them that are Evil.</hi> We muſt be for keeping up a <hi>Godly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;</hi> a <hi>Diſcipline</hi> that ſhall be a <hi>Terror to Evil Doers,</hi> and a <hi>Praiſe to them who do well;</hi> a <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> that ſhall <hi>put away a wicked perſon from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</hi> With <hi>Zeal</hi> we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke Offenders; with <hi>Zeal</hi> to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure miſcarriages; and countenance nothing that is puniſhable; not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, that the <hi>Houſe of</hi> GOD be a <hi>Den of Thieves.</hi> When we are vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently carried this way, then the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe</hi> of GOD has <hi>Eaten us up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. We ſhould be <hi>Zealouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi> That we may obtain the <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> which in the <hi>Houſe of</hi> DOD,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001913_0018_0FB9D61993A63660"/>
we have a Tender of: Have a <hi>Strong Appetite,</hi> for what is going in the <hi>Houſe.</hi> In the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, and in the <hi>Aſſemblies of Zion,</hi> there is an admirable variety of <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> wherewith GOD will be the <hi>Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek Him</hi> there. One who was eminent for his Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to the <hi>Houſe of</hi> GOD, could ſay; Pſal. V. 5. <hi>I will come into thy Houſe in the multitude of thy Mercy.</hi> There is a <hi>multitude</hi> of Bleſſings, a great Number of no ſmall Bleſſings, for which we are to come into the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD. Here we are <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſings;</hi> Here we are <hi>Enriched</hi> with the <hi>Bleſſings;</hi> Here we are <hi>Directed,</hi> and here <hi>Aſſisted,</hi> for our Arriving to the <hi>Bleſſings.</hi> We are to be <hi>Zealouſly concerned</hi> for a ſhare in theſe <hi>Bleſſings:</hi> And our <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt be ſuch, that nothing ſhall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy us without the <hi>Bleſſings.</hi> Then, the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of</hi> GOD has <hi>Eaten us up!</hi> Our Buſineſs at the Houſe of GOD, muſt be for a ſweet
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001913_0019_0FB9D61AF42B83B8"/>
Experiment of that Word; Lam. III. 25. <hi>The Lord is Good unto them that wait for Him, unto the Soul that ſeeks Him.</hi> There are the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> which the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> does mainly Conſiſt of, and Inſiſt on; The <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of <hi>Tranſgreſſion forgiven, and Sin covered;</hi> The <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of a <hi>Turn from all Iniquities;</hi> The <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> which we are <hi>Indeed Bleſſed</hi> of GOD, when we have them Secured unto us. Our <hi>Zeal,</hi> and an Inſatiable <hi>Hunger</hi> for the <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> muſt carry us to the <hi>Houſe of</hi> GOD; Elſe the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe</hi> has not <hi>Eaten us up.</hi> In coming to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, we are <hi>zealouſly</hi> to Propound and Expect, the Aſſuring of ſuch <hi>Bleſſings</hi> unto us. When our GOD calls us to His <hi>Houſe,</hi> it is for this <hi>purpoſe;</hi> Iſa LV. 3. <hi>Come unto me; Hear and your Souls ſhall Live; and I will make an Everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure Mercies of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved One.</hi> The <hi>Bleſſings</hi> to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, are
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001913_0020_0FB9D61EB889ADB8"/>
thoſe <hi>Bleſſings;</hi> the <hi>Merchandiſe whereof, is better than the Merchandiſe of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold.</hi> Moſt certainly, to Secure all <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings in Heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> is a thing well worthy of the moſt ardent <hi>Zeal</hi> in the World; Worthy of a Greater than any thing in this World, yea, than to <hi>Gain the whole World.</hi> In the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD are thoſe <hi>Courts</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places,</hi> where we Lay Hold on all <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings</hi> in <hi>Heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and <hi>Lay Hold on Eternal Life.</hi> In Coming to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, we muſt have a <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Good Things of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and a mighty Concern for that <hi>Bleſſedneſs:</hi> Pſal. LXV. 4. <hi>We ſhall be ſatisfied with the Goodneſs of thy Houſe, even of thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Temple.</hi> Come to the <hi>Houſe,</hi> with ſuch a <hi>Zeal</hi> as this; <hi>I come hither, that I may know more of Him, whom to know is Life Eternal.</hi> Come with ſuch a <hi>Zeal</hi> as this; <hi>I come hither, that I may be United unto my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001913_0021_0FB9D6204C9730B8"/>
and Reconciled unto God.</hi> Come with ſuch a <hi>Zeal</hi> as this; <hi>I come hither, that I may have the Lovely Graces of the Holy Spirit conferred on me, and Increaſed in me; and be made meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> And come with ſuch a <hi>Zeal</hi> as this; <hi>I come hither, that I may be Inſtructed in my Duty, and Strengthened againſt my Temptations, and Comforted under my Calamities, and filled with the Peace of GOD.</hi> A mighty Concern to make ſure of the <hi>Salvation,</hi> whereof the <hi>Wells</hi> are O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD: This is the <hi>Zeal</hi> of the <hi>Houſe.</hi> To come thither with a Soul <hi>Hungring,</hi> and <hi>Thirsting</hi> after the <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is Revealed, and Offered, and Beſtowed there; This is to be <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> up with the <hi>Zeal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>A Zeal</hi> Enkindled in the <hi>Houſe of GOD;</hi> Is not this the <hi>Zeal of His Houſe?</hi> And when that <hi>Zeal</hi> puts us upon <hi>Sacrificing</hi> our

All to GOD, may it not be ſaid, <hi>The Zeal hath Eaten us up?</hi> We read of Notable Things to be done; and it is ſaid, Iſa. IX. 7. <hi>The Zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this.</hi> It may partly be underſtood of a <hi>Zeal</hi> Enkindled by the <hi>Lord of Hosts.</hi> Thus <hi>a Zeal</hi> Enkindled in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, and by what paſſes there, may be called, <hi>The Zeal of the Houſe.</hi> But the <hi>Zeal</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> is no where more conſpicuous, than in the <hi>Zeal</hi> of <hi>Sacrificing.</hi> With a <hi>Zeal of GOD</hi> mightily filling of our Souls, and flaming in them, we are to Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Conſecrate <hi>Our ſelves</hi> unto the Glorious GOD; Chuſe to be <hi>Wholly the Lords;</hi> Long to be <hi>Entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Lord:</hi> Beg of His Holy Spirit, <hi>Oh! Do thou take poſſeſſion of me.</hi> Yea, we are to bring our <hi>All</hi> under a <hi>Dedication</hi> unto the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous GOD. Make a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>All,</hi> by having HOLINESS TO THE LORD, written upon ALL; and by a perpetual projection, that <hi>All</hi> may be applied unto the Service of

GOD: Have nothing, but what ſhall have the Character of a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> upon it; <hi>A Thing ſet apart for the Uſe of GOD.</hi> Yet more; We ſhould be willing to <hi>Give up</hi> all our <hi>Good Things</hi> whenever GOD ſhall call us to it. Look upon all our <hi>Good Things</hi> with a <hi>Sacrificing Eye.</hi> Whatever we have any <hi>Reliſh</hi> for, we ſhould come to this Diſpoſition; <hi>Lord, If thou wilt have this Good Thing to be denied unto me, I am willing to go without it! Thy Will be done concerning it!</hi> Our <hi>Will</hi> ſhould be <hi>Sacrificed</hi> unto the Lord; Be <hi>Extinguiſhed</hi> and <hi>Aboliſhed</hi> in the Lords. Yea, We ſhould count a <hi>Sacrificing Heart,</hi> which can Reſign <hi>Every Good Thing;</hi> This we ſhould count a <hi>Better Thing,</hi> and more Deſirable than any Thing that we have <hi>Sacrificed.</hi> Such a <hi>Sacrificing Zeal,</hi> is what the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD calleth for; 'tis what the Children of GOD ſometimes find <hi>Enkindled</hi> in His <hi>Houſe,</hi> when they find there, the Things that make their <hi>Hearts
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001913_0024_0FB9D62D91202F90"/>
to burn</hi> within them. And is not the <hi>Zeal</hi> now ſuch as even to <hi>Eat us up?</hi> The <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of Old, were devoured, by a <hi>Fire</hi> Enkindled from Heaven upon them.  The <hi>Lion of GOD,</hi> [The <hi>Altar,</hi> was called, <hi>Ariel,</hi> or, The <hi>Lion of GOD!</hi>] then did <hi>Eat up</hi> the <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> A <hi>Zeal</hi> Enkindled from Heaven in a Soul, <hi>Baptiſed with the Holy Spirit and with Fire, the Holy Spirit</hi> Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>Fire</hi> from above into the Soul, even like what was darted from the <hi>Shechinah</hi> upon the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Sacrifices:</hi> (and like the <hi>Flame</hi> often viſibly ſeen deſcending, and call'd the MANIFESTATION of the Spirit, on the <hi>Baptiſed</hi> in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times,) does offer up it ſelf and its All unto God in a <hi>Flame of Love.</hi> The <hi>Zeal of the Houſe</hi> of GOD hath <hi>Eaten up</hi> ſuch a Soul!</p>
                  <p>V. We will not allow, that the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of GOD,</hi> has any Force upon a man, Except he be

                     <hi>Zealouſly</hi> and <hi>Mightily</hi> concerned, that He may <hi>himſelf</hi> be an Houſe of GOD. Our <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt be concerned for this; Exod. XV. 2. <hi>My God, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Him an Habitation.</hi> But how? Our <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt come into this <hi>Flame</hi> of the <hi>Fire of God; My GOD, I will my ſelf be thy Habitation.</hi> A Good Man is himſelf a <hi>Living Temple</hi> of GOD. And it is moſt certain, One ſuch <hi>Living Temple,</hi> is of more Account with the Glorious GOD, than any of <hi>Wood</hi> and of <hi>Stone,</hi> and of the moſt Exquiſite Artifice that is to be ſeen, in the moſt Superb and Stately <hi>Cathedrals</hi> upon Earth. An humble Spirit, that is become <hi>an Habitation of God thro' the Spirit,</hi> is of more Account with GOD, than a <hi>Temple</hi> of meer <hi>matter</hi> without a <hi>Soul;</hi> tho' there ſhould be more than Four Thouſand Tun of Gold, and more than Forty Thouſand Tun of Silver, laid out upon it: As according to the <hi>preſent Reading</hi> of the Text, there was upon one of old. A Good Man has
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001913_0026_0FB9D630679A8CC0"/>
GOD ſo dwelling in him, that he becomes an <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD. But what muſt be our <hi>Zeal</hi> for ſuch a Bleſſedneſs? It muſt be this. We muſt Exceedingly bewail and bemoan the condition, which by our <hi>Fall</hi> from GOD, mankind is fallen into. With Tears in our Eyes, we muſt ſee it the condition of a <hi>Temple</hi> in Rubbiſh; An <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines. Hereupon, we muſt heartily deſire yea, very <hi>zealouſly,</hi> to be Raiſed out of this Deplorable Condition. In our JESUS we ſee the matchleſs <hi>Temple</hi> of GOD become a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as the price of that Favour, that we may be re-edified a <hi>Temple</hi> of GOD. We are now to behold the SPIRIT of GOD, profering to Reſtore us, and Enter us, and Poſſeſs us, as an <hi>Holy Temple.</hi> We are Joyfully to accept of the proffer; Joyfully conſent to the proffer; and ſay, <hi>Oh! Holy One, Do thou come into me, and Rectify all that is out of order within me; and fulfil in me all the Good pleaſure of thy
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001913_0027_0FB9D63500F99A70"/>
Goodneſs.</hi> What remains is, That we be always Employ'd in thoſe Things, to which an <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD is to be devoted; and that we abhor and avoid thoſe things by which an Houſe of GOD would be debaſed. The Zeal of coming at this Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Oh! Let it make a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Impreſſion upon us. It can't be ſaid, That the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of</hi> GOD ha's <hi>eaten us up,</hi> Except the <hi>zeal</hi> and wiſh and care to be an <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, be ſuch as to <hi>Swallow up</hi> all our <hi>Temporal Concernments.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all our <hi>Temporal Concernments</hi> give way to this <hi>Grand Work</hi> of GOD: this <hi>Grand Aim</hi> of Chriſtianity.</p>

                     <p>I. And now, how can we go any further without firſt making the pauſe of a <hi>Lamentation</hi> over it, That the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe of</hi> GOD, ſeems to be ſo mightily departed from us; to be ſo mightily declined with us? Alas, Of how many may it be ſaid; <hi>The Zeal of getting this World has Eaten

them up!</hi> Of how few; <hi>The Zeal of the Houſe of GOD has Eaten them up!</hi> When the People of GOD could not ſee Him at Work for them, how Pathetically do they Expoſtulate! Iſa. LXIII. 15. <hi>Where is thy Zeal?</hi> But, Oh! How may the Expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be turned by our GOD upon our ſelves, who do ſo little for Him, and for His <hi>Houſe,</hi> and mind ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle what becomes of it? <hi>Where is your Zeal.</hi> A <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> how rare to be found among the <hi>Diſciples?</hi> How few <hi>Phinehas's</hi> in Publick Stations?

The Voice of our SAVIOUR from Heaven, unto Lukewarm <hi>Laodicea,</hi> muſt be the <hi>Exhortation:</hi> Rev. III. 19. <hi>Be zealous and Repent.</hi> Oh! may the <hi>Zeal of the Houſe</hi> of GOD be now fired in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD; A <hi>Zeal,</hi> that like an <hi>Holy Fire,</hi> ſhall <hi>Eat up</hi> us, and <hi>Eat up</hi> all our Powers and Engage all our Endeavours, and all our Intereſts.</p>
                     <p>Briefly,</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, Our <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt be a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete Zeal;</hi> A <hi>Zeal</hi> with <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Except there be <hi>Diſcretion</hi> to govern it, our <hi>Zeal</hi> will be like an Head-ſtrong Horſe wit out a <hi>Bridle;</hi> will run us into Inconveniencies. <hi>Church-Hiſtory</hi> has told us, what horrid Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences once follow'd, upon the <hi>Raſh Zeal</hi> of one Man pulling down an Idols Temple in the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia.</hi> But as our <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt be <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,</hi> ſo it muſt be <hi>Sincere.</hi> Not the <hi>Zeal</hi> of a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> which Extends no further than to the <hi>External.</hi> Not a <hi>Zeal</hi> acted by the <hi>Vain-glory</hi> of a

                        <hi>Jehu,</hi> who calls, <hi>come and ſee my Zeal?</hi> Oh! Beware of <hi>putting on Zeal for a Cloak,</hi> in another ſenſe, than that wherein the Sacred Scripture uſes that Expreſſion. Whatever preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we make, let us Remember, we have to do, with a <hi>GOD that will not be mocked,</hi> in whatever we do. <hi>What is the Zeal of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when GOD ſhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Soul?</hi> and when <hi>Eyes like a Flame of Fire</hi> and more penetrating than the <hi>Lightning,</hi> ſhall pierce into it. What I now beſpeak is, <hi>The Zeal of the Houſe of GOD,</hi> and a <hi>mighty Concern</hi> for it. And I ſollicit for Three wayes of Expreſſing ſuch a <hi>Zeal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt. We are to Expreſs a mighty <hi>Zeal,</hi> in <hi>Going</hi> to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD. Walk to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD, as often as you can; yea, tho' the walk may lye thro' a valley of <hi>Baca,</hi> and hath no little Trouble in it. Whatever <hi>Diſcouragements</hi> may lye in the way, let your <hi>Zeal</hi> overcome the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements.

Let neither <hi>Heat</hi> nor <hi>Cold,</hi> nor any Conquerable Hardſhips diſcourage you. But let the Cry of your <hi>Zeal</hi> be that; Pſal XLII. 1. <hi>As the Hart makes a panting Cry for cooling Streams of water; ſo my Soul makes a panting cry to thee, O mighty God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly. We are to Expreſs a mighty <hi>Zeal</hi> in <hi>Working</hi> at the <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD. Be in Earneſt, about all that is to be done there.

hand, if particular perſons or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have ſome very bad and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things in them, that's no ſufficient ground to cry them down, as though there were nothing good in them. There were in the Church of <hi>Thyati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> (as well as in ſeveral others of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches) very <hi>good things,</hi> which our Lord <hi>commends;</hi> yet there were a <hi>few things</hi> which he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                  <p>The fault our Lord finds with <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi> is, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Thou ſuffereſt that woman</hi> Jezebel, <hi>which calleth her ſelf a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, to teach and to ſeduce my Servants to commit Fornication, and to eat things ſacrificed to Idols.</hi> This Woman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a <hi>Propheteſs,</hi> tho' really ſhe was not. Some think ſhe's call'd <hi>Jezebel,</hi> from her <hi>likeneſs</hi> to the Wife of King <hi>Ahab</hi> in promoting <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and other Wickedneſs.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord Jeſus would have good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline upheld in his Churches.</hi> The Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was commended for this. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Thou canſt not bear them which are evil.</hi> Thoſe who are known to be <hi>Heretical</hi> in Opinion, or <hi>groſly ſcandalous</hi> in Practice, ought not to be allow'd in the Churches of Chriſt: if by proper means they won't be reform'd, they ſhould be Excommunicated <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put away from among your ſelves that wicked perſon.</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 13. <hi>A man that is an Heretick, after the firſt and ſecond Admonition, reject.</hi> So, thoſe <hi>Scandalous</hi> in <hi>Practice</hi> that won't be reform'd, are to be treated as <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans.</hi> Mat. 18. 17.

                  <p>Our Lord nextly proceeds to <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> this <hi>Jezebel. v.</hi> 22. <hi>I will caſt her into a Bed, and them that commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with her into great tribulation,

except they repent of their deeds.</hi> v. 23. <hi>And I will kill her Children</hi> (which may comprehend her <hi>Diſciples, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,</hi> thoſe that were <hi>ſeduc'd</hi> by her) <hi>with death.</hi> That is, with the <hi>Plague,</hi> (as ſome think) or the <hi>Second Death,</hi> (as others) or the phraſe may be look'd on as an <hi>Haebraiſm, In killing I will kill;</hi> that is, our Lord would <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and terribly deſtroy them.</hi> Next to this clauſe, comes in our Text, <hi>All the Churches ſhall know, that I am he which ſearcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your works.</hi> This plainly implies, that the Churches <hi>ſhould</hi> ſerve Chriſt with their <hi>hearts and reins,</hi> that is, <hi>ſincerely, uprightly.</hi> This being <hi>ſuppos'd,</hi> 'tis aſſerted, that Chriſt <hi>knows</hi> whether they do ſo or no, for he <hi>ſearches</hi> the <hi>hearts and reins:</hi> 'tis alſo aſſerted, that the <hi>Churches ſhall know this,</hi> they ſhall <hi>know that he ſearches the hearts,</hi> for he will <hi>give to every one according to his works.</hi> Accordingly, we may take theſe three heads for the Subject of our preſent Diſcourſe, <abbr>

                  <p>2. <hi>He knows whether they do ſo or no.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus is God as well as man, and therefore neceſſarily <hi>knows</hi> whether perſons are <hi>hypocrites</hi> or <hi>ſincere,</hi> in the profeſſion they make of Religion. This is neceſſarily imply'd or intended in thoſe words of our Text, <hi>I am he that ſearcheth the reins and the hearts.</hi> In a literal ſenſe, the <hi>reins</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> are <hi>Internal parts</hi> of the body, &amp; quite out of the ſight of men; yet God ſees them. <hi>For there is not any Creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight, all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4. 13. But the <hi>reins</hi> and <hi>hearts,</hi> in our Text are taken in a metaphorical or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe, to ſignifie the <hi>Rational Souls</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="unknown:001913_0059_0FB9D69A337A8338"/>
of men, with their <hi>immediate deſigns, purpoſes, thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. For tho' theſe are ſecret from the view of other men, yet they lie open to Chriſt's view. He <hi>ſearches</hi> them, the meaning is, he <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſees, knows, and is acquainted</hi> with them. Perſons often <hi>pretend</hi> to have thoſe deſigns and inclinations, which are not really in them; and thereby they may deceive men who can judge only by outward appearance. They may <hi>outwardly appear righteous to men, while inwardly they are full of iniquity and hypocriſie,</hi> Mat. 23 28. But the Lord Jeſus, whoſe <hi>eyes are a flame of fire,</hi> cannot be thus impos'd upon, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. He not only knows mens <hi>words</hi> and <hi>outward actions,</hi> but alſo as fully knows their <hi>hearts,</hi> all their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, deſires</hi> and <hi>purpoſes.</hi> He <hi>knows the things that come into their minds, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every one of them,</hi> Ezek. 21. 5. If they act agreeably to his Will, ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring and deſigning to glorifie him; he ſees and approves their ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, tho' men poſſibly may tax them with <hi>Formality, Hypocriſie,</hi> and by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ends in what they do. So on the other hand, if they make the moſt pious ſhows and pretences, and ſhine
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001913_0060_0FB9D69B354A2E70"/>
like Angels, in the opinion of men; yet if they ſecretly and chiefly aim at their own applauſe, outward profit or advantage in the matter; then the Lord Jeſus plainly ſees and greatly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors, their curſed mockery and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. Therefore he could ſay of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who made wondrous ſhows of Piety; <hi>all their works they do to be ſeen of men,</hi> Mat. 23. 5. It was for a <hi>pretence</hi> that they <hi>made long prayers;</hi> they made great ſhews of piety, that they might the more eaſily <hi>devour Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows houſes.</hi> Their pretence to Serve God, was made uſe of to ſerve &amp; gratifie their own curſed luſts and corruptions. So that when men may almoſt eſteem ſuch and ſuch (on the account of their pious pretences) to be <hi>Angels of light;</hi> poſſibly the Lord may know (becauſe of their ſecret hypocriſie) that they are more like <hi>Devils Incarnate.</hi> It is moſt certain, that the Lord Jeſus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſees and knows the hearts of all men, and all that is in them. <hi>He ſees not as man ſeeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 16. 7. <hi>Jeſus knew all men; and needed not that any ſhould teſtifie of man, for he knew what was in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001913_0061_0FB9D69F3944D3E0"/>
man,</hi> Joh. 2. 24, 25. And as the Lord Jeſus <hi>knows the hearts and thoughts</hi> of all men; So the laſt generad head tells us,</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>All the Churches ſhall know this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he'll give to every one according to his works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's probable that this latter part of our Text, does more immediately and directly intend, that the Lord Jeſus would bring upon <hi>Jezebel</hi> &amp; her wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed followers, ſuch <hi>remarkable deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive Judgments</hi> for their wicked works; as ſhould <hi>demonſtrate to all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> that heard of them, <hi>that he knew their hearts. Jezebel</hi> pretended to be a <hi>Propheteſs,</hi> extraordinarily Inſpired and taught of God, tho' indeed ſhe was not. So, calling her ſelf a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs,</hi> ſhe pretended that her <hi>Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines were Divine;</hi> and might very likely inſinuate, that 'twas but a part of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> to practice ſuch <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as ſhe incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. But the Lord Jeſus knew all the <hi>deceit, pride, preſumption, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of her heart,</hi> and of the hearts of her followers; and would in his ſpotleſs all governing Providence make ſuch diſcoveries thereof, and bring ſuch
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001913_0062_0FB9D6A45546C318"/>
Judgments therefor, as ſhould <hi>fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Churches</hi> (for their awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, warning, caution) that he knew the <hi>wickedneſs of their hearts,</hi> and was righteous in the Judgments he inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Crimes. God ſometimes executes ſuch remarkable vengeance on the wicked, that a man ſhall ſay, <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is a God that Judgeth in the earth. Pſa.</hi> 58. 10,11. <hi>The Lord is known by the Judgments which he executeth, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is ſnared in the work of his own hands, Pſa.</hi> 9.16. Thus God ſometimes remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably and evidently manifeſts his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, Holineſs, Righteouſneſs,</hi> in the <hi>viſible Judgments</hi> he brings on particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>Societies</hi> of men here in this World. And probably this (as was hinted but now) is what is more immediately, primarily and directly intended in our Text.</p>
                  <p>Yet our Text is by no means to be confined, limited or reſtrained to this ſenſe. For in this World God does not always make a manifeſt evident di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the good and bad, <hi>by giving to every one according to his works.</hi> We're plainly told, Eccl. 8. 14.—<hi>There be juſt men to whom it happeneth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the work of the wicked; &amp; again,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001913_0063_0FB9D6A8D09963C0"/>
there be wicked men, unto whom it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth according to the work of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> Sometimes <hi>the way of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed does proſper,</hi> Jer. 12. 1. <hi>The wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he,</hi> (Hab. 1. 13.) while <hi>the godly are plagued all the day long, and chaſtened every morning,</hi> Pſal. 73. 14. Well, but the Lord Jeſus who knows perfectly well <hi>all the thoughts, words and actions, of all men;</hi> will be the Univerſal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge of the whole world; and in the <hi>Judgment-day</hi> he'll make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt &amp; known to <hi>all perſons, all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> yea to <hi>all Nations,</hi> (for they ſhall he cited before him. Mat. 25. 32.) <hi>that he ſearches the reins and the hearts,</hi> and that by his <hi>giving to every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his works.</hi> At that time Chriſt <hi>will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, &amp; the counſels of the heart ſhall be made manifeſt.</hi> 1. Cor. 4. 5. At that time moſt fully and remarkable, <hi>he will render to every man according to his deeds. To them who by patient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in well doing, do ſeek for glory, honour and immortality, eternal life. But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and anguiſh, on every ſoul of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001913_0064_0FB9D6AA417FB678"/>
man that doth evil.</hi> Rom. 2. 6—9. God ſays, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in the body; according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Then</hi> the <hi>ſecret</hi> (as well as open) Sins of the Wicked, tho' they had been cloak'd with never ſo ſplendid preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Piety, ſhall be laid open to the view of all men and Angels; &amp; have juſt puniſhment inflicted for them <hi>Then</hi> alſo ſhall the <hi>ſecret</hi> (as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen) duties of the Saints, their <hi>holy deſires, deſigns, ſecret prayers, ſincerity of heart</hi> in thoſe actions which men were ready to charge with formality and hypocriſie; I ſay, theſe things ſhall be laid open, made publick to the view of all; and ſhall be graciouſly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt the Judge of all. The Laſt Day, the Great Day of Judgment, will be the great day of <hi>diſtinction &amp; ſeparation</hi> between the <hi>Sheep</hi> and the <hi>Goats,</hi> the <hi>Wheat</hi> and the <hi>Chaff,</hi> the <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>Ungodly.</hi> Then, even at that time moſt evidently, fully and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001913_0065_0FB9D6AC60BA7E88"/>
remarkably, <hi>will the Lord Jeſus give to every one according to his works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may now proceed to the <hi>Uſe,</hi> and may Infer from what has been ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We ſhould never content our ſelves, meerly with Externals in Religion.</hi> It's true, we ſhould acquaint our ſelves with the Goſpel of Chriſt, believe it, profeſs our belief of it and ſubjection to it. We ſhould atttend Gods Holy Worſhip and Ordinances, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our words and outward actions to the precepts of the Goſpel, as that Men may have nothing remarkable to ſay againſt us, Phil. 2. 15. <hi>That ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God without rebuke.</hi> But we ſhould by no means content our ſelves, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with what is outward and viſible in Religion. There may be a form of godlineſs, where there's nothing of the power of it. To have a name to live, and yet be dead; is a terrible condition to be in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We ſhould not think our ſelves
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001913_0066_0FB9D6AD41790788"/>
ſincere, Saints, meerly becauſe Men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem us ſo.</hi> Men can Judge only by outward appearance, 1 Sam. 16. 7. Even <hi>good men</hi> may be miſtaken about us, and think much better of us than we really are. Did not holy <hi>Abraham</hi> charitably hope, that there might be <hi>fifty righteous perſons in Sodom,</hi> when God the <hi>ſearcher of Hearts</hi> knew there were <hi>not ten</hi> there? Gen. 18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Our great buſineſs ſhould be, to approve our Hearts right and ſincere before God.</hi> Without this, all our ſhows of Religion will avail nothing to our Salvation. Not one hypocrite ſhall go to Heaven. Many of the <hi>Children of the Kingdom</hi> (thoſe who belong to Chriſt's viſible Church in this world) <hi>ſhall be cast into outer darkneſs,</hi> Mat. 8. 12. Many Profeſſors, many Church-members will be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Hell for ever; yea and many <hi>Preachers</hi> as well as <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of the Goſpel. <hi>Many</hi> will ſay to Chriſt, Lord, Lord, <hi>have we not propheſied in thy name</hi> (that is, preach'd his Word)
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001913_0067_0FB9D6B003B612C0"/>
and yet he'll ſay to them, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me ye that work Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Mat. 7. 22, 23. We ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee to it, that we heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of Sin, believe in Chriſt, love and obey God. We muſt have Faith that purifies the Heart and works by love, elſe we muſt periſh for ever. No outward ſhows of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Intitle us to Heaven; none but the <hi>pure in Heart</hi> ſhall ſee God. If there were a great Aſſembly of Profeſſors together, and but <hi>one hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi> among them; he ſhould periſh &amp; all the reſt be ſaved. So, if there were among them but <hi>one ſincere Saint,</hi> he ſhould be ſaved; and all the reſt ſhould be damned. We ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrive (like the Apoſtle) <hi>to pleaſe God who trieth our hearts,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 4.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Particular Churches ſhould make Chriſt's glory their end, and his Word their rule in all they do.</hi> The Lord Jeſus knows the heart deſigns and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of all, not only conſider'd in their ſingle capacity as individual
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001913_0068_0FB9D6C34FC2BE88"/>
perſons; but alſo conſider'd as parts or members of any Society or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Therefore <hi>Churches</hi> as ſuch, ſhould Endeavour to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves to Chriſt in all they do: For he is the Head of the body the Church, the Builder and Owner of the Church which is his Houſe. And if they would approve themſelves to him, they ſhould aim at his glory &amp; make his word their rule, in all they do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>This is their duty.</hi> They ſhould <hi>obſerve all things whatſoever Christ has Commanded,</hi> Mat. 28. 20. <hi>He is thy Lord, and Worſhip thou him,</hi> Pſal. 45. 11. Chriſt has <hi>purchas'd his Church with his own blood,</hi> and ſince he has ſo <hi>bought them with a price; they ſhould glorify him with their bodies and Spirits which are his,</hi> Act. 20. 28. 1 Cor. 6. 20</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>This is their Honour.</hi> When per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons make a true and right profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tis their honour to act agreeably thereto; for therein they ſhow their Integrity and Uprightneſs. Churches
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001913_0069_0FB9D6CB70804A50"/>
(as well as particular Chriſtians) can't honour themſelves more, than in walking and acting as Chriſt (whom they profeſs to be their Lord and Maſter) commands them to do. Chriſt ſaid to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, thou hast kept my word;</hi> and the Exhortation he then gave was, <hi>hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown,</hi> Rev. 3. 8, 11. While <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> keep cloſe to the Word of Chriſt and act agreeably thereto, 'tis a <hi>crown of honour and glory to them;</hi> and their ſo doing leads to <hi>an eternal crown of glory</hi> in the future World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This is their ſafety and Advantage. All Power in Heaven and Earth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Chriſt,</hi> he's <hi>Head over all things to the Church</hi> (Mat. 28. 18. Eph. 1.22.) he <hi>walks in the midſt of the Golden Candleſticks</hi> (the Churches) and <hi>holds the ſtars</hi> (his Miniſters) <hi>in his right hand,</hi> Rev. 1. 13, 16. 20. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he rules and governs <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> according to his Infinite Wiſe and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001913_0070_0FB9D6CE0809D898"/>
Soveraign pleaſure. Therefore it muſt needs be for the ſafety and welfare of <hi>particular Churches</hi> (as well as particular Chriſtians) to obey and honour Chriſt in all things. He's <hi>King in Zion,</hi> has <hi>a rod of Iron to daſh his enemies to pieces, as a Potter's veſſel;</hi> therefore it's <hi>wiſdom</hi> to <hi>ſerve him with holy fear;</hi> leſt <hi>his anger being kindled againſt us,</hi> he deſtroy us for ever, Pſal. 2. It's unſpeakably dangerous for Perſons or Churches, to provoke the Lord Jeſus by acting contrary to his Word; for he can <hi>remove the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick</hi> out of it's place, <hi>fight against them with the rod of his mouth, come on them</hi> (ſuddenly) <hi>as a thief, kill them with death,</hi> and <hi>ſpue them out of his mouth</hi> (as he threatens in caſe of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence and non amendment) Rev. 2. 5, 16, 23. <hi>and</hi> 3. 3, 16. If they provoke him to anger, he can tear them to pieces ſo that none ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; he can terribly plague and puniſh them both in this World and in the next. On the other hand, if
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001913_0071_0FB9D6CFC36CFFB8"/>
they keep the word of Chriſt's pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, uphold and maintain his <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, Worſhip, Diſcipline</hi> as his word directs; and in all things approve themſelves to him; he can and will do for them, all that infinite Wiſdom (accompani'd with Infinite Love) ſees beſt for them. What great and <hi>precious Promiſes</hi> in theſe Epiſtles to the <hi>Aſian Churches,</hi> are there made to thoſe that are faithful in ſerving of Chriſt? Promiſes very great and precious Indeed. Truly, <hi>godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>All things ſhall work together for good to them that love God, and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to his purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8. 28.</p>
                  <p>And as all particular Churches, ſhould make Gods glory their end and his Word their rule; ſo ſhould <hi>you</hi> who purpoſe (God willing) to attend and uphold his Worſhip and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances <hi>in this place.</hi> To you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that have been at conſiderable pains and coſt, in building this Houſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001913_0072_0FB9D6D9EF9194F0"/>
for the Worſhip of God, I would ſay a few things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Examine your ſelves concerning what you have done in this matter.</hi> Was it with a true and hearty aim, at the furtherance of Gods glory and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Religion; that you engag'd in this affair, and have been at ſuch pains and expence in it? I would not be miſtaken, I do not charge nor chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any of you in this matter; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I think it's not improper, for you to examine your own hearts in this affair. If upon examination you find, that you have regularly and ſincerely approv'd your hearts to God in this affair; then be <hi>thankful</hi> that God has enabled you to <hi>expend ſo much</hi> for his ſervice, and that he has <hi>Inclin'd</hi> you thus to <hi>honour him with your Subſtance;</hi> and you ſhould humbly hope and truſt, that theſe your gifts and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings do and ſhall find acceptance with God thro' Chriſt. It's a good and great thing, when in matters of this nature perſons can truly ſay, as <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001913_0073_0FB9D6DAF0EE0040"/>
about his <hi>Preparations</hi> to build the <hi>Temple,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 17.—<hi>As for me, in the uprightneſs of mine heart I have willingly offered all theſe things.</hi> And as you ſhould be <hi>thankful,</hi> ſo far as you have <hi>approv'd your ſelves to God</hi> in this affair; ſo you ſhould be <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> alſo for the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> you have had. The beſt means can't command ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Eccl. 9. 11. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor riches to men of underſtanding, nor favour to men of skill: but time and chance happeneth to all men.</hi> Men might labour in the fire, and ſpend their ſtrength for very vanity, if God did not ſmile on and ſucceed their Endeavours, Pſal. 127. 1. <hi>Except the Lord build the Houſe, they labour in vain that build it.</hi> It is therefore owing to kind Providence, not only that perſons have <hi>contributed</hi> of their <hi>eſtates to build this Houſe;</hi> but alſo that <hi>Materials</hi> have been provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Labourers</hi> and <hi>Artificers preſerved and aſſiſted,</hi> and <hi>that the Houſe is thus
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001913_0074_0FB9D6DE326DBE88"/>
finiſhed and perfected. Be thankful</hi> to God for this. But if upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any of you find, that you have acted from <hi>by, ſiniſter</hi> ends, not truly aiming at the furtherance of Gods glory and the Intereſt of Religion, or not <hi>chiefly</hi> aiming at theſe things; this calls for your humiliation before God, and flying to the blood of Jeſus for pardon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Approve your ſelves to God for the future.</hi> Be Chriſtians not only in word, but in deed and in truth, Dont content your ſelves, with any thing ſhort of true unfeign'd repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſin, and faith in Chriſt Jeſus. A <hi>New Meeting-Huuſe</hi> (if it were as coſtly and magnificent as <hi>Solomons Temple</hi>) <hi>New Seats, New Pews,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>New Heart;</hi> can never Intitle you to an <hi>habitation</hi> or <hi>ſeat</hi> in the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> which is above. <hi>Sabbaths, Meeting-Houſes, Ordinances, Miniſters;</hi> as to <hi>Man's profit,</hi> are all of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to this end <abbr>

Live therefore as becomes the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, the members of Chriſt, the living Temples of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; being holy in heart and life, holy in all manner of converſation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Maintain Religion in your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi> Be religious in your own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as well as in the Houſe of God.
