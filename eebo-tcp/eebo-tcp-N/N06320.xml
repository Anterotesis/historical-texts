            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM XXII. 28.</bibl>
               <q>FOR the Kingdom is the Lord's: And He is Governour among the Nations.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Neceſſity and Importance of civil Government, to the Welfare of Mankind, and the manifold Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of it to humane Society, have been ſo often, and ſo well treated of upon ſuch Occaſions as this; that it is needleſs to add any thing to what has been ſaid by my Reverend Fathers who have gone before me, on this Subject.</p>
            <p>But after all that Man, that the wiſeſt and beſt of Men, in the moſt exalted Stations can do, there Manifeſtly needs a ſuperiour Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Goodneſs, to govern the World, and order the great Affairs of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Nations to the beſt and wiſeſt Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:008017_0005_102E1477B30FDA88"/>It will not therefore be improper or unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to raiſe our Thoughts to the Bleſſed and only Potentate, and to conſider ſomething of his univerſal Empire and Dominion over all Nations, yea over all Creatures, and all Events; when the Heads and Rulers of our Tribes are aſſembled, to give Thanks to GOD for his great Goodneſs to this People, in the many diſtinguiſhing Privileges, which thrô his good Providence, we have been, and are yet indulged with; and to ſeek his Guidance and Bleſſing on our public Intereſts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; particularly, upon the important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs that lay before our General Aſſembly; eſpecially, at ſuch a Seaſon as this, when our Nation and Land are involved in the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of War, when Kings of the Earth are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves, and Rulers and Kingdoms combining and taking counſel together againſt us, and not againſt us only, but, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, againſt the whole Proteſtant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and the Reformed Churches in general.</p>
            <p>'Tis juſt matter of Support and Comfort <hi>that GOD governs the World,</hi> that the Supreme Ordering and Diſpoſal of all things is in the Hands of infinite Wiſdom, Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>The LORD reigneth, let the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce: let the Multitude of the iſles be glad thereof.</hi> Pſal. 97.1.

of this univerſal Government, is put into the Hands of CHRIST, our great Mediator, whom <hi>God hath ſet at his own Right hand in heavenly Places — and hath put all things under his Feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the Church</hi> Eph. 1.20.22.</p>
            <p>This Pſalm, wherein is our Text, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a Prophecy of CHRIST, there are ſeveral Paſſages of it expreſsly applied to Him in the New Teſtament, and there are ſome Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in it, that can be applied to none elſe in their ſtricteſt and moſt proper Senſe, and can belong to David, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a Type of Chriſt in a figurative and metaphorical Senſe only. — The deep Abaſement, and bitter and unparallel'd Sufferings of our Bleſſed Saviour, — The very kind, and manner, and circumſtances of his Death, his glorious Exaltation, and the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and propagation of his Kingdom thrô the World, are here foretold, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Circumſtances attending them, ſo very minutely pointed out; and all was ſo exactly fulfilled in our bleſſed Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> as to give very convincing Evidence that this is indeed the CHRIST, the promiſed Saviour of the World.</p>
            <p>What the inſpired Apoſtle ſaith of Him <hi>Phil.</hi> 2 6,—10. is here foretold, and may ſerve as a Comment or Illuſtration on great
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008017_0007_102E147D6C312FC8"/>
Part of this Pſalm: viz. <hi>That being in the form of GOD, He thought it not Robbery to be equal with GOD: But made himſelf of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and took upon him the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and was made in the likeneſs of Men: and being found in Faſhion as a Man, be hum led himſelf and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs Wherefore GOD alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name: that in the Name of JEſUS every Knee ſhould bow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>CHRIST was raiſed from the deepeſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement and Sufferings, to the higheſt Dignity, Honour and Glory: This gives Hope to his People when in a low afflicted State, that Light will ſooner or later ariſe to them out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſince He who once ſuffered for them, in their Stead, as well as for their Good, now lives and reigns above, to diſpenſe the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings He died to purchaſe, and always has ſhown, and will always ſhow, a very tender Concern for his Church and People whom He has redeemed with his own Blood. Let the Proſpect look never ſo dark and threatning, which way ſoever elſe we turn our Eves; yet here Light ariſes, and we may find ſomething to bear up our Hearts and Hopes, when we fix them upon the all-diſpoſing Providence of GOD, eſpecially, as it is adminiſtred by Chriſt our great Mediator, whom <hi>GOD has ſet as

the ſpiritual, and civil Government, for the Temporal Good and Welfare of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But further,</hi> as GOD had a ſpecial Regard to Man, in the Formation, Preſervation, and Government of the inferiour Orders of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; so his Providence watches over Man, and all his Affairs, and Concerns, with a very particular Care. How much is needful to one Man's Preſervation, Support, and Comfort: And what Wiſdom, Power; and Goodneſs muſt be employ'd, in upholding a whole World of Men; ſupplying them with Neceſſaries, Comforts and Delights of various Kinds; and that not for a Day, or Year, or one Age only; but thrô the ſeveral Ages and Generations of Men that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, and been provided for, in theſe, almoſt Six Thouſand Years, that the World has ſtood, and that notwithſtanding, Ten Thouſand Barrs and obſtructions, that Men have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually laying in the way of their own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by their Sins, Follies, and Diſorders.</p>
            <p>We might here more particularly, thô it muſt be but briefly, Conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD's Providential Government over Men, as combined in civil Societies. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is made for Society, and ſtands in need of mutual Help. — Government is neceſſary to the Being, and Well-Being of Society. — There would probably have been ſome Sort
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008017_0017_102E14978F100C70"/>
of Government among Mankind, as there ſeems to be among the Holy Angels, had Man retain'd his Integrity. — 'Tis more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary in this our fallen and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved State, wherein Men's Luſts, and irregular, ſinful Inclinations are become ſo impetuous, and headſtrong, and bear ſuch a dreadful Sway — The ſence of GOD and Religion is ſo much effaced, and worn out of Men's Minds, and the State of future Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (if not diſbelieved) is by many, ſo little thôt of, or looked upon as ſo far off; that it has but a feeble Influence upon the Minds of moſt.— There needs ſome nearer, and more ſenſible Reſtraint, to curb Men's irregular and vicious Inclinations, and keep the World in any tolerable Peace and Order. — What an unſafe and uncomfortable Place would this World be, were Men left at their full, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained Liberty, to do every One, what ſeems Right in his own Eyes, or rather what is moſt agreeable to his own irregular and ſinful Inclinations? Men's Wills and Strength would be their Rule; many would be ready to ſnatch from others what they was able to get, and had a mind to have, and to cruſh or deſtroy thoſe that would hinder or oppoſe them No Man's Life, Poſſeſſions or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts would be ſafe; <hi>But Men like the Fiſhes of the Sea, that have no Ruler over them,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:008017_0018_102E14992493B948"/>
would be preying upon, and devouring one another. <hi>Habb.</hi> 1. 14. GOD has therefore, in great Wiſdom, and Mercy to Mankind, appointed civil Government, to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and Praiſe to them that do well, and a Terror to evil doers; that under its Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Men may find Reſt and Safety, and lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Honeſty.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of civil Government is evident from the very Nature and Reaſon of Things; and that it is of divine Inſtitution and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment appears as evident from Scripture, which teaches us alſo the End and Deſigns of it. See, Prov. 8 15, 16. <hi>By me Kings Reign, and Princes decree Juſtice, By me Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>beg. Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of GOD: the Powers that be are ordained of GOD,</hi> &amp;c. See alſo, I <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14. Civil Rulers derive their Authority from GOD, the ſupreme Ruler and Governor of the World; they rule under Him, and ſhould rule for Him; and improve their Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to thoſe great and good Ends and Purpoſes for which He has appointed it.</p>
            <p>And his all-diſpoſing Providence preſides over Kingdoms, Nations, and Governments.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008017_0019_102E149BCCB4D690"/>
               <hi>The moſt High GOD divideth to the ſeveral Nations their Inheritance.</hi> Deut. 32.8. <hi>And appointeth the Bounds of their Habitation.</hi> Acts 17.26. And when any People have, not only their Lot caſt in a good Land; but a good form of Government ſet up among them, — well qualified Perſons raiſed up, and veſted with Authority,—good Laws and Rules found out, and eſtabliſhed; the Agency and Influence of divine Providence is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged, and the divine Goodneſs is to be Adored therein.</p>
            <p>'Tis the great Ruler of the World, that ſets up, and pulls down earthly Rulers as He pleaſes. Pſal. 75.6, 7. <hi>For Promotion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South: But GOD is the Judge; He putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> Dan. 4.17, 32. <hi>The most High GOD ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever He will.</hi> He either raiſes up good Rulers, and ſets them over a People in Mercy, as he raiſed up David his Servant, and ſet him over His People Iſrael; <hi>To feed them according to the integrity of his Heart; and guide them by the fulfillneſs of his Hands</hi>; Pſal. 78.72.

See this further Illuſtrated: <hi>Job</hi> 12.16,—25. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.33. But we proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Affairs of the Church are under the ſpecial Care, and Conduct of divine Providence.</p>
            <p>GOD early ſet up a Church in the World, and has hitherto preſerved it, and many ways expreſſed his ſpecial Care and Kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, from its earlieſt Infancy in the days of Adam, down to this very Day; and has aſſured us, that thrô his continued Care, <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> Mat. 16.18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:008017_0022_102E14A3A17E8238"/>'Tis worthy of Obſervation, that as we can't worſhip GOD aright, any further than we know how it is his Will and Pleasure to be Worſhipped; ſo (beſides what may be learned from the dim beclouded Light of natural Reaſon) GOD has all along favoured his Church with the Light of divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for many Ages of the World, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets immediately Inſpired, or Meſſages from Heaven by holy Angels; and theſe Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions communicated by Oral Tradition. But it has pleaſed GOD long ſince, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Will to Writing in the holy Scripture, that ſure Word of Prophecy, which was given by divine Inſpiration, and contains all we need to know, or practice, in order to GOD's Acceptance, and our own Salvation. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. To theſe ſacred Writings, GOD has given the ſtrongeſt Atteſtation, and by his ſpecial Providence has preſerved them to this Day.—GOD's public Worſhip was early ſet up in the World, and Men began in ſolemn Aſſemblies to Call upon the Name of the Lord. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.26.</p>
            <p>When the ſence of Religion, and Virtue was ſo far loſt in the World, and Mankind was grown ſo very corrupt and degenerate that GOD determined to deſtroy that wicked Generation of Men from the face of the Earth by a remarkable Vengeance: He preſerved
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008017_0023_102E14A5FB784228"/>
Noah, a Preacher of Righteouſneſs with his Family. And when alter this, the World was running faſt into Idolatry; and GOD in his holy Providence, ſuffered other <hi>Nations to walk in their own ways,</hi> Acts 14.16. GOD called Abraham, taught him the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and Worſhip of GOD, and preſerved it among his Poſterity: And thô even they were ſo much addicted to Idolatry and Wickedneſs, that the true Religion ſeemed ſometimes to be almoſt loſt among them, yet in the worſt of Times, GOD preſerved a Number of true, and faithful Worſhippers. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.14.18. And thô for their Sins, GOD often raiſed up Enemies againſt them, and chaſtized with a variety of other Judgments, and at length ſent them into a miſerable Captivity; yet He again returned them to their own Land, and that in ſo remarkable a Way that his Hand appeared viſible in it: When their Enemies had, at one Time and another, plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, attempted, and ſeemed almoſt to have affected their Ruin, He always, ſeaſonably interpoſed for their Help: See Book of <hi>Eſth.</hi> And at length, when the fulneſs of Time was come, GOD ſent his own Son to atone for Men's Sins, by his Sufferings, and Death; to give the World a perfect Pattern and Example of Holineſs; and to ſet up that pure and ſpiritual Diſpenſation, which is to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008017_0024_102E14A9203A0FA0"/>
continue to the end of the World; and ſo ſoon did He ſpread this holy Religion abroad, that the Apoſtle Paul applies what the Pſalmiſt ſpake of the Sun in the Heavens, to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive Light of the Goſpel, even at that Day. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. And having ſet up the Chriſtian Church, He has ſtill upheld it, againſt all the Power and Policy of Hell and Earth — carried it thrô a Sea of Blood, in <hi>Ten Heatheniſh,</hi> and a <hi>greater Number of Popiſh</hi> Perſecutions, — has reformed a conſiderable Part of it from the groſs Errors, Superſtitions, and Idolatries of Popery,— and has always had a Number of faithful Witneſſes, to profeſs, and bear Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to the Truth, againſt the Corruptions of Antichriſt, — has often revived Religion when decay'd and languiſhing, and always had a Church in the World, wherein Chriſt has Reigned even in the midſt of Enemies, — who thô they have often afflicted, yet have never been able to deſtroy it. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. and 124.</p>
            <p>But I may not enlarge on this delightful Theme of GOD's Care over his Church:</p>
            <p>But proceed to ſay, that as GOD's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence preſides over Mankind in General, and governs the larger Bodies, and Societies of Men. So,</p>

In all theſe Things GOD acts, in a Manner becoming Himſelf, how far ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is above our Thoughts and Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: So as, neither to be the Author of Sin, nor an unactive, unconcerned Spectator: But the holy, wiſe, powerful Orderer, and Diſpoſer of all Things. In brief, GOD is infinitely Holy, and hates Sin; infinitely Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and could prevent Sin; and therefore would never permit Sin, were He not alſo, infinitely Wiſe, to bring Good out of Evil; as He did, in the Caſe of Joſeph's Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20.

            <p>We make a Profeſſion, and have the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Religion among us; and there are, I Truſt, no ſmall Number of truly Godly and Religious People in the Land; and I ſuppoſe, the People of this Land, and of this Colony, are not in general, ſunk into ſo great a Depth of Prophaneneſs, Vice, and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as ſome other Parts of the World. But are we not far degenerated from the Virtue and Piety of our Anceſtors? Where is that ſtrict, ſerious Virtue and Religion that Once

            <p>And as there is a ſad Decay and Decline in theſe excellent Things; ſo on the other Hand, are not thoſe Sins and Vices grown much more common and frequent, that were ſeldom known among the firſt Settlers of this Land?

May not GOD complain of us, that we have left our firſt Love? that Iniquity abounds, and tha Love of many waxes Cold: that as our Numbers, and Worldly Comforts and Accommodations have Increaſed, ſo have our Sins, — that we are grown more corrupt in our Principles: more looſe and irreligious, profane and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in our Practice; and that the Things that remain are Languiſhing and ready to Die?

            <p>Our Fathers no Doubt, had their Failings and Imperfections; and they had likewiſe their Troubles and Tryals: But as we have been gradually declining from GOD, have not his Frowns, and our Troubles been increaſing in a variety of Judgments? as Wars, Sickneſs, Droughts, and Difficulties in our Civil and Religious Affairs. Indeed GOD has in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remembred Mercy, and ſeemed loth to proceed to Extremity; as Pſal. 78.38. <hi>But He bring full of Compaſſion, forgave their Iniquity, and Deſtroyed them not; yea, many a Time turned He away his Anger,</hi> and did not ſtir up all his <hi>Wrath.</hi> But have we not continued, to a ſad Degree impenitent and unreformed, under Mercies and Judgments; yea, been waxing worſe and worſe under both?</p>
            <p>And as our Sins, ſo his righteous Frowns ſeem to be increaſing upon us: 'Tis now a dark Day. The aſpects of Providence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very frowning and threatening: We are deeply involved in the Troubles and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of War: And thô our Rulers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſhown a forward Spirit to engage
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008017_0037_102E14C7D46CC668"/>
and exert themſelves, to their Power; yea, may I not ſay, beyond their Power, for our neceſſary Defence, and for repelling the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Force and Violence of our Enemies: Yet it has not pleaſed GOD to ſmile, but frown upon moſt of our Enterprizes. Our Enemies have been ſufferred to gain great Advantages againſt us, which I need not, and delight not to relate; while our Expeditions againſt them (in which great Numbers of Lives have been loſt, and conſiderable Part of our moderate Treaſure or Subſtance has been ſpent) have Once and Again proved unſucceſsful: And when our Numbers are leſſened, and conſiderable of our ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſpent, the Burden of War lies ſtill heavy upon a Young &amp; Infant Country, whoſe Sinews are but feeble to ſuſtain it; our Experience in Campaigns but ſmall; and our Minds, I fear, not ſuitably affected,— more diſpoſed to complain of Men, than to humble ourſelves before GOD, and to Truſt in an Arm of Fleſh, than to ſeek and engage his Almighty Help. Theſe are dark Symptoms, and ſore Frowns upon us, and in what they are to Iſſue GOD only knows.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> It therefore becomes and concerns us to ſee, and ſuitably to take Notice of the Hand and Providence of GOD, in all the Troubles and Calamities we are under. 'Tis
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008017_0038_102E14C96886D508"/>
but too common, and too natural to us to fix our Eyes ſo much upon Means and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and ſecond Cauſes, as to forget and overlook the great Firſt Cauſe, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Orderer of all Things, and hence to be either Unaffected, or unſuitably Affected. But does not GOD govern the World? <hi>Is there any Evil in the City, and the LORD hath not done it,</hi> Amos 3.6. <hi>Who gave Jacob to a Spoil, and Iſrael to the Robbers? did not the LORD, He againſt whom we have Sinned? for they would not walk in his Ways, neither were they obedient to his Law,</hi> Iſa. 42.24. And ſhould not his Hand be taken Notice of? — We have Cauſe more than enough to complain of the Injuriouſneſs of our Enemies, — and we have great Reaſon to lament the Unſucceſsfulneſs of our Friends, — But we have, at the ſame Time, no leſs Reaſon to humble ourſelves under the righteous Hand of GOD in both: And 'till we get into this Way, to look at the Hand of GOD, and look into our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to humble ourſelves, for our Sins, and under his Frowns, and pray, and ſeek his Face, and turn from our evil Ways, we have little Reaſon to expect the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of our Troubles.

            <p>Our Work is Great, as well as Good: We need each others Help and Aſſiſtance in it, as well as all of us continual Help and Aſſiſtance from GOD; it therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to be <hi>Fellow Workers</hi> herein, and by our mutual Affection, Prayers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Aſſiſtance to encourage each others Hearts, and ſtrengthen each others Hands, and further each others Uſefulneſs and Comfort as much as we are able; ſtriving together for the Faith of the Goſpel, and to promote the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that pure and holy Religion CHRIST has taught us in his Word, and recommended by his Practice. — And the Diſtreſſes of the Day call upon us who are Miniſters of the LORD to be much in our Prayers and Cries to GOD, that He would ſpare and bleſs his People, as <hi>Joel</hi> 2.17.</p>

perhaps much Miſtaken. This the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Affairs may prove a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to; we ſhould therefore guard the more carefully againſt it. Remember that Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not to be expected in Man. That there may Difficulties ariſe which humane Wiſdom can neither fore-ſee and obviate, nor humane Power prevent. It becomes us rather to eye the Hand of GOD in the Difficulties we are under, to humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before Him, to ſee and realize our Dependance on Him, and to ſeek to Him, and wait on Him for Help and Deliverance, and to ſtrengthen the Hands of our Rulers when ſeeking our Good.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things, the Frowns of GOD we are under — the threating Danger we are in — the dark Cloud that gathers over us (and not over us only, but over the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Intereſt) loudly call us to.</p>
            <p>There is yet Hope in GOD, He is able to Help: And if we return to, and ſeek, and truſt in Him, there is Hope he will.</p>
            <p>'Tis a great Work that is now in the Hands of our Rulers, our Officers, and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the Defence of our Lives, our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Properties, our Holy Religion.—All that is dear to us in this World ſeems evidently to be ſtruck at, and threatned, by the Deſigns and Attempts of our ancient,

active, inveterate, and alaſs! now too ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enemies, who have long been projecting to bring <hi>North-America</hi> under their Power, and againſt whom we are never ſafe, when 'tis in their Power to Hurt and Deſtroy us, our intire Dependence is on GOD for Succeſs againſt them.—But what have we done more than formerly, to engage his Preſence, Help and Bleſſing? Let us ſee our Danger, our Duty and our Dependence upon GOD, let us humble ourſelves before Him, for our Sins, and under his Frowns, carefully and ſpeedily reform whatever is amiſs, every One, Firſt in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or in his Family; and every One in his Place and Station, endeavour to further a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reformation, and all unite in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Cries to GOD for his Help and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: This has been tried, and not found in vain. ver. 4, 5.

               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:008017_0049_102E14E4DC74E598"/>There is Help in GOD, and when his People are prepared, and in his appointed Way waiting for it, he is ready to beſtow it.</p>
            <p>'Tis an encouraging Conſideration that our Enemies are alſo his — either Heathen Idolaters, or Idolatrous Chriſtians, in whoſe Skirts is found the Blood of GOD's Saints and Servants.</p>
            <p>And is it not a further Token for Good, that GOD has given us ſuch Favour in the Eyes of our <hi>Royal Father</hi> the KING, and of the Nation, and given them ſuch a Sence of our Danger, and Concern for our Safety and Welfare, as to ſend, not only conſiderable Supplies of Men and Money, and Military Stores, as well as Naval Force; but One of the NOBLES of the Land, of tried and approved Skill and Valour, as well as of unſhaken Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and firm Attachment to the Britiſh Liberties civil and religious, to conduct our Military Affairs. May GOD make him a happy Inſtrument of our Protection and Safety.</p>
            <p>Let us be Thankful to GOD for theſe Smiles of his Providence. But let us not truſt in an Arm of Fleſh, but in the LORD of Hoſts, and may He be our Protection and Defence, and give us Cauſe to Sing,
