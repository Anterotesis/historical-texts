            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great and wiſe Author of our being, has ſo formed us, that the love of liberty is natural. This paſſion, like all other original prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the human mind, is, in itſelf,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012256_0005_0F8A6C1D751829C0"/>
perfectly innocent, and deſigned for excellent purpoſes, though, like them, liable, through abuſe, of becoming the cauſe of miſchief to ourſelves and others. In a civil ſtate, the genius of whoſe conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is agreeable to it, this paſſion, while in its full vigor, and under proper regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is not only the cement of the political body, but the wakeful guardian of its intereſts, and the great animating ſpring of uſeful and ſalutary operations; and then only is it injurious to the public, or to individuals, when, thro' miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of things, or by being overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced by ſelf-love, it takes a wrong direction.</p>
            <p>CIVIL and eccleſiaſtical ſocieties are, in ſome eſſential points, different. Our rights, as men, and our rights, as chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, are not, in all reſpects, the ſame. It cannot, however, be reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but that this uſeful and important principle, muſt, in its genuine influence and operation, be friendly to both: For although our Saviour has aſſured us, his kingdom is not of this world; and it be
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012256_0006_0F8A6C1E20B07820"/>
manifeſt from the Goſpel, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its conſtitution and laws, that his ſubjects ſtand in ſome ſpecial relation, and are under ſome peculiar ſubjection to him, diſtinct from their relation to, and connection with civil ſocieties, yet we juſtly conclude, that as this divine polity, with its ſacred maxims, proceeded from the wiſe and benevolent Author of our being, none of its injunctions can be inconſiſtent with that love of liberty, he himſelf has implanted in us, nor interfere with the laws and government of human ſocieties, whoſe conſtitution is conſiſtent with the rights of men.</p>
            <p>CHRIST came to ſet up a kingdom diverſe, indeed, from the kingdoms of this world, but it was no part of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to put down, or deſtroy government and rule among men. He came to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure liberty for his people, and to make them free, in the moſt important ſenſe, yet not to exempt them from ſubjection to civil powers, or to diſſolve their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to one another, as members of political bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:012256_0007_0F8A6C202158F4F0"/>
As to things of this nature, all eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical conſtitutions and laws, as coming from GOD, muſt leave men juſt as they were; becauſe all civil ſocieties, founded on principles of reaſon and equity, are, as well as the peculiar laws of Chiſtianity, agreeable to the Deity, and certainly, intimations from the all-perfect mind, cannot be contradictory.</p>
            <p>THESE things, ſeem not to have been rightly apprehended, and well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by men, at all times and in all places. The Jews, ſome of whom were early proſelyted to the chriſtian faith, had imbibed high notions of their liberty, and ſuperiority to all others, as the peculiar people of GOD; and were loth to own ſubjection to the Romans, as a civil ſtate, when they were actually under their dominion. And ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts from among the Gentiles, tho' they had not theſe national prejudices. yet from their ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt, as their King and Ruler, and, as 'tis probable, from miſtaking the meaning of ſome apoſtolic declarations, aſſerting
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012256_0008_0F8A6C204C5DD520"/>
their freedom, as chriſtians, diſclaimed likewiſe all human authority over them.</p>
            <p>MEN of this caſt, gave no ſmall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to Church and State, in the early days of the Goſpel. Of ſuch the Apoſtle Peter ſpeaks where he ſays—<hi>They deſpiſe government: Preſumptuous are they. Self-willed, they are not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Pet. II. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH men as theſe, and their ſeditious, turbulent behaviour, I doubt not, this ſame Apoſtle had in view, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the inſtructions in my text, by which he endeavoured to guard chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans againſt their evil practices.</p>
            <p>BUT, as all authority, demanding ſubmiſſion, and all ſubmiſſion, due to ſuch authority, are likely to be beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, by having theſe things reduced to their firſt principles;—by having the foundation of ſuch authority fairly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and its juſt boundaries, which muſt be the meaſure of ſubmiſſion due to it, clearly marked out: And as ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is moſt likely to be duly yielded,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012256_0009_0F8A6C214BDED950"/>
by having the reaſons and motives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of plainly exhibited, ſo theſe are things which ſeem here aimed at by the Apoſtle. <hi>Submit yourſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake: whether it be to the King as ſupreme; or unto Governors, as unto them who are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evil-doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well. For ſo is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to ſilence the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of fooliſh men: As free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN theſe words he gives us a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of civil government; repreſenting its origin and great deſign; that ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or obedience which is due to it; and the true principles from which ſuch obedience ſhould flow.</p>
            <p>UPON this general view of the ſubject, it is obvious, that if handled with any degree of propriety, it may offer uſeful inſtructions, both to Rulers, and thoſe under their government.—A modeſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to do this, will not, it is hoped, be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012256_0010_0F8A6C21E3EC6558"/>
diſagreeable to this reſpectable audience, by whom I aſk to be heard with patience and candor.</p>
            <p>THE FIRST thing offered to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is, the ORIGIN of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, from whence all authority in the ſtate muſt take its riſe. And this is ſaid to be from man. <hi>Submit yourſelves to every ordinance of man,</hi> &amp;c. More in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly, perhaps, it might be rendered, "to every human Inſtitution or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment." And this may be juſtly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as having reſpect to every kind of civil government, under whatever form it is adminiſtred:—It is the ordinance,—the inſtitution or appointment of man.</p>
            <p>THIS does not imply, however, that civil government is not from God; for thus it is ſometimes repreſented, and is expreſſly ſaid to be the <hi>ordinance of God.</hi> So St. Paul declares.—<hi>There is no power but of God. The powers that be, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God. Who ever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. XIII. 1, 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:012256_0011_0F8A6C22A90C06B0"/>
CIVIL government is not, indeed, ſo from God, as to be expreſſly appointed by him in his word. Much leſs is any particular form of it there delineated, as a ſtanding model for the nations of the world: Nor are any particular perſons, pointed out, as having, in a lineal deſcent, an indefeaſible right to rule over others.</p>
            <p>BUT civil government may be ſaid to be from God, as it is he who qualifies men for, and in his over-ruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, raiſes them to places of authority and rule; for by him <hi>Kings reign:</hi>—As he has given us, in his word, the character of Rulers, and pointed out both <hi>their</hi> duty, and the duty of thoſe under their authority; which ſuppoſes, not only the exiſtence of civil government, but that it is agreeable to his will: And eſpecially and chiefly, as civil government is founded in the very nature of man, as a ſocial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in the nature and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things. It is manifeſtly for the good of ſociety:—It is the dictate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:—It is the voice of reaſon, which may be ſaid to be the voice of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:012256_0012_0F8A6C2352203688"/>
IT being only thus that civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ordinance of God, there is no impropriety in aſſerting likewiſe that it is the <hi>ordinance of man.</hi> For though it is founded in the nature of man, and in the conſtitution of things, which are from God, yet nothing is plainer, than that it proceeds immediately from men. It is not a matter of neceſſity, ſtrictly ſpeaking, but of choice. This is the caſe, as to government in general:—This is moſt evidently the caſe, as to any particular form of government.</p>
            <p>ALL men are naturally in a ſtate of freedom, and have an equal claim to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. No one, by nature, nor by any ſpecial grant from the great Lord of all, has any authority over another. All right therefore in any to rule over others, muſt originate from thoſe they rule over, and be granted by them. Hence, all government, conſiſtent with that natural freedom, to which all have an equal claim, is founded in compact, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the parties;—between Rulers and their Subjects, and can be no

otherwiſe. Becauſe Rulers, receiving their authority originally and ſolely from the people, can be rightfully poſſeſſed of no more, than theſe have conſented to, and conveyed to them.</p>
            <p>AND the fundamental laws, which are the baſis of government, and form the political conſtitution of the ſtate;—which mark out, and fix the chief lines and boundaries between the authority of Rulers, and the liberties and privileges of the people, are, and can be no other, in a free ſtate, than what are mutually agreed upon and conſented to. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever authority therefore the ſupreme power has, to make laws, to appoint officers, &amp;c. for the regulation and government of the ſtate, being an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity derived from the community, and granted by them, can be juſtly exerciſed, only within certain limits, and to a certain extent, according to agreement.</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe otherwiſe, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a delegated power and conſtitutional right, Rulers may make laws, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012256_0014_0F8A6C24D2ADD858"/>
officers for their execution, and force them into effect, i. e. according to their own arbitrary will and pleaſure, is to defeat the great deſign of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and utterly to aboliſh it. It is to make Rulers abſolutely deſpotic, and to ſubject the people to a ſtate of ſlavery; becauſe it will then be in the power of Rulers, by virtue of new laws and regulations, they ſhall pleaſe to make, to ſubvert and annihilate the preſent conſtitution, and to ſtrip the ſubject of every kind of privilege.</p>
            <p>THIS may be briefly evidenced by a ſingle inſtance.</p>
            <p>IT is eſſential to a free ſtate, for without this it cannot be free, that no man ſhall have his property taken from him, but by his own conſent, given by himſelf or by others deputed to act for him. Let it be ſuppoſed then, that Rulers aſſume a power to act contrary to this fundamental principle, what muſt be the conſequence? If by ſuch uſurped authority, they can demand and take a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012256_0015_0F8A6C2599D5F3E0"/>
penny, by the ſame authority they may a pound, and even the whole ſubſtance of the ſubject, ſo as to make him wholly dependent on their pleaſure, having nothing that he can call his own; and what is he then but a perfect ſlave?<note n="*" place="bottom">Men <hi>in ſociety having property,</hi> they have ſuch a right to the goods, which by the law of the community are theirs, that nobody hath a right to take their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or any part of it from them, without their own conſent: Without this they have no property at all; for I have truly no <hi>property</hi> in that, which another can by right take from me when he pleaſes againſt my conſent. Hence it is a miſtake to think, that the ſupreme or legiſlative power of any common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, can do what it will, and diſpoſe of the eſtates of the ſubject arbitrarily, or take any part of them at pleaſure. Lock on civil Government.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIS, at firſt view, is manifeſtly inconſiſtent with all juſt conception of freedom; and is the very eſſence of arbitrary and tyrannical power.</p>
            <p>Now, all Rulers in a ſtate, and all power and authority with which they are veſted;—the very being, and form of government, with all its conſtitutional laws, being thus from the people, hence civil government, is called, and with great propriety, the <hi>ordinance of man,</hi>—an human inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:012256_0016_0F8A6C2651776B98"/>
THIS is the caſe, as to the Britiſh government in particular, under which we have the happineſs to live. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional laws are comprized in <hi>Magna-Charta,</hi> or the great charter of the nation. This contains, in general, the liberties and privileges of the people, and is, <hi>virtually,</hi> a compact between the King and them; the reigning Prince, explicitly engaging, by ſolemn oath, to govern according to theſe laws:—Beyond the extent of theſe then, or contrary to them, he can have no rightful authority at all.</p>
            <p>IF the preceding poſitions, and the reaſonings from them are juſt, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things may be noticed, as dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible therefrom, or cloſely connected therewith,—That it is highly requiſite, for the good of the ſtate, that both Rulers and people be well acquainted with, and keep in mind the conſtitutional laws of government—Rulers, that they may be directed and guided thereby, and not depart from, or counteract the deſign of their inſtitution, to the injury, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012256_0017_0F8A6C27D679DC48"/>
of the people.—And people, that knowing the bounds of ſubmiſſion, and the extent of their privileges, they may be guarded againſt tranſgreſſion, and yield a ready and full obedience.</p>
            <p>EQUALLY requiſite it muſt be likewiſe, for the ſame end, that there be no myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries in the governing plan:—That all laws and rules of government, be as plain as poſſible, and eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to prevent contentious diſputes between Rulers and their ſubjects;—to preclude the former, from tyrannical op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, under colour of lawful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the latter from rebellious diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, under pretence of privilege.</p>
            <p>FOR, it follows from what has been ſaid, that as all diſobedience in ſubjects, to conſtitutional authority, is rebellion againſt government, and merits puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adequate to the crime, ſo all aſſumed power in Rulers, not granted them by the conſtitution, is without juſt authority, and ſo far forth, can claim no ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:012256_0018_0F8A6C2888320D90"/>
"As uſurpation," ſays the great and judicious Mr. LOCKE, "is the exerciſe of power which another hath a right to, ſo Tyranny is the exerciſe of power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond right, which no body can have a right to." And again. "Where-ever law ends, Tyranny begins, if the law be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed to another's harm. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in authority exceeds the power given him by law, and makes uſe of the force, he has under his command, to compaſs that upon the ſubject, which the law allows not, ceaſes in that to be a magiſtrate: And acting without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, may be oppoſed as any other man, who by force invades the right of another."</p>
            <p>AND tho' it may not always be prudent and beſt, to reſiſt ſuch power, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion may be yielded, yet that the people have a right to reſiſt, is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; otherwiſe the abſurd and exploded doctrines of paſſive obedience, and non-reſiſtance, muſt be admitted in their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent, and their conſequences patiently borne. And it muſt be granted finally, that the people as well as their
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012256_0019_0F8A6C2D345EA590"/>
Rulers, are proper judges of the civil conſtitution they are under, and of their own rights and privileges; elſe, how ſhall they know when theſe are invaded;—when ſubmiſſion is due to authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive requiſitions, and when not?</p>
            <p>BUT we are now to conſider</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, THE great deſign of Civil Government, and the end for which Rulers are appointed; and that is the good of the community, or political body.—<hi>Whether it be to the King, as ſupreme; or unto Governors, as unto them who are ſent by him, for the puniſhment of evil-doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>RULERS are not appointed, indeed, for the happineſs of the people, excluſive of their own, as if theſe things were inconnected. But, as it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that ſome ſhould be advanced above their brethren,—be cloathed with authority, and honorably ſupported, meerly for the ſake of their own eaſe,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012256_0020_0F8A6C2F30747AE0"/>
dignity and grandeur, ſo it would be equally unreaſonable, that Rulers ſhould be ſlaves to the people, and watch and labour for their welfare, without ſharing in it.</p>
            <p>BUT the happineſs of Rulers and of their Subjects, are not thus excluſive of each other, but perfectly coincident. They are both parts of the ſame body,—their true intereſts are interwoven, and their happineſs inſeparable. Rulers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting agreeable to their inſtitution, and attending on that very thing, are juſtly entitled to eſteem and reverence, and an honorable ſupport from the people, though theſe are not the things they ought to have chiefly in view.</p>
            <p>THEY are to conſider themſelves as raiſed above their brethren, and inveſted with authority, for more noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous purpoſes;—for the peace and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Community, committed to their care: Hence it is ſaid, of the civil Ruler, <hi>he is the miniſter of God to thee for good.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. XIII. 4.</note>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:012256_0021_0F8A6C2F54835BA8"/>
NOR can any other end be imagined, worthy of reaſonable beings, why men ſhould put themſelves out of a ſtate of natural freedom, and ſubject themſelves to the authority and rule of others, but for their greater good;—for the ſecuring, more effectually, their juſt rights, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and privileges.</p>
            <p>THIS is the great end of their forming into ſociety;—of their eſtabliſhing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain laws, as the general meaſures of right and wrong, and giving power to ſome, to govern the whole community by ſuch laws.</p>
            <p>THIS being the deſign of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, good Rulers are juſtly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as benefactors to the people. They are placed as watchmen and guardians over the ſtate, whoſe ſpecial buſineſs it is, both in their legiſlative and executive capacity, to conſult and promote its wellfare. To curb and reſtrain the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and factious, from acts of fraud, rapine and violence, and to protect others in the peaceable enjoyment of their rights.

To puniſh tranſgreſſors,—to relieve the oppreſſed, diſpenſing, with an equal and impartial hand, juſtice to all.</p>
            <p>FOR, it is neceſſary for the ſupport of government, and that the great and ſalutary ends of it may be anſwered, not only that its laws be juſt, but that they be enforced by proper ſanctions; fitted to affect the human mind, and to engage obedience; and that Rulers have power to execute ſuch laws, in the puniſhment of evil-doers, and for a praiſe,—for the ſupport and encouragement of them that do well.</p>
            <p>FROM this view of our ſubject, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of high importance, to the good of the ſtate, that they who are veſted with power to make laws for the Community, as there ſhall be occaſion, and to appoint officers for their execution, have quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications anſwerable to their high places of power and truſt.—That they be men of ſuperior knowledge and wiſdom;—well acquainted with the civil conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—with the juſt boundaries between
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012256_0023_0F8A6C30CF09C310"/>
the prerogative of Rulers, and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People, that their laws may be duly framed, and adjuſted to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ſyſtem.—Men able critically to examine the complection of the ſtate;—to ſearch out its diſorders, and to apply proper remedies:—Able to judge of the natural courſe and tendency of things, and to foreſee, beyond what is common, the operation, and conſequences of their own acts;—how the rights of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als—how the common good will be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected thereby.</p>
            <p>THEY ſhould be men of great inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and candor;—ready to receive light when offered,—to redreſs grievances, when convinced of them, and to amend, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Pretences to perfect wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge, and inerrability of judgment, in civil, as well as eccleſiaſtical matters, ill become the higheſt mortal; and are likely to produce unhappy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, when found in Rulers, eſpecially if accompanied with an obſtinate adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their own meaſures.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:012256_0024_0F8A6C318EEE72E0"/>
THEY ſhould be men of great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benevolence of heart, who will naturally care for the welfare of their brethren, and treat them with conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention and kindneſs. Such a behaviour, corrected and managed by prudence, is perfectly conſiſtent with their maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dignity of their character, and will greatly endear them to the people.

            </p>
            <p>Again, RULERS ſhould be men free from a ſordid covetous temper, which has ſelf-intereſt like the pole ſtar ever in view, and endeavours to ſteer all things by that direction. As they are deſigned to act for the public good, they ſhould be men of liberal and generous ſouls;—ready to prefer the common ſafety and happineſs, to their own private emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:012256_0025_0F8A6C3254BD47C8"/>
THEY ſhould be likewiſe men of great reſolution and firmneſs of mind;—not eaſily diſmayed and overcome by diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, or intimidated by threatened dangers:—Able to maintain a calmneſs of mind, and to guide with a ſteady hand, in tempeſtuous ſeaſons:—Able to bear with the unpoliſhed plainneſs of ſome honeſt men, and with the weakneſſes and follies of others:—Not apt, in a pet, to deſert the common cauſe, and to ſacrifice the public happineſs to their own paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reſentments.</p>
            <p>And, finally. IT muſt be of great importance, to the good order and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the ſtate, that Rulers be men of diſtinguiſhed piety and virtue, who will be likely to rule by example as well as law. It was an act of prudence, as well as piety in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>—his appointing one to a place of high truſt in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note n="‡" place="bottom">Nehem. VII. 2.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</hi> A firm belief of Revelation:—A ſtrong impreſſive ſenſe of the divine and everlaſting things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Goſpel,—this will ſecure
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012256_0026_0F8A6C33208EF218"/>
the good conduct of Rulers, eſpecially when under temptation to do wrong, above every thing elſe. True religion inlarges, and ſtrengthens the mind,—fixes deep in the heart, the principles of right action, and gives ſteadineſs and uniformity of behaviour.</p>
            <p>MEN of this character will act with fidelity and zeal in the ſervice of the public, conſidering themſelves as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God, as well as to men. They look beyond the preſent ſtate of things, and view their conduct as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with futurities of a moſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature; and will aim at approving themſelves, not only to the people, but to their own minds, and to God the Judge of all.</p>
            <p>SUCH Rulers will beſt anſwer the great ends of their inſtitution. They will be to the people, as the directing,—as the chearing and comforting light of the Sun.—As the refreſhing rain,—as the firm, unſhaken pillars of the ſtate,—the ſhield of its defence and ſafety, and the ſource
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012256_0027_0F8A6C33CA3CD598"/>
of conſtant bleſſings. Nor can they fail of engaging the eſteem and love, and ſubmiſſion of the people.</p>
            <p>WE may now in the THIRD place, conſider that ſubmiſſion which is due to government; and take ſome particular notice of the nature and extent of it. <hi>Submit yourſelves to every ordinance of man, whether it be to the King as ſupreme, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Governors,</hi> &amp;c. Similar to which is that of St. Paul, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers.—Put them in mind to be ſubject to principalities and powers, to obey magiſtrates,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THE duties of Rulers and Subjects are reciprocal, and mutually imply each other. If ſome are to govern, others are to ſubmit to their government, and to be obedient to their authority; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Rulers are but an empty name;—the conſtitution is diſſolved, and anarchy enſues.</p>
            <p>NOR is this ſubmiſſion due only to the Supreme Ruler, but to all in lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012256_0028_0F8A6C34944EE9E0"/>
under him, down to the loweſt officer in the ſtate. Not only to the King, but to thoſe who are ſent by him, to carry on the various parts of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. Diſobedience to inferior of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, while acting by lawful authority, is diſobedience to the higheſt power, as it is by authority derived from thence, that all in ſubordinate places of civil truſt, execute their offices. Submiſſion is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe due to all conſtitutional laws, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſuit the preſent intereſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, or not. A man is not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey a juſt law, calculated for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, becauſe, in certain circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it operates againſt his private intereſt.</p>
            <p>UNLIMITED ſubmiſſion, however, is not due to government, in a free ſtate. There are certain boundaries, beyond which, ſubmiſſion cannot be juſtly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor is therefore due. Theſe limits are marked out, and fixt, by the known, eſtabliſhed, and fundamental laws of the ſtate. Theſe laws being conſented to by the governing power, confine, as well as direct its operation and influence, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012256_0029_0F8A6C35B02BF090"/>
are the connecting band between autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and obedience.</p>
            <p>AND no wiſe and juſt Ruler, we may ſuppoſe, would aim at wantonly leaping over theſe bounds, and acting beyond them, as this would be, not only acting without lawful authority, and injuriouſly robbing the people of their rights, but would tend to create unhappy jealouſies, and to ſtir up broils and contentions in the ſtate, which might give him much uneaſineſs, if no worſe conſequences ſhould follow.</p>
            <p>IT was a fine expreſſion of a Spartan Ruler, and indicated the freedom and happineſs of the ſtate, who, upon being aſked, "who governed at <hi>Sparta?</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the laws, and the magiſtrates <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi> to theſe laws." The conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal laws of the ſtate, are, properly, the ſupreme power, being obligatory on the whole community,—on the higheſt officer, as well as the loweſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:012256_0030_0F8A6C363597C9A0"/>
HERE then, we have the juſt meaſure and extent of ſubmiſſion. It is due to all decrees and requiſitions of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are conſiſtent with the known, and fundamental laws of the ſtate, by which fundamental laws, the very law-making power itſelf is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and beyond which it cannot paſs.</p>
            <p>AND it ſeems immaterial, as to the preſent point, whether ſuch authority in Rulers, and ſubmiſſion in ſubjects, reſult directly and wholly from the original conſtitution and frame of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or from ſubſequent compacts between them, mutually agreed to.</p>
            <p>ALL ſuch compacts, whether under the name of charter-grants, or however denominated, muſt be ſuppoſed agreeable to the fundamental laws of the ſtate, and grounded thereon. i. e. Such as the ruling power has authority to make, or enter into, and the people freely accept of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:012256_0031_0F8A6C3A21C9F6A0"/>
UPON ſuch agreement, a particular kind of government, in ſome reſpects new, may take place; but, ſo far as it is new, or variant from the original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, this ſubſequent agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Rulers and people, ought to be the invariable meaſure of adminiſtration.—This bounds the authority of Rulers, and the ſubmiſſion of ſubjects.—The people, while they owe obedience, have an undoubted right to their granted, or ſtipulated privileges; and may juſtly claim, and inſiſt upon them, unleſs, by miſconduct, they are forfeited.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole therefore. Proper ſubmiſſion, in a free ſtate, is a medium, between ſlaviſh ſubjection to arbitrary claims of Rulers, on one hand, and a lawleſs licence, on the other. It is obedience in ſubjects to all orders of government, which are conſiſtent with their conſtitutional rights and privileges. So much ſubmiſſion is due, and to be readily yielded by every ſubject; and beyond this, it cannot be juſtly deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe Rulers and People are
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012256_0032_0F8A6C3A8BC72300"/>
equally bound, by the fundamental laws of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>THE ſtate of the world, and temper of mankind, may render theſe obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neceſſary and highly important;—important and neceſſary as a check upon Rulers of a deſpotic turn; and a reſtraint upon the licentious among the people; that neither, by breaking over their juſt bounds, may diſturb the peace, and injure the happineſs of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>FOR there have been Rulers, and may be ſuch again, who look with wiſhful eyes on the liberties and privileges of the people. Who conſider them as a prey, worthy to be ſeized, for the gratification of their pride and ambition,—of their cruelty or covetouſneſs Such, under one pretence or other, will be ſtretching and enlarging their power, and graſping at more and more, 'till, if not obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, civil government will be converted into abſolute tyranny, and a free people into ſlaves.</p>
            <p>A PEOPLE in love with liberty, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012256_0033_0F8A6C3E5FC39B68"/>
ſenſible of their right to it, cannot but be jealous of ſuch Rulers; and ought to be on their guard againſt unjuſtifiable and arbitrary claims. Tamely to ſubmit, would be highly unworthy of them as free men, and ſhew they deſerved the yoke, under which they ſo readily put their necks.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand. There are found among the people, perſons of a querulous and factious diſpoſition.—Ever reſtleſs and uneaſy, and prepared to raiſe and promote popular tumults. From the meer love of wrangling, or from ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious views,—to riſe from obſcurity, to public notice, and to an important figure, they find fault with Rulers, and point out defects in the adminiſtration.—Small miſtakes are magnified.—Evil deſigns are ſuggeſted, which, perhaps never exiſted, but in their own heads. They cry up liberty, and make a mighty ſtir to ſave the ſinking ſtate, when in no danger, but from themſelves, and others of a like caſt.</p>
            <p>THERE are ambitious and deſigning men, in the ſtate, as well as in the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012256_0034_0F8A6C3F3580CAE8"/>
church; and there are fit tools to ſerve the purpoſes of both. As ſome make hereticks in the church, and raiſe an eccleſiaſtic poſſe to demoliſh them, chiefly with a view to render themſelves diſtinguiſhed, as ſound in the faith; ſo others make traitors in the ſtate, and raiſe the popular cry againſt them, to gain to themſelves the name of Patriots.</p>
            <p>THE wiſe and prudent will make a pauſe, before they inliſt under ſuch poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical zealots. They will judge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the faulted conduct of their Rulers. They will make reaſonable allowances for human frailties, and be as ready to yield ſubmiſion where it is due, as to defend their liberties where they are in danger.</p>
            <p>WE proceed now in the LAST place.—To take notice of the principles from which ſubmiſſion and obedience to government ſhould flow. And theſe are, a ſenſe of our duty to God, as well as to civil Authority, connected with, and animated by a ſenſe of liberty.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012256_0035_0F8A6C3FD2D79BC0"/>
               <hi>Submit yourſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake.—As free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TRUE religion:—A ſacred reverence of the Deity:—The love of virtue and goodneſs, are as neceſſary to make good ſubjects, as good Rulers: And a ſpirit of liberty is requiſite, to render obedience true and genuine both to God and man.</p>
            <p>EVEN the ſupreme Ruler of the world, is not a deſpotic, arbitrary Monarch, nor does he require obedience by meer au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. His ſacred laws,—all framed agreeable to the perfect rectitude of his nature, and reſulting from his infinite goodneſs, and righteouſneſs, are wiſely adapted to the human ſyſtem, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for its good.</p>
            <p>THEY recommend themſelves to the reaſon of our own minds, and manifeſtly tend to our happineſs:—We ſee our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as well as our duty in them, and that theſe are cloſely connected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:012256_0036_0F8A6C408F1659B8"/>
AGREEABLE to the nature and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of theſe divine mandates, the obedience God requires of us, is not that of ſlaves, to a tyrannical maſter, but that of children, to a wiſe and benevolent father. It muſt be <hi>free,</hi>—a matter of choice, and not of force, driving us on againſt a reluctant mind.</p>
            <p>LIKE to this, is the obedience we owe to civil government. Suppoſing its laws founded, as they ought to be, in reaſon and equity, and calculated for the good of ſociety, they demand our approbation. And being under their authority, as members of the political body, both duty and intereſt require our ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>BUT as all earthly Rulers, as well as all human inſtitutions, may be ſuppoſed to be imperfect; and ſubmiſſion may be required, inconſiſtent with our juſt rights and privileges, there is a liberty, of a ſomewhat different nature, reſpecting civil government, we have a claim to, and which ſhould have influence on our conduct, i. e. a liberty to with-hold, as well as to yield ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:012256_0037_0F8A6C416B64FA70"/>
FOR, even a chriſtian people, who, from their character, as ſervants of God, are bound to ſubmit to the higher powers, and to obey Magiſtrates, are not, out of courtly complaiſance to their Rulers, or from a mean, timorous, and ſlaviſh temper, to reſign up their juſt rights, when imperiouſly demanded, or craftily ſought after. Remembering they are freemen and not ſlaves, they ſhould act as <hi>free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY have an undoubted privilege to complain of unconſtitutional meaſures in government, and of unlawful incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon their rights; and may, while they do it with becoming decency, do it with that noble freedom and firmneſs, which a ſenſe of wrong, joined with the love of liberty, will inſpire.</p>
            <p>EVEN under great and manifeſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, a prudent regard to their own, and the public ſafety, may forbid, indeed, violent means of reſiſtance; but ſhould never lead them, tamely to yield to unlawful claims.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:012256_0038_0F8A6C4212C04EE8"/>
CHALLENGING their right, and pleading for it, tho' this ſhould not prevail to the immediate redreſs of grievances, yet may be of high impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to keep alive,—to cheriſh and ſtrengthen,—not a ſpirit of faction and diſcontent, but that ſpirit of liberty, which is, as it were, the <hi>animating ſoul</hi> of a free ſtate;—which being once gone, every thing valuable will become an eaſy prey, and a ſtate of abject ſlavery enſue, to live in which, may be far worſe, than to be <hi>free</hi> among the dead.</p>
            <p>BUT ſtill, on the other hand:—While a people conſider themſelves as <hi>free,</hi> and are zealous to maintain their liberty, they ſhould remember alſo their ſubjection to civil authority, and to God, the righteous Judge of all; and be careful not to carry liberty beyond its juſt bounds:—Not to uſe it for a cloke of maliciouſneſs:—Not, under colour and pretence of this, to refuſe juſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;—to be diſorderly, factious and tumultuous. As the ſervants of God, and accountable to him, they ſhould render unto all their dues, and ſeek,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012256_0039_0F8A6C42C91B0630"/>
not only their own, but the welfare and happineſs of all.</p>
            <p>WOULD people, in general, poſſeſs their minds of ſuch ſentiments, and act under their direction and influence, how much would this tend to the peace and happineſs of ſociety! Many groundleſs and unreaſonable complaints, from reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ambitious, or from ignorant and peeviſh men, would be diſcountenanced and ſuppreſſed, and the community, by a general ſteady courſe of well-doing, would, agreeable to the will of God, put to ſilence the ignorance of ſuch fooliſh men.</p>
            <p>AND in caſe of real and grievous oppreſſion from unrighteous Rulers, ſuch principles as theſe, would be likely to produce the moſt happy effects. They would unite the members of ſociety, as one body.—They would guard them againſt raſh and unlawful meaſures of defence;—lead them to ſuch as are prudent and juſtifiable; and engage them to act with that determined reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and firmneſs, reſulting from reaſon
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012256_0040_0F8A6C43CE20BEB8"/>
and virtue, which is moſt likely to hold out, and to prevail, in time, over every ſpecies of injuſtice and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>AND would both Rulers and Subjects imbibe ſuch ſentiments, and, under their direction and influence, diſcharge with fidelity the duties of their reſpective pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, what a proſperous and flouriſhing condition might they hope for!</p>
            <p>THE ſprings of government, acting with vigor, and under a right direction; and the members of ſociety, yielding a correſpondent and uniform ſubmiſſion, a general harmony and happineſs muſt enſue.</p>
            <p>THE political ſtate would be like a body in full health. The conſtitutional laws, preſerved inviolate, would, like ſtrong bones and ſinews, ſupport and ſteady the regular frame. Supreme and ſubordinate Rulers duly performing their proper functions, would be like the greater and leſſer arteries, keeping up their proper tone and vibrations; and juſtice, fidelity, and every ſocial virtue,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012256_0041_0F8A6C45D8EB6118"/>
would, like the vital fluid, run without obſtruction, and reach, refreſh, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate the moſt minute and diſtant parts: While the multitude of ſubjects, yielding, in their various places and relations, a ready and chearful obedience, would, like the numerous, yet connected veins, convey back again the recurrent blood, to the great fountain of it, and the whole frame be vigorous, eaſy, and happy.</p>
            <p>UPON that view of Civil Government we have now been taking; and while feeling in our own breaſts a warm ſenſe of liberty, and the bleſſings of it, can we help dropping a tear over the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of our fellow creatures, who are groaning under the iron yoke of tyranny and oppreſſion—ſubjected to the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary will of their imperious and deſpotic Lords,—and to all the wretchedneſs, which lawleſs pride and ambition;—which wanton cruelty and unbridled luſt can inflict upon them?</p>
            <p>How much to be pitied are ſuch miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable objects!—How ardently is it to be
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012256_0042_0F8A6C46ECD0E680"/>
wiſhed, that the principles of civil liberty may prevail through the earth, to the breaking in pieces the power of oppreſſors every where, and the reſtoring the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to freedom and happineſs!</p>
            <p>FROM ſuch ſcenes of human wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and woe, we naturally reflect, with gratitude to heaven, on our own happy condition, as ſubjects of the Britiſh Empire:—A conſtitution founded in the law of God, and of nature;—on the principles of reaſon and equity:—A form of government admirably contrived for the due ſupport of authority, and the ſecurity of the rights and privileges of the people.</p>
            <p>MAY this excellent conſtitution, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſhed by the experience and wiſdom of ages, be preſerved inviolate, the ſource of bleſſings to this and future generations: And his preſent Majeſty, our moſt gracious Sovereign (whom may God long preſerve) ever eſteem it his glory, and find it his happineſs, to reign over a free and loyal people.</p>
            <p>

THE form of Government, in this Province, is ſimilar to that of our mother country, ſo far as the circumſtances, of a dependent ſtate will admit;—the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power being lodged in the hands of the King's Repreſentative,—of his Majeſty's Council, and,—of perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the people, to act for them, in General Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>OUR Commander in chief, who is at the head of this legiſlative body, is not indeed, elected by ourſelves, but appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Crown; which, perhaps, all things conſidered, is not to our diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.

            <p>DEEPLY penetrated, as I am, with a ſenſe of Liberty, and ardently in love with it; and tenderly concerned for the proſperity and happineſs of my native land, I abhor a licentious and factious ſpirit;—I deteſt the baneful principle.</p>
            <p>I HEARTILY wiſh the univerſal peace of ſocieties, on the foundation of reaſon and righteouſneſs. I wiſh, in particular, that all diſtruſtful jealouſies, with the grounds of them, between Great-Britain and theſe Colonies were removed.—That all unhappy diſputes between them, were equitably and amicably ſettled.—That their former confidence in each other was fully reſtored.—I wiſh their connection with each other may be perpetual, and their happineſs mutual.</p>
            <p>BUT certainly, SIRS, it is not neceſſary in order hereto, that if our conſtitutional rights and privileges ſhould be demanded,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012256_0057_0F8A6C5D66681B88"/>
we ſhould readily yield to the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous claim.</p>
            <p>SHOULD we thus meanly reſign them up, and take, in exchange, the chains of ſlavery for ourſelves and children,—could we forgive ourſelves? Would our unhappy poſterity forgive us? Should we not deſerve the puniſhment, while we felt the guilt of aſſaſſins, for having <hi>ſtabbed</hi> the vitals of our country?</p>
            <p>THE interior ſtate of the Province, Honored Gentlemen,—the common proſperity and happineſs of the people, are things that will lie near your hearts, and be cared for by you at all times. Their true welfare you will have in view, and endeavour to promote it, in framing any new laws, which the exigencies of the ſtate may require; and concerting any farther meaſures that may be needful, for the ſuppreſſion of vice and wickedneſs; and for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and promotion of Religion, in the knowledge and practice of piety and virtue:—For baniſhing idleneſs and luxury;—for encouraging labour, induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012256_0058_0F8A6C5DE07BA898"/>
and frugality;—for the better cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating and improving our lands:—promoting manufactures, and trade; and for the general procurement of thoſe things, which tend to make a people happy in themſelves, and to eſtabliſh and confirm their freedom.</p>
            <p>AND of high importance it is to the good of the ſtate, and worthy of your particular care, that the good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome laws now in being, as well as others that may be enacted, have their full force and efficacy, according to the ſpirit and intention of them.—That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be maintained in all the juſt extent of it, as a neceſſary reſtraint on the lawleſs and diſobedient, and a protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defence to others. Without this we cannot continue a <hi>free,</hi> nor be a proſperous and happy people. If our liberties are not wreſted from us, in any other way, we ſhall ſoon deſtroy them ourſelves, and prove <hi>tyrants</hi> and <hi>oppreſſors</hi> to one another.</p>
            <p>THIS matter, I conceive, claims the attention, and is humbly offered to the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012256_0059_0F8A6C5E8A5BE2D0"/>
conſideration, of the Honorable the Judges of our courts,—of his Majeſty's Juſtices of the peace; and of all to whom the execution of the laws is committed:—of all perſons likewiſe, who are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appointed as inſpectors of the morals of the people; whoſe buſineſs it is to make preſentments of diſorderly practices, tending to the diſhonor of God, and to the diſquietude and hurt of ſociety.</p>
            <p>IT is of great conſequence to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic weal, that gentlemen in ſuch ſtations, faithfully diſcharge the duties of their reſpective places, and that the laws have their free courſe, and proper operation. And it is certainly the duty of the people readily to ſubmit to Government, in all the juſt extent and exerciſe of it; and under its due adminiſtration, to lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</p>
            <p>CIVIL government, my hearers, is one of the greateſt outward bleſſings of which we are poſſeſſed. It is our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from fraud and injuſtice—from rapine and violence. It is the ſecurity of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012256_0060_0F8A6C5F4C062000"/>
our lives,—of our properties, and of every thing that is dear to us in the world. It becomes us therefore, not only to ſubmit to it ourſelves, but to do all we can to maintain and ſupport it.</p>
            <p>WHILE we are zealous for liberty then, let us take care we do not deſpiſe government, and weaken the ſprings of it, by running into licenciouſneſs, of which ſome ſeem not to be out of danger in the preſent day.</p>
            <p>LET us, my Fathers and Brethren,—let us act as <hi>free:</hi>—Let us ſtand up for our juſt rights; but conſider ourſelves, at the ſame time, as ſervants of God; and ſubmit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake. Let us never uſe our liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs;—never imagine, that under pretence of this, we can have a right to do wrong.</p>
            <p>LET us, upon all occaſions, diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and endeavour to baniſh from among us, ſuch licencious principles; and by well-doing, put to ſilence the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of fooliſh men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:012256_0061_0F8A6C601ED203C0"/>
To CONCLUDE. MAY this whole Aſſembly:—May the people of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in general, both Rulers and others, be concerned that they act a proper part, in the ſtations aſſigned them by Divine Providence; faithfully diſcharging the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their reſpective places. While fond of freedom, from the tyrannous and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive power of man, let us all ſee to it that we are free from a much more diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and deſtructive tyranny,—that of our own luſts, and of Satan, that great enemy to our higheſt and beſt intereſts. While we glory in the name of <hi>freemen,</hi> let us ſee to it that we are the <hi>Lord's Servants;</hi> and live in a willing and hearty ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his ſacred laws and government.</p>
            <p>THEN may we expect the ſmiles of that Almighty Being, whoſe favor is life. <hi>Then</hi> may we expect that, in his gracious and over-ruling Providence, he will ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the dark clouds that hang over us, and make us yet a proſperous and happy people.—<hi>Then</hi> may we indulge the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, chearing hope, not only of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good days here, but of obtaining, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, eternal peace and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.</p>
            <p>

FOR, in a ſhort time, we ſhall all finiſh our courſe in this world. In a few days,—a very few, we ſhall be called off this ſtage of action.—Our relation to civil ſociety will ſoon ceaſe.—Our connection with one another, and with this world, will be diſſolved.—Preſently we ſhall all, however diſtinguiſhed in this life, ſtand upon a level before our common Judge, to receive our final ſentence and reward.</p>
            <p>O! HOW happy for us, if having main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained our integrity, and conducted well thro' this tempting, and enſnaring world, we then receive that ſupporting,—that life-giving ſentence,—<hi>well done, good and faithful ſervants!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH what unutterable joy ſhall we be filled;—with a joy inexpreſſibly grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,—more noble, and excellent, than can ariſe from the greateſt honors and riches of this world, if then we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, with all the virtuous and good, into the full and glorious <hi>liberty</hi> of the Sons of God!</p>
            <p>WHICH may God, of his infinite mercy, grant, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
