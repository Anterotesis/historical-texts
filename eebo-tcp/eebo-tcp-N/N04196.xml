            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>In this Chapter we have a divine Song which <hi>Moſes</hi> by the Help of God's Spirit compoſed for the Uſe and Benefit of the People of God who were then upon the Stage, and thoſe that ſhould ariſe after them; wherein he ſetteth forth the Mercy of God to allure them, and his Vengeance to awaken them to obey all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. <hi>to</hi> 45.</p>
            <p>And having made an End of ſpeaking all the Words of this Song, (and almoſt all he had to ſay unto them in the Name of the Lord, for the Time of his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was now at Hand.) He in <hi>Ver.</hi> 46. exhorted them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſet their Hearts unto all the Words which he had teſtified among them. He had ſhown them the Way of the Lord; the Religion they ſhould chooſe, profeſs, practice and propagate in the World; and he would have them ſet their Hearts to it. <hi>Set your Hearts unto all the Words which I teſtify among you this Day.</hi> Let theſe Words reach and affect your Hearts, and engage them to the Duties of Religion, ſo that you may cheerfully and faithfully perform them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To teach their Children the Religion he had taught them, and to charge them to obſerve it. <hi>Ye</hi>

               <hi>ſhall teach your Children to obſerve to do all the Words of this Law,</hi> 'Twas not enough that they were reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious themſelves, but they ſhould do what they could to make their Children ſo; that thereby Religion might be handed down to the lateſt Poſterity.</p>
            <p>And in this Verſe of which my Text is a Part, he laboured to faſten theſe Words of Exhortation upon the People, with ſuch Arguments as theſe; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That which he had exhorted them unto was not a vain Thing for them to obſerve; <hi>For it is not a vain Thing for you.</hi> They might be ready to think (as ſome do now) that Religion is a vain Thing; that there is no Profit in it, and that they might proſper without it, as well as other Nations; but he would have them know and conſider that it was no unprofitable Buſineſs, but of great Importance, and worthy of their moſt ſerious Care and Concern. For,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was their Life; <hi>becauſe it is your Life,</hi> i.e. it is as neceſſary as your Life; as precious and profitable, and rather to be choſen than your Life. <q>O that Men were fully poſſeſſed of this, that Religion is their Life, even the Life of their Souls!</q>

            <p>Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> the Man of God laboured to excite and ſtir up the People of God to ſtudy the Principles and perform the Duties of the holy Religion he had taught them, and to put their Children upon theſe Things.</p>

From the Words I ſhall obſerve to you, this</p>

            <p>In ſpeaking to this I ſhall endeavour,
<list>
                  <item>(1) To ſhew you what Religion is in general.</item>
                  <item>(2) What that Religion is, which is the Life of God's People. And,</item>
                  <item>(3) Why it is called their Life.</item>

            </p>
            <p>I. I am to ſhow, <hi>What Religion is in general;</hi> or what we are to underſtand by it.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall ſay,</p>
            <p>The Word <hi>Religion</hi> is derived from the Latin Word <hi>Religo,</hi> which ſignifieth to faſten or bind hard, and it is uſed for that Profeſſion of Piety which a Man binds himſelf to obſerve, in the Practice of which he hopeth and expecteth to be ſaved. Salvation is that which all Men hope for who have any Senſe of a future State of Weal and Wo; of Happineſs and Miſery; and every Man hopeth to be ſaved in the Religion he profeſſeth. And therefore when a Man hath drank in any Religion, let it be never ſo falſe and vain, he is hardly brought off from it. Thus it was with the <hi>Athenians</hi> when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preach'd Chriſt and the Reſurrection unto them. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>Ver.</hi> 16, 17, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>II. I am to ſhew; <hi>What that Religion is, which is the Life of God's People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I ſhall ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not every Religion that is profeſſed in the World, in the Practice of which Men hope to be ſaved. And therefore mind; it is not the Religion of the <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> Nations; nor the Religion of the <hi>Mahomitans;</hi> neither is it the Religion of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not the Religion of the Heathen or Pagan Nations</hi> Their Religion, (as the Rev. Dr. <hi>Beveridge</hi> obſerves,

               <hi>It is not the Religion which the Jews now profeſs.</hi> They were once the only Covenant People of God, and their Religion was the only true Religion in the World: The Principles of it are contained in the Book of the Law, called the old Teſtament; to which our Goſpel is annexed. And this Book they ſay, (and we concur with them in it) was written by holy Men of God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore is not of human Invention, but of divine Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>But in as much as they rejected the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> (our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt) who was propheſied of, and promiſed to them in the Book of the Law, and who came to them according to Promiſe, and offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them to be their Saviour &amp; Redeemer, and would not accept of him, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 11.) but by wicked Hands crucified and ſlew him; (<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23.) They are now broken off from God's Covenant, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20.) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from being a People &amp; Kingdom by themſelves, (tho' they were once a Nation and Kingdom of great Renown in the World) and are become a Proverb of Reproach, and a By-Word among all Nations whither they are driven; and their Religion is now become vain, and will not ſave them.</p>
            <p>So that it is not every Religion which is profeſſed in the World, in the Practice of which ſome hope to be ſaved, that is the Life of the People of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall ſay;—</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the true <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and that only which is the Life of God's People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005173_0010_1016CFCA5AA56558"/>
I ſay, <hi>the true Chriſtian Religion,</hi> becauſe all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that goeth under the Name of Chriſtian is not true; and all that call themſelves Chriſtians don't pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the true Chriſtian Religion. Many groſs Errors and Hereſies, and pernicious Principles and Opinions are broached &amp; taught by Men who call themſelves Chriſtians. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> abounds with ſuch; and among Proteſtants there are too many; therefore I ſay, <hi>it is the true Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and no other, which is the Life of God's People. The true Chriſtian Religion hath the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for it's Author and Object; and therefore derives it's Name from him, and it is contained in the Scriptures of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, called the holy Bible; wherein we are ſhewn who Jeſus Chriſt is, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>that he is the eternal and only begotten Son of God; the Brightneſs of his Father's Glory; and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, and only Saviour of the World:</hi> And wherein, we have the Hiſtory <hi>of his Birth and Education; of his Doctrine and Miracles; of his Sufferings and Death; of his Reſurrection from the Dead, and Aſcention into Heaven;</hi> where he ever liveth to make Interceſſion with God the Father on the Behalf of them that come unto God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
            <p>This Religion is the only ſafe Religion; and that in the Practice of which Salvation is to be hoped for upon good and ſufficient Grounds; and it hath comparatively but few Vouchers; <hi>i. e.</hi> but few that profeſs it, and ſtand firmly by it.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Religion, if we conſider it, in its largeſt Latitude, (for that which is true, and that which is falſe) ſpreads over but a ſmall Part of the <hi>Globe.</hi> 
               <q>Some that have divided the inhabited World into thirty Parts, have found but five of the thirty to go under the Name of Chriſtian.</q> And if all that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, but yet don't profeſs the true Chriſtian Religion, were ſet by themſelves, how few would be left?</p>
            <p>And having ſaid that the true Chriſtian Religion is the only Religion which is the Life of God's People;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005173_0011_1016CFCBE9C82EA8"/>
it may ſeem proper that I give you ſome diſtinguiſhing Marks and Characters of this Religion, (tho' all that might be ſaid of it can't be now expected) whereby it may be diſcerned and known from that Religion which is not true Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall ſay—</p>
            <p n="1">1. The true Chriſtian Religion teacheth us to own and acknowledge, the one only living and true God, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to be the Object of religious Worſhip, and no other. Not <hi>Baal,</hi> not an Idol, nor any graven Image. As God ſaid to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael (his ancient Covenant People) ſo he ſaith to us, Exod. 20. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me. Thou ſhalt not make unto thee any graven Image, or any Likeneſs of any Thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Waters under the Earth: Thou ſhalt not bow down thy ſelf to them, nor ſerve them, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Heathen, whoſe Religion is falſe and vain, have many vain Objects of religious Worſhip; their <hi>Idols are Silver &amp; Gold, the Works of Mens Hands,</hi> Pſal. 135. 15. But the true Chriſtian Religion hath no other Object of religious Worſhip than the one only living and true God; who is one in Eſſence, and three in Relations; the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 28. 19.</p>
            <p>And as the true Chriſtian Religion hath the one only living and true God for the Object of religious Worſhip, and no other, ſo it teacheth Men to turn from their Idols which are Vanities, unto the living God, who made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and the Sea, and all Things that are therein, (<hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 15.) and to worſhip him, and him only with religious Worſhip, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>When the Devil impudently tempted our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to deny the God that is above, and to fall down and worſhip him, he rejected the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the greateſt Abhorrence and Deteſtation, ſaying as in Mat. 4. 10. <hi>Get thee hence Satan, for it is written,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:005173_0012_1016CFCDDFD6DD18"/>
               <hi>thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve:</hi> i. e. in a religious Manner, and with religious Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The true Chriſtian Religion teacheth us to make the holy Word of God our Rule and Standard in all religious Affairs, and nothing elſe. Not the Laws of <hi>Heathens,</hi> not the Laws of <hi>Mahometans,</hi> nor the Laws of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Men. And every true Chriſtian will look upon himſelf to be bound by it, for therein (and in no other Book) we are ſhewn what is Good, and what it is that God requires of us; how he is to be feared, loved, and ſerved by us; and all that we ſhould know, believe, and do; that we may enjoy his Favour here, and be happy with him forever, is therein recorded and revealed to us, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16.</p>
            <p>There we are told that we muſt repent of our Sins, and believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and do good Works,<note n="i" place="bottom">Acts 17. 30. 1 Joh. 3. 23.</note> and that if we do theſe Things we ſhall be ſaved; but if we neglect them, we ſhall be damned.<note n="o" place="bottom">Luk. 13. 3. Mar. 16. 16. and Rom. 2. 7, 8.</note> We ſhould therefore ſearch the Scriptures, and adhere to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 34. 16.</p>
            <p>When our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſent forth his Diſciples to ſpread and propagate the true Chriſtian Religion, he did not leave them to their Liberty to teach what they would, and to give what Laws they pleaſed to the Church, but he charged them to teach the People to obſerve all thoſe Things which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, and nothing elſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>And when they ſubſtituted others in their Room, they charged them to keep to the Word, to preach that and nothing elſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. For when Men turn from that they run wild in Religion, and bring Diſorder and Confuſion into the Church.</p>
            <p>The Word of God is pure and perfect, true and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous altogether, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7, 8, 9. It is holy, juſt, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005173_0013_1016CFD1DED2ABB8"/>
good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. and therefore the more ſure Word of Prophecy, whereunto every one ſhould take heed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. It is more ſure than any Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Viſion or Revelation, that any may pretend to; and if this be laid aſide, we have no certain Rule for Religion, and muſt needs walk in Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Men are mutable and fallable, ſubject to Change and to err: they are of one Mind to Day and another to-Morrow; and if Religion were to be under their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it would be as mutable and fallable as they, and change as they do; and there would be no certainty in it: therefore they are not fit to make Rules for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Under the Diſpenſation of the Law many wicked Kings overthrew the true and pure Religion of God, and ſubſtituted a falſe Religion in the room of it. And the Scribes and Phariſees tranſgreſſed the Commandments of God by their own Traditions, on which Account our Saviour found Fault with them, and told them that their Worſhip was vain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 3, 6, 9. And ſince the Promulgation of the Goſpel, the true Chriſtian Religion hath been overthrown in many Places by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Men, and a falſe Religion ſubſtituted in the Place of it; and it will be always ſo if the Word of God be laid aſide.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The true Chriſtian Religion teacheth us to have reſpect to all God's Commandments and Ordinances; and will not allow us to be partial in the Law, nor to turn aſide to the right Hand or to the left. Deut. 5. 32. 33. <hi>Ye ſhall obſerve to do as the Lord your God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you; you ſhall not turn aſide to the right Hand or to the left. You ſhall walk in all the Ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The true Chriſtian Religion teacheth us to have a ſpecial and ſingular Regard to the Glory of God in all our religious Duties &amp; moral Actions. True Chriſtians are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. and will be zealous of them. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2 14. and as they have
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005173_0014_1016CFD5E91BBA38"/>
Opportunity and Ability perform them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9, 10. Not with any ſinful View that they may have Praiſe of Men, but principally and chiefly, and above all Things, that God may be glorified by them, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The true Chriſtian Religion teacheth us to make our humble &amp; fervent Addreſſes to the God &amp; Father of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, for the beſtowment of his Holy Spirit upon us; (which he hath graciouſly promiſed, and for which he will be inquired of by us, to beſtow it on us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27, &amp; 37.) whereby we may be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of our ſpiritual Death, regenerated and ſanctified, and made fit to be Partakers of that Inheritance of the Saints in Light: and without which all our Pretences to the true Chriſtian Religion will prove empty &amp; vain. For if any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The true Chriſtian Religion teacheth us not to rely on any Works of Righteouſneſs and Piety which we do, for the Juſtification of our Perſons before God, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Souls; but to acknowledge when we have done all thoſe Things which are required of us, that we are unprofitable Servants, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 10. That our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes are as filthy Rags, &amp; that we are as an unclean Thing before God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64. 6. And by Faith to rely humbly and intirely on the Righteouſneſs and Merits of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, (who is the Lord our Righteouſneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6.) for the Pardon of our Sins, and Salvation of our Souls, <hi>Tit.</hi>3. 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>And having hinted to you theſe diſtinguiſhing Marks of the true Chriſtian Religion; I ſhall now paſs to the third and laſt Thing which I propoſed under the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>III. I am to ſhew you; <hi>Why Religion,</hi> i. e. <hi>the true Chriſtian Religion, is called the Life of God's People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I ſhall ſay; (1) Becauſe it is their temporal Life: (2) Their political Life: (3) Their ſpiritual Life: And (4) The Way to their Enjoyment of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life in the World to come.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005173_0015_1016CFD8A61BF370"/>
1. The true Chriſtian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <hi>becauſe it is their temporal Life;</hi> that is, the Way and Means to preſerve and prolong it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorted the People of God to ſet their Hearts to all the Words which he teſtified among them, and obſerve to do them, he told them that it was not a vain Thing for them, <hi>becauſe it was their Life;</hi> and then he added, <hi>Through this Thing ye ſhall prolong your Days in the Land whither ye go over Jordan to poſſeſs it.</hi> By which he ſhews us, that to be truly religious is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Means to preſerve and prolong our temporal Life in this World. Such Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of the Life that now is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. God hath ſaid to the Wicked, <hi>they ſhall not live out half their Days,</hi> Pſal. 55. 23. But to the truly religious he hath ſaid; <hi>with long Life will I ſatisfy him; and ſhew him my Salvation,</hi> Pſal. 91. 16. They have Life in the Promiſe of God, (and that is wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Wicked have not) and while they live they experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Faithfulneſs of God in performing his Promiſe to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The true Chriſtian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <hi>becauſe it is their political or civil Life;</hi> or their Life as a civil Government (whether Kingdom or Province) and they can't well, nor long ſubſiſt without it. It is this that exalteth a Nation; that makes it honourable in the Eyes of God, and famous &amp; renowned among other Nations, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 34. And it is this that is the Defence of a Nation, Kingdom, or Province. As it is ſaid of Wiſdom, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 12. It is a <hi>Defence;</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of the true Chriſtian Religion, it is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; for while it is preſerved in its Power and Purity among the People of God, God is with them to protect and preſerve them. See 2 Chron. 15. 2.—<hi>Hear ye me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſa, and all Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you while ye be with him.</hi> And on this Account they may ſing with the Church, as in Pſal. 46. 1, 2. <hi>God is our Refuge and Strength, a very preſent Help in Trouble, therefore will not we fear &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005173_0016_1016CFDA51CE1718"/>
It went well with the Nation of the Jews ſo long as they adhered to the true Religion, and they were famous and renowned in the Eyes of the Nations round about them: But when they declined, then they become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the Eyes of other Nations, and were ſorely puniſhed and broken by the juſt Judgment of God upon them; as you may ſee in the Hiſtory of their Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The true Chriſtian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <hi>becauſe it is their ſpiritual Life;</hi> or the Life of their precious and immortal Souls: without this their Souls are dead, even while their Bodies are alive, and will die eternally.</p>
            <p>As the Body without the Spirit is dead, ſo the Soul without true Religion is dead alſo; that is, ſpiritually dead; dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins; as the Apoſtle told the Epheſians they were before they embraced the true Chriſtian Religion, Eph. 2.1. <hi>You hath he quickned who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins:</hi> i. e. You who were void and deſtitute of the true Chriſtian Religion, and ſo of a Principle of ſpiritual Life; hath he quickned. <q>The Word <hi>quickned</hi> importeth a reſtoring of ſpiritual Life, by the infuſion of a vital Principle (in the Work of Regeneration) whereby Men are enabled to walk with God in newneſs of Life;</q> to fear him and love him, and ſerve him, and delight in a careful Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his Commandments and Ordinances, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the moſt pleaſant and comfortable Life that we can live in this World; for while we live ſuch a Life, we may ſay with the Apoſtle, as in Phil. 3. 20. <hi>Our Converſation is in Heaven &amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. The true Chriſtian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <hi>becauſe it is the Way to their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of eternal Life and Happineſs in the World to come.</hi> Our Saviour ſaid, Joh. 17. 3. <hi>This is Life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> i. e. this Knowledge is the Way to eternal Life, and without it Men will miſtake the Way, and miſs of it. The Knowledge of God, and of Jeſus
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005173_0017_1016CFDCFAC5F5A0"/>
Chriſt, is an eſſential Part of the true Chriſtian Religion, and the Way to be happy for ever; for ſuch Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of the Life which is to come; not from any Meritoriouſneſs in it, but from the free Grace of God, which hath annexed to it the Promiſe of eternal Life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn you, on what Account the true Chriſtian Religion, may be called the Life of God's People.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall proceed to make ſome Improvement of this Doctrine in a few Words.</p>
            <p>USE I. This Doctrine ſhews us that ſuch as make a Profeſſion of Religion, ſhould examine the Religion they profeſs, and ſee whether it be the true Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>There are many Religions in the World (as you have heard) and yet but one true Religion that will lead a Man to Heaven; ſo that tho' ſome of all Nations ſhall be ſaved, yet not ſome of all Religions; and therefore every Man ſhould examine his Religion, and not take it up upon Truſt as ſome do, ſaying they believe as the Church believes, and can give no other Account of their Religion.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> directs us to prove all Things, and to hold faſt that which is good, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 5. 21. that is, to try all Doctrines and Opinions in Religion which are delivered by any for Truths. And we are not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every Thing we hear 'till we have made trial of it. 1 Joh. 4. 1. <hi>Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they be of God, becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. What are we to try the Spirits by; or the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines which Men teach for Truths?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By the Word of God, which is the Standard of Truth. Gal. 4. 30. <hi>What ſaith the Scripture?</hi> Iſai. 8. 20, <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005173_0018_1016CFDEA6ACECB8"/>
               <hi>to this Word, it is becauſe they have no Light in them.</hi> The Word of God is a ſure Rule, a ſafe Rule, and a ſufficient Rule, whereunto we do well that we take heed; (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.) And to this every Man ſhould bring his Creed, and try every Article of his Faith, and hold faſt that which is good; for then is his Religion true when it agreeth with the Rule of Truth, which is the Word of God. The <hi>Bereans</hi> were commended for their Care to try the Apoſtles Doctrine by the Scriptures of Truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11.</p>
            <p>USE. II. This Doctrine ſhews us that the true Chriſtian Religion ſhould be dear to us as our natural Life, yea, and more too, becauſe it is our ſpiritual Life, or the Life of our Souls, and the Way to eternal Life.</p>
            <p>The Life of our Body is more precious to us than all our worldly Enjoyments: <hi>Skin for Skin; yea, all that a Man hath will he give for his Life,</hi> Job 3. 4. But the true Religion which is the Life of our Soul, ſhould be more precious to us than the Life of our Body, and we ſhould chuſe rather to part with our natural Life, than with our holy Religion, for if we loſe this we loſe our Souls.</p>
            <p>Profane Hiſtory gives us many Examples of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in the holy Word of God we read of many who choſe to ſuffer the Loſs of their Poſſeſſions, yea, and of their Lives to, rather than part with their holy Religion. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35, 36, 37.</p>
            <p>The Diſciples of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt forſook all they had for him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 27. And <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> a Man full of Faith &amp; of the Holy Ghoſt ſuffered Death for his Sake, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 59. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> willingly ſuffered the Loſs of all Things, rather than he would forſake Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. And if we would be his Diſciples, we muſt when he calls us to it forſake all to follow him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 33.</p>
            <p>There is no worldly Thing that we ſhould be ſo much concerned for as the Religion of Chriſt. Tho' there are ſome, who (<hi>Gallio</hi> like) care not for the Religion of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005173_0019_1016CFE2A6E250B0"/>
Chriſt, and others who ſpeak and write againſt it, and perſecute the Profeſſors of it, and do all that they can to beat it down and deſtroy it; yet it ſhould be dearer to us than our Lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And above all Things we ſhould be concerned to promote and preſerve it in the World, and to hand it down to Poſterity, that the Generations to come may profeſs and practice it, and have the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Comfort of it.</p>
            <p>USE III. This Doctrine ſhews us the Vanity and Madneſs of ſuch as ſlight and deſpiſe, and ſet Light by the true Chriſtian Religion, and go about to eſtabliſh a Religion of their own Invention.</p>
            <p>This is the Way and Manner of ſome Men; they don't ſee thro' the Religion which God hath inſtituted and revealed in his Word, therefore they deſpiſe it, and ſet up a Religion of their own Invention, and will not ſubmit to any other than that which is the Product of their own (depraved) Reaſon and Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>God never deſigned humane Reaſon to be the Rule of his Religion, but his own Word &amp; Law; and that Man that hath no other Rule for his Religion than his own natural Reaſon and Underſtanding, is no better of it than the Heathen, and ſtands no fairer for Heaven than they do.</p>
            <p>Humane Reaſon is good in its Place, and when under proper Regulation uſeful in Religion; but it can never contrive a Religion that will lead a Man to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Who will not acknowledge that <hi>Adam,</hi> when he had fallen from God's Favour and Fellowſhip, had as much humane Reaſon as any of his Poſterity? And did he know how to reſtore himſelf into his Favour and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip again? No verily; he had no Notion of this: therefore inſtead of contriving a Religion to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he endeavoured to hide himſelf from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord among the Trees of the Garden; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8. And they act as ignorantly who think to contrive a Religion of their own whereby they may be ſaved; and ſet Light by the Religion which God hath revealed;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005173_0020_1016CFE86FBB9EA8"/>
in the Belief and Practice of which alone we may on good Ground expect Salvation.</p>
            <p>USE IV. This Doctrine ſhould put us upon a ſerious Reflection on the State of our holy Religion at this Day; and excite us to conſider whether it be in a reviving or dying Condition.</p>
            <p>That there hath been a few Years paſt, a remarkable Revival of the true Chriſtian Religion in ſome Towns in this Country, is very evident &amp; manifeſt to the Teachers of it, and many others: and it well becometh us to give God the Praiſe and Glory of his Grace in reviving his Work as he hath done in one Place and another.</p>
            <p>And while we are thankful for this, we have Cauſe to lament before him that there are ſuch different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with reſpect to the State of Religion, both among Miniſters and People.</p>
            <p>Some call it a Time of great Reformation at this Day; others; a Time of great Deluſion and Giddineſs; and little Reformation.</p>
            <p>Some rejoyce that the Work of God is carried on gloriouſly: others tremble, fearing leſt Satan be let looſe, and ſuffered to delude many, both Miniſters and People.</p>
            <p>Some ſay that the itenerant Preachers, who have been travelling into many Towns in the Country of late, have been the happy Inſtruments of rouſing many out of their carnal Security and of reforming their Lives. <hi>Others</hi> ſay they are wandering Stars, and that ſome of them impart no Light; that their travelling from Place to Place hath been the Occaſion of much Confuſion and Diſorder in the Worſhip of God, and ſuch Cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſome Places, as is inconſiſtent with the true Chriſtian Religion; and by Means of them ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where there was Peace and Holineſs flouriſhing, have been ſorely rent and broken with Diviſions.</p>
            <p>Some ſay that illiterate Men (ſuch it may be, as never learnt the Aſſembly's Catechiſm, nor can give any tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Account of the Doctrine of our Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>
               <hi>Others</hi> ſay that ſuch Men are unqualified &amp; uncalled, and undertake this Work out of the Pride of their own Hearts, and to gratify their own Luſt.—That the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Word is a ſacred Office, not to be invaded by private Men, whether learned or unlearned, under the Pretence of an inward and immediate Call to it: That none are to meddle in it, but ſuch as are qualified for it, and externally and regularly called to it<note n="a" place="bottom">Heb. 5. 4. Rom. 10. 15.</note>; That theſe Men run before they are ſent, as the falſe Prophets did of old;<note n="e" place="bottom">Jer. 23. 21.</note> And as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, ſome ſhall do in Goſpel Times;<note n="i" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2. 1.</note> And by Means of ſuch Men the ſacred Scriptures are moſt injuriouſly wreſted, the Peace and Order of the Churches diſturbed; and a great many Errors and Miſtakes introduced. Satan hath filled the Church and World with Errors &amp; Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles this Way; ſaith an excellent Divine, namely Mr. <hi>Flavel.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p>Some have a fond Regard to Voices, Viſions, and Revelations, and countenance and encourage them, as if the Mind and Will of God were to be known by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There were ſome ſuch in the beginning of the Reformation by <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and theſe Men <q>were ſo intangled with certain enthuſiaſtical Snares, that they thought it the higheſt Impiety to renounce them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Others</hi> have no Regard at all to Voices, Viſions and Revelations, and ſhew them no Countenance; but ſay, that God who at ſundry Times, and in divers Manners,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005173_0022_1016CFED51EB4F90"/>
ſpake in Times paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt Days ſpoken to us by his Son, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2.) whom we ſhould hear, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 5) and that we are to look for no Revelations but what he hath made to us in his Word: <hi>Indeed we need no more.</hi> As for Voices, Viſions, Revelations, and Impulſes, many have been deceived by them; but as for what Chriſt has revealed it deceiveth none; but is ſufficient to make Men wiſe unto Salvation thro' Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> upon Occaſion ſaid, the Scripture is ſo full that as for Viſions and Revelations <hi>nec curo, nec deſidero,</hi> I neither regard nor deſire them. And when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had a Viſion of Chriſt, (after a Day of Faſting and Prayer) he cried out, <hi>Avoid Satan,</hi> I know no Image of Chriſt but the Scriptures. Again,</p>
            <p>Some ſay that Exclamations and Faintings on the Account of extraordinary Sorrow for Sin, or Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, in publick Aſſemblies, or more private Meeting for the Worſhip of God, is a Sign of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Preſence of God, and of the Effuſion of his Holy Spirit upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Others</hi> ſay it is Breach of that Order and Decency which the Spirit of God hath directed us to obſerve in our religious Aſſemblies for his Worſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40.</p>
            <p>Some ſay that Diviſions and Seperations in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, have a great Tendency to promote true Religion in them at this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Others</hi> ſay, that we have no ſuch Direction in the holy Scriptures; and that it is a Sign of the dying State of Religion; that the Scriptures caution Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches againſt Diviſions &amp; Seperations among themſelves; and exhort them all to ſpeak the ſame Thing, and to be perfectly joined together in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judgment; and to endeavour to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:005173_0023_1016CFAAEB5CD868"/>
Thus we are divided and broken, when we ſhould be all united, and in one Mind, being Members of one Body in Chriſt, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5.) and Profeſſors of one and the ſame true Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>And there being ſuch Diviſion among us, what ſhall we ſay with Reſpect to the State of our holy Religion at this Day? May we conclude that it is reviving, or dying?</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded that it is to be acknowledged, with the greateſt Thankfulneſs to Almighty God, that in ſome Places there are evident Tokens of the Effuſion of his Holy Spirit for the revival of Religion among us at this Day.</p>
            <p>And we ſhould eſteem it ſo, there, <hi>where</hi> the Word of God is more remarkably quick and powerful in the publick Miniſtry of it than uſual in our publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; <hi>where</hi> there is a wonderful ſhaking among the dry Bones, and many that have been for a long Time dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, appear to be made alive to God; <hi>where</hi> ſleepy Sinners are awakened; ſtubborn Sinners ſubdued; proud Sinners humbled; carnal Wretches made ſpiritual; covetous Worldlings made liberal; Drunkards made temperate; and unclean Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons made chaſte: <hi>Where</hi> profane Swearers, by the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Name of God, now fear his glorious &amp; fearful Name: <hi>Where</hi> thoſe that lived unmindful of Heaven, now ſeek the Things which are above, and ſet their Affections upon them: <hi>Where</hi> thoſe that lived prayerleſs Lives, now call upon God; and thoſe that deſpiſed his Word now trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at it: <hi>Where</hi> many that had no Sight nor Senſe of their Sins, and of the wretched and miſerable State they are in by Nature, are now pricked in their Heart, and cry out ſaying, <hi>What muſt we do to be ſaved? Where,</hi> many that turned their Backs upon the Table of the Lord, and ſaid (practically at leaſt) the Table of the Lord is contemptible, do now hunger &amp; thirſt for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt there; and <hi>where,</hi> Additions are made to the Church daily; and true Chriſtian Charity, Peace, and Unity, with Holineſs, doth flouriſh; there
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005173_0024_1016CF9F892B7920"/>
Religion is reviving; and that it is ſo in ſome Places, is to be acknowledged to the Praiſe and Glory of God.</p>
            <p>But alas, how is it in ſome other Places? It is to be ſpoken with Lamentation, that Religion is in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and dying Condition, and reduced to a low Ebb, in ſome Places. It is ſo in ſuch Places, <hi>where</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſettled on their Lees, are at Eaſe in Zion, and unconcerned for the Salvation of their Souls; <hi>where</hi> they that have been filthy are filthy ſtill; that have been unjuſt are unjuſt ſtill; they that have been prayerleſs, are prayerleſs ſtill; and they that have lived in the Neglect of the holy Duties of Religion, and in the Practice of ſcandalous Immoralities, are unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and unreformed to this Day: <hi>where</hi> there are none that ſtir up themſelves to take hold on God, and the Ways of <hi>Zion</hi> mourn, becauſe none cometh to the ſolemn Feaſts; and <hi>where</hi> there are ſuch lamentable Seperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Confuſions, and Cenſoriouſneſs, as plainly ſhew that God is departing from them: In ſuch Places, Religion is in a dying Condition. And is not this the Caſe in ſome of our Towns?</p>
            <p>USE V. This Doctrine ſhould excite and ſtir up all ſuch as make a Profeſſion of the true Chriſtian Religion, to take heed and beware leſt Satan deceive them, and ſo at laſt they ſhould prove counterfeit Chriſtians. 2 Cor. 2. 11. <hi>Leſt Satan ſhould get an Advantage of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is Danger of this, and every one ſhould be jealous of himſelf, and fear leſt he ſhould be deceived. The Phariſee was deceived, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 11.) and the Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceans were deceived, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. And it is common for Men to be deceived with reſpect to the State and Condition of their Souls.</p>
            <p>Some that pretend much to Religion, and the Spirit of God, do many Times give ſufficient Reaſon to fear a counterfeit Work: And indeed it is no wonder if many ſhould prove counterfeit Chriſtians, and reprobate Silver, in ſuch a Time as this, when Religion is ſo much talked of, and profeſſed in one Place and another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:005173_0025_1016B84FCC7C55B8"/>
The beſt Things on Earth may be counterfeited; as <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> and precious <hi>Jewels;</hi> and ſo may the beſt Things of the Spirit of God, as <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi> We are not to take every Thing for Gold that looks like it, nor every Thing for the Work of God's Spirit that hath a Shew of it. They are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the beſt that would appear to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Satan who transforms himſelf into an Angel of Light, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14.) is doubtleſs now at Work, and uſeth his helliſh Policy to counterfeit the Works of God's Spirit in many, and how near he may mimick them is hard to determine: He may do much this Way to the Deluſion of many Souls, if God permits him.</p>
            <p>We may not think the Time is now come wherein he is bound, and ſhall hurt no more; or that he now ſleepeth, when his Kingdom ſhaketh in many Places, and ſeems to be coming down apace; but we ſhould fear leſt he get an Advantage of us, and pray earneſtly that he may be bruiſed under our Feet; and lament thoſe Things which have a Shew of his Foot, and give us Reaſon to fear that he is ſuffered to delude ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Perſons to the everlaſting Ruin of their precious Souls.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now paſs to the ſixth and laſt Uſe.</p>
            <p>USE. VI. This Doctrine ſhews us, that we ſhould all do what we can, in the ſeveral Places and Stations God hath ſet us in, for the Preſervation and Promotion of that Religion which is our Life.</p>
            <p>There is much to be done for it, and ſomething may be done by every one that maketh a Profeſſion of it. Therefore I ſhall addreſs Perſons of every Order and Degree, to put forth their helping Hand for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of our holy Religion. And here,</p>
            <p>I. Let me addreſs <hi>civil Magiſtrates;</hi> or ſuch as God hath promoted to the Seats of civil Government, to do what they can to promote the Religion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:005173_0026_1016CF704B205BB0"/>
               <hi>Honoured Patriots!</hi> Let it not ſeem a ſmall Thing to you, that you have the true Chriſtian Religion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend, but eſteem it as a very great Honour conferred upon you, and Truſt repoſed in you by him, <hi>by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice; by whom Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 15, 16.</note> and labour to approve your ſelves faithful to him, and to his Religion.</p>
            <p>Thô the Religion of Chriſt may ſubſiſt without the Aſſiſtance of civil Magiſtrates, (as it hath done, yea, and even then when civil Magiſtrates oppoſed it, and laboured to beat it down and deſtroy it,) yet ſuch Men have been very helpful to promote it. And as they have Power and Authority, ſo they ſhould improve it for that End.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral Ways in and by which civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates may very much promote the Religion of Chriſt. Give me leave to mention a few.</p>
            <p>They may do it—</p>
            <p>By their earneſt and fervent Prayers to almighty God, thrô Jeſus Chriſt, for the Preſervation of it, in its Life, Power, and Purity.</p>
            <p>By their holy and religious Examples; and wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in ſuch difficult and perplexing Caſes as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of it may be concerned in, and aſk their Counſel about. And</p>
            <p>By enacting and executing ſuch Laws as have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereunto. Thus they may promote the Religion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt hath clothed them with Power to <hi>enact</hi> and <hi>execute</hi> Laws for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Religion. Here mind—</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Civil Magiſtrates may enact Laws for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and preſerving the true Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:005173_0027_1016CF73D5229178"/>
They may not make Laws againſt it, to beat it down and deſtroy it, for they have received no ſuch Power from Chriſt, by whom they rule and govern Men: They as well as others are under that Tie, 2 Cor. 13. 8. <hi>We can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi> They may not hinder the free Courſe of Religion, nor make Laws for the Rule of it; for this, Chriſt who is the Head of the Church, and Author of Religion, hath done already, and exhibited them in his Word.</p>
            <p>But they may add a civil Sanction and Strength of Law, for the ſtrengthning and aiding the Exerciſe of Religion, and ſecuring thoſe divine Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which Chriſt hath given to his Church, and to oblige Men to ſubmit to the Laws of Chriſt, ſo far at leaſt as to make no Diſturbance in the Church, and by doing ſo they may promote the Religion of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>II. Let me addreſs you; my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, who are Miniſters of the true Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; <hi>Reverend and Beloved;</hi> Let us eſteem it, not as a ſmall Thing that the God of Iſrael, hath ſeperated us from the Congregation of Iſrael, to bring us near unto himſelf, to do the Service of the Tabernacle of the Lord, and to ſtand before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to preach the Religion of Chriſt, and to miniſter unto them in holy Things;<note n="e" place="bottom">Numb. 16. 9.</note> But let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a great Honour conferred upon us by Jeſus Chriſt, (the Head and Saviour of the Church) and ſee to it that we honour him in this honourable Service, by doing all we can to preſerve and promote his Religion, and to hand it down to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005173_0032_1016CF828E282928"/>
To this End, let us ſtudy to ſhew our ſelves approved unto God, Work-men that need not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.<note n="i" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2. 15.</note> And let us be at Peace among our ſelves; Love as Brethren, and have fervent Charity one for another; and if it be poſſible ſpeak the ſame Mind, and be perfectly joined together in the ſame Time, and in the ſame Judgment; <hi>for if the Shepherds are divided, the Sheep will be ſcattered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us keep up our Aſſociation Meetings, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently meet together to ſtrengthen one another's Hands, and to encourage one another's Hearts in the Work of God, and to ſtrive together in our holy, humble, and fervent Prayers to Almighty God, thrô Jeſus Chriſt, for the Life of our holy Religion, which is in Danger of dying from among us; and ſay as in Hab. 3. 2. <hi>O Lord, revive thy Work.</hi> And as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 16. <hi>Let thy Work appear unto thy Servants, and thy Glory unto their Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt charged the Angel of the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> to be watchful, and ſtrengthen the Things which remained, that were ready to die, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2. And the ſame Charge lieth upon all the Angels of his Churches at this Day, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Paſtors &amp; Teachers of them; and they muſt be watchful and do what they can to ſtrengthen the Religion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Brethren,</hi> There never was a Time ſince the Churches of Chriſt were planted in <hi>America,</hi> wherein Watchfulneſs and Patience, Prudence and Courage were more neceſſary for the Miniſters of them than now.</p>
            <p>There is, (doubtleſs) a good Work of God going on in the Country, his Spirit is evidently poured out upon many in one Place and another, which calls for our moſt grateful and thankful Acknowledgement unto him.</p>
            <p>And there is, (doubtleſs) an evil Work of Satan going on in the Country, even there where the good Work
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005173_0033_1016CF84CECD1BB8"/>
of God is going on; (as it was in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> when the Spirit of God was remarkably poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many: and as it was in <hi>Pargamos</hi> where Chriſt had a Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 22.) which calls for our Humiliation. But for me to ſay ſo, may be grievous to the Minds of ſome, who would have all the Noiſe &amp; Stir, the ſtrange Agitations and Motions, Screaming and Fainting, and Diſorders, that are grievous and offenſive to many godly Perſons, attributed to the pouring out of God's Spirit upon his People, and will not allow of any Deluſion in ſuch Things.</p>
            <p>But this (I truſt) is not the general Opinion of either Miniſters or People. The moſt are for diſtinguiſhing the genuine and proper Works of God's Spirit, from the counterfeit and deluſive Works of Satan: And if this Method were complied with and wiſely managed by all, Peace and Holineſs, with good Order, might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and promoted where it is, and reſtored where it is wanting.</p>
            <p>What a ſad Condition is Religion running into in ſome of our Towns (by Means of Satan, and the Luſts of Men,) where Cenſoriouſneſs, and the Train of Evils which attend that unchriſtian Spirit, (as Diviſions, Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Diſorders and Confuſions) lamentably prevail?</p>
            <p>And many would have it ſo; therefore they refuſe to be healed, when healing Methods are preſcribed.—How often have we ſuch melancholy Accounts from one Place and another?</p>
            <p>The Time is now come when many of the true and faithful, pious and laborious Miniſters of our holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (though they ſhould be eſteemed very highly in Love for their Works ſake,<note n="o" place="bottom">1 Theſ. 5. 13.</note> yet are inſulted by ſome as <hi>Korah</hi> and his Companions inſulted <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Ye take too much upon you,</hi> Numb. 16. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:005173_0034_1016CF880226A8C0"/>
Some ignorant and mean, vile and baſe Men, will now proclaim themſelves converted, thô they can't give any Scripture Proof of it, nor do they ſhew it in their Converſation. And if we labour to ſhew them their Miſtake, and tell them what is lacking; they'l preſently pronounce us <hi>carnal, unconverted,</hi> and <hi>Oppoſers of God's Work.</hi> And this they are encouraged to do, by the Example of ſome Perſons of an eccleſiaſtical Character, who have thus reproached (contrary to the 5th &amp; 9th Commandment) ſome of our moſt learned and pious Fathers and Brethren in the Miniſtry, who have truly preached Chriſt, and ſhewn unto Men the Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him; and by their humble, holy, peaceable, and blameleſs Lives, have ſhown themſelves to be the true Followers of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Under ſuch a Trial, let that Word of Chriſt comfort us, Mat. 5. 11, 12. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when Men ſhall revile you</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And let us go on in the Way of our Duty in full Aſſurance of Faith, having our Hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and our Bodies waſhed with pure Water, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22.) And while a Spirit of Giddineſs poſſeſſeth the Minds of ſome, ſo that they are toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine by the Slight of Men, and cunning Craftineſs whereby they lie in wait to deceive, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14.) Let us be ſtedfaſt unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord, for as much as we know that our Labour is not in vain in the Lord, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55.) And holding faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith, without wavering, let us conſider one another, to provoke unto Love and good Works, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23, 24.) And then Religion may flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and proſper in our Churches.</p>
            <p>III. Let me addreſs the Reverend and Learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of our College, and Profeſſor of Divinity, and the worthy Tutors, who are aſſiſting in the Government and Inſtruction of the Students there.</p>

                  <p>Our College hath been very much the Glory of <hi>New-England</hi> for more than a Century of Years, and is ſo at this Day; many eminent and excellent Men for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Wiſdom, Piety and Prudence, have ſprang from thence; Men that have been of great Uſe and Service both in the Church and State; ſeveral of our excellent <hi>Governours,</hi>

                  <p>The Lord grant that the College may never become a Seminary for degenerate Plants, who will with their fooliſh Hands pull down thoſe Houſes which their pious Fathers have been building for the Name of the Lord in this Wilderneſs; as the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>I.

The Welfare and Proſperity of theſe Churches, under God, doth very much depend upon the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; Education of our Sons at the College: if they come forth well inſtructed, and eſtabliſhed in the true Chriſtian Religion, they may be happy Inſtruments of promoting it in their Day and Generation; but if they come forth poiſoned with corrupt Principles, they'l be likely to poiſon and ruin theſe Churches.</p>

            <p>Have a watchful Eye over them, and labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and keep them back from bad Company and Courſes, as much as you can. <hi>Eli</hi>'s Neglect to reſtrain his Sons from their wicked Practices, was a great Hurt to Religion, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 17. and at length prov'd the Ruin of his Houſe. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things Heads of Families ſhould do to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and promote the Life of our holy Religion.</p>
            <p>And we ſhould all, as we have Opportunity and Ability, freely, cheerfully, and abundantly contribute of our Subſtance for the promoting and preſerving the Religion of Chriſt, not only in the Places where we live, but alſo in other Places, where we know our Help is wanted.</p>
            <p>It was the Cuſtom and Practice of the primitive Chriſtians to do what they could to promote the true Chriſtian Religion in one Place and another by their publick Contributions; the Churches of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> contributed freely and abundantly for that End. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 26. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>And we have ſome modern Examples of this Nature; many of our Chriſtian Brethren and Friends in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> have contributed abundantly for the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our holy Religion in remote Places, where the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005173_0038_1016CF916E6C1438"/>
People have been either not able, or not willing to promote it, among themſelves:—And there are many in this Country and Province that have fared the better for their Chriſtian Liberality. And their Zeal ſhould provoke us to the like Works of Piety towards God, and Charity towards the Souls of Men. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2.</p>
            <p>And who indeed that hath experienced the Power and Efficacy of God's Word upon his own Heart for his Illumination, Conviction, Converſion and Comfort, will not endeavour, this Way, when 'tis in the Power of his Hand, that others may experience the ſame?</p>
            <p>I ſhould think it a ſad Epitaph ſhould this be wrote upon my Grave, ſaid a certain Perſon. <q>Here lies a Man that would not ſerve his Generation by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating as much Acquaintance with Religion to Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity as he could. <hi>Or,</hi> Here lies a Man that had a Life of many Years in the World, but he went thrô it, and yet no Man knew God the better for him, and no one got more Acquaintance with God thrô his Means.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We are not made for our ſelves alone, but we are made to help in making the World better; and if the Age we live in is not the better for us, it will be the worſe.</p>
            <p>Our Eſtates, if juſtly gotten, come of God, he is the Owner of them, more ſo than we are, and when we beſtow any Thing for the Propagation of Religion, we may ſay as King <hi>David</hi> did, when <hi>he,</hi> and his <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> offered willingly and abundantly for the Service of the Houſe of God; <hi>All Things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 14. And when we thus give to the Lord we honour him with our Subſtance, and take the moſt proper Way to increaſe what we have. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 9. 10. and Chap. 11. 25.</p>
            <p>Thus I have with great Plaineſs appeared as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for that Religion which is our Life.</p>

               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:005173_0039_1016CF94D71685C0"/>
And now I ſhall conclude with three Arguments to excite us all to do what we can in the Places &amp; Stations God hath ſet us in, to preſerve and promote the Life of our holy Religion. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Con.</hi> That the only true Religion hath been loſt from many Places and People that once enjoy'd it, thrô their Neglect of it.</p>
            <p>God hath always preſerved the true Religion in the World, and he will not ſuffer the Gates of Hell, ſo to prevail againſt it, as to deſtroy it out of the World ſo long as Time ſhall endure, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. But yet it hath not been always preſerved in one Place, &amp; among one People, but it hath been moving from Place to Place; and from one Family, Nation, and Kingdom, to another.</p>
            <p>God firſt gave Life to the true Religion in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Family; then in <hi>Noah</hi>'s; then in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s; and then in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s; then in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s; and then in the Nation of the Jews; and then among the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>No People have had it among them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World to this Day; but it hath been mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and loſt from many Places and People, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from Hiſtory both ſacred and profane.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It hath been loſt from the Nation of the Jews for many hundred Years paſt.</hi> If we look into the holy Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament, we may there find that the Jews had once the only true Religion in the World; but now it is loſt from them. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt threatned them with the Loſs of it, when he ſaid as in Mat. 21. 43. <hi>The Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the Fruits thereof.</hi> And as he threatned ſo it came to paſs, and they have now no true Religion among them: Thrô Unbelief they were broken off from God's Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. and being broken off God hath ſaid to them, <hi>Loammi,</hi> i. e. <hi>Ye are not my People, and I will not be your God;</hi> as in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 9. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005173_0040_1016CF98A3C02D08"/>
               <hi>It hath been loſt from many Places of the Gentiles.</hi> When the Jews were broken off from God's Covenant, then the believing Gentiles were graffed in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 11. and the true Religion was with them; and hath been preſerved among them unto this Day; but it hath not continued in any one Place from that Time to this; <hi>no;</hi> but it hath been moving from Place to Place.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Places in which it flouriſhed in the Days of the Apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are now deſtitute of it: The ſeven Churches which were in the moſt famous Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thiatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, &amp; Laodicea,</hi> of which we read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 11. in which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt walked, are all now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct; and the People that dwell there walk in Darkneſs; in the Darkneſs of Ignorance, Superſtition, &amp; Hereſy; and in ſome Places they have quite loſt the Chriſtian Name.</p>
            <p>And as the true Chriſtian Religion hath long ſince been loſt from <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſo it hath alſo from <hi>Affrica,</hi> where there were once ſome Thouſands of Chriſtian Churches, and many famous Miniſters; as <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Auſtin;</hi> whoſe Writings are ſtill in Uſe in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>And as the true Chriſtian Religion hath been loſt out of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> ſo it is in a great Meaſure loſt out of <hi>Europe.</hi> In <hi>Bavaria,</hi> in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in <hi>Moravia,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> there have been famous Chriſtian Churches, but now they are corrupted with Popery, and Socinianiſm. As the learned and excellent Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi> obſerves.<note n="e" place="bottom">See his <hi>Ichabod.</hi> p. 61, 62.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There was once in <hi>Rome</hi> the true Chriſtian Religion; a holy Church, a People beloved of God, called to be Saints, whoſe Faith was ſpoken of throughout the whole World, as we read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 7. But what is the true Chriſtian Religion reduced to in that great City? And what is that Church come to? May ſhe not be called the <hi>Mother of Harlots,</hi> and <hi>Abominations of the Earth,</hi> Rev. 17. 5.</p>

               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:005173_0041_1016CF9A692AC5C8"/>
2. <hi>Con.</hi> That the true Chriſtian Religion may be loſt from the People of God in this Land, and will be ſo, if there be no Care taken to preſerve it.</p>
            <p>It is now ſomething more than ſix Score Years ſince the true Chriſtian Religion was brought into this Land, (which was then a Wilderneſs) by our pious Anceſtors; and through the wonderful Patience and Goodneſs of God it is now handed down to the third and fourth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; but we don't know that it ſhall be continued for Generations to come; <hi>Gray Hairs are here and there upon it;</hi> many Symptoms of its languiſhing and dying State and Condition may be ſeen by every one that hath any Skill in Religion.</p>
            <p>Are not the Diviſions and groundleſs Seperations which are in many of our Churches in this Land, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Tokens of the ſickly State of Religion?</p>
            <p>And doth not the ſpringing up, and prevailing of Doctrines contrary to the true Chriſtian Religion in one Place and another, threaten the Death of our holy Religion, particularly <hi>Deiſm, Arianiſm, Arminianiſm</hi> and <hi>Antinomianiſm?</hi> Thô the three former do not appear ſo bare-faced among us as the latter, yet they have too many Vouchers in ſome Places where the true Religion is profeſſed. As for the Antinomian Hereſies, they ſeem to be ſpreading apace, and it is high Time to guard againſt them, leſt theſe Churches ſhould be infeſted and ſorely diſtreſſed with their Errors, as they were in their early Days. A ſhort Account of which the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> hath given us in his <hi>Magnalia,</hi> which is worthy of our Obſervation at this Day.<note n="i" place="bottom">
                  <q>
                     <p>Book 7th. p. 14, 15, 16. The Church of God had not long been in this <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> before the <hi>Dragon</hi> caſt forth ſeveral <hi>Floods</hi> to devour it; but not the leaſt of thoſe <hi>Floods</hi> was one of <hi>Antinomian</hi> and <hi>Familiſtical</hi> Hereſies, with which the Country began betimes to be infeſted.—And the Stir which they made about thoſe <hi>Opinions,</hi> grew ſo general that they quickly affected all the publick Affairs of the Country.—</p>
                     <p>There did then ariſe in the Land a Diſtinction between ſuch as were under a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and ſuch as were under a <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> wherein the bigger Part of the Country in the Management of that Inquiry; <hi>By what Evidence muſt a Man proceed in taking to himſelf the Comforts of his Juſtification?</hi> laid upon our <hi>Sanctification</hi> the firſt and main Streſs of our comfortable <hi>Evidence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Opinioniſts</hi> were for another Sort of <hi>Evidence</hi> as their chief; namely, <hi>The Spirit of God by a powerful Application of a Promiſe,</hi> begetting in us and revealing to us a powerful <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of our being juſtified.</p>
                     <p>Now the Truth might eaſily have united both of the Perſwaſions, yet they that were of the <hi>latter Way</hi> carried the Matter on to a very <hi>perilous Door,</hi> open'd not only for new <hi>enthuſiaſtical Revelations,</hi> but alſo for a Neglect of ſuch <hi>Qualifications</hi> in all <hi>Godlineſs</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> as muſt be found in all that would be <hi>proſpered,</hi> and not <hi>rejected</hi> in their Confidences. Yea, they employed their Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> at ſo extravagant a Rate as threatned a Subverſion of all the peaceable Order in the Colonies.</p>
                     <p>They drove at this; That the moſt virtuous Man upon Earth might not be admitted into the <hi>Churches</hi> without profeſſing, that renouncing of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his good State, he waited for <hi>immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to aſſure him of it. And ſuch as were already in <hi>Church Communion,</hi> unleſs they became fond of the <hi>New-Lights,</hi> in this Thing pretended unto, were preſently branded as favouring a Covenant of Works.</p>
                     <p>The Contention ſpread it ſelf into <hi>Families,</hi> and all private and ſmaller Societies, who were to be accounted under a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and ſo Enemies unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and who were not? which was determined among the buſy <hi>Sectaries</hi> by a Perſon's accommodating himſelf unto their <hi>fine-ſpun</hi> Speculations. <hi>Illic ipſum eſſe fuit promereri.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Diſturbance proceeded from thence into all the general Affairs of the Publick: The Expedition againſt the <hi>Pequot Indians</hi> was moſt ſhamefully diſcouraged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Army was too much under a <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> began to be contemned as being of <hi>a legal Spirit,</hi> and having therewithal a Tang of <hi>Anti-Chriſt</hi> in them; nor could the ordering of Town Lots, or Town Rates, or any Meeting whatſoever eſcape the Confuſions of this Controverſy.</p>
                     <p>'Tis incredible what Alienations of Mind, and what a very <hi>Calenture</hi> the Devil raiſed in the Country upon this <hi>odd Occaſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it may not be amiſs to deſcribe a little more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the <hi>Methods</hi> whereof the <hi>Devil</hi> therein ſerved his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. The <hi>Sectaries</hi> acquainted themſelves with as many as poſſibly they could, and carried on their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with all the <hi>Courteſies</hi> and <hi>Kindneſſes</hi> that they could contrive to ingratiate themſelves in the Hearts of others, eſpecially of <hi>New-Comers</hi> into the Place; they herewithal appear'd wondrous <hi>holy, humble,</hi> ſelf-denying and ſpiritual, and full of the moſt charming Expreſſions imaginable. <hi>Free Grace, Goſpel Truths, Glorious Light, and holding forth of Chriſt,</hi> was all their Tone: And meeting with Chriſtians that had any Doubts in their Minds about their own future Happineſs, they would inſinuato into them that they had never taken <hi>a right Courſe for Comfort,</hi> by going to <hi>evidence</hi> their good Eſtate by their <hi>Sanctification;</hi> but that there was a more evangelical Way to Peace, by which they themſelves were got above all their Fears for ever.</p>
                     <p>They began uſually to ſeduce <hi>Women</hi> into their Notions, and by thoſe <hi>Women,</hi> like their firſt Mother, they ſoon hook'd in the Huſband alſo. Having wrought themſelves any where into a good Eſteem, they ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t themſelves with a manifold Subtilty to undermine the Eſteem of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> and intimate that their <hi>Teachers</hi> themſelves, never having been <hi>taught of God,</hi> had miſ-taught, and miſled the People.—Whence it came to paſs that ſome who had followed thoſe Miniſters three thouſand Miles thrô ten thouſand Deaths, yet now took up ſuch Prejudices, not only againſt their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> but againſt their <hi>Perſons</hi> alſo, that they did never care to hear them, or ſee them any more.</p>
                     <p>They adminiſtred their <hi>Poiſons</hi> in ſmaller <hi>Doſes</hi> and not without <hi>Preparations,</hi> wherein if any made any Boggle, they would preſently retreat, and ſay, <hi>Nay, don't miſtake me, for I mean the ſame that you do, we differ only in Words.</hi> And they would beſure ſtill father their Whimſies upon ſuch Perſons as were held in moſt <hi>Veneration</hi> throughout the Country; but if they were brought Face to Face, they would ſtill wind out with ſome cunning Evaſions. Thus they went on 'till they had got ſome noted <hi>Perſons</hi> in all <hi>Order</hi> to patroniſe them.</p>
                     <p>And then it is impoſſible to deſcribe the Cenſures, the Contempts, the Affronts caſt upon the beſt Men in the Land, as Men <hi>ignorant of Chriſt;</hi> and the terrible Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Contention that enſued in all Societies.</p>
                     <p>The Miniſtry of the Country, awakned by theſe <hi>Noiſes</hi> about the Temple, had ſeveral Meetings, that they might ſet Matters to Rights, all which were ineffectual, until the <hi>General Court</hi> called a <hi>Synod</hi> of all the Churches in the Country to meet at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the Year 1637.</p>
                     <p>The Synod being aſſembled, with the Rev. <hi>Thomas Hooker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peter Buckley,</hi> choſen its Moderators at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> (then called by the Name of <hi>New-Town</hi>) on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 30th. 1637. there were produced about eighty-two erroneous Opinions and Expreſſions which had been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Country by ſeveral Men, at ſeveral Times.</p>
                     <p>The Authors of theſe Errors were neither mentioned nor inquired; but the <hi>Errors</hi> themſelves were conſidered, confuted, and condemned from the plain <hi>Word of God.</hi> For indeed the Deſign of the <hi>Synod,</hi> was not <hi>Jus Dare,</hi> but only <hi>Jus Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And as for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which was called the holy City, when the true Religion flouriſhed in it; it is now a miſerable Town, in which are no Inhabitants beſide Infidels and Idolaters; and on Mount Zion, in that very Place where <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple ſtood, there is now a <hi>Moſque,</hi> or Turkiſh Church for Mahomitan Worſhip.<note n="o" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>I.

            <p>And to this End let us conſider, how we have left our firſt Love; remember from whence we are fallen, and repent, and do our firſt Works; for if this be not done, Chriſt will come unto us quickly, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our Candleſtick out of his Place; and then we ſhall be a miſerable People. But if this be done by us, he will walk in the midſt of theſe golden Candleſticks, and they ſhall not be moved: He will help us, and that right early.</p>
