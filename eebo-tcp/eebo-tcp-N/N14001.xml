            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

He has taken the liberty of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, though unacquainted with learned phraſes and grammatical queſtions, to offer this to every ſon of freedom; and as it was not intended for the public eye, hopes the critic will forgive all errors. He only adds, that, if any ſentences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, ſhould kindle the ſmalleſt emotion of joy in an American breaſt, he will think his labour amply rewarded.</p>

The government and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of kings are almoſt as old as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if we look back to antiquity, we will find the good old patriarch Abraham engaged in a war with five kings, which he defeated, retook his brother and all his ſpoil, and at his return from the ſlaughter, had the approbation and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of Melchizedeck the prieſt of the moſt high God, who congratulated him on his victory, and regaled him with bread and wine. The force that Abraham had was but ſmall, yet with that force he overcame all his enemies.—So may America and her allies overcome all their enemies. But before we proceed, let us take notice why thoſe words were ſpoken by the children of Iſrael to Rehoboam their rightful ſovereign, and then apply the caſe to America and Great-Britain, with ſome remarks.</p>
            <p>Diſobedience is the general cauſe of all earthly calamities, and ſometimes meets with immediate vengeance from the hand of the

Lord and from the hand of man. Solomon's diſobedience was the cauſe of the ten tribes revolting, as you will find it record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preceding chapter; which points out the revolution of the ten tribes, as it came to paſs in the firſt year of the reign of Solomon's ſucceſſor.—Thus you ſee the children viſited with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ins of the fathers.—Rehoboam being the hereditary prince repairs to Shechem to be placed on his father's throne, and accordingly all the heads of Iſrael aſſemble to the coronation: But the children of Iſrael were appriſed of Rehoboam's deſigns, and they ſent and fetched Jeroboam the uſurper, for he had fled through fear from the land, during the reign of king Solomon; for had he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But who will anſwer for the blood that has been ſpilt in America when the Lord maketh enquiry for it, I know not.—But I am afraid I have deviated from the point in view.—</p>
            <p>So when all Iſrael ſaw that the king would not hear nor redreſs their grievances, they all with unanimous voices ſaid, What portion have we in David, or what inheritance in the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Notwithſtanding all their boaſtings, they have been fought with bravery equal to that of Romans, by the raw and undiſciplined Americans.—There is no need to recount the battles that have been fought; they know, and America alſo knoweth, that her arms have in many actions ſhone with reſplendent luſtre; one of her beſt generals, with his army, has been taken alive in the face of day, by thoſe men that they branded as cowards.—Since we can look veterans in the face, and Britains too; let us not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, but be of good courage and the Lord will be our helper.

            <p>Nothing but ſuperiority has given them any victories that they have ever gained; not their valour — And theſe victories have been oftentimes ſo dearly bought, that they have been almoſt equal in their conſequences to a total defeat.—They have armed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics to fight againſt their maſters, contrary to the laws of civilized nations.—They have hired foreign mercenaries to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their baſe deſigns; but their moſt vigorous efforts have proved abortive.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, may America ſay with one voice, that though they have been chaſtened ſore they are not given over unto death, and that he has raiſed up for us an American Joſhua to lead our armies into the field, whoſe virtuous perſon I hope heaven will preſerve.</p>

What need have we to have any portion or dependence upon Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? what good have they done for us? and what evil have they not done? The churches of God have been burnt and defaced, and nothing but devaſtation, rapine and plunder have marked the footſteps of the Britiſh generals in America; to enumerate them would be needleſs. Let me excite and admoniſh you with all the affection of a fellow-citizen, though a deſcendant of Africa, that you be no more afraid of them, but rather if poſſible to follow the example of good Joſhua, when he defeated the kings of Canaan, when he called his captains and his warriors together, and ſaid, Come near and put your feet upon the necks of thoſe kings, and be not diſmayed, but be ſtrong and of good courage, for thus ſhall the Lord do unto all your enemies againſt whom ye fight.— The blood of the innocent that has been ſhed, as well as the cries of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
