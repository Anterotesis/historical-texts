            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I PRESUME the larger Part of this great Assembly are met here this Day, with an Expectation and Desire to make some Improvement, both of the Death and Life of <hi>that honourable and aged Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> who has sat so long among us a great Part of our Beauty and Joy, and whose late Decease now puts us into universal Mourning. And as I have often tho't that He in many respects, both in his Birth, his Education, his Office, Life and Character, resembled the <hi>Scripture</hi> SAMUEL: I cou'd not but apply myself on this Occasion, to make a few Reflections on the Words before us; wherein every Hearer sees a clear Description of our own deceased.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003344_0004_0FF7E551B743E748"/>AND here are these four things to be considered,—
<list>
                  <item>1. THE Person spoken of,</item>
                  <item>2. HIS peculiar Office,</item>
                  <item>3. HIS faithful Discharge of it,</item>
                  <item>4. and lastly, HIS shining Piety.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>THE Person spoken of</hi>; and this is SAMUEL.</p>
            <p>NOW SAMUEL, we know, was one of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and happy of the JUDGES, which the GOD of <hi>Israel</hi> was pleased to raise up among his People in the early times of their Declension; to save them from Oppression and preserve them in a strict Adherence to the inspired Religion of their Fathers.</p>
            <p>HIS immediate Descent was from <hi>Parents</hi> of exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Piety. While many turn'd away to the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Inventions of the neighbouring Nations; this happy Couple persevered in the zealous Practice and Profession of the pure Religion, as it was reveal'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from GOD Himself.</p>
            <p>HIS <hi>Father</hi> strictly followed his great and pious Leader JOSHUA in his Resolution, that both He and his House would serve the LORD. He constantly went up with all his Family from his own Habitation in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah</hi> to the Tabernacle and Ark in <hi>Shiloh</hi> at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Seasons: and there He gave his devout atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to the sacred Institutions of divine appointment; there He presented his publick Sacrifices of Prayer and Praise, and worshipped the LORD.</p>
            <p>AND his <hi>Mother</hi> will be for ever famous, for the Prayer of Faith whereby she obtained this her first born Son, and for the grateful Sacrifice of Praise wherewith she came and return'd Him freely to the divine Bestower. In a particular manner He was the <hi>Son of her Vows</hi>: For she solemnly resolv'd before she had Him, to give Him up to GOD; And as soon as she weaned Him, she chearfully performed her Promise. She brought Him up to the TEMPLE in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> as the <hi>Ark and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003344_0005_0FF7E55653ADB070"/>
Tabernacle</hi> are expresly called in the first <hi>Chapter</hi> at the 9th <hi>Verse</hi>: And there she presents her Child with her Thank-offering and joyful Song, and resigns Him to the LORD as long as He lived.</p>
            <p>HERE she therefore leaves Him: and Here in his tender Years He is, under the Instruction and Care of the High Priest ELI, trained up in the Knowledge of the inspired Writings and in the sacred Service of the Sanctuary, to which He had been thus devoted. In the 2d <hi>Chapter</hi> at the 11th <hi>Verse,</hi> 'tis said, that <hi>the Child did minister to the LORD before</hi> ELI <hi>the Priest</hi>: and in the 18th Verse, again, that SAMUEL <hi>ministred before the LORD, being a Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN these two Places He is called a <hi>Child,</hi> even while He <hi>ministred</hi>: He ministred <hi>before</hi> or <hi>to</hi> the LORD— To signify the pious Inclination and Employment of his tender Age: And He is said to minister <hi>before</hi> ELI the Priest; which seems to intimate, that ELI took Him into his special Care, kept Him always under his Eye, descern'd his Hopefulness and delighted in Him. And by the general Air of the sacred History, it seems as if there quickly grew a very great and mutual Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness between the venerable Master and the young De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple. While SAMUEL grows in filial Reverence and Concern to obey and please the aged Father; ELI also grows in a paternal Tenderness and Affection for Him.</p>
            <p>UNDER the Tuition of this ancient and pious <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,</hi> who was no doubt Himself a learned Man in the Laws of GOD, such a Child as SAMUEL must needs improve in Goodness. And in <hi>Verse</hi> 26th we read, that <hi>the Child</hi> SAMUEL <hi>grew on, and was in Favour, both with the LORD, and also with Men.</hi> As He advanc'd in Years and Knowlege, He must therefore also have grown in Grace and Wisdom, even in his early Youth; so as to rise in the Notice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of all about Him, as well as to have this destin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Honour done Him as to intimate, that He grew in the Favour of GOD Himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003344_0006_0FF7E55A70D71CE0"/>YEA to such an eminent Highth of Piety did He quickly rise; that while He was no more than a <hi>Child,</hi> GOD was pleas'd to single Him out above all the Priests and People of ISRAEL, to endue Him with the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy.</hi> And indeed, He seems to be the <hi>youngest Prophet</hi> that ever was in the World.</p>
            <p>IT was in a time of far advanc'd Apostacy, when the provoked Spirit of GOD had greatly left them; <hi>the Word of the LORD,</hi> i. e. The Word of Prophecy, was become very <hi>precious</hi>; and there was <hi>no open Vision,</hi> i. e. no known or publick Prophet favoured with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations. In such a Time as this it was, and while <hi>the Child</hi> SAMUEL <hi>ministred to the LORD before</hi> ELI; that <hi>the Word of the LORD was revealed to</hi> SAMUEL, as we have an account in the 3d <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT a <hi>Child</hi> — a <hi>Prophet</hi>!— How is it possible that humane Nature in so extreamly light and vain an Age, shou'd in a suitable manner bare the destinguishing Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being a Prophet, above the rest of the World? The great Apostle PAUL, tho' in the hight of manly Power and Wisdom, a full grown Christian, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with great numbers of inspired Persons, yet represents himself in the utmost danger of being exalted above measure for his abundant Revelations; and to save Him from it, both a <hi>Thorn in the Flesh</hi> was given Him, and a <hi>Messenger from Satan</hi> sent to buffet Him, and keep Him low. But little SAMUEL bares the Dignity alone in so lowly a manner, that He still gets up in the Morning to attend on his inferior Office of opening the Doors of the House of the LORD, and goes on to conceal his Revelations, till ELI obliges Him to discover them.— His <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> under them is a far greater Wonder than his having the Spirit of Prophesy.</p>
            <p>NONE can be so much prepar'd for the Revelations of the mind of GOD, or Converse with Him, as the most Humble Soul: none so much become or recommend them when they are bestowed: and none are so much
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003344_0007_0FF7E55E63434C48"/>
prepared for signal Exaltations. With such the Blessed GOD delights to dwell: And no wonder then we read in the three last <hi>Verses</hi> of this third <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the first of the next, — That SAMUEL <hi>grew, and the LORD was with him, and let none of his Words fall to the Ground: and all</hi> ISRAEL <hi>even from</hi> Dan <hi>to</hi> Beersheba, <hi>knew that</hi> SAMUEL <hi>was established to be a Prophet of the LORD: and the LORD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd again in</hi> Shiloh: <hi>for the LORD reveal'd Himself to</hi> SAMUEL <hi>in</hi> Shiloh, <hi>by the Word of the LORD: and the Word of</hi> SAMUEL <hi>came to all</hi> ISRAEL.</p>
            <p>AND now it seems, we read no more of this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Youth for above <hi>Twenty</hi> Years, when we find Him cloathed suddenly with a <hi>Judicial</hi> Character, and some how or other removed from <hi>Shiloh</hi> to <hi>Ramah.</hi> We therefore come to consider,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>THE peculiar Office of a Publick</hi> JUDGE, <hi>wherein the Text describes Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT long before He arrives at this, his uncommon Graces must be extreamly tried and exercised. He must bare the Yoke in his early Days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and even while a Youth, it seems, as if his own awful Prophecies became a most affecting History.</p>
            <p>FOR now comes on a time of great Affliction and Confusion in the Land of ISRAEL. The <hi>Philistine</hi> Armies came up and killed <hi>Four thousand Men</hi>: In a second Fight, slew <hi>Thirty thousand Footmen</hi>: The Two Sons of ELI, who had carried the ARK into the Field of Battle were slain: That sacred Sign of GOD's gracious Covenant and Presence was taken by their insulting Enemies: Upon the dreadful Tidings, the <hi>High Priest</hi> Himself, who was also their sovereign Judge, falls off his Seat and dies: and the ARK OF GOD is carried into the House of <hi>Dagon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A most dark and dismal Day was this to ISRAEL: as we have it described in those moving Colours,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003344_0008_0FF7E5638C3E2BA8"/>
Psal. lxxviii.58,—64. <hi>For they provoked Him to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with their High Places, and moved Him to Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy with their graven Images: When GOD heard this, He was wroth, and greatly abhorred</hi> ISRAEL: <hi>So that he forsook the Tabernacle of</hi> Shiloh, <hi>the Tent which He placed among Men; and delivered his Strength into Captivity, and his Glory into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hand: He gave his People over also to the Sword, and was wroth with his Inheritance: the Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed their young Men, and their Maidens were not given to Marriage: their Priests fell by the Sword, and their Widows</hi> had no Opportunity to make their funeral Lamentations.</p>
            <p>WITHIN Eight Months after, indeed, the <hi>Philistines</hi> were forced by the distinguishing Judgments of GOD upon them, to return the ARK to the Borders of Israel: But no sooner was that most sacred Token of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Presence arrived at <hi>Bethshemesh,</hi> than <hi>Fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand &amp; Seventy</hi> of the People flocking round it from every Quarter, were slain, by a Divine Plague, for their irreverent Treatment of it <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam vi 19. I am sensible, that to soften the History, both the SYRIAK &amp; ARABAK render it 70 Men and 5 thousand Men, and BOCHART wou'd have it 70 out of 50 thousand who were there present; because He thinks it not agreable to the Divine Mercy. But the Hebrew words are 70 Men 50 thousand Men; which both the SEPTUAGINT and the CHALDEE PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAPHRAST retain, and is most agreable to what is said in the following verse, that GOD had smitten them with a GREAT SLAUGHTER. And it seems strange to me that any Thoughtful Mind shou'd make the Objection. For tho' this high Irreverence of GOD might be the Publick, contemporary and last Occasion of this Destruction; yet we must consider, that Mankind are commonly if not always so guilty and expos'd to the Vengeance of Heaven, that it can't be inconsistent with the Divine Mercy, almost at any time to bring a Plague among a numerous People which shall destroy as many &amp; more than those: and it consists with Wisdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to chuse the Time when they have been openly and conjunctly guilty of the same Sin, that He might appear to bare His dreadful Testimony both against the Sin it self and the Publick and United Commission of it.</note>. And their victorious Enemies seeing them still in ill Terms with Heaven, seem to

have improved their advantage, and extending their Armes, to keep them under sore Oppression for <hi>Twenty</hi> Years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT what became of the</hi> Ark, <hi>the</hi> Tabernacle, <hi>and the</hi> Publick Worship, <hi>for this tedious Interval</hi>?</p>
            <p>AS for the <hi>Ark</hi> &amp; <hi>Tabernacle</hi>—They were kept asunder all this Time, and a long while after. Upon the great Destruction of the People at <hi>Bethshemesh,</hi> the <hi>Ark</hi> was carried to <hi>Kirjathjearim,</hi> i. e. in English, <hi>the Field of the Wood,</hi> whereof we read in <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxii.6. and was in the Tribe of JUDAH, and there it rested. But the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> seem'd to continue all this while at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> which was in the Tribe of EPHRAIM, as we may show hereafter.</p>
            <p>AND as for the <hi>Publick Worship</hi> during this <hi>Twenty</hi> Years Oppression, — the Ark and Tabernacle thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining separate, the Sanctuary Service seemed to be in a great measure interrupted, neglected and dissolved. And this the more, since 'tis very likely that their jealous and vigilant Oppressors wou'd never suffer them in great numbers to resort together, as all their Males were by their Law obliged three times a Year, at the Tabernacle of the Congregation. By this means Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion further languished, and many more thro' the Arts and Influence of the neighbour Nations and their Commerce with them, turned aside to other Worship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT in this long Scene of Trouble,</hi> where <hi>was our hopeful</hi> SAMUEL, <hi>and how does he</hi> employ <hi>himself</hi>?</p>
            <p>IN this state of publick Dissolution, ELI and his two elder Sons being Dead, and there being little to be done at <hi>Shiloh</hi>; the <hi>Philistines</hi> keeping a watchful eye on that Place of Concourse and on the surviving Family of ELI the late High Priest and Judge; <hi>Shiloh</hi> seems to have lain in a very solitary State and almost deserted: And 'tis therefore likely that SAMUEL either liv'd a retired Life <hi>There,</hi> or rather returned to his paternal Inheritance at <hi>Ramah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003344_0010_0FF7E56A561DA6D0"/>HOWEVER, He was neither unconcerned with the lamentable State of ISRAEL, nor unactive in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to Restore it. And the Third &amp; Fourth <hi>Verses</hi> of this Seventh <hi>Chapter,</hi> seem to be a brief Epitome of this obscure Part of his rising Life. For there we read, that while the House of ISRAEL were lamenting after the <hi>LORD</hi>: SAMUEL <hi>spake to all the House of</hi> ISRAEL <hi>saying; If ye do return to the LORD with all your Hearts, then put away the strange Gods and</hi> Ashtaroth <hi>from among you, and prepare your Hearts to the LORD and serve Him only; and He will deliver you out of the hand of the</hi> PHILISTINES. By this it seems that either the People, and especially the Chief of ISRAEL repair'd to SAMUEL for Council; or rather, to prevent the Umbrage of their Enemies, He travelled about from Tribe to Tribe to teach them; Labouring to show them their provoking Sins, to make them sensible that all these Sufferings were Corrections for them, and to bring them on to a general and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance and Reformation.</p>
            <p>AND herein he wrought with <hi>great Success,</hi> as the following <hi>Verse</hi> informs us. For at the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Twenty</hi> Years, and when <hi>He</hi> seems to be about <hi>Thirty</hi> Years of Age, they appear prepared to return to the <hi>LORD.</hi> And then upon his Advice we find them in the two following <hi>verses,</hi> gathering together at MIZPEH, their ancient Place of Concourse, that there they might unite in Fasting, Praying and Returning to the GOD of their Fathers: and THEN and THERE 'tis first said, HE JUDGED THEM.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT why did not one of the Princes of the Tribes assume this Office? How came</hi> SAMUEL <hi>invested in it</hi>; when he was neither the Son of such a Publick Ruler, nor a Man of War, nor did his Genius seem to turn so much to the Arts of civil Policy as plain Religion, to the Service of which He had been from his Infancy designed?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003344_0011_0FF7E56E89FC1B48"/>FOR the Resolution of these Enquiries, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider; That upon the early notice of the Divine Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with him, the Eyes of ISRAEL must needs be turned towards him as their decisive Oracle: and as they grew in their Knowlege of him, and saw more and more of his extraordinary Piety and Wisdom and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Mind of GOD, his Authority no doubt increased with his Age, and the numbers yearly grew of those who applied to him for his Advice and Judgment, and referr'd their causes to his wise Decision. <hi>Who</hi> cou'd therefore be so fit to Judge and Rule them? <hi>Who</hi> cou'd have so great Authority and Influence? In <hi>Whom</hi> cou'd they so well confide or be united? And therefore now they wisely and openly receive and honour him as their PUBLICK JUDGE, whom GOD had been so signally Preparing for this high Imployment.</p>
            <p>AND now at this Assembly of the Tribes of ISRAEL, the Character of this Great and Pious Man arises to the highest pitch that we can well conceive. For now it seems as if the extraordinary Powers both of a Sovereign <hi>Prophet, Priest and Judge,</hi> were on this occasion united in him: which seems to be a superiour Honour bestow'd on SAMUEL, above all others of the mere Sons of Men, either before or since. For, as a <hi>Prophet</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with Heaven, he alone declares the Mind of GOD to the attentive People; as their <hi>High Priest,</hi> he offers Publick Sacrifice and Prayers for them; and as their <hi>Sovereign Judge,</hi> they all appear to have their Eyes on his Authority and to be intirely subject to his Direction. — Who among the mighty of the Earth may be compared to him!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT in what consisted this Peculiar Office?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW the original and chief Intention of it seems to be —<hi>a Publick Saviour of a People either from foreign or domestick Oppression.</hi> The first occasion is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely given us in <hi>Judg.</hi> ii.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>—19. And the Sum is this, —
<q>That when the children of ISRAEL forsook the LORD and followed other Gods of the People round about them; the Anger of the LORD grew hot
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003344_0012_0FF7E570DE1F8088"/>
against them, and He deliver'd them into the hand of Spoilers that spoiled them, and they were greatly oppressed: Nevertheless the LORD raised up JUDGES, which deliver'd them out of the hand of those that spoiled them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when He raised up such <hi>Judges</hi>; then He was with the <hi>Judge,</hi> and deliver'd them out of the hand of their Enemies all the Days of the <hi>Judge</hi>: for it repented the LORD, because of their Groanings by reason of those that oppressed them and vexed them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT then there was no necessity, that these <hi>Publick Judges</hi> shou'd be Men of the Sword, or have any hand in the immediate Conduct of their Armies. It was sufficient, that they were Persons of great Reputation &amp; Authority among the People, for Justice, Wisdom, Piety, Integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and a publick Spirit: in whom their several Tribes could readily unite and trust, and be directed by in weighty Cases both of a foreign and domestick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So the High Priest ELI judged <hi>Israel Forty Years,</hi> even while He remain'd at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended the Service of the Ark and Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>SO SAMUEL likewise Judged their Tribes, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after SAUL was rais'd to the royal Dignity. And when He first became their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, He sav'd them, not by Leading out their Armies, or order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Battles, which He left to those who were trained to War; But by imploying his great Sway and Authority in wisely directing their civil and religious Affairs at Home, promoting a Reformation among the People, doing what lay in his Power to bring them back and reconcile them to GOD, and improving his Interest in Heaven by offering Sacrifice and earnest Intercessions for them.— <hi>This</hi> is the right Way of <hi>saving</hi> a People both from intestine and foreign Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence: And He that helps to reform them, helps to deliver them.</p>
            <p>AND then a publick Judge is to go on and persevere in the same great Design of preserving a People from
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003344_0013_0FF7E576ED1AB8F0"/>
Apostacy, and the natural Consequence thereof — Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression. He is to set a bright Example of universal Righteousness and Goodness; and not only <hi>Do</hi> the things which are Right and Good Himself, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>See</hi> that others do so too: In the most publick manner to discountenance all Iniquity in every corner of the Land, to encourage Obedience to the Laws of GOD, To be a constant Terror to Evil-Doers, and a Joy and Praise among the Righteous.</p>
            <p>FOR these great Ends is SAMUEL raised up to this high Employment, when ISRAEL was brought very low, and had been languishing under hard Oppression for their Departure from the GOD of their Fathers.</p>
            <p>AND now we go on to see in the</p>
            <p n="3">III. place, <hi>HIS faithful</hi> DISCHARGE <hi>of this supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING Begun an happy Reformation, He was as zealous to Preserve it. And being own'd their publick Judge, He carefully employ'd his Power, to keep down all Iniquity, and promote a constant Reign of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Goodness thro' the Land.</p>
            <p>AND here are these Three things to be observed,
<list>
                  <item>1 <hi>THE great Pains He took for the Publick Good,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>HIS strict Integrity,</hi> And,</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>HIS stedfast Perseverance.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THE great Pains He took for the Publick Good. — "<hi>He went from Year to Year in Circuit, to</hi> Bethel <hi>and</hi> Gilgal <hi>and</hi> Mizpeh, <hi>and Judged</hi> ISRAEL <hi>in all those Places: and his Return was to</hi> Ramah, <hi>for there was his House, and there He judged</hi> ISRAEL.</p>
            <p>THAT we may have a clearer View of his Judicial <hi>Circuit,</hi> I shall endeavor a Scripture and brief <hi>Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> ISRAEL.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:003344_0014_0FF7E57BF3FBE838"/>AT the Head of the <hi>Mediterranean Sea,</hi> about <hi>Five thousand five hundred</hi> Miles to the <hi>East-north-eastward</hi> from us — There lies the Land of CANAAN: Having the Sea on this side, with the <hi>Philistine</hi> Cities bordering on it, and on the East side, the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> issuing out of the Lake of <hi>Galiilee,</hi> called also <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and running down into the Lake of <hi>Sodom.</hi> On the other side <hi>Jordan,</hi> were the Tribes of <hi>Reuben, Gad</hi> and <hi>the half of Manasseh,</hi> ranging along to the Northward: and beyond them, MOAB and AMMON Eastward; and Southward MIDIAN and the great ARABIAN WILDERNESS. About the midst of the Land, from <hi>Jordan,</hi> across almost to the Western Sea, lay the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi>: having <hi>Juda<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AND, for the <hi>Circuit</hi> of SAMUEL —</p>
            <p>RAMAH now appears to be the Place of his Abode; the reason of which we observed before. But there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing several Towns of the same Name, especially one in <hi>Benjamin</hi> and another in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> it has been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by Geographers, which of these was the Seat of SAMUEL. However, to me it seems to be decided plainly by Scripture. For this must needs be the same RAMAH, where his Father had his House, as we read in the 1st <hi>Chapter</hi> at the 19th <hi>Verse,</hi> and in the 2d <hi>Chapter, Verse</hi> the 11th. In the former Text 'tis said of both his Parents, That they <hi>Return'd and came to their House in</hi> RAMAH: and <hi>who</hi> shou'd heir this House of theirs but their first born SAMUEL? or whither shou'd He repair from <hi>Shiloh</hi> but to the Place of his Kindred from whence He came? Agreable to the same Expression, <hi>HIS Return</hi> is here said to be also <hi>to</hi> RAMAH, <hi>for there was HIS House</hi>: And the Name of the Place is also the same, viz.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003344_0015_0FF7E57E7432A7D8"/>

            <p>NOW <hi>Zophim</hi> it seems lay <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and signifies a <hi>Prospect.</hi> The SYRIACK therefore renders it, — <hi>The Hill of Prospects,</hi> and the ARABACK — <hi>The Hill of Discovery</hi>: <note n="(B)" place="bottom">Bib.

of <hi>Ephraim</hi>; upon one of which stood RAMAH, the Abode of SAMUEL.</p>
            <p>BUT the Region rather seems to take it's Name from ZUPH or ZOPH one of his own Ancestors, of whom we read in the same Verse with <hi>Ramathaim-Zophim,</hi> and who is also called ZOPHAI in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> vi.26. <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> therefore render it — <hi>The Double Ramah of the</hi> ZOPHITES; Because con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of two contiguous Cities and in the Land of the Sons of ZUPH.

            </p>
            <p>BUT the punctual Scituation of RAMAH seems to be now uncertain. Some of the Ancients indeed tell us that it lay in the neighbourhood of <hi>Lydda</hi>; and many Moderns imagine it to be the same with <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mola,</hi> a little South-Westward of <hi>Lydda</hi> and within a dozen Miles of the Sea.

'Tis said, The Lot of the Sons of <hi>Joseph</hi> fell from <hi>Jordan</hi> by <hi>Jericho</hi> to the Wilderness which goeth up from <hi>Jericho</hi> thro'out MOUNT BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEL; In <hi>Chap.</hi> xviii.13, that the Border of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> came to the South side of it; and in the 22d Verse, 'tis reckon'd among the Cities allotted to <hi>Benjamin.</hi> But in <hi>Judges</hi> 1.22,—25. we read, that the House of <hi>Joseph</hi> went up and smote it with the Edge of the Sword; and in 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> vii.28. That it was the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Possession of the Sons of <hi>Ephraim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY this we see that BETHEL was a City in the Borders between the Tribes of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi>: And as 'tis likely that the Border-Cities were to be possess'd by those of either neighbouring Tribe that wou'd first go up and take them from the <hi>Canaanites</hi>; the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> first went up and seized BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEL, and made it theirs.</p>
            <p>BUT by the Scituation of it, about the midst of the Land every way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we see how well it served for the Concourse of the <hi>midland</hi> People, on either side, to SAMUEL for Judgment.</p>
            <p>FROM hence, He made his further Progress <hi>East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> still, to GILGAL.</p>
            <p>NOW GILGAL was a very famous Place which lay on the East of <hi>Jericho</hi> near <hi>Jordan.</hi> There the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> first encamped upon their coming out of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and entering the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was on the 10th Day of the first Month, <note n="*" place="bottom">Josh. iv.19.</note> being <hi>Forty Years</hi> from their leaving <hi>Egypt.</hi> There they set up the Twelve Stones they took from the midst of the River, as a lasting Monument of their passing thro' it on dry Ground <note n="†" place="bottom">Verse 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

thro' it, and the <hi>Reproach of</hi> EGYPT <hi>roll'd away</hi>; on which account the Place receiv'd the Name of GILGAL, i. e. <hi>Rolling away</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Josh v.9.</note>. There on the 14th Day of the same Month they first kept the Passover in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>: and by their Uncircumcision it seems as if they had not kept one for <hi>Forty Years</hi> before: <note n="‖" place="bottom">Exod xii.43. —49.</note> and in <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three Days</hi> after, the <hi>Manna</hi> ceased <note n="*" place="bottom">Josh. v.10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—12.</note>.

            </p>
            <p>IN fine, There the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> rested till the Land was for the most part conquer'd and divided, when 'twas reared up at <hi>Shiloh</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Josh xviii.1</note> in the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> However GILGAL yet appears in the Days of SAMUEL, to be a Place of great Resort for publick Sacrifice and Worship; <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> xiii.4 7 — 12. &amp; xv.12,—33.</note> which SAMUEL therefore chose to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the People to, when He publickly invested <hi>Saul</hi> with the Royal Dignity <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Sam. x.8 &amp; xi.14, 15.</note>. And by the Scituation of it on the Eastern Borders of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a Place convenient for the Tribes of ISRAEL on the other side of <hi>Jordan</hi> to repair for Judgment.</p>
            <p>FROM hence He seems to have turn'd about and travelled <hi>Westward,</hi> across the Land, to MIZPEH</p>
            <p>NOW MIZPEH signifies an <hi>High Place</hi> or Place of <hi>Speculation</hi>: By which we may suppose it on a high Hill of a very fair Prospect round it: And of several men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture, there are Two especially remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>THE first in <hi>Gilead</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan</hi> and in the Tribe of <hi>Gad</hi>; where <hi>Laban</hi> overtaking <hi>Jacob,</hi> they set up a Pile of Stones as as a publick Witness of the League
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003344_0020_0FF7E59366AE82F8"/>
between them. <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxi.49. Here the <hi>Israelites</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled themselves together and encamped against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> who dwelt on their Eastern Borders, <hi>Judg.</hi> x.17. And here they made <hi>Jeptha</hi> their Head and Judge, who had his Residence in the same City, <hi>Judg.</hi> xi.8, — 11, and 34.</p>
            <p>BUT the most famous MIZPEH seems to be on the Western Border of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> And it being a Border City may possibly be ascribed to them both, As in <hi>Judges</hi> xv.38. &amp; xviii.36. It lay in a Place convenient for the General Assembly both of these and of the other Tribes, and has been renowned for their frequent Congress on great Occasions. For there they gathered together as one Man before the LORD, to go up against the <hi>Benjamites</hi> of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> Judges xx.1. Thither SAMUEL also called them, when He brought them to a Publick Reformation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on his Judicial Office, as we observed before: and there He again assembled them, to find out by Let the Man whom GOD would have to be their <hi>King</hi>; and <hi>Saul</hi> being discovered was there first Proclaimed. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> x.17— 24.</p>
            <p>Hither SAMUEL made his yearly Journies to Judge them: and by the Scituation of the Place between <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> and the <hi>Sea,</hi> it appears to lie convenient for the Concourse of the <hi>South-western</hi> People of ISRAEL to meet Him.</p>
            <p>AND thus having visited the principal Cities which were then in the Land; He finished his Circuit, and returned to RAMAH: <hi>For there was his House</hi>: And yet even <hi>there,</hi> He did not give up Himself to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent or supine Life; But <hi>there</hi> He still continued to receive their Appeals and <hi>Judge</hi> them.</p>
            <p>THUS He seems to have Chosen the most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Cities, for the easier Confluence of the People to Him, from every Quarter. He minded not his own Advantage or Ease so much as theirs: and least they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003344_0021_0FF7E595F9B2B8B0"/>
should lose too much Expence or Time in coming to his House at <hi>Ramah,</hi> He travels about, and carries them Publick Justice. And herein he neither regarded the Inclemencies of the Weather, nor Inconvenience of Inns or Roads in those Hilly Countries, nor spared his Pains for the Good of the People.</p>
            <p>TO all these Places He constantly went, and Judged them. The <hi>Syriak</hi> seems well to render it — <hi>He judged</hi> ISRAEL <hi>and all those Regions,</hi> i. e. not only those principal Cities, but all the Countries round them. In them He exercised his Judicial Power for the Publick Interest: In them He yearly held his Courts of Justice: And there He received their Appeals from the Inferiour Judges, He patiently heard their Pleas, and decided their Controversies. There He also doubtless enquired into the <hi>Manners</hi> of the People round about: He restrained and corrected the Vicious, He gave forth righteous Decisions: And in them He always displayed his superiour Wisdom, Goodness, Equity, and strict regard to the Good of the Publick and the Laws of GOD.</p>
            <p>AND to all these Places He went in Circuit <hi>from Year to Year,</hi> or at least so long as his Age per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and never allowed his own Affairs to hinder Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are now to observe <hi>his strict Integrity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR tho' this be not so expresly mentioned in the <hi>Text,</hi> it is plainly couched and implied. For the Words must needs be meant as an historical Recommendation of Him in the exemplary Character of a Public Judge; and his <hi>Uprightness</hi> is also intimated in the great Pains He took and the Fatigues He endured, in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this high Office: The like to which we read not of any other Judge before Him.</p>
            <p>BUT to illustrate this, I shall only cite — That most open and solemn <hi>Appeal</hi> He made both to GOD
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003344_0022_0FF7E59A970CD548"/>
Himself and the whole Congregation of ISRAEL in <hi>Gilgal,</hi> with the united Voice of all the Tribes in his Applause; when He was much advanc'd in Years, and was laying down a great Part of the weight of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon SAUL'S Accession to the Kingdom, 1 Sam. xii.1,—5. <hi>And</hi> SAMUEL <hi>said to all</hi> ISRAEL —
<q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have hearkned to your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a King over you: And now behold, the King walks before you, and I am old and grey-headed, and behold my Sons are with you, and I have walk'd before you from my Childhood to this Day: Behold, Here I am; witness against me before the LORD, and before his <hi>ANOINTED:</hi> Whose Ox have I taken? or whose Ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received a Bribe to blind mine Eyes therewith? and I will restore it to you.</q>
And they said; <hi>Thou hast not defrauded, neither hast Thou taken ought of any man's hand.</hi> And He said to them,
<q>The LORD is Witness against you, and his <hi>ANOINTED</hi> is Witness this Day, that ye have not found ought in my hand:</q>
And they answered, <hi>He is Witness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW free and open, how unanimous and strong is this repeated Publick Testimony of all the Tribes of ISRAEL, to SAMUEL'S perfect <hi>Uprightness</hi> thro'out his whole and long Administration!</p>
            <p>BUT,</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE must now observe <hi>His stedfast Perseverance</hi> in this laborious Office.—<hi>And</hi> SAMUEL <hi>judged</hi> ISRAEL <hi>all the Days of his Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN <hi>Chap.</hi> viii.1. He is said to be <hi>Old,</hi> before He called his <hi>Sons</hi> to help Him in the Judicial Office. Now a Man can scarce be stiled <hi>Old</hi> till he be <hi>Sixty Years</hi> of Age: nor can we well suppose his <hi>Sons</hi> were grown to a sufficient Gravity and Wisdom for such a weighty, serious and superior Employment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till they were arriv'd at <hi>Forty</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which will also raise their <hi>Father</hi> to at least <hi>Three-score Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:003344_0023_0FF7E5A07A507780"/>SOMETIME after, when the Elders of ISRAEL gathered themselves together and came to ask Him for a King, they began their Speech with saying, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Thou art old,</hi> &amp;c. which it was not likely they would say to SAMUEL'S Face unless his Age were far advanc'd indeed, and his natural Powers of Judging or at least of <hi>Travelling</hi> were very visibly declined thro' Age; and therefore was alleged as one great Reason of their asking for a King to Judge them.</p>
            <p>AND after this at SAUL'S establishment at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> SAMUEL says of Himself, in <hi>Chap.</hi> xii.2. <hi>Behold I am old and grey-headed,</hi> &amp;c. And yet it seems He still went on in this great Employment to the Day of his Death, which was many Years, some think <hi>fifteen</hi> or <hi>sixteen</hi> after; and from <hi>Acts</hi> xiii.20, 21. compared with the History of the Judges, that in the whole He judged ISRAEL for <hi>Forty Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH his <hi>hoary Head,</hi> to be sure, He sat on the <hi>Judgment Seat</hi>: He <hi>There</hi> desir'd to spend his Life in the Publick Service. And <hi>There</hi> — what a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Reverence must strike the Soul, to see this great and aged Man, with the flowing and silver Locks of his unshaven Head, as He had been a pure <hi>Nazarite</hi> from the Birth, and his Face grown shining with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of Sanctity and Wisdom! Even his humble Mind could not but know the Veneration of the People for Him, their Delight to see Him, and that his meer Appearance in their Assemblies cou'd not but raise their Minds into an Esteem of Piety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT how could He Judge</hi> ISRAEL <hi>all the Days of his Life, when</hi> SAUL <hi>was made their King to Rule and Judge them</hi>?</p>
            <p>TO this I answer— That the Heads of ISRAEL seem to ask for a King to Judge them, not to lay SAMUEL by while He was capable to discharge the Office, nor indeed ever to supply his Place in the Courts of Judicature; But partly to relieve Him of the Burthen of Civil Government, as He grew thro'
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003344_0024_0FF7E5A482674F88"/>
Age unable, and partly to head their Armies: tho' chiefly indeed, from a weak Affectation of worldly Pomp and Grandeur, which they liked better than the plain and simple way of Government they had been used to, that they might have one among them in the Power, State and Splendor of a King, like the Kings of other Nations. <hi>Chap.</hi> viii.11,— 20.</p>
            <p>SAUL was therefore chiefly employed in martial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs all his Days. And besides He knew that SAMUEL had a vastly greater Skill in civil Matters, the People were entirely satisfied with SAMUEL'S Presidence in their Courts of Justice: and SAUL cou'd never presume to controul so divine a Person, to interfere with Him, or deprive the People of so great a Benefit. And even SAUL Himself in the Highth of Power appears afraid of the more awful Prophet: and SAMUEL on all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions appears superior to Him when they come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For SAMUEL more than once severely reproves and threatens Him: He also sent the King to destroy <hi>Amalek</hi>; and when SAUL had spared <hi>Agag,</hi> contrary to the Law of GOD, <hi>Samuel</hi> went to SAUL, brought Him to confess his Sin, to ask even SAMUEL'S Pardon, and to intreat of SAMUEL to honour Him before the People with his Presence: And then SAMUEL com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands King <hi>Agag</hi> to be brought before Him, slew Him before SAUL'S Eyes, and returned to his House at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> Chap. xiii. and xv.</p>
            <p>SAMUEL therefore still retains his great Authority, especially in <hi>civil Matters,</hi> and continues in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise thereof till sometime before his Death, when He took his final Leave of SAUL; and then seems to be grown too Old to go the Circuits, and retires to his House at <hi>Ramah.</hi> However, <hi>There,</hi> no doubt He still employ'd his remaining Life in Judging all that repaired to Him, till He wholly resigned the publick Business, and compos'd Himself to Die.</p>
            <p>BUT we must hasten to consider</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:003344_0025_0FF7E5A861765478"/>IV. and lastly, <hi>HIS shining PIETY.</hi>—
<q>And His Return was to <hi>RAMAH,</hi> for there was his House, and there He Judged <hi>ISRAEL;</hi> and there <hi>HE BUILT AN ALTAR TO THE LORD.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS latter Clause, at the first view indeed, may only seem an Instance of his Family Religion: But when we come to enquire into the Use of ALTARS, we shall clearly see it reaches to every Branch of Piety.</p>
            <p>NOW there were <hi>Three sorts</hi> of ALTARS mentioned in Scripture (1) An <hi>Altar</hi> of WITNESS — As was the Altar built on the Eastern side of <hi>Jordan</hi> by the <hi>Two Tribes and half</hi> there seated, upon their Parting from the other and Returning to their Possessions, <hi>Josh.</hi> xxii.10,—34. But this was a mere Monument of Piety, as <hi>Deodate</hi> terms it: And one wou'd think, without either <hi>Grates</hi> to support the Offerings or <hi>Air-Vents</hi> to fan the Fire, as the other had. (2) An <hi>Altar</hi> of INCENSE, which was order'd to be overlaid with pure Gold, and made only for the Burning of the sweetest Spice and Frankincense, every Morning and Evening, in the Holy Place of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi>; and was peculiar to them, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxx.1,— 10, 34, — <hi>e.</hi> and xxxvii.25, — <hi>e.</hi> (3) And lastly, An <hi>Altar</hi> for SACRIFICE: which was this of SAMUEL'S as we may see in the 9th <hi>Chapter</hi> of this History.</p>
            <p>THO' <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> brought their Offerings to the LORD; yet NOAH was the first we read of who built an <hi>Altar,</hi> and this for Sacrifice; which was upon his coming out of the Ark on Mount <hi>Ararat,</hi> at the ceasing of the Deluge, <hi>Gen.</hi> viii.20. The next was ABRAHAM, who built <hi>Four</hi> Altars at so many several Places in the Land of CANAAN: And then <hi>Isaac, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Man<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ah,</hi> and the <hi>Eleven Tribes,</hi> in others: And now comes SAMUEL, and builds an Altar to the LORD at <hi>Ramah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Use</hi> of this kind of Altars, was for Offering <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> both of <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving</hi>: and their <hi>Design</hi> was to show the Necessity of Satisfaction
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003344_0026_0FF7E5AC486EC488"/>
to be made to the Justice of GOD for the Sins of Men, in order to obtain Peace and Favour with Him; and to lead the Mind to the great <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of CHRIST, as the only sufficient Purchase of every Mercy.</p>
            <p>A Sacrifice of <hi>Atonement</hi> was for the Expiation of Sin, for averting the Anger and Judgments of GOD both f<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lt and feared, and for obtaining his Favour and Blessing. So JACOB offered Sacrifice, on Mount <hi>Gilead,</hi> as He was going to meet his Brother ESAU. <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xxxi.54.</note> and at <hi>Beersheba,</hi> as He was going down to AEGYPT <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen xlvi.1.</note>. So GIDEON built an Altar in <hi>Ophra,</hi> and offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Deliverance from the <hi>Midianites</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Judges vi.24, — 26.</note>. So the ELEVEN TRIBES at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> for Success against the <hi>Benjamites</hi>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:003344_0027_0FF7E5B25C17FC70"/>SAMUEL'S <hi>Altar</hi> then, was a continual Instrument both of Family and Publick Worship, and a standing Sign of his eminent Devotion — That He took Care to Live in good Terms with GOD, to implore Him constantly for needful Favours, and to return Him grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Praises for the Bestowment of them.</p>
            <p>BUT when SAMUEL had wrested <hi>Israel</hi> out of the oppressive Hands of the <hi>Philistines — Why did He not restore the</hi> ARK <hi>to the</hi> TABERNACLE <hi>at</hi> Shiloh? <hi>Why did He not himself return to that sacred Place and Service, according to his early Dedication? Why did He not attend the Worship there as well as</hi> ELI, <hi>who</hi> Judged ISRAEL <hi>notwithstanding? Or, tho' He liv'd at</hi> Ramah, <hi>Why did He not from time to time repair to the</hi> Altar <hi>before the</hi> Sanctuary, <hi>according to the Law in,</hi> Exod. xxix.36,—<hi>e.</hi> &amp; Deut. xii.17,—27?</p>
            <p>NOW the <hi>Reasons</hi> of this Conduct may be such as these —</p>
            <p>IN <hi>Psalm</hi> lxxviii.60. We read, that upon the ARK'S being carried from <hi>Shiloh</hi> by the <hi>Sons</hi> of ELI, the LORD <hi>forsook the</hi> TABERNACLE <hi>of</hi> Shiloh; v.67, that <hi>He refused the</hi> Tabernacle <hi>of</hi> Joseph, <hi>and chose not the Tribe of</hi> Ephraim; and v.68, <hi>but chose the Tribe of</hi> JUDAH, <hi>the Mount</hi> ZION <hi>which He loved.</hi> This might well be reveal'd to SAMUEL, and He in time communicate the same to DAVID, who it seems were very intimate and agreed together about the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> in the <hi>House of GOD</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Sam. xiii.14.xv.28.xvi.1.13. compar'd with Chap xix 18 — 24, and 1 Chr. ix.10, — 22. &amp;c.</note>. And this might be one great Reason why as soon as DAVID came to the Throne of <hi>Israel,</hi> the very first thing He did was to take <hi>Jerusalem</hi> from the <hi>Jebusites</hi> and dispossess them of Mount ZION; and when He had fortified and adorn'd the Mountain, He remov'd the ARK into a Tabernacle He had there prepared for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:003344_0028_0FF7E5B663E502B8"/>HOWEVER, It seems that by a <hi>Divine Interposition,</hi> the <hi>Ark</hi> and <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of MOSES were never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to come together in SAMUEL'S Days.</p>
            <p>FOR the ARK remain'd at <hi>Kirjathjearim,</hi> unless when 'twas carried to the Army on some Occasions, and then returned thither, till King DAVID translated it to <hi>Zion.</hi> And the TABERNACLE seem'd to rest at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> to the Reign of SAUL; who 'tis likely, that both the Tabernacle and Conventions of the People might be nearer to Him, ordered it with ELI'S Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<q>to NOE, in his own Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi>: As 'tis probable that JOSHUA for the same Reason, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved it before, from <hi>Gilgal</hi> to <hi>Shiloh</hi> in his Tribe of <hi>Ephraim.</hi>

For when He had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the ARK to <hi>Zion,</hi> and <hi>left</hi> ASAPH <hi>with his Brethren to serve before it constantly as every Days work required</hi>; He at the same time <hi>left</hi> ZADOK <hi>the Priest with his Brethren the Priests, before the</hi> TA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERNACLE <hi>of the LORD at</hi> GIBEON, <hi>to offer burnt Offerings to the LORD on the Altar of the burnt Offering continually, Morning and Evening, and to do according to all that was written in the Law of the LORD,</hi> &amp;c: <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Chron. xvi.37, — 42.</note> And <hi>Here</hi> it still continued as the most publick Seat of Sacrifice and Worship, under ZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOK, <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Kings iii.4. compar'd with 2 Chron. i.3,—6.</note> till King SOLOMON removed IT with all it's Vessels, as well as the ARK, into the TEMPLE <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings viii.1, — 4. and 2 Chro. v.5.</note>. And thus at length they met together in the same House, in about <hi>One hundred and thirty Years</hi> from their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT to Return</hi> — In such a dissolved State of the Sanctuary Worship, SAMUEL seems to have a special, divine Allowance, both to leave the Tabernacle-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to apply Himself intirely to <hi>Judge &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi>

               </gap>'S Days, and required the whole of his Strength and Time — as also to Reside at RAMAH as a proper Place, and there to <hi>Build an Altar</hi> — ready at hand upon all Occasions.</p>
            <p>UNDER this head of <hi>Piety,</hi> we might here observe, His high Regard for the Publick Worship, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the Great GOD for the Conduct and Success of his Affairs, his constant solemn Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to HIM, and his Gratefull Care to return HIM all the Glory — of which this ALTAR was a continual Witness.</p>
            <p>BUT of all these I shall only single out <hi>One</hi> Instance— which was his <hi>Eminence for the</hi> Spirit <hi>and</hi> Duty <hi>of PRAYER.</hi>— He delighted in it; He set much by it; He profess'd and practic'd it in the most open manner.</p>
            <p>WHEN He first directs the Tribes to Assemble, He does it in such Terms as these —<hi>Gather all</hi> Israel <hi>to</hi> Mizpeh, <hi>and</hi> I WILL PRAY FOR YOU <hi>to the LORD.</hi> When they were met together, He turns the Day into a Day of <hi>Prayer and Fasting</hi>: And no doubt He led and bore a chief Part in the Publick Supplications of that vast Assembly. And when the Day was over, and the Lords of the <hi>Philistines</hi> came up against them; <hi>the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>were afraid — and said to</hi> SAMUEL — <hi>Cease not to</hi> CRY <hi>to the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD <hi>for us, that He will save us,</hi> &amp;c.— They had a greater Confidence in the earnest Prayers of SAMUEL, than in all their Forces.</p>
            <p>AND we quickly see their mighty Efficacy. For the History goes on to tell us — That SAMUEL <hi>took a sucking Lamb, and offered it for a Burnt Offering wholly to the LORD; and</hi> SAMUEL <hi>Cried to the</hi> LORD <hi>for Israel, and the</hi> LORD <hi>heard Him— and thundred with a great Thunder on that Day upon the</hi> Philistines <hi>and discomfited them, and they were smitten before</hi> Israel. And then to ascribe the Honour
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003344_0030_0FF7E5BEE2640FD8"/>
of all to GOD, He sets up There a Pillar of Stone, and calls it <hi>EBENEZER,</hi> saying, <hi>Hitherto hath the LORD helped us</hi> — as a lasting and publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of Praise to the GOD of <hi>Israel.</hi> And upon this we read — <hi>That the</hi> Philistines <hi>were subdued, and they came no more into the Coasts of</hi> Israel: <hi>And the hand of the LORD was against the</hi> Philistines <hi>all the Days of</hi> SAMUEL: <hi>and the Cities which the</hi> Philistines <hi>had taken from</hi> Israel <hi>were restored,</hi> &amp;c. Chap. vii.</p>
            <p>WHAT a great Blessing was this one Man, by his earnest Intercessions, to that whole People! Of which they were all so sensible that in a Time of the most fearful Tokens of the Divine Displeasure, they apply to Him as their powerfull Advocate with Heaven; Chap. xii.19. <hi>And all the People said to</hi> SAMUEL, <hi>Pray for thy Servants to the LORD thy GOD that we Die not,</hi> &amp;c. To which He nobly Answers, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.—<hi>GOD forbid that I should Sin against the LORD, in ceasing to Pray for you,</hi> &amp;c. His extraordinary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence in Prayer, was therefore after celebrated in such Terms as these, Psal. xcix.6. Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>among his Priests; and</hi> SAMUEL <hi>among them that Call upon his Name: They called on the LORD, and He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them.</hi> And in <hi>Jer.</hi> xv.1. SAMUEL is join'd with MOSES, as Two of the most prevailing Men in Prayer with GOD, that ever were, to save a sinful People.</p>
            <p>I might also mention several other Instances of his excelling Virtues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the signal Honours done Him both by GOD and <hi>Israel</hi>: But the time wou'd fail me — I shall only say, — That far from Ruling in an Imperious manner, Behold his great <hi>Indulgence,</hi> as a tender Father, even to the displeasing Humours of the People. Chap. xii.1. <hi>And</hi> SAMUEL <hi>said to all</hi> Israel; <hi>Behold, I have hearkened to your Voice in all that ye said to me,</hi> &amp;c. And yet what a mixture of <hi>Majesty</hi> was there in his Administration? <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>BUT we must come to observe, That at length this great and aged Pattern of Integrity and a Publick Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Zeal for GOD, and the Cause of Pi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

The Tribes are all in motion, to see his last Remains, and attend them to the Grave. And perhaps there never was so great a <hi>Funeral</hi> in the World as SAMUEL'S For of Him alone of all the <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> of ISRAEL, we read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxv.1. That when He <hi>Died,</hi> ALL THE ISRAELITES <hi>were Gathered together, and Lamented, and Buried Him in his House at</hi> RAMAH. And both his Death and their universal Confluence and Mourning at his Funeral are remark'd again in Chap. xxviii.3. <hi>Now</hi> SAMUEL <hi>was Dead, and</hi> ALL ISRAEL <hi>had Lamented Him, and Buried Him in</hi> Ramah, <hi>even in his own City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR their having a KING, nor SAMUEL'S advanced Years, nor his Decays of Nature prevented their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Sorrow. But they mourn the Loss of a PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICK FATHER, who greatly Loved them, had spent his Life to serve them, and from the Days of his Youth had arose and shone an admir'd Example of Piety, Justice, Goodness, and every Publick Virtue that cou'd make a People Easy and Happy; and a whole Nation assembles to unite in Mourning, and take their Leave at his Grave.</p>
            <p>AND thus — I have endeavour'd some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the extraordinary Life and Virtues of this ancient and most venerable <hi>Judge</hi> of ISRAEL. They are recorded in the sacred Volumns for the Admiration of every Age. Which puts me in mind of what the

            <p>AND for the same Reason as He first raised up SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MUEL, and then describ'd Him in perpetual Records; He is pleased still in successive Ages, to raise up others in their measures like Him; that He might give his People of every Generation a visible Evidence of what He is willing as well as able to do, and a living Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to charm them with the Beauty of Piety.</p>
            <p>IT would therefore be to conceal his Grace, and with-hold his Honour; not to observe the same kind of his Goodness among our selves, nor Praise Him for it.</p>

            <p>SEE how his Appearance raises in every Mind an Expectation of Justice: and his snowy Locks like SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MUEL'S adorn the Bench, attract every Eye to look on the more venerable Face they Crown, and make us wish his Place might never miss Him.</p>
            <p>LET us go into the RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLIES; and there we see his Seat constantly filled, with the <hi>Bible</hi> before Him to try every Doctrine. See how He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires and delights in the Beauty of every Divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And there let us view and be like Him, in his reverent and careful Attention, his humble and devout Behaviour, and the gentle Fervour of his pious Soul within raising up a silent Light in his Countenance.</p>
            <p>LET us visit his FAMILY; and there behold the strict and still Religion, the grave and comely Order. How every <hi>Sabbath</hi> is kept from Evening to Evening in a sacred manner; and every Day Morning and Evening the <hi>Scriptures</hi> read, and his <hi>Prayers</hi> with his Household go up as Incense to Heaven. How He instructs and councils those under his Care, and makes them easy and wise together. How free his <hi>Table</hi> to the learned and pious; How welcome is every <hi>Minister</hi> as an Ambassador of CHRIST; every <hi>Scholar</hi> treated with learned and entertaining Conversation, especially on the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their Originals; every <hi>Comer</hi> with Freedom and Courtesy; and every <hi>Poor</hi> with wise Advice and Alms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:003344_0037_0FF7E5DA05194088"/>LET us follow Him into EVERY PLACE &amp; COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PANY<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there admire and imitate the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Vein of unaffected Piety, of condescending Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, of innocent and decent Alacrity; and of such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Meekness and Freedom of Speech, as make his Presence the Satisfaction of all about Him, the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Piety visible, and the Ways thereof appear to be the ways of Wisdom and Pleasantness.</p>
            <p>LET us now behold Him gently <hi>Descending</hi> the Stage of Life; as his Age grows on Him, first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting his Circuit, then laying down one Publick Office after another, and at length retiring to his House like SAMUEL; that He might be gradually loosened from his earthly Cares, and have the greater Leisure to entertain Himself with the opening Views of that glorious Life which begins to dawn and rise upon Him, and will never decline.</p>
            <p>Lastly, LET us attend on his DEATH-BED-side; and view his exemplary Patience, Submission, Resignation, Faith; and the same humble, heavenly and unruffled Calmness of Mind as were usual with Him in the Days of his Health. How precious were the Tho'ts &amp; Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the REDEEMER still to Him: How He composes Himself to Die, as if He were only to sleep or rest in <hi>His</hi> gracious Arms. And when his Eyes were closed and his Speech had fail'd Him, his Hands yet constantly rising at every devout Meditation, till his Soul retires by undescernible Degrees from every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of Life, that it might take it's Flight to the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Abodes: And then with what wonderful Ease and Gentleness it leaves them without so much as a parting Groan or the least Intimation of Sorrow.</p>
            <p>THUS liv'd and died this venerable <hi>Judge</hi> of our Country, whom the GOD <hi>of our Fathers</hi> was pleased to raise up and continue to the present Generation, as a memorable Instance of our primitive Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:003344_0038_0FF7E5DB92D58498"/>AND now, Let us be Thankful to HIM for preserving his destinguishing Course so long and conspicuous with us: And yet let us mourn the Loss of his Life and continual Prayers. Let us all take Care that this great Example may not rise up against us in the future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to condemn or ashame us. Let us earnestly strive to follow Him in every Virtue. Let us encourage our selves with this —That the <hi>same Spirit</hi> which dwelt so brightly in Him, remains with GOD in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite measure; and there's not the least of us all, but He can make as eminent in every Grace. And let us earnestly Pray, that the SPIRIT from on high may be poured out abundantly on all Orders and Ages among us —</p>
            <p>
               <q>— THAT He may raise up of our <hi>Sons</hi> for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and of our <hi>Young Men</hi> for Nazarites and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: that we may still have <hi>Judges</hi> as at the first, and <hi>Councillors</hi> as at the beginning: that we may be stiled a Place of Piety, and may know that the LORD, the mighty one of JACOB, is our Redeemer. That our <hi>Officers</hi> may all be Peace, and our <hi>Exactors</hi> Righteousness: that Violence may not be heard in our Land, nor Wasting or Destruction within our Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but our Walls may be called Salvation, and our <hi>Gates,</hi> i. e. Our Council-Chambers and Courts of Justice, <hi>Praise.</hi> That the People may all be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and inherit the Land for ever: that the Sun may go down no more among us, nor the Moon withdraw Her shining, but the LORD may be our everlasting Light, the Days of Mourning ended, and our GOD our GLORY.</q>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT of the Deceased FROM THE <hi>Weekly News-Letter,</hi> No. 158. CORRECTED. <hi>BOSTON, January</hi> 8. 1729, 30.</head>
            <p>ON the first of this Instant, at half an hour past Five in the Morning, after about a Month's Languishment, Died at his House here, the Honourable <hi>SAMUEL SEWALL,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> in the 78th Year of his Age; who has for above Forty Years appeared a great Ornament of this Town and Country.</p>
            <p>His Great Grand-father, HENRY SEWALL; <abbr>Esq</abbr> was a Linnen-Draper in the City of <hi>Coventry</hi> in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> acquired a considerable Estate, was a very prudent Man, and more than once chosen Mayor of that ancient City. HENRY the eldest Son out of Dislike to the English Hierarchy, sent over his only Son HENRY then a Young Man to <hi>New-England</hi> in 1634, with neat Cattle and Provisions suitable for a new Plantation, who made his Pitch at <hi>Newbury,</hi> whither his Father soon followed. And on <hi>March</hi> 25. 1646, that his Son Married Mrs. JANE, the eldest Child of Mr STEPHEN and Mrs. ALICE DUMMER, who likewise then dwelt there under the Ministry of the Rev. Mr. THOMAS PARKER and Mr. JAMES NO<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003344_0040_0FF7E5E3A48F3CD8"/>But this Climate being not agreable to Mr. DUMMER and Consort, they returned to <hi>England</hi> the Winter following, and their Son and Daughter SEWALL with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who dwelt a while at <hi>Warwick,</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to <hi>Bishop-Stoke</hi> in <hi>Hampshire</hi>; where on Lord's Day <hi>March</hi> 28. 1652, this their eldest Son SAMUEL was Born, and baptiz'd in <hi>Stoke</hi> Church, <hi>May</hi> 4th fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, by the Rev. Mr. RASHLY, who was once a Member of the old Church in <hi>Boston,</hi> afterwards one of the ejected Ministers. Some Months after, the Family remov'd to <hi>Badsly</hi> in the same County, where another Son, the late Maj. STEPHEN SEWALL of <hi>Salem</hi> was Born, <hi>Aug.</hi> 19th 1657: And at <hi>Rumsey</hi> a neighbouring Market Town, their said eldest Son was first educated in the Grammar School, of which Mr. <hi>Figes</hi> was Master. But the Father returning to <hi>New-England</hi> in 1659, sent for his Family to come over to him; who arriv'd at <hi>Boston,</hi> Lord's Day July 6th 1661, with this their Son, then nine Years of Age.</p>
            <p>Upon his going up to <hi>Newbury</hi> then the Place of his Father's Residence, he was sent to School to the Revd. and Excellent Mr. PARKER<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under whom He made a laudable Proficiency till the Commencement in <hi>Aug.</hi> 166<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, when He was admitted into HARVARD COLLEGE by the very learned and pious Mr. CHARLES CHAUNCY, who also gave Him his first Degree in 1671, being one of the last Classis which receiv'd Degrees from that famous President.</p>
            <p>In 1674, He took his Degree of Master of Arts from President HOAR; and was early chosen a Tutor and Fellow in that House. But did not reside long there: for on <hi>February</hi> 28. 1675, 6. He was Married to Mrs. HANNAH the sole Daughter and Heir to the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble JOHN HULL, Esq<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Boston,</hi> with whom He had a plentiful Estate: Upon which He setled here, and liv'd and died an honourable Member of the SOUTH CHURCH, of which He had the satisfaction to see one of his own Sons become a worthy Pastor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003344_0041_0FF7E5E7420282D8"/>In 1684, He, was chosen a Magistrate of the <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chusetts</hi> Colony. In the disorderly time of Sir <hi>Edmond</hi>'s Government, toward the end of 1688, He went a Voyage to <hi>England</hi>: Upon his landing there, met the surprizing News of the happy REVOLUTION: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned hither in the following Year. In 1692, He was appointed by King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY</hi> in their Royal CHARTER, one of the first Council for their Majesties in this Province, into which He was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually chosen and sat till 1725, when He resign'd his Election, having out lived all the others nominated in that Fundamental Constitution. In 1692 He was made one of the Judges, and in 1718, Chief Justice of our Superior Courts of Judicature thro' the Province, in which He sat till 1728, when his Infirmities growing on Him, He resigned that Place also. In 1715, He was made Judge of Probates for this County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and continued in that Office till 1728, when He laid it down: it being the last Publick Post wherein He serv'd and honoured his Country.</p>
            <p>For his CHARACTER —I shall sum it up in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome — <hi>That He was universally and greatly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd, esteemed, and beloved among us for his eminent Piety, Learning and Wisdom; his grave and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Aspect and Carriage; his instructive, a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>able and chearful Conversation; his strict Integrity and regard to Justice; his extraordinary tender and compassionate Heart; his neglect of the World; his abundant li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality; his catholick and publick Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his critical Acquaintance with the Latin, Greek and Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, the Latin Poets, and above all the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their inspir'd Originals; his Zeal for the Purity of instituted Worship; his constant, diligent and reverent Attendance on it, both in the Church and Family; his Love for the Churches, People and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, the civil and religious Interests of this Country; his tender Concern for the aboriginal Natives; and as the Crown of all, His Moderation, Peaceableness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Humility; which being all united in the same Person,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003344_0042_0FF7E5EBAE29B020"/>
and in an high Degree and Station, rendered Him one of the most shining Lights and Honours of the Age and Land wherein He lived, and worthy of a very distinguishing regard in the New English Histories.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He liv'd happily with the Wife of his Youth for about Forty three Years, who left him a sorrowful Widower, <hi>October</hi> 19. 1717. He afterwards Married two other virtuous and worthy Consorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Mrs. ABIGAIL TILLY, and Mrs. MARY GIBBS who is now his Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Widow. He had Issue only by the first; by whom He had seven Sons and seven Daughters: two of the former and one of the latter only Survive Him. His Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding continued with Him to his last Hours: He Died in Peace: And was yesterday honourably Inter'd.</p>
