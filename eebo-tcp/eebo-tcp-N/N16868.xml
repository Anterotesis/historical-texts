            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>PSALM LXXXII. VERSE I.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>GOD</hi> ſtandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty: He judgeth among the <hi>GODS.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS paſſage of inſpired ſcripture may well poſſeſs the minds of this numerous and reſpectable audience, with reverence and a ſacred awe, before him, who is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of his ſaints; and who will be ſantified in all them that come nigh him: It is particularly adapted to arreſt the moſt ſerious attention of our honoured Rulers; at whoſe invitation we are aſſembled in the Houſe of God on this auſpicious anniverſary, —to ſupplicate the Divine Preſence with them, and his ſmiles and bleſſing upon the ſpecial buſineſs of the day; and their adminiſtration of government the enſuing year; and to enquire of him from his word, agreeable to the laudable practice of our pious Progenitors, from the firſt ſettlement of the country, to the preſent period.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:021713_0006_0FB54BDD670D15E8"/>OUR text has a primary reference to the Rulers of God's ancient covenant people. But as this paſſage of ſcripture is of no private interpretation, it will as ſitly apply to our civil fathers now before God, as to the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrim</hi> of old.</p>
            <p>THE words before us, will naturally lead us—'To make ſome brief and general obſervations on government.'—The propriety and uſefulneſs of an <hi>aſſembly,</hi> for conducting the important affairs of it.—The ſublime characters rulers ſuſtain.—The Supreme Ruler preſent with them, as an obſerver, and judge; ready for their aſſiſtance and ſupport, when acting up to their character; and carefully noticing whenever they loſe ſight of the great end of their appointment: And the powerful influence, the conſideration of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and inſpection muſt have, to engage them in a conſcientious diſcharge of the duties of their exalted ſtations. May I be indulged your ſerious and candid attention, while I attempt to dilate a little, upon theſe ſeveral particulars; all obviouſly contained in, or eaſily deducible from our text. <hi>GOD ſtandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty: He judgeth among the Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT our text applies to the ſupreme govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a community, and involves the various
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021713_0007_0FB54BE1E140E8B0"/>departments of it, is readily ſeen by looking into the Pſalm before us; where we find this congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the mighty, reproved for the improper uſe of their power, and a different mode of conduct enjoined upon them. "How long will ye judge unjuſtly, and accept the perſons of the wicked? Defend the poor and fatherleſs: Do juſtice to the afflicted and needy: Deliver the poor and needy, rid them out of the hand of the wicked."</p>
            <p>CIVIL government is both a dictate of nature, and revelation; and is accordingly indifferently denominated, <hi>the ordinance of God, and the ordinance of man.</hi> Man was originally formed for ſociety, and furniſhed with faculties adapted thereto: Faculties for the improvement of which ſocial intercourſe is indiſpenſably neceſſary. Some of the moſt important duties, and refined delights of human life are of the ſocial kind.</p>
            <p>IN order to obtain the benefits of ſociety, civil rule is eſſentially requiſite. Thoſe luſts of men, from whence come wars and fightings, are ſo prevalent in this apoſtate world, that they are obliged to form compacts and combinations, for mutual aſſiſtance and ſupport. And there is perhaps no people no earth, however uncultivated and barbarous, but who have adopted ſome kind of civil polity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:021713_0008_0FB54BE386446690"/>THE light and law of nature, which uniformly urges to this mode of procedure, may well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as an expreſſion of the divine will: For God addreſſes the human mind in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and he does it by the voice of reaſon, as well as revelation.</p>
            <p>THE providence of God is particularly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in elevating man to poſt of honour and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and giving them a ſeat among the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mighty. "For promotion cometh nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth: But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and fitteth up another." "By me (ſays wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or that glorious Being who is the wiſdom of God) by me kings reign, and princes decree juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. By me princes rule and nobles, even all the judges of the earth." And in the New-Teſtament, we have the ſame idea held up, in terms equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. "Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers; for there is no power, but of God. The powers that be, are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God." Again, "ſubmit yourſelves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's ſake; whether it be to the King, as ſupreme, or unto Governours,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021713_0009_0FB54BE51EE76C38"/>
as unto them that are ſent by him, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well. For ſo is the will of God."</p>
            <p>THESE declarations apply to civil government in general, which is indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial felicity and ſafety. But they are by no means to be extended to every mode of government that has obtained among mankind: Not certainly to a deſpotic and lawleſs domination. This is not the ordinance of God. Nor indeed any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but ſuch as protects the ſubjects in the peaceable poſſeſſion of their juſt rights, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and priviledges.</p>
            <p>THE particular form of government and mode of adminiſtration, that ſhall obtain among the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nations of the world, heaven has not ſeen fit to preſcribe. This ſeems to be referred to the wiſdom of each community to determine for themſelves. And a great variety has in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, actually taken place; in conſequence of the different genius, ſentiments and ſituation, of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent people, in different ages and climes.</p>
            <p>IN ſome conſtitutions, the ſupreme authority hath been veſted in one man. In others, a few
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021713_0010_0FB54BEBCAE640B0"/>
are ſelected for the purpoſe. Others ſtill have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to many. The particular mode of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that has obtained the preference with the people of this land, directs our attention to the latter of theſe three. And ſo does our text. <hi>The congregation of the mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE ſeems an evident propriety in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the management of the intereſting and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affairs of government, to a number ſelected from the whole.</p>
            <p>POWER is of an intoxicating quality; and for a ſingle individual to be veſted with ſovereign rule, is ſubjecting him to a temptation too ſtrong for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man virtue. A deſire of pre-eminence is a natural paſſion, and when properly reſtrained, may prove highly beneficial to ſociety. But when it has a full free courſe, and attains the ſummit of its wiſh, and feels itſelf without controul; the ſubject of this undue elevation, is apt to be puffed up with pride, to become intolerably ſupercilious and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical; and to trample upon thoſe rights of the community, and individuals, which it is the prime deſign of government to protect.</p>
            <p>WHEREVER the will of a deſpot is the ſupreme law, the great end of government is uſually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021713_0011_0FB54BF0D687FD78"/>
This is ſufficiently atteſted by facts: And it is no other than what might juſtly be expected from the nature of man.</p>
            <p>THERE are, it is true, advantages ariſing from veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the adminiſtration in the hands of one man, or a few; when they are well furniſhed with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and fidelity; advantages from the deciſion and diſpatch, with which affairs of State may be tranſacted; and which in particular emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, may be peculiarly beneficial. But they are ſo counterbalanced by the ills that reſult from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary rule, on the one hand, and the ſafety that ariſes from good advice on the other, that there ſeems a manifeſt propriety that a number ſhould be ſelected for the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>"WHERE no council is (ſays the wiſe Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) the people fall: But in the multitude of councellors there is ſafety." So limited is the human mind in all its perceptions and operations, and ſo diffuſe, difficult, and many times perplexed are human affairs, eſpecially the important ones of government, that they elude the comprehenſion of an individual; and demand the combined wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a number, to conduct them with propriety. In free and judicious debates, there is frequently
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021713_0012_0FB54BF22AEE8250"/>
much light reflected upon intricate ſubjects. What eſcapes the obſervation, or recollection of one, may occur to another; and the minds of all be ripened for a reſult, by means of the light mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflected in their conſultations. Affairs of State, thus carefully canvaſſed, may doubtleſs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with greater propriety, by an aſſembly of the wiſeſt and beſt men in a community, than by a ſingle individual, however improved and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious he might be.</p>
            <p>SUCH further is the immenſe weight of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is too heavy for the ſhoulders of an individual: A congregation of the mighty, will find the burden equal to their united ſtrength. Thoughtleſs and inconſiderate people, may fondly conceive, that the buſineſs of a Ruler is as eaſy as the character is honourable. But thoſe who know the circle of their duty, and the various difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that attend it, are fully ſenſible, that it is an office, laborious, extenſive, and greatly exerciſing to all the powers of the body and mind.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER refers to the public ſafety and happineſs, demands their attention. The good and wholeſome laws, that are in being, are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021713_0013_0FB54BF323B8ED90"/>
to be executed; and proper perſons ſought out to carry them into effect. Laws unexecuted, however good in themſelves, and beneficial in their tendency, anſwer no valuable purpoſe; and may really prove injurious, by lowering the general influence of authority. If men may violate one law without any animadverſion; why not another? There is nothing inſpires the public mind with ſo general a veneration of government, as an undoubted expectation, that every penalty incurred, ſhall be inflicted. New laws are from time to time to be framed, accommodated to the temper, genius and circumſtances of a people, and the exigencies of ſtate: And to be ſo framed that it may not be eaſy to elude their meaning, or evade their force. Juſtice, <hi>diſtributive, penal,</hi> and <hi>commutative,</hi> muſt have a free uninterrupted courſe in a community: This ſeems to be the very corner ſtone of its happy exiſtence. Uſeful literature is to be encouraged, that youth may be trained up in knowledge and virtue, and fitted to ſerve God, and their generation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will. Religion pure and undefiled, before God and the Father, ſo indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſecure the favour and bleſſing of heaven, is particularly to be patronized. They muſt guard with a vigilant eye, againſt the numerous

evils which threaten the body politic, whether from external violence, or internal convulſions; and attend to whatever ſerves to promote public proſperity. The commerce, agriculture, and manufactures of a people ſhould particularly be put under the moſt judicious regulations; to encourage honeſt induſtry, and baniſh idleneſs: The former as beneficial, as the latter is baneful. The one, continually prompting to vice and ſedition; the other engaging to a quiet and peaceable life.</p>
            <p>GREAT and arduous is the labour requiſite for ſo extenſive a ſphere of action as this; ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of which, we have but hinted at. And the difficulties of it are ſometimes greatly enhanced, by the peculiar embarraſſments in which a people are involved. The <hi>cumbrance</hi> of a great community is hard to be borne; but their <hi>ſtrifes</hi> render the burden ſtill more grievous.</p>
            <p>WHEN Jethro, that wiſe Prince, and prieſt of Midian, obſerved Moſes attending this duty from morning to evening, he makes this juſt remark.—"The thing that thou doeſt is not good: Thou wilt ſurely wear away: This thing is too heavy for thee: Thou art not able to perform it thyſelf alone." And the exceſſive labour and fatigue, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021713_0015_0FB54BFDDA4A3598"/>
various vexations of the ſervice, effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Moſes of the propriety of his obſervation. Though he was eminently furniſhed with every qualification requiſite for a good ruler, and ſucceſsful adminiſtration;—ſuch as learning, wiſdom, meekneſs, patience, and the moſt perfect patriotiſm; yet worn down with painful ſervices, and ready to ſink under the burden, we find him pouring out his complaint to God, in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive terms,—"Wherefore haſt thou afflicted thy ſervant? And wherefore have I not found favour in thy ſight, that thou layeſt the burden of all this people upon me? Have I conceived all this people? Have I begotten them, that thou ſhouldſt ſay unto me, —carry them in thy boſom as a nurſing father carrieth the ſucking child.—I am not able to bear all this people alone, becauſe it is too heavy for me."</p>
            <p>UPON this earneſt application to heaven, God was pleaſed to alter their form of government. Moſes is directed to ſelect out of all the people, ſeventy men of their firſt characters: Men known and noted as ſuch, to be joined with him in the adminiſtration. Theſe compoſed the great <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim,</hi> and are <hi>that Congregation of the Mighty,</hi>—thoſe earthly GODS, to whom our text moſt probably hath a primary reference.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:021713_0016_0FB54BFF241F48B0"/>IT is a divinely glorious character they ſuſtain. <hi>The mighty,</hi> and according to the Hebrew dialect; <hi>Gods.</hi> Theſe terms expreſs their dignity, and point out the neceſſity of ſuitable qualifications for the diſcharge of the duties of their ſtation.</p>
            <p>THE dignity of rulers, has by ſome been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, as a ſubject of flattery; and their minds have been immoderately puffed up, by the high ſtrained compliments of fawning ſycophants; till they have conceived themſelves ſomething above human. But they bear the image of God's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and are illuſtrious by the rays of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, for a very different purpoſe:—That they might imitate the juſtice and beneficence of that glorious Being they repreſent; And exerciſe the authority with which they are veſted in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to the great and good ends, for which they are raiſed above their brethren. When the public good engroſſes their attention, and engages their unwearied exertions: When they lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out for the encouragement of whatever is virtuous, commendable and praiſe worthy, and for the ſuppreſſion of every thing of a contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and tendency: When they improve all the powers of their minds, and all the advantages of their preferment to theſe ends:—Then do they
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021713_0017_0FB54C00A1FFB470"/>
act up to their honourable character; they fill with dignity their exalted ſtations, and may be ſitly denominated <hi>Gods,</hi> and workers together with God.</p>
            <p>To be equal to this important character and employ, it is neceſſary that they be perſons of good natural abilities, and acquired accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The former of our bodies and the father of our ſpirits, has been pleaſed to exerciſe, both his "wiſdom and ſovereignty in the different make of men. To ſome he giveth wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding exceeding much; and largeneſs of heart, even as the ſand that is on the ſea ſhore," where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are able to diſcern both time and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are ready for every emergency. The powers of others ſeem formed upon a leſſer ſcale, and evidently point them to a lower line of duty. Education ſerves to keep up the natural diverſity in the human compoſition. The ſituation and circumſtances of ſome, in the courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is peculiarly favourable for improvements in thoſe uſeful ſciences which enlarge and ennoble the mind, and qualify it for extenſive uſefulneſs: While others are neceſſarily deſtitute of thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and conſequent improvements. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021713_0018_0FB54C05A2CED7C8"/>
as with a ſun-beam, points out the former of theſe, as perſons proper to be veſted with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling powers, in preference to the latter. Their qualifications beſpeak it; the public good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it; and the word of God directs to it. "Provide out of all the people <hi>able men,</hi> ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs, and place ſuch over them." <hi>Able men</hi>—men poſſeſſed of wiſdom and knowledge; of ſence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of fortitude and firmneſs; neither enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by debauchery, or effeminated by diſſipations, equal to the cares, fatigues and burden of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and of "attending continually on this very thing." Their religious and moral qualifications are directly ſubjoined, and are equally deſireable, in thoſe who rule over men. <hi>Such as fear God,</hi> are really religious, in principle and practice; <hi>Men of truth,</hi>—of inviolable integrity; who maintain a ſacred regard to their engagements: <hi>Hating covetouſneſs</hi>; not only free from that turbid ſource of corruption; but deteſting the low prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that centers wholly in itſelf.</p>
            <p>SUCH characters collected from a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, for the purpoſe of conducting its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant public concerns, compoſe a truly reſpectable aſſembly: <hi>A Congregation of the Mighty:</hi> God's
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021713_0019_0FB54C0B19B7CD20"/>
vicegerents. They exhibit a ſaint reſemblance and repreſentation of the ſource of all power; and are miniſters of the providential government of the great Supreme.</p>
            <p>OUR text repreſents the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them; and taking cognizance of their conduct. <hi>God ſtandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty: He judgeth among the Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INFIDEL minds, and thoſe who by their conduct, have made it for their intereſt, either that there ſhould be no God, or that he ſhould be regardleſs of their behaviour; have ſometime flatly denied his ſuperintending human affairs. At other times endeavoured to argue themſelves into ſceptiſciſm upon the ſubject. The ancients of Iſrael, in the days of Ezekiel, had the confidence to aſſert, that "The Lord had forſaken the earth." Others of a ſtill more ancient date are repreſented as querying—"Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the ſtars, how high they are—How doth God know? Can he judge through the dark cloud? Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he ſeeth not, and he walketh in the circuit of heaven." Others ſtill have ſaid in their hearts, ſecretly whiſpered to themſelves, when rebuked by their conſciences for their
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021713_0020_0FB54C0E170C9AB0"/>
criminal conduct; not daring to utter aloud the impious thought: "God hath forgotten, he hideth his face; he will never ſee it."</p>
            <p>OUR inward feelings revolt at ſuch blaſphemous ſuggeſtions, and aſſertions. And the word of God throughout, reprobates the ſhocking imagination; and repreſents it, as the fruitful ſource of all the over-flowings of impiety and immorality, which prevail, in the moſt degenerate places and periods of time.</p>
            <p>THE moſt high God, the poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth, is uniformly revealed in his word, as an immenſe, an infinite Being; omnipreſent and omniſcient. His univerſal preſence and inſpection, are neceſſary to the adminiſtration of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential government now; and to a righteous diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments, in the judgment of the great day.</p>
            <p>HE is preſent in the Congregation of the Mighty as an attentive obſerver:—A powerful aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant: A righteous Judge.</p>
            <p>THOUGH he has given the earth to the children of men, and imparted of his authority to his Vice-gerents below; yet he ſtill holds the reins in his own hands, and hath the government on his ſhoulders; and critically obſerves the conduct of thoſe, who by being exalted to rule, are brought eſpecially nigh to himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:021713_0021_0FB54C0EEF5DF618"/>HE beholds with approbation thoſe wiſe and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants who conform to the moral character of the Supreme Ruler, and make his adminiſtration the pattern and ſtandard of theirs. He obſerves their unwearied endeavours to poſſeſs their minds with political wiſdom, that they may fully comprehend the duties of their ſtation; and their uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted fidelity for the diſcharge of them; their careful attention for the removal of every need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs burden, and the redreſs of every real grievance. He ſees their ſolicitude to remove whatever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the free courſe of juſtice; their aſſiduous endeavours, that it may be impartially adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to all of every rank, and in every part of the community. He obſerves the firmneſs and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with which they oppoſe themſelves againſt evil doers, and the workers of iniquity; with what zeal and ardour, they labour for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of vice and immorality, ſo utterly ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, both from its natural tendency, and the righteous judgment of God. He regards their meekneſs, ſelf-denial and patience, their prudence, paternal affection and public ſpirit; and that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy and God-like benevolence which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to the nobleſt exertions for the publick good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:021713_0022_0FB54C1072CCC2C0"/>HE particularly notices the ſerious reference they cultivate to his all ſeeing eye; and the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual influence this has upon the temper of their hearts, as well as the diſcharge of the duties of their exalted ſtations.</p>
            <p>A LIVELY ſenſe of an ever preſent God, muſt powerfully arreſt every mind that is the ſubject of it; and beget that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wiſdom: Which is ſo eſſential and important a branch of religion, as to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubſtituted for the whole of it. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant principle is indiſpenſably neceſſary, for every man, who wiſhes to approve himſelf to God. It is the greateſt ornament to a chriſtian Ruler; and of the happieſt influence to the uniform diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of every incumbent duty. Whenever it exiſts and exerts itſelf, Heaven regards it with approbation. It renders the ſervices and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of all who poſſeſs it acceptable, and well pleaſing in his ſight. The Congregation of the Mighty thus qualified, diſpoſed and employed; will ſecure and enjoy the approbation of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Ruler.</p>
            <p>BUT the great God not only takes notice of all their exertions for the honour of his name, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021713_0023_0FB54C11DFDB9038"/>
the good of ſociety; but is preſent with them for their aſſiſtance and ſupport.</p>
            <p>CIVIL Rulers are honoured as miniſters and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his providential government; and they are favoured with his providential preſence, that the ordinance of Heaven in this reſpect, might not be rendered void; but that they may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh that which the Supreme Ruler pleaſes; and proſper in the ſtation which he has aſſigned them.</p>
            <p>WHEN God has ſuch a favour for his people, as to afford their Rulers his gracious preſence; his right hand and the light of his countenance will do great things for them, and cauſe all things to go well with them.</p>
            <p>ARE they involved in darkneſs or embarraſſed with difficulties? The fountain of light, will illuminate their minds, and irradiate their paths, and make their duty plain before them.</p>
            <p>ARE they beſet with threatning dangers? He that is with them, is more, and mightier, than all that are againſt them; and can eaſily deliver from the ſtrivings of the people within; and external violence from abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:021713_0024_0FB54C1BA07EAE08"/>THE preſence of the Supreme Ruler, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the mighty, as a fun and a ſhield for their direction and defence, is at all times deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and upon ſome emergencies of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Such difficulties may perplex their minds, and embarraſs their paths, as that they may really <hi>not know what to do.</hi> But the Father of light, if graciouſly preſent with them, can eaſily point out to them, the path of duty and ſafety. He has an immediate acceſs to the human mind, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire command of it. As the rivers of water, he turneth it which way ſoever it pleaſeth him. He can ſuggeſt ſuch a train of thought, and mode of conduct, as ſhall lead them out of the labyrinth, ſet their feet upon a rock, and eſtabliſh their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>DOES a ſpirit of ſedition ariſe, and the contagion catch from breaſt to breaſt; do the clouds collect and blacken, the clamor wax louder and louder, and direct its courſe, againſt the conſtitution and guardians of the State: Is it ready to burſt out in contenſion, confuſion, and every evil work? Oh haw deſirable is the gracious preſence and powerful influence of the Supreme Ruler, at ſuch a period, with thoſe who act under him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:021713_0025_0FB54C1D2D27AD58"/>SUCH ſeaſons of danger and diſtreſs are not ideal. They have been realized under every form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; though more frequently perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe of the moſt liberal complexion. It is not the beſt ſyſtem of civil rule; or the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and judicious adminiſtration, that is a certain ſecurity from ſuch evils.</p>
            <p>UNDER the <hi>Jewiſh theocracy,</hi> where God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf condeſcended to be their King; enacted their laws, civil as well as ſacred; reſided among them, exhibiting continually, a viſible appearance of his preſence; conducting the affairs both of Church and State, by the miniſtry of Moſes;—of whoſe appointment to office by Heaven, his qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it, and fidelity in it, they had the moſt undeniable proofs. Yet under all theſe advantages for a quiet adminiſtration, and obligations to a due ſubmiſſion; Korah and company, had the addreſs to effect a moſt dangerous inſurrection. They firſt attach to their intereſt, a number of leading characters; then raiſe their <hi>poſſe,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their charge.</p>
            <p>BUT what charge could hold, againſt ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a Ruler as Moſes? Whom has he defrauded, or oppreſſed? Not a ſingle individual. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021713_0026_0FB54C1EC1A1D8C0"/>
before the heart-ſearching God, he had not. "Reſpect them not (ſays he, in his ſolemn addreſs to the Diety) I have not taken one aſs from them, neither have I hurt one of them."</p>
            <p>WHAT is the terrible grievance, or pretended grievance, that enables theſe ſons of ſedition, to raiſe the whole Congregation againſt Moſes and Aaron? It is pride and imperiouſneſs. Strange that this of all things, ſhould be the charge, when we are aſſured, from ſacred record, that "the man Moſes, was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth." But what of that? The charge takes, and that anſwers the purpoſe. "Ye take too much upon you, (they complain) ſeeing all the Congregation are holy, every one of them: Wherefore then lift ye up yourſelves above the Congregation of the Lord?</p>
            <p>THIS daring rebellion was ſeverely rebuked by the righteous Governour of the World. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it, and leaders in it, were partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by fire from the Lord: And for the reſt, the earth opened her mouth, and they went down quick into the pit.</p>
            <p>BUT ſuch a malignant effect had this inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the minds of the people, that even this
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021713_0027_0FB54C2397DCFE58"/>
awful interpoſition of the great God of Heaven, was not ſufficient to quell it. The very next day there is a freſh riſing, and a new charge exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Moſes and Aaron are impeached with killing the people of the Lord.</p>
            <p>GRACIOUS Heaven! Is it poſſible, that when thoſe ſinners againſt their own ſouls, were cut off by the hand of God, in the open view of thouſands and ten thouſand witneſſes; and by his creating a new thing too; cauſing "the earth to open and ſwallow them up, with all that appertained to them," that the whole Congregation ſhould directly charge Moſes and Aaron, with the murder of thoſe pious good people?</p>
            <p>THIS was too much for infinite patience to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. "Get ye up from this congregation (ſays the Lord to Moſes, proſtrate before him as an humble ſervent interceſſor for them) that I may conſume them in a moment." And though Moſes and Aaron ſtood in the gap, and at length turned away the anger of God: Yet it was not till fourteen thouſand ſeven hundred, were made monuments of the divine diſpleaſure; beſides them that died about the matter of Korah.</p>
            <p>THESE things happened to Iſrael of old for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamples; and they are written for our admonition
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021713_0028_0FB54C2A2124CD60"/>
on whom the ends of the world are come, and they admit of a profitable improvement. We do not indeed in the preſent age expect miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous interpoſitions; yet when God is graciouſly preſent with his ſervants, he does ſometimes by a ſurprizing coincidence of events, work out their ſalvation: So that "whoever is wiſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them, may underſtand the loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord." To proceed with our ſubject.</p>
            <p>THE great Governor of the world, is not only preſent with thoſe in authority, as an obſerver of all the good they do for his people; and to afford every aſſiſtance and ſupport, as circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:—But as a righteous judge, who critically obſerves the deportment of the whole, and of each individual, and takes cognizance whenever they loſe ſight of the great end of their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>He judgeth among the Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT all-piercing eye which pervades the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and penetrates every diſguiſe, ſees who conſtitute the Congregation of the Mighty. He perfectly knows the various views they have; and the different improvement they make of their talents and opportunities. They are raiſed above their brethren; not that they may ſhine in affluence, and fare ſumptuouſly every day;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021713_0029_0FB54C2B60411098"/>
much leſs, that they may indulge to inglorious eaſe and ſloth; and leaſt of all, that they ſhould pervert judgment, and juſtice; but that having a more extended circle of duty, they may be more extenſively uſeful. If however there are any who neglect the buſineſs of their ſtation, who permit their talents to lie by them uſeleſs, as though folded up in a napkin, if content with the honors or profits of preferment, they leave the duties to be performed by others: He who ſtands in the midſt of their aſſembly obſerves it. If through their delinquency, "judgment is turned away backward, and juſtice ſtandeth afar off: If truth falleth in the ſtreet, and equity cannot enter," the Lord ſees it. "If they forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and thoſe that are ready to periſh; if they ſay, behold we knew it not: Doth not He that pondereth the heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it? and He that keepeth their ſoul, doth He not know it? and ſhall He not render to every man according to his works?"</p>
            <p>WHATEVER pleas any may ſubſtitute for the neglect of their duty, every omiſſion is noticed by the righteous Judge; and noted down in the book of his remembrance. The abuſe of their truſt, expoſes them to the juſt reſentments
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021713_0030_0FB54C2CE7B2C7E0"/>
of thoſe, who have conſided their intereſts to their care; and to the preſent rebukes of that God who judgeth in the earth. But whether they fall under the effects of theſe now, or not—a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere reckoning and an awful doom awaits them at the great day: "Caſt ye the <hi>unprofitable</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant into outer darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth."</p>
            <p>AND if mere indolence and inattention to duty, be thus reſented by the Supreme Ruler; thoſe who are chargeable with direct and poſitive breaches of their truſt, will not eſcape his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If they judge unjuſtly, and accept the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the wicked: If miſchief be framed by a law, in effect and conſtructively, however covertly done, and men are turned aſide from their right—He who is higher than the higheſt regardeth ſuch violent perverſion of judgment and juſtice. When this is the caſe, "all the foundations of the earth or land, are out of courſe," as it is expreſſed in our context: For when juſtice is preverted, what good can be expected? "The omniſcient God ſees, and ſhall he not avenge ſuch injuſtice as this? Hear that declaration of our bleſſed Lord, which will apply to the point, and deſerves the ſerious attention of thoſe who abuſe their truſt;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:021713_0031_0FB54C3627CFBA08"/>
"But if that evil ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming; and ſhall begin to finite his fellow-ſervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the Lord of that ſervant ſhall come, in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites."</p>
            <p>AND now will not the conſideration of the divine preſence in the aſſembly of political rulers, moſt powerfully engage them to a conſcientious diſcharge of the duties of their exalted ſtation? If their minds are poſſeſſed with a lively ſenſe of his immediate inſpection; they will, they muſt attend to the important affairs that come before them, with great ſolemnity of ſpirit.—Every matter that is ſuggeſted, or ſubmitted to their conſideration, will be impartially examined; and nothing ſuffered to paſs merely upon the account of its plauſible appearance. In every debate the enquiry will be, not what meaſure will moſt contribute to my popularity; to ſecure my preſent ſtation; or advance me to an higher? Nor, what will be moſt for my perſonal intereſt, or the advantage of thoſe with whom I am particularly connected? But what is fit, and right in itſelf; and in the view of my moſt calm and retired
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021713_0032_0FB54C37618C5548"/>
thoughts, diveſted as much as poſſible of paſſion and prejudice? What will ſtand the awful trial of the Supreme Governour, and meet his final approbation?</p>
            <p>A LIVELY ſenſe of an ever preſent God, habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally impreſſed upon the mind, will happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the general temper and conduct; and it will prove peculiarly beneficial in preſſing public emergencies: It will raiſe above that fear of man which bringeth a ſnare; and leſſen, if not utterly deſtroy the force of temptation, from whatever quarter it originates. It will make them ſtedfaſt, immovable, abounding in the work of the Lord. It will expand the human heart, and inſpire with a laudable ambition, to ſecure his ſacred ſanction. In ſhort it will form a principle of action, which viewed in its proper connexion and extent, is one of the nobleſt and beſt that can poſſeſs the Ruler's breaſt.</p>
            <p>THERE are it is true, other principles that have their uſe, and are often improved by Providence to produce good effects: Such as a benevolent diſpoſition:—A quick ſenſe of honor:—ambition of being diſtinguiſhed as of conſequence in the State; and the like. But the influence of all theſe lower principles, is very uncertain, eſpecially in times of great trial and temptation. If preſent
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:021713_0033_0FB54C3934C477F8"/>
intereſt, and preſent duty interfere, as they ſome times may; what is there but a ſerious reference to the inviſible God, that will enable the ruler to hold faſt his integrity? This indeed will engage him to go through honor and diſhonor, good report, and evil report; reſolutely to ſurmount, or charge through every difficulty and oppoſition that he meets with in the line of duty. The teſtimony of his own conſcience affords him a conſtant ſupport, a continual feaſt. "The work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace; and the effect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſurance forever."</p>
            <p>FAITHFUL Rulers, acting uniformly under the influence of this moſt excellent principle, have the faireſt proſpect of ſecuring the acceptance and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their fellow-citizens; and thereby of protracting the period, and enlarging the ſphere of their uſefulneſs. But whatever returns are made them, by an ungrateful world or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe generation; God is not unrighteous to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their work and labour of love. That peace of his which paſſeth all underſtanding, ſhall poſſeſs their hearts, and prove their ſupport under every preſent preſſure. And in the neareſt views of diſſolution, the teſtimony of their conſciences, that they have walked before God, with a perfect
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021713_0034_0FB54C3EEC687050"/>
heart, and have done that which was right in his ſight, will inſpire a hope ſure and ſtedfaſt. And great ſhall be their reward in Heaven.</p>
            <p>WILL not the ſubject, thus conſidered, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lead us to reflect, with the moſt pleaſing ſenſations, and ſincereſt gratitude to Heaven, upon our own happy conſtitution of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Emancipated from Britiſh domination, freed from that exorbitant claim to a right to bind us in all caſes whatever; which like a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid vortex threatned to ſwallow up all that was dear and ſacred in our view; and to reduce us to a ſtate of abſolute ſervility: Freed from theſe evils, we have had the ſingular privilege of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eſtabliſhing a frame of government for ourſelves: And, to render it the more perfect, of availing ourſelves of the examples and maxims of the ſacred writings, as well as the wiſdom of all preceding ages. The thought that it is <hi>our own</hi> is a pleaſing recommendation. The treaſure and the blood we have been obliged to expend in order to its acquiſition, muſt enhance its value. But eſpecially the broad baſis it lays for equal liberty, civil and religious; the ſecurity it gives to all our rights as men, and chriſtians; the favourable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it has upon our peace and proſperity in this
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021713_0035_0FB54C40613E21C0"/>
life; and the advantages it affords of ſecuring a good foundation againſt the time to come; all conſpire to raiſe our eſteem even to veneration. Strangers are not permitted to rule over us. "Our nobles are of ourſelves: And our Governour proceeds from the midſt of us." Our beſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, it is our privilege and our duty to ſelect, out of all the people, and from every part of the Commonwealth, to conduct our intereſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: And, not by will or caprice, but fixed fundamental rules, which they are under the oath of God to maintain ſacred and inviolable. And if experience ſhould convince us that amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or alterations, are eligible, or neceſſary; a conſtitutional mode is pointed out, in which they may be effected, without expoſing us to thoſe inteſtine jarrs and convulſions, which uſually attend alterations, and eſpecially revolutions in other States. Happy, thrice happy people, have we but wiſdom to know, and virtue to improve, ſo excellent a ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>WHAT thanks ſhould we render to God moſt high, to God who performeth all things for us, for the favourable diſpoſitions of his providence, which opened the way for, and has enabled us to ſecure ſo excellent a conſtitution! Our preſent ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation is by no means the reſult of chance. The
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021713_0036_0FB54C4219C7D2B0"/>
revolution that introduced it was replete with brilliant events; ſuch as engaged the attention and admiration of diſtant nations; and will ſhine with diſtinguiſhed luſtre in the faithful page of hiſtory. The hand of Heaven has been conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, in raiſing up eminent characters for council and war, in uniting ſo extenſive a territory in a common cauſe; in giving us favour in the eyes of foreign powers, and influencing them to afford us eſſential aid; and eſpecially in a variety of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous interpoſitions of his providence, in periods of greateſt perplexity, darkneſs and danger. How did the Supreme Ruler ride forth upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens for our help; and in his Excellency upon the ſkies! How often did he make bare his arm on our behalf, and exert the ſaving ſtrength of his own right hand, till we obtained the completion of our wiſhes; peace with eſtabliſhed independence; upon terms too, as honorable to America, as they were humiliating to Britain.</p>
            <p>To hint at theſe intereſting events, will not be deemed improper at this time, as it ſerves to touch the ſecret ſprings of gratitude, and draw forth our whole ſouls in love to him, to whom we are ſo infinitely indebted. And at the ſame time, may remind our civil Fathers of the confidence the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:021713_0037_0FB54C48F790EE08"/>
community repoſe in them, by committing the Supreme powers of the conſtitution, both Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Executive, to their care: And the ſacred obligations they lay themſelves under by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truſt.</p>
            <p>HIS Excellency will conſider his renewed call to the firſt ſeat of government in this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, by the voice of the people, as a decided proof of their continued attachment to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and grateful acceptance of his paſt ſervices: And the confidence they ſtill repoſe in his abilities and diſpoſition for future exertions in their favour.</p>
            <p>HIS Honour the Lieutenant-Governour elect: The Honourable the Senate, and the Honourable Houſe of Repreſentatives, advanced to their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective important ſtations by the ſuffrages of their fellow-citizens, have now an happy opportunity of improving the large ſhare of public confidence they poſſeſs, in contributing to the peace, order and felicity of the whole community. To this great end, they will direct their united attention and exertions.</p>
            <p>IN filling up the vacancies in the Legislature, and furniſhing out a Council, for the Supreme
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021713_0038_0FB54C4BDCF29560"/>
Executive, their eyes will be upon the faithful in the land, upon men of known and tried abilities.</p>
            <p>IN all the buſineſs that comes before our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Rulers, they will keep in view the public good, as the great end of their appointment to office. By a ſtrict conformity to the principles of the conſtitution, they will if poſſible, cut off all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for murmuring and complaint: And where any really exiſts, effectually and expeditiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it.</p>
            <p>THEY will keep a vigilant eye upon thoſe reſtleſs ſpirits, who either from an averſion to the neceſſary reſtraints of government, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content at their own ſituation, or embarraſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their perſonal intereſt, through their own folly, extravagance or unſucceſsful ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, are continually plotting miſchief, excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fears and jealouſies of honeſt people, inſinuating that their liberties and privileges, are invaded, or in danger, &amp;c. Such men are the peſts of ſociety: They ſhould be narrowly obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whenever their factious diſpoſition diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers itſelf by overt acts, ſeaſonably and ſeverely animadverted upon; that others may avoid their crimes as they would their fate. Inattention to evils of this kind in their riſe is dangerous, and may prove fatal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:021713_0039_0FB54C4D1F01F530"/>To contribute to public happineſs our civil Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will give every encouragement to induſtry, ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary to bring forward to our aid, the numerous reſources with which our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is bleſſed. By good laws and proper encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agements, they will endeavour to improve our agriculture, fiſheries, commerce, arts and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures. Theſe extenſive fields will furniſh out full, and profitable employ for all parts of the community. And induſtry in the improvement of theſe advantages, attended with proper econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, would enable us to emerge from our embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments, diſcharge our debts, feel our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and appear to advantage upon the great Theatre of the world.</p>
            <p>To anſwer the great end of their appointment, our Rulers will patronize learning and the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arts. They will encourage our Schools and Academics, and eſpecially our Univerſity, ſo illuſtrious for the renowned characters it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced: And to which the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth will ſtill direct her eye for "ſtrong rods for the ſceptre of them that bare rule;" to her own ſons nurtured in that feat of learning, will ſhe look for prophets, and to her young men for Nazarites, to take her by the hand, and lead her in the way ſhe ought to go.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:021713_0040_0FB54C54C4AC0F68"/>
THEY will moreover endeavour the impartial diſtribution of juſtice and judgment. "The God of Iſrael ſaid, the rock of Iſrael ſpoke: He that ruleth over men, muſt be juſt." Would they approve themſelves to the Supreme Ruler or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the prime deſign of government; they muſt conſcientiouſly attend to this cardinal virtue. All their acts and laws muſt be founded upon this ſure baſis. And all their promiſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, held ſacred and inviolable.</p>
            <p>THEIR promiſes, their plighted faith for the payment of the public debt, does in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner ſolicit their moſt ſerious attention. The creditors of the public, attached to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of their country, in the moſt critical juncture, chearfully ſteped forward, and expoſed both their perſons, and their fortunes, to the moſt threatning dangers, on her behalf. While ſome jeoparded their lives in the high places of the field, and endured all the fatigues of a ſevere and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued war; through various perils, many times in cold and nakedneſs, hunger and thirſt, yea "in deaths oft." Others riſqued their intereſt at the earneſt call of their country, in the ſupport of the common cauſe, relying upon the public faith. Have they forfeited their right to their intereſts,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:021713_0041_0FB54C561F55A6F8"/>
either from loan, or ſervices performed? Britain perhaps, had her arms been ſucceſsful, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine they had; for their treaſonable attempts againſt her authority. And thoſe among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who have been uniformly inimical to the American cauſe, may be pleaſed with the cruel mortification to which they ſee them ſubjected. But is there an individual friendly to the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and poſſeſſed of the moſt moderate ſhare of judgment and integrity, who does not view them as highly meritorious?</p>
            <p>THE decided part they took in favour of their much injured country, and in periods too of its utmoſt perplexity and danger, is greatly to their honor. They aſſerted her rights and ſupported her cauſe, not by a mere profuſion and flouriſh of words; but by actions, which admitted of no duplicity of ſenſe or meaning. They riſqued their dear-earned intereſt, and their ſtill dearer lives for the freedom of their country. Heaven di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and aſſiſted the noble exertions, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the arduous attempt with glorious ſucceſs. Had they not a right to expect, that government would honor themſelves, by paying a ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their engagements? Did not found po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, juſtice, honor, gratitude and every inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous principle which actuates the human mind,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021713_0042_0FB54C57DBD03188"/>
urge to this? Can ſpecious promiſes, under the names of certificates, indents, facilities, due-bills, &amp;c. couched in the faireſt terms, while covering the groſſeſt deception, be conſidered as a honorable diſcharge of the public engagements? Is this claſſ of citizens, to look and expect till their eyes and hearts fail them with waiting? Have not many already been as effectually ruined by their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the public faith, as if their ſubſtance had been conſumed by the flames? Have not many, urged by ſad neceſſity, been obliged to part with their public ſecurities, for a very tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ing conſideration? And muſt not more directly ſhare their ſevere fate, unleſs the juſtice of government interpoſe? Some appear averſe to this interpoſition, becauſe it muſt now come too late with reſpect to many. But if through the delinquency or delay of the public, many of her faithful and tried friends, who have rendered her the moſt eſſential ſervice, are ruined; is this a good reaſon why they ſhould make thorough work, and diſpatch the whole body of them?</p>
            <p>"To turn away a man from his right, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him in his cauſe, the Lord approveth not," in any caſe whatever. But are there not in the caſe before us ſome circumſtances, which give a peculiar colouring to the injuſtice done, to a part at leaſt, of the public creditors, by with-holding their due?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:021713_0043_0FB54C591FCE49C8"/>WHEN David while in the ſtrong hold, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,—"O that one would give me water to drink out of the well of Bethlehem; and three of the thirty chief, break through the hoſt of the Philiſtines, and drew it, and brought it to him; he would not drink of it. My God forbid it me, that I ſhould do this thing (ſays he.) Shall I drink the blood of theſe men, that have put their lives in jeopardy? For with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it." In this view of the caſe, and as far as it will fairly apply to our army, —is there an individual, who would with-hold from them their due; and deprive them of that bread they have acquired a righteous claim to, at the peril of their lives? Again.</p>
            <p>THE aged and helpleſs, and particularly widows and orphans, may be viewed as another claſs of public creditors. Theſe, incapable of vindicating their rights, have a ſpecial claim to the patronage and protection of authority. Injuſtice offered to theſe, and eſpecially to the latter, is ever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as greatly aggravated. And ſome of the moſt pointed threatnings in the whole book of God, are directly levelled againſt this ſin. Says the Supreme Ruler of the univerſe, —Ye ſhall not afflict any widow, or fatherleſs child. If thou afflict them in any wiſe, and they cry at all unto me;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021713_0044_0FB54C626309ECC8"/>
I will ſurely hear their cry, and my wrath ſhall wax hot, and I will kill you with the ſword, and your wives ſhall be widows, and your children fatherleſs."</p>
            <p>THERE is other property, of which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity have availed themſelves in the late conteſt, the with-holding of which, and eſpecially the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of it, from its original deſign, is perhaps carrying injuſtice to its higheſt pitch. I mean that which has been devoted to God: Conſecrated to charitable uſes: The pious donations to our Univerſity: The funds for the benefit of Churches, and other ſocieties: The proviſion made in one place and another, for the relief of the aged and neceſſitous, the widow and orphan. What is an invaſion of this kind of property, but down-right <hi>ſacrilege</hi>? A crime that ſcarce admits of excuſe or extenuation. "If one man ſin againſt another, the Judges ſhall judge him: But if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall plead for him?"</p>
            <p>SHALL theſe claims upon the public be ſtill ſuſpended to give ſcope for ſpeculation? Shall they be vacated, or in any degree mutilated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diſcharge of them is not to be effected, without laying a burden upon the community? And this when we are aſſured, they are entirely
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021713_0045_0FB54C63BB5F66E0"/>
competent to the annual diſcharge of the intereſt, and lowering the principal, with a tax no heavier in proportion to the preſent number, than was commonly paid before the war? Would ſuch pleas avail between man and man? Would they with good men and true, in a Court of Juſtice? Should an individual endeavour to get rid of his debts by ſuch means, would it not conſign his character to perpetual infamy? Can any plead for it then in a community; eſpecially when the example it exhibits is ſo deteſtable in itſelf, and ſo deſtructive in its tendency, and abominable in the eyes of a righteous God, who declares, "I hate robbery for burnt ſacrifice."</p>
            <p>PERMIT me only to add here, Our honoured Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers among all their other exertions for the good of the Commonwealth, will pay a particular attention to the intereſt of Religion. Is it their governing aim to approve themſelves to God? They muſt perſonally think of, and practiſe, the graces and virtues of the Chriſtian character, without which it is not poſſible to pleaſe God. If they have the intereſt of religion at heart, they will give it their determined ſupport: Not by inſtituting articles of faith, or forms of worſhip, or in any manner infringing the rights of conſcience; but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:021713_0046_0FB54C6522DCF128"/>
none to places of power and truſt, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of good moral characters; by countenancing and encouraging the miniſters of religion; by a faithful execution of the laws for the ſuppreſſion of profaneneſs, immorality and impiety; and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by an exemplary attendance upon public worſhip, and goſpel inſtitutions. Examples, and particularly of thoſe in higher life, have a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing victorious force; and by them good Rulers may eminently ſubſerve the intereſts of piety and virtue.</p>
            <p>"GODLINESS is profitable to all things; having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come." It inſures the favour and bleſſing of heaven. It contributes to public happiness, by engaging all orders of men to an upright diſcharge of their ſeveral duties. Rulers poſſeſſed of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles, will approve themſelves "Miniſters of God for good," to their people. And ſubjects under ſimilar influences, will yield due obedience; not merely for wrath, or through fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but from a far nobler principle,—"for conſcience ſake." Religion in this view is ſo far from being a vain thing, <hi>that it is our life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe articles, and indeed to the whole circle of the duties of their elevated ſtations, our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:021713_0047_0FB54C669F458228"/>
civil Fathers will view themſelves as under ſacred obligations to attend. It is fit and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in itſelf, that you do ſo. Heaven requires it of you; and the public good, in which your own private happineſs, and that of your deareſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections is involved, demands it. But there is no conſideration can have a more commanding force, than that which our text holds up to view. May you all feel its fulleſt effect. <hi>God ſtandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty.</hi> The Supreme Ruler, before whom the moſt exalted intelligences of the upper world, proſtrate with veiled faces, is preſent with you. He knows you all by name. Your principles, your views and the inmoſt receſſes of your ſouls, are all naked and open to his inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He is at hand for your aſſiſtance. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly implore it, he will graciouſly afford it. And if you have it, and improve it; we may hope for clear evidence, from your happy and ſucceſsful adminiſtration, that <hi>He is with you of a truth.</hi>—<hi>He judgeth among the Gods.</hi> He carefully notices your conduct, with a view to a righteous retribution. "Though you are called Gods, yet you muſt die like men;" and like your brethren of the duſt appear before his dread tribunal, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of your preſent civil diſtinctions. Actuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this ſolemn thought; conducting with a

ſerious reference to the broad eye of heaven, and the recompence of reward; you will have the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proſpect of acquitting yourſelves with honour, of being approved of God, and accepted by the multitude of your brethren. Yea, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>How ſolicitouſly concerned does it becomes us all to be; that we avail ourſelves to the utmoſt of our preſent ineſtimable advantages; and eſpecially that we do not forfeit and forego them, by our own folly and perverſeneſs!</p>
            <p>OUR advantages are much every way. The lines are fallen to us in pleaſant places; and we have a goodly heritage. The land we poſſeſs, like the choſen reſidence of God's favourite people of old, is "a land of hills and vallies, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven. The eyes of the Lord our God are always upon it, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year even unto the end of the year." It amply repays the toils of the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous huſbandman; yielding a rich ſupply of the neceſſaries, and moſt ſubſtantial articles of life; and a good ſurpluſage for the purpoſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:021713_0049_0FB54C71EB7215E8"/>
Our fields, the uncultivated wilderneſs, the fiſheries, the trade, and numerous arts and manufactures, offer buſineſs and bread, to every induſtrious individual; buſineſs ſuited to every different genius; and a decent ſupport, and what in other countries would be called luxurious liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>OUR land is a "valley of viſion." We are bleſt with the bright beams of goſpel light and grace, which afford the higheſt advantages, for ſecuring an inheritance in a better, in a heavenly country, when our connections with this are over.</p>
            <p>THE eſtabliſhment of the new federal ſyſtem, ſo favourable to a <hi>firm,</hi> and at the ſame time <hi>free</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; ſo well adapted to brace the nerves of civil authority, through the whole frame; "to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh juſtice, inſure domeſtic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and ſecure the bleſſings of liberty for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and our poſterity:" The conſideration which our firm bond of union will give us among the nations of the earth: The bright and pleaſing proſpect of enjoying the fruits of all our exertions and expence for liberty and independence, under the wiſe councils, and judicious regulations, of thoſe eminent patriots, from the various parts of the

union, which compoſe our national government; and eſpecially under the preſidency of that illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chief, in whom we all concentre our views with an unanimity as deſirable, as it is unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled.</p>
            <p>THESE advantages we now poſſeſs, are great in a ſeparate view; but combined, are they not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and unparralleled, by any part of the whole habitable world? May I not with the utmoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, as well as warmeſt emotions, congratulate our honoured Rulers, this reſpectable audience, and our whole land, upon our preſent promiſing ſituation? More particularly upon the new aera ſo happily, ſo auſpiciouſly commenced. The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil eaſy advance to this new ſtage of political ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; and all the pleaſing ſcenes which provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is opening to our view. Have we not the moſt flattering preſages of realizing all that felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo beautifully pictured out by the ſweet Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt of Iſrael? "That our ſons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner-ſtones, poliſhed after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a palace; that our garners may be full, affording all manner of ſtore; that our ſheep may bring forth thouſands and ten thouſands in our ſtreets; that our oxen may be ſtrong to labour; that there be no breaking in or going out; no

complaining in our ſtreets." Happy is the people that is in ſuch a caſe; yea happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord.</p>
            <p>SAYS an ingenious foreigner with reſpect to theſe United States;—"It is impoſſible not to wiſh ardently, that this people may attain to all the proſperity of which they are capable. They are the <hi>hope</hi> of the world. They may become a <hi>model</hi> to it. They may prove the fact, that men can be free, and yet tranquil. They may exhibit an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>political</hi> liberty, of <hi>religious</hi> liberty, of <hi>commercial</hi> liberty, and of induſtry. The aſylum they open to the oppreſſed of all nations, ſhould conſole the earth. The caſe with which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured may eſcape from oppreſſive governments, will compel Princes to become juſt and cautious. And the reſt of the world will gradually open their eyes upon the empty illuſions with which they have been hitherto cheated by politicians."</p>
            <p>WITH all theſe advantages, greater perhaps than providence has ever committed to any one people "ſince the tranſgreſſion of the firſt pair;" with all our own raiſed expectations, and that of others; ſhould we through our folly and perverſeneſs, miſcarry, alas how contemptible ſhall we appear! How criminal and wretched ſhall we be!</p>

               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:021713_0052_0FB54C7E131452B8"/>AND is there not really danger ſufficient to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the idea? To put us upon our guard, if not to alarm our fears? Virtue is juſtly repreſented, as the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of a republican government. Have we a ſufficiency to animate ours? If the ſpirit be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the form will be of but little worth. Had the people of theſe States, in fact, poſſeſſed thoſe meaſures of public and private virtue, which the conſederation gave them credit for; <hi>that</hi> might have proved a foundation for many generations. Experience has given the moſt unequivocal proofs, that it did not poſſeſſ energy ſufficient for us. And though we promiſe ourſelves much from the National Conſtitution, ſo happily effected, orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized and commenced; yet we may by no means expect to be happy under it, without our own conſent and co-operation too.</p>
            <p>IF we are not prudent and cautious in our elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to important public offices: If we are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the neceſſary reſtraints and expence of good government: If we indulge to mean groundleſs jealouſies and ſuſpicions of thoſe in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and give a looſe rein to the vices too prevalent in the preſent day; and eſpecially if we get beyond the reſtraints of religion, and bid adieu to the fear of God: Have we not every reaſon to expect, that our moſt pleaſing proſpects
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:021713_0053_0FB54C7F6B7AE3D0"/>
will be ſoon cloſed, and ſucceeded by the deepeſt gloom?</p>
            <p>MAY we unite in guarding againſt this danger; and exert ourſelves for the ſupport of order, peace and good government; which is really no other than our own ſupport, and that of our near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and deareſt intereſts. Let us endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive a bleſſing upon the adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by addreſſing ardent prayers, ſupplications, interceſſions and thankſgiving, to the throne of Grace, for all who are in authority. Let us cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate a condeſcending, benevolent, pacific and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit: And eſpecially by repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and a careful practice of the various graces which conſtitute the chriſtian character; let us ſtrive to conciliate the favor of Heaven. This will have the happieſt aſpect upon our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. "If God giveth quietneſs, who then can make trouble? But if he hideth his face, who can behold him, whether it be done againſt a Nation or a man only?"</p>
            <p>To conclude, let us all of every character, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly remember, that the all-ſeeing eye of the Supreme Governor and Righteous Judge of the world, is not confined to the congregation of the Mighty. It runs to and fro through the whole
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021713_0054_0FB54C80E8589530"/>
earth, beholding the evil and the good. It criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally obſerves the temper of our hearts, and the tenor of our lives: how we conduct in our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtations; whether we improve, or neglect, the talents committed to our truſt; whether we make his approbation our governing principle, or live as without God in the world. We have each our ſtation and work aſſigned us by our common Lord; and are under a ſacred injunction to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy till he comes. <hi>Come he moſt certainly will</hi>; and every eye ſhall behold him: And every one receive an irreverſible award from his mouth, according to the deeds done in the body. Let this ſolemn awful thought have its due weight on all our hearts, and it will have the beſt effect. It will make us ſuch manner of perſons as we ought to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs. Thus may we paſs with improvement the varying ſcenes of this mortal life; and finally be admitted to a kingdom that cannot be moved; to a city that hath foundations whoſe maker and builder is GOD.</p>
