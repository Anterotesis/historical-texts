            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN it pleaſed God to manifeſt the glorious Diſpenſation of his bleſſed Son, our Lord and Saviour, in the Fleſh, Apoſtles were called and ſent forth in his ſervice, and numbers believed in his name. Theſe were to receive Power from on high after that the Holy Ghoſt had come upon them, for which they were commaded to wait, and accordingly they were endued with the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>In the early times of Chriſtianity it was found neceſſary for the Apoſtles, Diſciples, and Believers, to meet often together for the conſolation and ſtrengthening one of another, when purſuant to the very nature and deſign of the Goſpel, which brought Peace on Earth, and good will to Men, a Care aroſe for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment and edification of the Church, and their labour was, that all ſhould be of one mind and become as one Family.</p>
            <p>But in ſucceſſion of time the ſimplicity and good purpoſe of ſuch Meetings declined, and a particular ſet of Men, for worldly and carnal ends, aſſumed an authority, exerciſing Lordſhip over the Flock (obſerving the command of our Lord ſo far only as to retain the name of Servants, when nothing was leſs in their view) pomp and power were aſſumed, and they made a diſtinction of themſelves by the aggrandizing name of the Peculiar Heritage of God, and then ſocial Good, and Charity in Mind and Practice was very much loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032162_0007_0FF165C0EAF4B058"/>And as it hath pleaſed the Lord in theſe latter days, to call a People to freedom, and from under that unwarrantable Yoke of Bondage, ſo he hath been pleaſed to raiſe in the Hearts of his Servants that primitive Love and Good will which eminently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed his Diſciples; wherein they have been perſuaded and directed, by his wiſdom and power, to have Meetings eſtabliſhed for like good purpoſes as in the primitive times, therein to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and have overſight, care, and compaſſion one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to endeavour that all may walk humbly, decently and honeſtly, and be of one mind, as becomes the Servants and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of our holy Lord.</p>
            <p>This is called our Diſcipline, in the exerciſe whereof Perſuaſion and gentle Dealing is and ought to be our practice; and when any, after all our Chriſtian endeavours cannot be reclaimed, the extent of our judgment is Cenſure, or diſowning ſuch to be of our religious Communion. And as this authority and Practice is Chriſtian, ſo it is laudable and reaſonable in Society; for the good and reputation of the whole Body ought to claim our greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, ſubordinately including that of every Member. Hence ariſes a care and concern for Decency and comely order in all our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Worſhip and Diſcipline, as well as honeſty, plainneſs and orderly walking in all the Members of our religious Society, that others ſeeing our good works may be induced to glorify our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is the Author of them, and thereby be brought into that Faith which works by Love to the purifying of the Heart.</p>
            <p>And for the worſhip of God, and the more regular and eaſy proceeding in the ſervice and diſcipline of the Church, Meetings have been by Divine aſſiſtance, as above hinted, ſet up and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, ſerviceable and ſubordinate to each other, as particular
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032162_0008_0FF165C2CA312568"/>
Meetings for worſhip, one or more of which conſtitute a Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Meeting. Monthly, which moſtly take in ſeveral particular or Preparative Meetings, who are to meet together once a month. Quarterly, including ſo many monthly Meetings as may under right direction moſt uſefully meet together once every three months. And Yearly, which is compoſed of ſo many Quarterly Meetings as may moſt conveniently attend the ſame; each of which have their reſpective Powers and Service for the well ordering of Society, and advancement of Truth and Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And whereas it hath been experienced, that in theſe Meetings great comfort, ſupport, and ſatisfaction have been received and enjoyed, when the members have attended them in awe, humility, and love, with no other views but the ſervice of God, and the help and aſſiſtance one of another, all friends who are, or would be, accounted members of thoſe Meetings, are, in brotherly love exhorted, that they come together in uprightneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, ſuitable to our calling, and the dignity of that power, which, as we rightly and meekly ſo demean ourſelves, will preſide and govern in all our Meetings; and there we ought to wait for the ſpirit of Meekneſs and Charity, which is the eſſential adorning which God will beautify and cloath his true Church with, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none can be truly Members thereof, nor really ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able therein. This will diveſt of Partiality, ſtiffneſs in opinion, and high thoughts of ourſelves, or of our own ſtrength and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and raiſe in us Patience and condeſcenſion, according to that excellent admonition of our Bleſſed Lord, who knows the ſecrets of all Hearts, <q>But he that is greateſt among you ſhall be your Servant.</q> Matt. XXIII. 11.22.26. 1719</p>

            <p>On deliberate conſideration it is recommended, in all applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of perſons to be received into Memberſhip, that Monthly Meetings be deep and weighty in their deliberations and reſult; and when a Monthly Meeting becomes ſatisfied, and united in believing that a Perſon applying to be received as a member of our Society, is convinced of our religious principles, manifeſting a good degree of ſubjection to the Divine principle in his or her heart, and a circumſpect Life and conduct, may in their freedom receive ſuch with propriety, without reſpect to nation or colour. 1796.</p>

            <p>The Children of Iſrael, the People whom God choſe out of all the Families of the Earth to place his Name among, and to make himſelf known unto, were ſtrictly commanded, not only to abſtain from the Idolatrous Practices of the Nations, in the midſt of whom they dwelt, but were enjoined to be <q>Circumſpect in all Things that the Lord commanded," and even to "make no mention of the Names of other Gods, neither to let it be heard out of their Mouth.</q> Exod. XXIII. 13.—This Injunction was not relative to any Legal or Typical Rites, external Ceremonies, or Inſtitutions of the Law peculiar to the Jewiſh Nation, but was a perpetual Command and ſtanding Ordinance, reſpecting the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the one Almighty Being, the ſame Yeſterday, to Day, and forever, and as ſuch ought to be regarded by us, and by all the Generations of thoſe, who, with the Heart believe, as well as with the Tongue confeſs, <q>That the Lord he is God, and that there is none elſe beſides him."

from all that would diſhonour the Name of God, either in Word or Deed, our antient Friends were conſcientiouſly concerned to refrain from the uſe of thoſe Names of Months and Days, which had been aſcribed by way of Honour to the Idols of the Heathen, and in conformity to their falſe Worſhips; this Concern reſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, from a firm Perſuaſion, that the Glorious Goſpel Day and Time was come, wherein the Lord was fulfilling his Covenant with Iſrael, viz. <q>I will take away the Names of Baalim <note n="*" place="bottom">This word <hi>Baalim,</hi> being the Plural Number of Baal, ſignifying Lord, has relation to the Names of divers Idols of the Heathen, worſhipped in ſeveral Places.</note> out of his Mouth, and they ſhall no more be remembered by their Name.</q> Hoſ. II. 17.</p>
            <p>And that you may the more clearly diſcern the importance of that Chriſtian Teſtimony borne by our Predeceſſors in this Caſe, we recommend what follows to your ſerious conſideration. viz.</p>
            <p>A brief Account of the Origin of the Names of ſome Months of the Year, and of all the Days of the Week, now cuſtomarily and commonly uſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. January was ſo called from Janus, an antient King of Italy,<note place="margin">Months.</note> whom heatheniſh ſuperſtition had deified, to whom a Temple was built, and this Month dedicated.</p>
            <p n="2">2nd. February was ſo called from Februa, a word denoting <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> by Sacrifices; it being uſual in this Month for the Prieſts of the Heathen God Pau to offer Sacrifices, and perform certain Rites, conducing as was ſuppoſed, to the cleanſing or purgation of the People.</p>
            <p n="3">3rd. March was ſo denominated from Mars, feigned to be the God of War, whom Romulus, Founder of the Roman Empire, pretended to be his Father.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. April is generally ſuppoſed to derive its Name from the Greek appellation of Venus, an imaginary Goddeſs, worſhipped by the Romans.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. May is ſaid to have been ſo called from Maia the Mother of Mercury, another of their pretended ethnic Deities, to whom in this Month they paid their Devotions.</p>
            <p n="6">6th. June is ſaid to take its Name from Juno, one of the ſuppoſed Goddeſſes of the Heathen.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:032162_0042_0FF16622D1EDB8C0"/>7th. July, ſo called from Julius Caeſar, one of the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, who gave his Name to this Month, which before was called Quintilis or the Fifth.</p>
            <p n="8">8th. Auguſt, ſo named in Honour of Auguſtus Caeſar another of the Roman Emperors—This Month was before called Sextilis or the Sixth.<note n="*" place="bottom">Macrob Saturn. Lib. I. Chap. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The other Four Months, namely, September, October, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, and December, ſtill retain their numerical Latin Names, which according to the late regulation of the Calender will for the future be improperly applied. However, from the continued uſe of them hitherto, as well as from the Practice of the Jews before the Babyloniſh Captivity <note n="†" place="bottom">See the Scriptures to the Time of Ezra.</note> it ſeemeth highly probable, that the method of diſtinguiſhing the Months by their Numerical Order only, was the moſt antient, as it is the moſt plain, ſimple, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal.</p>
            <p>As the Idolatrous Romans thus gave Names to ſeveral of the Months, in honour of their pretended Deities; ſo the like Idolatry prevailing among our Saxon Anceſtors, induced them to call the Days of the Week by the Name of the Idol which on that Day they peculiarly worſhiped—hence.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Days.</note>The Firſt Day of the Week they called Sunday, from their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomary adoration of the Sun on that Day.</p>
            <p>The Second Day of the Week they called Monday, from their uſual Cuſtom of Worſhipping the Moon on that Day.</p>
            <p>The Third Day of the Week they named Tueſday, in honour of one of their Idols called Tuiſco.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Day of the Week was called Wedneſday, from the Appellation of Woden, another of their Idols.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Day of the Week was called Thurſday, from the Name of an Idol called Thor, to whom they paid their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on that Day.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Day of the Week was termed Friday, from the Name of Friga, an imaginary Goddeſs, by them worſhipped.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Day they ſtiled Saturday, as is ſuppoſed from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, or Seater, by them then worſhipped.<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Verſtegan and Sheringham.</note>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>In the Ages of Popiſh Superſtition, not only the uſe of ſuch Heatheniſh Names and Cuſtoms were indulged, but alſo other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and unſcriptural Practices in Religion were invented and introduced. For when the Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion became National, Multitudes of Heatheniſh Prieſts, whoſe Intereſt lay in the performance of Rites, Ceremonies, and Sacrifices, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced prevailing Chriſtianity with ſelfiſh Views, and laboured early, with too much ſucceſs, to find employment for themſelves, by impoſing on the People a new ſet of Ceremonies and Sacrifices, bearing ſome reſemblance to thoſe, which in their former ſtate of Heatheniſm they had been accuſtomed to: From this corrupt Source ſprang the Popiſh Sacrifice of the Maſs, the Celebration of which, at particular Times, and on particular occaſions gave riſe to the Vulgar Names of Michaelmas, Martinmas, Chriſtmas, and the like.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that theſe Appellations and Names of Days, Months and Times are of an Idolatrous or Superſtitious Original, contrary to the Divine Command, the Practice of good and holy Men in former Ages, and repugnant to the Chriſtian Teſtimony borne by our faithful Friends and Predeceſſors in the Truth, for the ſake of which they patiently endured many Revilings; let neither the reproach of Singularity, nor the ſpecious Reaſonings of ſuch as would evade the Croſs of Chriſt, turn you aſide from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel, nor diſcourage you from keeping to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Truth, in denominating the Months and Days according to the plain and Scriptural way of Expreſſion, thereby following the example of our worthy Elders, and coming up in a noble and honourable Teſtimony againſt theſe, and all other remains of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superſtition.

            <p>Ever ſince we were a People we have had a Teſtimony againſt mere Formality, and human Injunctions in Matters of Religion and the Worſhip of God, and being taught by the Precepts of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Teſtimonies of his Apoſtles, and our own

Experience, that the Worſhip and Prayers which God will accept, can only be performed by the immediate aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit; we are conſcientiouſly concerned to maintain our Religious Diſſent from formal and ceremonious Injunctions; by which ſet Forms and Times are appointed in Man's Will for Divine Worſhip; for though the Jews in the firſt Covenant had many Faſts and Feaſts and holy Days, yet even in that Time, when the obſervation of Faſts and appointed Days was enjoined, the Lord by the Prophet declared, <q>He was weary to bear their appointed Feaſts, that their ſolemn Meeting was Iniquity.</q> Iſaiah. I. 10 to 15. Becauſe for want of a proper Diſpoſition to ſeek and ſerve him; their Hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained polluted. <q>Ye ſhall not Faſt as Ye do this Day to make your Voice to be heard on high, is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen, a Day for a Man to afflict his Soul? Is it to bow down his head as a Bullruſh, and to ſpread Sackcloth and Aſhes under him? Will thou call this a Faſt and an acceptable Day to the Lord? Is not this the Faſt that I have choſen, to looſe the Bands of Wickedneſs, to undo the heavy Burthens, and to let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed go free, and that ye break every Yoke? Is it not to deal thy Bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the Poor that are caſt out, to thine Houſe; when thou ſeeſt the Naked that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thyſelf from thine own Fleſh; then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer, thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay here I am.</q> Iſa. LVIII. 4 to 9. From which it appears, that even when Public Faſts were obſerved by Divine appointment, yet the Lord declared his diſapprobation of them, when the Obſervers thereof did not manifeſt their ſincerity by ſuitable Fruits of Repentance and amendment of Life. But we dare not comply with Injunctions of that kind, as the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in which thoſe outward Obſervations were enjoined, has long ſince Ceaſed. Chriſt, our Holy Head and High Prieſt, who is the ſubſtance of that which was pointed to, and hoped for, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins his Followers the obſervance of a Daily, univerſal Faſt; a Faſt from every thing which has not a tendency to purify and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Soul, and render it more and more fit to become the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Holy Ghoſt. He poſitively requires of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Followers, <q>That they deny themſelves, take up their Croſs and follow him" Matt. XVI. 24. And "that they Watch and Pray always, that they may be accounted worthy to

That in the Primitive Churches they ſaw an end of theſe Shadows of things to come, and were brought to him, the ſubſtance, in whom all Figures and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows do end, is manifeſted by the repeated expreſſions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paul. <q>For Chriſt is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth" Rom. X. 4.—"But now hath he obtained a more excellent Miniſtry, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes." Heb. VIII. 6. But now after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the Weak and Beggarly Elements, whereunto ye deſire again to be in bondage. Ye obſerve Days, and Months, and Times, and Years; I am afraid of You, leſt I have beſtowed upon You labour in vain." Gall. IV. 9 to 11. "One Man eſteemeth one Day above another, another eſteemeth every Day alike: He that regardeth the Day regardeth it unto the Lord, and he that regardeth not the Day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. Let us not therefore Judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a Stumbling Block or an occaſion to fall, in his Brothers way." Rom. XIV. 5, 6, &amp; 13. "Let no Man therefore Judge you in Meat or Drink, or in reſpect of an holy Day, or of the New Moon, or of the Sabbath Days, which are a ſhadow of things to come, but the Body is of Chriſt.</q> Coll. II. 16.17.

            <p>It appearing, by the Reports brought up to this Meeting,<note place="margin">Attendance of week day Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> that there is a neglect and deviation in ſome, from that ancient and honourable practice of Meeting together on Week Days for the worſhip of him that lives forever, it would be a matter of comfort that there might be a general amendment in this reſpect: Thoſe who have been preſerved in faithfulneſs therein, having livingly to teſtify from that experience which cannot deceive, that it hath been very profitable, and knowing the benefit of ſuch a Practice, their regard for thoſe Providentially placed under their Care ſo prevails, that they cannot be eaſy without encouraging and putting forward their Children, Apprentices and Servants to this religious Duty, as well as other behaviour ſuitable thereunto.

            <p>IT appearing to have been the concern of this Meeting from time to time revived with increaſing weight, to teſtify their uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſunity with the importation and purchaſing of Negroes and other Slaves, and to direct the Overſeers of the ſeveral Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to adviſe and deal with ſuch as engage therein; and it hath likewiſe been the continued care of many weighty Friends, to preſs thoſe that bear our name to guard as much as poſſible againſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any reſpect concerned in promoting the bondage of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy people; yet as we have with ſorrow to obſerve that their number is of late increaſed amongſt us, we have thought proper to make our advice and judgment more public, that none may plead Ignorance of our Principles therein, and alſo again earneſtly exhort all, to avoid in any manner encouraging that practice, of making Slaves of our fellow creatures.—For if we continually bear in mind the Royal Law of doing to others as we would be done by, we ſhall never bereave our fellow Creatures of that valuable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Liberty, nor endure to grow Rich by their bondage; to live in eaſe and plenty by the toil of thoſe whom violence and cruelty have put in our power, is neither conſiſtent with Chriſtianity or common juſtice, and we have good reaſon to believe draws down the diſpleaſure of Heaven; it being a melancholy but true reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that where Slave keeping prevails, pure Religion and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty decline, as it evidently tends to harden the heart,<note place="margin">Evil effects of Slave keeping.</note> and render the Soul leſs ſuſceptible of that holy ſpirit of Love, Meekneſs and Charity which form the peculiar characteriſtic of a true Chriſtian. How then can we who have been concerned to publiſh the Goſpel of univerſal Love and Peace amongſt mankind, be ſo inconſiſtent with ourſelves, as to purchaſe ſuch who are Priſoners of War, and thereby encourage this antichriſtian practice; and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as many of thoſe poor Creatures are ſtolen away, Parents from Children, and Children from Parents; and others who were in good circumſtances in their native Country, inhumanly torn from

what they eſteemed a happy ſituation, and compelled to toil in a ſtate of ſlavery, too often extremely cruel.—What dreadful ſcenes of Murder and cruelty thoſe barbarous Ravages muſt occaſion in the country of thoſe unhappy People, are too obvious, Remember our bleſſed Saviour's poſitive command to do unto others as we would have them do unto us; and that with what meaſure we mete it ſhould be meaſured to us again. And we entreat all to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether the purchaſing of a Negro, either born here or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, doth not contribute to a further importation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the upholding all the evils above mentioned, and to the promotion of Man ſtealing, the only theft, which by the Moſaic Law was puniſhed with death. <q>He that ſtealeth a Man and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him, or if he be found in his hands, he ſhall ſurely be put to death.</q> Exod.

How can we be ſaid to love our Brethren, who bring, or for ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ends keep them in Bondage?—Do we act conſiſtent with this noble principle, who lay ſuch heavy Burthens on our fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?

Or do we not thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that temporal Intereſt hath more influence on our conduct herein than the dictates of that merciful, holy, and unerring Guide?</p>
            <p>And we likewiſe earneſtly recommend to all who have ſlaves, to be careful to come up in the performance of their duty towards them, and to be particularly watchful over their own Hearts, it being by ſorrowful experience remarkable, that cuſtom, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with evil of any kind, hath a tendency to bias the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deprave the mind; and it is obvious, that the future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of thoſe poor Slaves who are now in bondage, is generally too much diſregarded by thoſe who keep them; if their daily taſk of labour is but fulfilled, little elſe perhaps is thought of; Yea, even that which in others would be looked upon with horror and Deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

            <p>And Dear Friends, you who by Inheritance have Slaves born in your Families, we beſeech you to conſider them as Souls committed to your truſt, whom the Lord will require at your hands, and who, as well as you, are made partakers of the Spirit of Grace, and called to be Heirs of Salvation; and let it be your conſtant care to watch over them for good, inſtructing them in the fear of God, and the knowledge of the Goſpel of Chriſt, that they may anſwer the end of their Creation, and God be glorified and honoured by them, as well as by us; and ſo train them up, that if you ſhould come to behold their unhappy ſituation in the ſame light that many worthy men, who are at reſt, have done, and many of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren now do, and ſhould think it your duty to ſet them free, they may be the more capable to make a proper uſe of their liberty.</p>
            <p>Finally Brethren, we intreat you in the Bowels of Goſpel Love, ſeriouſly to weigh the cauſe of detaining them in Bondage; if it be for your own private gain, it is much to be feared that the love of God, and the influence of the holy ſpirit is not the prevailing Principle in you, and that your Hearts are not ſufficiently redeemed from the World, which that you with ourſelves may more and more come to Witneſs, through the cleanſing virtue of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt, is our earneſt deſire. 1754.</p>

                        <head>Some Obſervations relating to the Eſtabliſhment of Schools.</head>
                        <p>It is the opinion of the Committee, that Friends having united with others, in employing ſuch Perſons for Maſters, who have not ſubmitted to the operation of Truth, hath had a tendency to ſtrengthen a diſpoſition in our Youth to avoid the Croſs, and unite with the ſpirit of the World; whereby many hurtful and corrupt things have gained ground amongſt us.</p>
                        <p>On reviewing the Minutes of the Yearly Meeting, we find, that at ſeveral Meetings, particularly at and ſince the Year 1750, the conſideration of the importance of training up our Youth in uſeful Learning, under the tuition of religious, prudent Perſons, ſuitably qualified for that ſervice, came weightily before the Meeting; when it was recommended, that Friends ſhould exert themſelves therein as fully as their circumſtances would permit; and that the likelieſt means to induce Perſons properly qualified, to undertake the buſineſs would be, to have ſome certain income fixed, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of which the Maſter ſhould be obliged to teach ſo many Children, on behalf of each Monthly or Particular Meeting, as the ſaid Meeting ſhall judge adequate to the Salary; and that no Maſter ſhould be employed, but with the approbation of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Monthly Meeting, appointed for that and other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, relating to ſuch Schools: But we find that notwithſtanding thoſe preſſing recommendations, very little has been effectually done therein. We therefore think it neceſſary that it be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Quarterly, and from thence to the Monthly and Preparative Meetings, that the former advice of collecting a Fund, for the eſtabliſhment and ſupport of Schools, under the care of a ſtanding Committee appointed by the ſeveral Monthly or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Meetings, ſhould generally take place, and that it be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Yearly Meeting, to Friends of each Quarter, to ſend up the next Year an account of what they have done therein. And we alſo think it neceſſary, that this weighty concern ſhould in future become the continued care of the Yearly Meeting, by an Annual Query; that ſo the matter may reſt on a ſolid foundation, and every poſſible encouragement and aſſiſtance may be afforded to
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:032162_0116_0FF166EFDBD70F58"/>
Friends, in the ſettlement of Schools, procuring Maſters &amp;c. &amp;c. through the whole extent of the Yearly Meeting. And, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome difficulties may appear in the raiſing a ſufficiency, fully to anſwer the end propoſed, yet as improvements of this kind have often ariſen from ſmall beginnings, it is deſired, that Friends be not diſcouraged, by their inability, but having faith in the divine bleſſing, being conferred on their benevolent intentions, would begin, by making ſome proviſion, agreeable to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their reſpective Meetings. That within the compaſs of each Meeting, where the ſettlement of a ſchool is neceſſary, a lot of Ground be provided, ſufficient for a Garden, Orchard, Graſs for a Cow, &amp;c. And that a ſuitable Houſe, Stable &amp;c. be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereon. There are but few Meetings but which may, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in materials or money, raiſe ſo much as would anſwer this charge. Such a proviſion would be an encouragement for a ſtaid Perſon with a family, who will be likely to remain a conſiderable time, perhaps, his whole life, in the ſervice, to engage therein. This will obviate the neceſſity Friends often think themſelves under, of hiring no other but a ſingle perſon, for a Maſter, on account of boarding him, from one Houſe to another, amongſt themſelves; hence they are induced to bargain with tranſient Perſons, often of doubtful characters; ſome of whom have proved to be Men of corrupt minds; and even where their conduct is moral, yet they are ſeldom likely to remain in the ſervice any longer than ſome employ more agreeable to ſupport themſelves offers: Whereby the Teachers miſs of opportunity of improvement, which nothing will give, equal to that experience gained by long practice, in the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or the Youth. A ſervice, which, however it may be ſlighted by many, if duly performed, is as arduous to the Teacher, as it is of advantage to the Youth: And which if it was undertaken by pious minded Perſons, more from an inclination of benefiting the Youth, than from a deſire of gain, would afford a ſatisfaction far exceeding that of ſpending their time either in ſupineneſs and eaſe, delighting themſelves in the enjoyment of their Wealth, or in the pleaſure of amaſſing more. For indeed as the Apoſtle obſerves I. Cor. VI. 20. II. Cor. V. 15. <q>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price—that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them.</q> And here a ſorrowful conſideration occurs, which we
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:032162_0117_0FF166F2D4F08110"/>
deſire to mention with caution and tenderneſs, that is the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs ſo apparent amongſt us to contribute that part of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which the circumſtance of things and the neceſſities of the People, have on different occaſions made neceſſary; if this had not been the caſe, a matter of ſo great importance as the virtuous edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Youth, would not have lain neglected, for ſo long a courſe of Years; after ſuch preſſing advices had been, ſo expreſſly, handed down from the Yearly Meeting: Hence ariſes a query, how far our neglect of applying to the neceſſary ſervice of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-men, ſuch part of the goods many have laid up in ſtore, is one of the cauſes of the deep affliction which now ſo feelingly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and how ſmall a part of what has been forcibly taken from many, if it had been ſeaſonably, and cheerfully contributed, would have anſwered the ſeveral good purpoſes, which have either been refuſed, or neglected by us.</p>
                        <p>The giving proper encouragement to ſuch Teachers as are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by example and precept, to promote the growth of piety and virtue; as well as due inſtruction in our Youth, and are likely to continue in the ſervice, would be attended with further advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as well from the experience the Teachers would neceſſarily gain, as the opportunity they would have of training up lame Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſuch, who in other reſpects, may be incapable of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting themſelves by labour, to be educated and qualified to ſerve as School Maſters; a conſideration well worthy our particular Care, as well from duty as intereſt. The benefit of the Youth, and the means of a comfortable living for the Maſter, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by the conveniency which might be made, for boarding ſome children, under his care, whoſe diſtant ſituation might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe impede their inſtruction.</p>
                        <p>And if to what has been propoſed, Friends were willing to add the promoting a ſubſcription, towards a Fund, the increaſe of which might be employed in paying the Maſter's Salary, if neceſſary, and promoting the education of the poorer Friend's children; ſuch a Fund though it might be but ſmall in the beginning, being a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed object, would draw the attention of Friends to contribute, whereas ſo long as there is no beginning made, this weighty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is neglected, by many, who would be glad of giving encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſo neceſſary and good a work. And although many may not be able to give much, yet as they are willing to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
