            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great Creator, and Former of all Things, was pleaſed at firſt to diſtinguiſh his Goodneſs to Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other Creatures upon Earth, in making and forming a Soul with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, endowed with ſuch noble Powers and Faculties as gave him a Rank among Beings but little lower than that of Angels; in giving him Dominion over the Creatures of the lower World, and crowning him with Glory and Honour; and that more eſpecially by giving him that Knowledge, Rectitude, and Purity of Nature, by which he came to be in the Image and after the Likeneſs of GOD himſelf.—Moreover GOD planted a Garden, and placed him in it, where he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain himſelf in the moſt delightful Manner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galing every Senſe with the moſt delicious Fruits of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004111_0004_1003B5AF4FCBCED8"/>
divine Bounty, and entertaining his Soul with the moſt pleaſing Contemplations upon the wonderful Works of GOD, and the ſweeteſt Intercourſe and Communion with him. And to crown all there was a Tree of Life, of which, if he had maintained his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, he might have eaten and lived forever.</p>
            <p>But the Devil that ſubtle Serpent, envious of the Happineſs of Man, and deſirous to betray him into the ſame Condemnation and Miſery with himſelf, did, by his cunning and falſe Suggeſtions, draw him into Sin, whereby he at once undid himſelf, defaced the Image and forfeited the Favour of his GOD; was turned out of Paradiſe, debar'd the Tree of Life, and expoſed to Death and Ruin forever.</p>
            <p>And this would have been the inevitable Fate of humane Nature, had not GOD of his infinite Mercy interpoſed for our Salvation and Recovery, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding and ſending One mighty to Save, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon new Terms in a gracious Covenant, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and propounded to us in his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And now altho' the Covenant that GOD has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with Men in the Blood of his own Son, is full of Grace, and every thing in it may be looked upon as meer Grace; yet alaſs! ſuch Corruption, Stupidity, and Madneſs is there in the Hearts of Men, ſince the primitive Apoſtacy, that there is nothing more difficult than to perſwade Men to forſake their Sins, which lead down to the Chambers of Death and Deſtruction, and to comply with the moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and reaſonable Terms of Salvation.</p>
            <p>The Devil (as it ſhould ſeem) found no great Difficulty in ſeducing and perſwading our firſt Parents to ſin: And ſo to deſtroy themſelves at firſt, but now it requires the utmoſt Skill and Wiſdom to perſwade Men to turn from their evil Ways and live. And all of it will be inſufficient unleſs GOD ſets in
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004111_0005_1003D368C9CEE8F8"/>
with his almighty Grace. I ſay unleſs GOD ſets in with his Grace; for although it be the Spirit of GOD that wins and gains a Soul over to himſelf, <hi>working in him both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> yet it is, at leaſt for the moſt Part, by ſetting in, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and co-operating with the outward Means that he has appointed for that End, ſuch as his Word and Ordinances, eſpecially the Miniſtry thereof, by a certain Order of Men, that he has all along employed for that Service. I mean the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, whoſe great Buſineſs it is to ſhew Men the Way to Salvation, and to perſwade them to come into it.</p>
            <p>And although one would think <hi>this</hi> the eaſieſt Thing in Nature, and that the bare propoſing the Thing to rational Creatures would be ſufficient, yet daily Experience ſadly convinces of the contrary, and that there is no Affair that Men are called to be concerned in, that requires greater Skill or Wiſdom in the Management of it; and this is what the wiſe Man intimates to us in my Text, <hi>And be that winneth Souls is Wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that winneth,</hi> or taketh <hi>Souls</hi> with that Skill and Induſtry as a Fowler taketh a Bird, for ſo (as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors obſerve) the Word imports. But although it be the ſame Word, yet here is the difference, both in the Deſign and in the Event of the thing. The Fowler uſes his Art to deceive the innocent Bird, to decoy and draw her into a Snare, when ſhe knows not that it is for her Life: Whereas the winning, or taking Souls, is the uſing an innocent and honeſt Art to undeceive Men, to perſwade a guilty Soul out of the Snare of the Devil, and a State of Sin and Death, into a State of Pardon, and Grace, and eternal Life; and ſo if they are taken or caught, it is not with Guile or to their Hurt, to their Death and Deſtruction, like the Bird, but to Salvation and Happineſs Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004111_0006_1003D36DB19D2C00"/>
a Soul thus taken is <hi>won,</hi> is gained, is ſaved. And now ſays the Preacher he that thus takes, and wins, and gains Souls is <hi>Wiſe.</hi> That is either,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1 ſt. It is a Point of Wiſdom to employ our Time and Strength in winning Souls.</hi> It is a great and noble Deſign to win <hi>Souls,</hi> to gain and ſave precious and immortal <hi>Souls.</hi> There is nothing in which Men can lay out their Time, their Skill, and all their Powers to better Purpoſe, than in winning loſt Souls, reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of the Hands of Satan their grand Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and in bringing them over to Chriſt, and into the Way of Salvation and Happineſs. It is the beſt Work that Men can ſet themſelves about; and conſequently he is a wiſe Man, that diligently, and in good earneſt, lays himſelf out herein. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> If we read the Text as ſome do, <hi>viz. be that is wiſe winneth Souls,</hi> then by being wiſe we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, <hi>being ſpiritually wiſe, or truly religious,</hi> and ſo make the Meaning of it to be, that he that is truly religious winneth Souls. And it is an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Truth that a Man of eminent Piety and Religion, does a great deal towards winning and perſwading others over to the Love and Practice of it. And thus ſome make the latter Part of the Verſe to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with the former; <hi>the Fruit of the Righteous is a Tree of Life:</hi> That is, the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, which the righteous Man produces in his Life and Converſation, is like a Tree of Life to himſelf, as it nouriſhes and preſerves his ſpiritual, and ſecures his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life: And it is a Tree of Life to others, as it greatly contributes to the Support and Nouriſhment of a ſpiritual Life in them, animating and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to the Imitation of them in all the Fruits of Righteouſneſs. <hi>And be that is wiſe winneth Souls,</hi> that is, He that is thus righteous or ſpiritually wiſe, wins upon others and gains them over to the Love and Practice of the ſame things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004111_0007_1003D373696A99A0"/>But then, <hi>3dly. He that winneth Souls is wiſe,</hi> may be underſtood thus; He that winneth Souls ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be wiſe, for he muſt needs be wiſe that can win and gain Souls; it requires a great deal of Wiſdom to do it. They that would win Souls need Wiſdom to know how to deal with them, and there is nothing in which their Wiſdom appears more conſpicuous.</p>
            <p>And here, although I may take Notice of the two foregoing Senſes of the Text as they fall in my Way, yet, I ſhall, upon this Occaſion, more eſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the laſt. Accordingly this is the Doctrine for our preſent Meditation, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>That it requires a great deal of Skill and Wiſdom to win Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the illuſtrating and confirming this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine I ſhall endeavour to ſhew,</p>

               <item>III.<hi>That altho' GOD, by his almighty Spirit, wins Souls, yet that it is every Man's Duty to uſe his Endeavours to win one another over to Chriſt; and that he commits it to ſome as their ſpecial and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Buſineſs, even the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>IV.<hi>Sbew that this is an Affair that requires a great deal of Wiſdom and Skill in the Management of it.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. I am to ſhew <hi>what we are to underſtand by win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Souls;</hi> about which my Text ſpeaks, and which requires ſo much Wiſdom to accompliſh.</p>
            <p>And here I would anſwer in one Word, <hi>That it is an effectual perſwading Men to forſake their Sins, and come over to the Faith, the Love, and the Practice of Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004111_0008_1003D376E5F3F910"/>Man by Sin had gone off from GOD, and gone over to the Side of the Devil and of his own Luſts, to the Love and Truſt, the Worſhip and Service of the Creature, inſtead of the Creator of all Things. And by this we have loſt and deſtroyed ourſelves. So that the winning of a Soul is the perſwading the Man out of this State of Sin and Miſery, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him over to GOD, and Chriſt, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is a prevailing with Men to repent of all their Sins, to renounce their beloved Luſts, to turn to GOD, to believe in Chriſt with all their Hearts, to accept of him as their Prince and Saviour, and to live as his Grace teaches them, even up to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and the Precepts of Chriſtianity, ordering their Converſation as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſay, the winning of Souls is a <hi>perſwading</hi> Men to this, and not forcing them to it contrary to their Wills; it is a preſenting Arguments proper to move and perſwade them to it. As the Bird that is taken (to which the Word refers) is by the Skill and Cunning of the Fowler drawn and allured, and not forced to the Snare; the Bird is not hunted and driven to the Place where it is taken, but goes freely and of its own accord, the skilful Fowler having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand laid the alluring Bait, which the Bird no ſooner diſcovers but haſtens to it. Thus the winning of Souls is by preſenting proper Arguments, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them in a rational Way to come to Chriſt, and ſubmit unto his Goſpel, not deceiving them as the Fowler does the Bird, but rather by undeceiving them, not to deſtroy but to ſave Men.</p>
            <p>And when a Soul is thus effectually perſwaded, then it is won, then it is gained, then it is ſaved from its loſt and periſhing State, and brought into a State of Grace, &amp; Favour, &amp; Life; a ſpiritual Life here, and in the Way to eternal Life hereafter. And oh! hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004111_0009_1003D37A2CFE99B8"/>
forever happy, the Soul that is thus won &amp; taken! Of ſuch an one it may be ſaid, <hi>he was dead but is alive, he was loſt and is found,</hi> Luke 15. 32.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I proceed now to ſhow <hi>that Souls muſt be thuswon, and gained over to Chirſt, and not compelled or forced againſt their Wills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt remember they are Souls we are treati<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of, rational Souls, intellectual Beings, free moral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents; and conſequently their being won ſo as to come over to Chriſt, muſt be a rational and voluntary Act: for there is no ſuch thing as a Soul's being won and gained over to Chriſt but where there is a free and full Conſent of the Will, which is incompatible with Force or Compulſion.</p>
            <p>The Body indeed, or the outward Man, may be forced into the viſible Kingdom of Chriſt; <hi>that</hi> can be forced to be preſent in chriſtian Aſſemblies, and at the publick Worſhip; and ſome, who are not for allowing to others the ſame Liberty they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like Circumſtances think reaſonable for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; have put external Force upon Men in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; but it has been, and I believe it always will be found, to little Purpoſe to uſe any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Force for driving Men into the Kingdom of GOD.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Saviour bids his Servants <hi>go to the high Ways, &amp; to the Hedges, and compel them to come in that his Houſe may he filled,</hi> Luke 14. 23. But what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion can we ſuppoſe Chriſt to mean here but a rational Compulſion, informing the Underſtnding, directing the Judgment, perſwading the Will, and exciting the Affections of the Soul towards Chriſt and his Goſpel? And GOD himſelf is repreſented as drawing Men, and not forcing them to Chriſt. <hi>No Man can come to me</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath ſent me draw him,</hi> John 6.44. And how does he draw us unto Chriſt? Why, <hi>with the Cords</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004111_0010_1003D37BF46D0540"/>
               <hi>of a Man, and with the Bands of Love,</hi> Hoſ. 11.4. With Cords proper to draw <hi>Men,</hi> rational Beings withal. And what are they but Arguments and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives proper to work upon our rational Nature, upon the intellectual and moral Faculties of the humane Soul? <hi>In the Day of GOD's Power they are made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. Although the divine Power is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted upon them, yet it is their own free Act and Deed; they act as freely in their coming over to Chriſt, as in any Action whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The Force of humane Laws, of common Cuſtom, of worldly Proſpects or Fears, compel many Men to the external Profeſſion of Chriſt and his Goſpel, and ſo to a viſible Appearance on the Side of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and they who look only at the outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, may and ought charitably to judge they are won over to Chriſt and his Kingdom; but He whoſe Prerogative it is to <hi>ſearch the Heart and try the Reins of the Children of Men,</hi> knows the contrary.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Chriſt's Kingdom is a ſpiritual Kingdom, that is ſet up in the Souls of Men; and if he don't reign in Men's Hearts, he will by no Means look upon them as won over to him, nor can they be ſaid to be gained or ſaved. And now Chriſt don't force himſelf upon Men whether they will or no He knocks indeed at the Doors of Men's Hearts by his Word, Ordinances, Providences, and by his Spirit; and he calls and waits for Entrance: but he will have Men to open the everlaſting Doors of their Souls in order to his coming in. So that we muſt freely open our Souls unto him, and heartily receive him, and then and not till then, is the Soul won; for as to any external Compulſion, or Motives from any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Views, it ſignifieth nothing; the Soul may, notwithſtanding all ſuch outward Appearance, be on the Devil's ſide, and in a loſt &amp; undone Eſtate.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004111_0011_1003D37E66E3FA78"/>III. <hi>I come new to ſhew, That although GOD by his almighty Grace wins Souls over to Chriſt, yet he makes it every Man's Duty to be uſing Endeavours to win one another over to him; and this he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to ſome as their ſpecial and peculiar Buſineſs,</hi> viz. <hi>the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I muſt briefly ſay theſe things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1ſt. It is GOD by his almighty Spirit and Grace that wins Souls to Chriſt.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>2dly. Notwithſtanding this he expects that we ſhould all be endeavouring to win one another over to Chriſt.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>3dly. He commits this to the Miniſters of the Goſpel as their ſpecial and peculiar Buſineſs.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt. It is GOD, by his almighty Spirit and Grace, that wins Souls over to Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, Whenever any are effectually perſwaded to repent of their Sins, to believe in Chriſt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his Goſpel, it muſt be aſcribed to the Agency and Influence of the divine Spirit. For although the Spirit of GOD don't work forcibly or compulſively, ſo as to offer any Violence to our rational Nature, or to any of our natural Powers and Faculties, yet he works powerfully and effectually upon them, in a Way that we know not how; much leſs can we deſcribe it. <hi>For as the Wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but cannot tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth, ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit,</hi> John 3.8. All we can ſay is, That ſome how or other the Spirit works in and upon our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and wins us over to Chriſt in a Way ſuited to our Nature, and although this Work goes on in ſuch a natural Way that we can't diſcern it to be any thing but a rational Act of our own, yet when we perceive the powerful Effect we may conclude the Spirit of GOD has been at Work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004111_0012_1003D3841C56CA90"/>The Way of the divine Spirit is to convince Men of Sin, to bring their Sins ſo to Remembrance, and to give them ſuch a lively Senſe hereof, as to excite unfeigned Sorrow, and at length to produce a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto Salvation. He opens alſo Men's Eyes, to behold the wondrous Things out of GOD's Law and Goſpel, to ſee the Glory of Chriſt, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miableneſs of Religion, and the Beauty of Holineſs, whereby the Soul is perſwaded to believe in Chriſt, and come into the Love and Practice of Chriſtianity, which is the ſame with the winning of the Soul.</p>
            <p>And now that this Work of Converſion, or winning the Soul to GOD, is by the divine Agency and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, is abundantly evident from the Oracles of GOD, there we find GOD aſſuming it as his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative <hi>to give a new Heart, and to put within us a right Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. And the being Born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which, is the ſame thing, is expreſly ſaid to be <hi>not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Men, but of GOD,</hi> John 1.13. And our coming to Chriſt is expreſly declared to be by the divine Influence, and that it can't be without it; <hi>No Man can come to me except the Father which hath ſent me draw him,</hi> John 6.44. In a Word, although we are <hi>to work out our Salvation with Fear &amp; Trembling, yet it is GOD that works in us both to Will and to Do of his good Pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. And <hi>ſuch as are ſaved, it is by Grace, thro' Faith, and that not of ourſelves, but it is the Gift of GOD,</hi> Eph. 2.8.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly. Notwithſtanding</hi> this, <hi>we ſhould all be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to win one anther over to Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For although it be GOD that converts, and wins the Soul; yet he does it in and by the Uſe of Means. And he makes great uſe of thoſe who are converted, to gain others alſo over to Chriſt: And he makes it the Duty of all, to be doing what they can in this
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004111_0013_1003D388146004C8"/>
Matter, nay the very Principle wrought in the Soul that is <hi>won,</hi> will prompt him unto it. He that is converted muſt endeavour to convert and ſtrengthen his Brethren.</p>
            <p>All thoſe Commandments in the Word of GOD, of inſtructing and counſelling, of exhorting and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing one another, are ſo many Injunctions upon us to be doing what we can to perſwade others o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Chriſt, for they all have a direct Tendency that Way. In a Word, theſe two great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>loving the Lord our GOD with all our Heart,</hi> &amp;c. and of <hi>loving our Neighbour as ourſelves,</hi> plainly oblige this. For how can we expreſs our Concern for the Honour of GOD and Chriſt, ſo much as by endeavouring to gain others over to Chriſt's Kingdom, whereby they may with us glorify our Father which is in Heaven? And how can we ſo fully ſhew our Love to our Neighbour, as by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring all we can to <hi>convert him from the Error of his Ways,</hi> and thereby <hi>to ſave his Soul from Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly. GOD commits this Work of winning Souls to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as their ſpecial and peculiar Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although it be the Duty of every Man, according to his Opportunities and Abilities, to endeavour the Converſion and Salvation of others; yet as it is a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſo difficult, and of ſuch vaſt Importance to Men and ſo apt to be neglected, when it is left indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently to all, that GOD in great Wiſdom and Kindneſs to Men, has provided an Order of Men, that ſhould devote themſelves to this Service; that ſhould ſtudy to acompliſh themſelves for it, and then give themſelves wholly to it. I mean the Miniſters of the Goſpel, for this is the grand Deſign of their Office, to win and gain Souls over to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004111_0014_1003B5B12B8F65D0"/>To them is <hi>committed the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, that they</hi> might in <hi>Chriſt's Name and Stead, intreat and beſeech Men to be reconciled unto GOD,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.18, 20. Their Buſineſs is <hi>to ſhew Men the Way to Salvation,</hi> and perſwade Men to come into it. They are ſent <hi>to open Men's Eyes, to turn them from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD, that they may receive Forgiveneſs of Sins, and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them that are ſanctified,</hi> Acts 26. 18. They are the Souls of Men that are committed to the Care and Charge of Miniſters, and their Buſineſs is, <hi>to watch for Souls as thoſe that muſt give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> to watch all Opportunities to win and gain them, <hi>that ſo they may do it with Joy and not with Grief,</hi> Heb. 13. 17. And we find that their Care muſt be, not only <hi>to ſave their own Souls,</hi> but the <hi>Souls of them that hear them,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.16.</p>
            <p>Moreover that <hi>this</hi> is the grand Buſineſs of Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, may be argued from every Branch in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office, for it has a plain direct Tendency to this. Thus the preaching of the Goſpel, which is a principal Part of the Miniſter's Work, What is this for, but to beget Men, through the Goſpel, unto Chriſt? To open and confirm the great Doctrines of the Goſpel, to explain the great Duties of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and urge a Compliance with them, from the Arguments and Motives which the Goſpel affords; that ſo they might get into Chriſt, and be ſaved from all Condemnation, and might obtain the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Again, what is the Deſign of their baptiſing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, but to ſet Chriſt's Mark upon them, to ſeal them with his Seal, to initiate them into his Church and Covenant, to put them in the Way of his Grace, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004111_0015_1003D38A7A9D2468"/>
ſo in the way of Salvation? For altho' Baptiſm of it ſelf don't ſave, as an outward Ceremony or <hi>putting away of the filth of the Fleſh;</hi> yet it will <hi>where there is the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21.</p>
            <p>Again, What is the Deſign of their adminiſtring the holy Sacrament of the Supper, but that by ſuch a lively Remembrance of Chriſt &amp; of his dying Love, our Souls may be filled with love and thankfulneſs unto him; may be led to Repentance by ſuch an Inſtance of amazing Love and Goodneſs, and may be encouraged to believe in him and obey his Goſpel, that ſo we may partake of the ſaving Benefits of his Death? What is it for, but to encourage &amp; ſtrengthen thoſe holy Souls that have gone over to Chriſt, to nouriſh and refreſh them in Grace, Holineſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, unto eternal Life?</p>
            <p>Finally, What is the deſign of all the faithful Reproofs, the publick and ſolemn Cenſures of the Church diſpenſed by the Miniſters of Chriſt, but to reduce and recover Backſliders &amp; Revolters, to bring back ſtraying and periſhing Souls to Chriſt? For when ſuch Admonitions take place, and anſwer the End, <hi>a Brother is gained,</hi> as our Saviour ſays, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15.</p>
            <p>And now from theſe Hints, and many more that might be given, it is abundantly evident, that the winning or gaining Souls is committed to Miniſters, as their ſpecial and peculiar buſineſs.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the laſt Thing propoſed, which I had chiefly in view, and ſhall in large moſt upon, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="4">IV. <hi>That in winning Souls there requires a great deal of Skill and Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he that winneth Souls is wiſe:</hi> It ſhews him to be a wiſe Man that winneth Souls, for it is a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004111_0016_1003B5B34C5AF2D8"/>
that requires a great deal of Skill and Wiſdom in the Management of it to any Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>What I propoſe here is,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1ſt.<hi>To prove the Point, and make it evident that there is a great deal of Skill and Wiſdom requiſite in winning Souls.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> I am <hi>to prove the Point, and ſhew that there is a great deal of Skill and Wiſdom requiſite in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Truth of <hi>this</hi> will plainly appear only by conſidering, 1ſt. <hi>What it is that the soul is to be won from.</hi> 2 dly. <hi>What it is to be won or gained over to.</hi> And, 3 dly. <hi>What ſubtle and powerful Oppoſers we have to deal with in this Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Let us conſider, <hi>What it is that the Soul is to be won from;</hi> and this will give us ſome View of the Difficulties of it, and ſo of the Wiſdom needful to accomplish it.</p>
            <p>And now, in general, it is a winning Men over from their corrupt Nature, from their beloved Luſts and from thoſe evil Practices that they have been long accuſtomed unto; it is a perſwading Men to change the very Temper of their Minds, and to alter the whole Courſe of Life. The winning a Soul is the perſwading a Man from thoſe Apprehenſions and Inclinations that are natural to him ſince the Fall; it is a perſwading him to renounce and abandon all his ſpiritual, and fleſhly, and worldly Luſts, ſuch as Pride, Malice, Envy, Diſcontent, Unbelief, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Senſuality, and the like, which are natural to the unregenerate Soul, and ſo dear to him, that it ſeems as eaſy to prevail with him to cut off a right Hand, or to pluck out a right Eye, as to part with them. Moreover, he is perſwaded to change his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004111_0017_1003D38C0232B2C8"/>
Courſe of Life, to forſake the Pleaſures of Sin, and the evil Ways that he has been long accuſtomed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; which ſeems as difficult for him to do as for the <hi>Ethiopean to change his Skin, and the Leopard his Spot.</hi> He is perſwaded to break off from the Love and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Practice of any known Sin, to <hi>hate every evil and falſe Way,</hi> and not ſuffer any one <hi>Sin to have the Dominion over him:</hi> He is perſwaded to <hi>depart from his own Iniquity, and to lay aſide every Weight, and the Sin that moſt eaſily beſets him,</hi> And now, let any Man judge, Whether it won't require very high Degrees of Wiſdom and Skill, to perſwade and win Men over to all this.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Let us conſider, <hi>What the Soul is won over to;</hi> which will be a further Proof of the Point.</p>
            <p>And, in general, It is to thoſe Things, that are quite contrary to the carnal and corrupt Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Inclinations of Nature. He that wins a Soul, perſwades the Man that was wont to ſay unto GOD, <hi>Depart from me, for I deſire not the Knowledge of thy Ways</hi> Job 21.14. now to ſay, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none on Earth that I deſire beſides thee,</hi> Pſa. 73. 25. And from anſwering like proud <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his Voice?</hi> Exod. 5.2. He is perſwaded to that gracious Language of Soul, <hi>Whatſoever the Lord my GOD ſhall ſay unto me, that will I do,</hi> Deut 5.27. And from ſaying with reſpect to Religion &amp; religious Duties, <hi>Behold, What a Wearineſs is it? And When will the Sabbath be over? To love GOD's Law, and to rejoice in the Way of his Teſtimonies, as much as in all Riches; to delight in drawing near to GOD, and eſteeming a Day in his Courts better than a Thouſand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, The winning of a Soul, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the Man to a Life of Faith in a crucified Saviour, <hi>Which to the Jews was a ſtumbling Block, and to the Greeks Fooliſhneſs.</hi> And to venture his
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004111_0018_1003D391894FFCC8"/>
Soul, and the eternal Concerns thereof, with Him, as one able to ſave to the uttermoſt. It is a perſwading the Soul to live no more by Sight and Senſe, but by Faith; to be looking, not to Things ſeen, which are temporal, but to Things unſeen, and eternal; all which meets with great Oppoſition from our Pride, Carrnality, and an evil Heart of Unbelief.</p>
            <p>Again, The Soul that is won, is perſwaded <hi>to deny himſelf, to take up his Croſs, and follow the Lamb whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goes,</hi> Matth. 16.24. and patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the utmoſt Hardſhips and Difficulties, that he may be called unto for the ſake of Chriſt, which carnal ſelf Love, Eaſe, and Sloth, will very much oppoſe.</p>
            <p>Finally, He is perſwaded to thoſe Things, which corrupt Nature does directly riſe up againſt; ſuch as forgiving Injuries, loving Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now, What ſhort of the utmoſt Wiſdom and Skill muſt it be, to perſwade Men to this?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> But then, let us conſider, <hi>What ſubtle and powerful Oppoſers we have to deal with in this Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we don't <hi>wreſtle</hi> againſt corrupt Nature, againſt <hi>Fleſh and Blood only, but againſt Principalities, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Powers, againſt the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World, againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſſes in high Places,</hi> Eph. 6.12. The Devil, that old Serpent, with his Subtilty and Malice, ſtole Man away from GOD at firſt, and he, with all his curſed Legions, is uſing all their Skill and Policy, to prevent our returning to GOD again. And, Oh! the innumerable Wiles, and ſubtle Devices of thoſe ghoſtly Adverſaries, to keep their hold of us, and hinder us from returning to GOD, and to our Happineſs; which Miniſters muſt be aware of, to obviate and anſwer, if they would win and recover Souls out of their Hands. And what a Multitude of Ways, muſt the natural Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004111_0019_1003B5B6E0846AC8"/>
and long Experience of thoſe malicious Spirits have found out, to keep Men under ſtrong Deluſions, and prevent their harkening to the Voice of the Charmer, altho' he charms never ſo wiſely?</p>
            <p>But then, Beſides the ſubtle Inſinuations of Satan, there are the continual Inticements, and earneſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations of Sinners, the bewitching Examples of the Wicked, the aluring Baits of the World, ſuch as the Riches, the Honours, &amp; the Pleaſures of it: The Sophiſtry and Cunning of Infidels, the peculiar Difficulties of ſome Men's Tempers, their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, their Employments, their Education, and their Cuſtoms; which all conſpire to oppoſe and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Men from returning to GOD, and to their Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And now, When we lay all theſe Things together, and at the ſame Time conſider, how corrupt Nature is on the ſame Side, and prejudiced in favour of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Argument or Pretence that Way, that has the leaſt Degree of Plauſibleneſs in it, and we ſhall ſee that it needs even the Skill of Angels, to know how to manage with Men, ſo as to win them over to Chriſt; and conſequently, that the wiſeſt of Men muſt needs be ſometimes poſed and nonplus'd, ſo as not to know what to do with Sinners, or what Methods to take to gain them, and if it was not for the Supply of Wiſdom and Grace, from the Fountain hereof, they would eaſily be outwitted, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched by thoſe ſpiritual Wickedneſſes in high Places.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>I proceed now to give ſome Account of that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and skill, that is neceſſary for the winning souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Wiſdom in general, it conſiſts in propoſing ſome good End, and in projecting; and purſuing the moſt proper Methods for accompliſhing the ſame
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004111_0020_1003D393E846F960"/>
And the higher the End propoſed, and the more difficult to accompliſh it, the more Conſpicuous is the Wiſdom in attaining the End.</p>
            <p>And now, As to the winning Souls, What nobler End can we propoſe? What can we aim at better, than to gain Souls over to Chriſt, to reſcue them out of the Hands of Satan, and deliver them out of the dreadful Bondage they are in to Sin and Death, and bring them into the glorious Liberties of the Sons of GOD? This is the way to bring Glory to GOD and Chriſt, to ſave Souls, precious and immortal Souls, from future everlaſting Wrath &amp; Miſery, &amp; bring them into a State of eternal Life and Happineſs. So that the Skill and Wiſdom here to be deſcribed, is <hi>that</hi> which conſiſts in taking the beſt, and the moſt likely Methods to win Souls.</p>
            <p>And, Here I ſhall hint at ſeveral Points of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which ſeems highly convenient, if not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, for thoſe whoſe Buſineſs it is to win Souls, if they would carry it on to any good Purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>It is highly requiſite that ſuch be well acquainted with the Religion they are to win Souls over to; and well skilled in the Arguments, proper to be made uſe of to perſwade them to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſeems to be the Foundation of all the after Acts of Wiſdom that Men are to exerciſe in this Matter, and without this it is impoſſible to manage the Affair with any Wiſdom. It is highly requiſite in order to our managing any Affair after a proper Manner, that we underſand the Buſineſs we are going about, or, ten to one, we ſhall commit ſome fatal Miſtake.</p>
            <p>So he that undertakes to win Souls, if he be wiſe, and would not miſcarry in his Deſigns, will take Care before hand to underſtand his Buſineſs, that is the Nature and the Importance of it, and what is the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004111_0021_1003D3535760CD60"/>
moſt likely Way to manage it to good Effect. He muſt underſtand the preſent wretched and miſerable State of Souls by reaſon of Sin, muſt be acquainted with the glorious Remedy that is provided for poor periſhing Souls, and what they muſt be brought over to, in order to their being ſaved; and he muſt be furniſhed with thoſe Arguments that are moſt proper to work upon ſuch ſinful ſtupid Souls, moſt likely to awaken them, and to perſwade them out of their wretched State.</p>
            <p>And as thoſe Things are moſt ſurely and clearly revealed in the holy Scriptures, ſo it muſt needs be a point of Wiſdom for every one that is deſigning this Buſineſs, to get well acquainted with them. <hi>They are given by Inſpiration of GOD, and are profitable, for Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs; that the Man of GOD may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto all good Works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. And no Work do they ſo particularly furniſh Men for, as this of winning Souls. They give us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the primitive Apoſtacy of Man, and of the deplorable State that we are brought into by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſon thereof: They reveal Jeſus Chriſt, the glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy provided for a periſhing World; which Things the World would have remained ignorant of to this very Day, if it had not been for thoſe ſacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: They ſhew us the Path of Life: They lead us to Chriſt: They tell us what we muſt believe, and what we muſt do to be ſaved. And they preſent the moſt moving Arguments to win our Souls; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to work upon our Judgments, our Wills, our Affections, our Hopes, our Fears, and upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Power of the Soul. And ſo in ſhort, <hi>they are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith that is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim 3.15. So that it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to a Man's being qualified to win
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004111_0022_1003D39DEFF728D8"/>
Souls, That he be well acquainted with the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; that not barely with the Words of Scripture, &amp; to have the Bible ſo in our Memories as to be able to ſay a great Part of it by Rote, &amp; quote Chapter &amp; Verſe: But ſuch as undertake the Buſineſs of winning Souls, ſhould underſtand the true Senſe &amp; Meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in general; I ſay in general, becauſe it is not to be ſuppoſed, That Miniſters ſhould be able to underſtand every Part of Scripture; for if one of the Apoſtles could ſay, with reſpect to the Epiſtles of another, that there were in them <hi>ſome Things hard to be underſtood,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.16. it will be no Wonder if there ſhould be many Things in their Writings beyond us to underſtand: and it ſhews a Want of Modeſty, as well as Judgment, for any to pretend to a full Underſtanding of every Part of Scripture, or to think it neceſſary that every Part be underſtood by us; it is ſufficient for us, that the neceſſary Points are ſo clearly revealed, as that with diligent Study, comparing one Part of Scripture with another, we may come to the Knowledge of them: And this every Miniſter ſhould labour after.</p>
            <p>And, In order to this, ſome Acquaintance with the Languages that the Scriptures were originally written in, and with the expoſitory Notes of learned Men upon the Scriptures, with eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, and many other Parts of Learning, is very convenient, and needful to a Man's being <hi>an able Miniſter of the new Teſtament, and a workman that need not to be aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, Such as would be well accompliſhed to win Souls, ſhould be able to diſtinguiſh between Truth and Error; between neceſſary and unneceſſary Points; between the weightier and the leſs weighty Matters of the Law and Goſpel; between Fundamentals and Circumſtantials; between the Form and the Power of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:004111_0023_1003D3A136222B58"/>It is neceſſary that ſuch be able to open and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the great Doctrines of the Goſpel againſt Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and for the Conviction of Gain-ſayers; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Duties of Chriſtianity; and furniſhed with proper Arguments to preſs them upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Men, ſilencing their Cavils, anſwering their Objections and Excuſes, removing Stones of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or Rocks of Offence, out of the Way.</p>
            <p>Thus a Man that devotes himſelf to the Service of Chriſt and of Souls, muſt be a <hi>ready Scribe, well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to the Kingdom of GOD,</hi> Matth. 13.32. He muſt be furniſhed with all the Weapons that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel affords, which are not <hi>carnal, but mighty through GOD, for the pulling down of ſtrong Holds, caſting down Imaginations, and every high Thing that exalteth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the Knowledge of GOD, and bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4, 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2 dly. <hi>It is highly proper that ſuch be won over to Chriſt themſelves, who are employed in winning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers over to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be not abſolutely neceſſary, and if we ſhould grant it poſſible for a Man to be the Means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting others by his Miniſtry, and yet he <hi>himſelf be a Caſtaway;</hi> yet as to humane Appearance, and the natural Tendency of Things, there is but little Probability that ſuch an one would do much towards the winning others over to Chriſt, that has never been won over to him himſelf.</p>
            <p>How can that Man urge the great Arguments of the Goſpel with Fervency and Force, that has never been moved by them himſelf? Nay, with what Force can a Man urge and perſwade others to forſake their Sins, and believe in Chriſt, and obey his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when he don't feel the Arguments to have any Effect upon his own Soul?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004111_0024_1003B5B872CA8C58"/>But now, on the other Hand, How will ſuch a Man urge this and the other Duty, when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has felt the Force of thoſe very Arguments that he uſes with others? Who can ſet forth the Excellency and Amiableneſs of Religion, like thoſe who have taſted the Pleaſures of it, and that can teſtify from their own Experience, that <hi>the Ways of Religion are ways of Pleaſantneſs &amp; the Paths thereof Peace?</hi> Who ſo likely to pitch upon the beſt Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men to be religious, as they, who have found by Experience, what have been the moſt forcible upon themſelves?</p>
            <p>And then again, Who ſo likely to be diligent and faithful in purſuing this grand Deſign of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, even that of winning Souls, like thoſe who are won over to the Love and Service of Chriſt, and are filled accordingly with a Zeal for his Honour, and with a compaſſionate Concern for the Souls of Men? And, Oh! With how much greater Pleaſure will ſuch purſue the Buſineſs that will be ſo much to the Glory of Chriſt and the Good of Souls, than one who <hi>careth for none of theſe Things?</hi> In a Word, Who ſo likely to lay themſelves out in this Service, as they who have their very Hearts and Souls enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this Matter? Which is the Caſe of every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that is himſelf thoroughly and effectually won over to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 dly. <hi>There is a great deal of Wiſdom and Skill to be uſed in the direct Application to the Souls of Men, in order to win and gain them over to Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As theſe previous Accompliſhments are very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary, ſo, if we would win Souls, we muſt, in our Miniſtrations and Applications to them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage with particular Skill and Wiſdom. And as there are publick and general, and, upon Occaſion, private and perſonal Applications to be made to the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004111_0025_1003D3A48B2D4078"/>
Souls of Men; ſo in both theſe, Miniſters muſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage with great Prudence, if they would anſwer the End propoſed. Here then,</p>
            <p n="1">1st. <hi>In their publick Miniſtrations, they muſt manage with great Wiſdom, if they would win Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miniſters muſt know how to behave themſelves in the Houſe of GOD, which is the Church of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving GOD. All the Miniſtrations of GOD's Houſe muſt be managed ſo as to have a direct Tendency to this grand End of their Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Thus, As Miniſters are employed to be the Mouth of the People to GOD in the publick Prayers; ſo theſe muſt be carried on in ſuch a Manner as will beſt Anſwer the End of that great Duty of Prayer. They muſt ſo order their Speech and their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in Prayer, as will be moſt likely to command the Attention, excite the Reverence, and raiſe the Devotion of the People. They muſt wiſely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate their Confeſſions to the Sins, their Petitions and Interceſſions to the Wants, their Thankſgivings to the Mercies of the People; and ſhould mention nothing in Prayer but what the Aſſembly that hear may and ought to join with them in.</p>
            <p>And then, as to Preaching, which is a principal Part of the publick Service, there is great Wiſdom requiſite in the managing of it, ſo as that the Word might prove a Savour of Life unto Life unto them that hear it. And now, as in <hi>preaching,</hi> Miniſters are to <hi>Teach, Exhort,</hi> and <hi>Rebuke;</hi> ſo in all theſe the Preacher muſt manage with great Diſcretion.</p>
            <p n="1">1st. <hi>Miniſters muſt</hi> TEACH <hi>the People with Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, In teaching the Doctrines and Duties of the Goſpel, Miniſters muſt take care that they don't miſtake the Doctrines and Commandments of Men, for the Doctrines and Commandments of Men, for the Doctrines and Commandments of GOD our Saviour. And here, although Miniſters may not
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004111_0026_1003D3A6FA73A750"/>
ſhun to declare the whole Counſel of GOD, ſo far as it is made known unto them; yet they muſt diſtinguiſh and inſiſt chiefly upon the moſt neceſſary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Points of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>And, Here I would take the Opportunity to ſay, That as for the <hi>ſublime myſterious Doctrines of the Goſpel,</hi> they ſhould always be treated with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Caution; and in thoſe Articles, if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters would be wiſe, they wont pretend <hi>to be wiſe above what is written.</hi> But the deeper and darker the Point is, the more cloſely muſt they adhere to the written Oracles of GOD; to which <hi>they will do well</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>to take heed, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark Place,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. And, I cannot but think this has been the Fault on all Sides, that they have departed, ſome more and ſome leſs, from the written Word, in their diſcourſing upon, and undertaking to explain the Myſteries of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and each Party has been more fond of ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own particular Terms, and Manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, than to ſit down contented with the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, as the Holy Ghoſt has delivered them unto us; by which Means, inſtead of winning Souls over to Chriſt, they only win them over to a particular Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which very Thing has divided the chriſtian World into innumerable Sects. Whereas, if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and other Chriſtians, had, in all their Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon myſterious Points, laid aſide humane Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and adhered to the Word, as a <hi>Lamp unto their Feet, and a Light their Paths,</hi> Pſal. 119.105. thoſe unhappy Diviſions might have been in a great Meaſure prevented.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eſſence</hi> of GOD, <hi>the Manner of the divine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,</hi> the <hi>Decrees</hi> of GOD, and the <hi>Manner of his Operation upon his Creatures,</hi> eſpecially upon <hi>moral
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004111_0027_1003B5BA63C00DC8"/>
Agents,</hi> are ſome of the <hi>deep Things of GOD, which the Spirit of GOD alone can ſearch out,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10.</p>
            <p>And therefore, The Miniſter that is ſo wiſe as to know himſelf, will have ſuch a modeſt humble Senſe of his own Weakneſs and Ignorance about theſe Things, as to take up contented with the Words of the Holy Ghoſt, believing that they ſet theſe Things in the trueſt and beſt Light, and go ſo far as we are capable of underſtanding, or, as is neceſſary for us to underſtand; and that moſt, if not all, humane At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to explain thoſe Points, have rather darkned than enlightned them; being Words <hi>without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which darken Counſel,</hi> Job. 38.2.</p>
            <p>So, that if the Preacher be wiſe, when he ſpeaks of thoſe Things, he will chuſe rather to ſpeak of them <hi>in the Words which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring ſpiritual Things with ſpiritual;</hi> than in the <hi>Words which Man's Wiſdom teacheth,</hi> agreable to the Apoſtles own Practice, as he tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13.</p>
            <p>But, to proceed, We are told, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.9. that <hi>becauſe the Preacher was wiſe, he ſtill taught the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Knowledge:</hi> Or, as it is in the Margin of ſome Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>the more wiſe the Preacher was, he ſtill taught the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Knowledge.</hi> So that he is the wiſe Preacher that endeavours to be Inſtructive in his preaching. He is the <hi>Paſtor after GOD's own Heart, that feeds the People with Knowledge and Underſtanding,</hi> Jer. 3.15. that don't turn the People off with unintelligible Terms, dark Phraſes, and obſcure Reaſonings; but will, as the Apoſtles ſays they did, <hi>uſe great Plainnſs of Speech,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.12. I don't mean by this, that Men ſhould uſe bald Expreſſions, and homely Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes; but ſuch Expreſſions as will beſt ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the cleareſt Ideas of the Point they are diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, in the moſt agreeable Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:004111_0028_1003D3AF1F1FB278"/>
               <hi>Laſtly</hi> under this Head, The Preacher that is wiſe will endeavour <hi>to make full Proof of h
is Miniſtry.</hi> 2 Tim 4.5. For, as it is when the Word is <hi>mixed with Faith,</hi> that it becomes profitable to the Souls of Men; ſo it is highly proper that the Preacher ſhould preſent them with proper Arguments, as a Foundation for their Faith, even ſuch Proofs as the Nature of the Subject will afford, and ſuch as the People may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve the Force of.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> But then, As Miniſters <hi>are to give Attendance to</hi> EXHORTATION, as well as Doctrine, ſo there is a particular Skill and Wiſdom requiſite in managing <hi>this,</hi> ſo as to win Souls.</p>
            <p>This is that Part of preaching which is directed immediately to the Conſciences of Men, perſwading and urging them to that Faith, and Love, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which will be Salvation unto them. And now here it is requiſite that Miniſters ſhould be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all the Arts of Perſwaſion; and that they be Maſter of all thoſe Arguments that are apt to ſtrike the Minds and Conſciences of Men; and of that Rhetorick too, which will ſtrike the Paſſions; for as the whole Soul is to be won, ſo there ought to be a moving Addreſs to all the Powers and Faculties, to every Paſſion and Affection the Soul.</p>
            <p>The Preacher that was wiſe ſought to find out <hi>acceptable Words,</hi> Eccl. 12.10 <hi>Words of Delight,</hi> as in the Margin: Words that delight and pleaſe the Soul, which wou'd wonderfully allure and attract it. And we all find by Experience, that the Soul is charmed and captivated by the pungent and pathetick Strains of the Preacher, that has wiſely ordered his Speech for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>He therefore, that is wiſe, will ſeek out ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Words; which, by the Way, teaches how far they are from managing this Matter with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004111_0029_1003D3B913CF6170"/>
who, inſtead of ſeeking out acceptable Words, ſeek out no Words at all before-hand, but turn the People off with extemporaneous Diſcourſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently with thoſe Words that come uppermoſt, and thoſe delivered in a confuſed, heſitating, and hobling Manner, which creates an Uneaſineſs rather than Pleaſure in the Hearers, and ſo will be very unlikely to win upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> As Miniſters are to REBUKE, as well as Exhort, in their preaching; ſo it requires as much Wiſdom to manage it properly, and ſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to anſwer the End of winning Souls, as any Part of the Sermon.</p>
            <p>Miniſters are <hi>to cry aloud, &amp; not to ſpare; to ſhew to the Houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>their Tranſgreſſions; and to</hi> Iſrael <hi>their Sins.</hi> But to do this in a Manner that will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Deſign, requires peculiar Skill. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter muſt be faithful, but not too ſevere, in publick Reproofs. So plain, as that every one that is guilty may eaſily apply it to himſelf; and yet not ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as publickly to expoſe Men's Characters, where the Crimes are private. He muſt duly expoſe the Sirs and Vices of the People, ſetting them forth in the cleareſt Colours, repreſenting their evil Nature, and warning them of the fatal Conſequences of Sin: But yet, this muſt be done in a Way that will convince and ſoften, and melt Men down into Repentance, rather than irritate, and ſo harden them in their Sins. It muſt be managed ſo as will beſt ſerve to excite within Men a juſt Senſe and Hatred of their Sins; and at the ſame time, an higher Eſteem and Love for the wiſe Reprover. And, <hi>as an Ear Ring of Gold, and an Ornament of fine Gold; ſo is a wiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver, upon an obedient Ear,</hi> Prov. 25.12. And thus much for the Wiſdom of the Preacher.</p>
            <p>And as for the other Miniſtrations of GOD's Houſe: I muſt but juſt hint at the Wiſdom that is
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004111_0030_1003D3C0964E48F0"/>
requiſite to the Management of <hi>theſe</hi> ſo as will beſt anſwer the gracious Inſtitutions of them.</p>
            <p>Thus, as to the adminiſtring BAPTISM and the LORD'S SUPPER, Miniſters muſt inſtruct in the Nature and Deſign of theſe holy Ordinances; muſt give due Invitation and Encouragement to Perſons to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon them, and at the ſame Time, warning them of the Danger of coming in a prophane, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and unworthy Manner; and they muſt wiſely diſtinguiſh between the clean and the unclean, the fit and the unfit Subjects of theſe Ordinances.</p>
            <p>And then, In the Adminiſtration of theſe Ordinances, Miniſters muſt behave with that Gravity, with that Seriouſneſs, and with that Devotion, as may ſerve to excite and influence the Devotion of others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Deſign of theſe ſacred Inſtitutions will beſt be anſwered. And here, in particular, as the Deſign of the <hi>holy Supper</hi> is to give Men a lively Remembrance of the dying Love of our dear Redeemer, ſo this ſacred Feſtival ſhould be ſo celebrated, and all the Parts of the Inſtitution ſo managed, as may ſerve to excite the moſt lively and affecting Remembrance of Him.</p>
            <p>And then, As to the CENSURES of the Church, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced by the Miniſters of Chriſt, (ſuch as publick Admonitions, Suſpenſions, and Excommunications) I would ſay, that as this Authority was not given <hi>for Deſtruction,</hi> but for <hi>Edification;</hi> ſo Miniſters muſt endeavour to manage it in ſuch a Manner as will be moſt likely to anſwer this End, <hi>viz.</hi> That in ſuch <hi>a Deſtruction of the Fleſh, the Spirit might be ſaved in the Day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor 5.5. Furthermore, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' we muſt be faithful to our ſtraying Brethren, yet we muſt deal and let them ſee that we deal tenderly with them: Altho' we may nor neglect them, yet we may not be too haſty or ſevere in our publick
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004111_0031_1003D3C81BAAB3E0"/>
Cenſures of them. But we muſt <hi>exhort and rebuke with all long ſuffering.</hi> And there we muſt take Care that nothing of this Nature be done <hi>by Partiality;</hi> and yet a <hi>Difference</hi> is to be made, according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Aggravations of the Offence. Let there be no eccleſiaſtical Proſecutions <hi>thro' Strife, vain Glory,</hi> or any private Pique or Revenge, <hi>but in lowlineſs of Mind,</hi> Phil. 2.3. In a Word, Every Admonition and Cenſure of the Church, muſt be managed with ſuch a Spirit of Meekneſs, Love, and Tenderneſs, as may ſoften and melt the Offender into Repentance. And thus much for the Wiſdom requiſite in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſtrations of GOD's Houſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly Conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The Wiſdom needful for Miniſters <hi>in their private Application to Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is often times Occaſion for Miniſters to apply themſelves privately and perſonally to Men. Such as are under Convictions and Concern about their ſpiritual State, will repair to their ſpiritual Guides for Counſel and Comfort: And others that are ſtupid and careleſs about their Souls, it is no Ways improper for Miniſters to go to them; and doubtleſs paſtoral Viſits, if they be managed wiſely, may be of great Advantage. And ſince it is the Miniſter's Buſineſs and Calling to <hi>win Souls,</hi> it ſeems very proper that what Time they can ſpare from their Studies and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Labours, and other neceſſary Avocations, they ſhould devote to the Service of particular Souls.</p>
            <p>But now here is a great deal of Wiſdom neceſſary to manage ſuch private Conferences &amp; Converſation to good Advantage. Here Miniſters muſt conſider the particular Tempers, Circumſtances, and Cond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itions of Men that they converſe with, applying Counſels, Comforts, Cautions, Warnings, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, as they ſee the Perſons need, and that will
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004111_0032_1003D3CEB66BAO18"/>
be likely to do them good. We muſt conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men's Tempers be quick and haſty, proud and haughty; whether they be humble and meek; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſelf-conceited and ſpiritually proud; whether they be dejected or diſcouraged; and muſt addreſs ourſelves to them accordingly. Moreover we muſt conſider what particular Sins they are addicted to; and muſt faithfully, but in the moſt friendly Manner, warn and admoniſh them thereof. We muſt find out the particular Difficulties and Objections in their Way of coming to Chriſt, wiſely adjuſting our Counſels and Arguments to the Circumſtances and Capacities of Perſons.</p>
            <p>Moreover Miniſters, if they would be wiſe, muſt watch for favourable Opportunities to perſwade Men over to Chriſt; ſuch as times of Sickneſs and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, times of Sorrow and Mourning; ſo alſo, when they have experienced remarkable Preſervations and Deliverances. In a Word, as there are <hi>favourable Opportunities, happy Junctures,</hi> for ſpeaking to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their ſpiritual Concerns, ſo Miniſters ſhould watch for them, and by no Means let them ſlip. But I muſt haſten to another general Inſtance of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom neceſſary in Miniſters, in order to their winning Souls, and that is,</p>
            <p n="3">3 dly. <hi>Their being very</hi> EXEMPLARY <hi>in their Lives and Converſations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a main Point, without which, all the reſt will ſignify little: For if a Man prays and preaches, and diſcourſes at all times, as it were, with the Tongue of Angels, yet, to what Purpoſe will it all be, if he contradicts it by his own Practice? And I know nothing that brings a greater Reproach upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that ſo effectually fruſtrates the grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Miniſtry, as the corrupt Practices and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exemplary Behaviour of thoſe who have worn that
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004111_0033_1003D3D89601BA60"/>
ſacred Character. For how is it poſſible that a People ſhould be perſwaded and wrought upon by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching of thoſe whom they ſee are not at all wrought upon by their own Arguments, and openly reject their own Counſels and Warnings? And truly, what can look ſo abſurd as to hear Miniſters crying down this and the other Sin on the Sabbath, and yet live in the allowed Practice of them, all the Week af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? How reproachful muſt it needs be to Miniſters, and what a Diſcredit to Religion, for them to teach one thing and practice the quite contrary? <hi>Thou that Preacheſt a Man ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal? Thou that ſayeſt a Man ſhould not commit Adultery, doſt thou commit Adultery? Thou that abborreſt Idols, doſt thou commit Sacrilege?</hi> Rom. 2 21 22.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Lord wiſely conſidered the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a good Example; and ſo exhibited a moſt perfect Pattern to the World in his own Life, and gives it in expreſs Charge to his Diſciples, <hi>to let their Lights ſo ſhine before Men, that others might ſee their good Works, and glorify their Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.16. And agreable to this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Charges his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let no Man deſpite thy Youth, but be thou an Example to the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, in word, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.12. Obſerve here the Way that the Apoſtle adviſes young <hi>Tim thy</hi> to take that he might not be deſpiſed, was to be Exemplary in the Spirit and Temper of his Mind, and in the whole Conduct and Behaviour of himſelf; and there is no other Way that will ſave Miniſters from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; nor any Way ſo likely for them to win upon the Souls of others. What is there that will give ſuch Force to their exhortations, and that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend Religion to the Eſteem the Love and Practice of others, as to ſee all the Vertues and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004111_0034_1003D3DE50AA6F08"/>
Graces of it exempliſied in the Miniſter's own Life? When does Religion appear ſo amiable, as when we ſee it drawn to the Life in a Man's Temper and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that is Religion, <hi>makes a Man's Face to ſhine.</hi> And how glorious does a Miniſter ſhine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a People, when his Life and Converſation is but a Tranſcript of his Preaching? Verily it is not eaſy to conceive how ſuch a Man would win upon a People. Therefore this is a grand Point for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to take Care of in their firſt ſetting out, as the Way to ſave them from Contempt, to honour their Character, and to <hi>adorn the Doctrine of GOD their Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here, with reſpect to a Miniſter's <hi>Converſation,</hi> there is Wiſdom and Prudence to be exerciſed: For as Miniſters may not be <hi>light and vain</hi> in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſo they muſt avoid the other Extreme of <hi>a m roſe affected Gravity;</hi> for this diſaſſects People to Religion, as much as too great Levity. Nor are Miniſters to be ſuperciliouſly brow-beating every thing in Company that promotes an innocent and civil Mirth. On the other Hand, They muſt take heed that they don't countenance, much leſs promote <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>filthy</hi> or <hi>prophane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miniſters may be pleaſant in Company, as well as other Men, ſo long as they obſerve proper Seaſons, and keep within the Bounds of Civility and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. There is a Time to <hi>Laugh,</hi> as well as a Time to <hi>Mourn;</hi> and Religion is not to be repreſented in ſuch gloomy Colours, as to forbid every Thing that excites a civil Mirth; for this would diſcourage, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than allure Men to Religion.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Miniſters would do well to conſider their Age and ſtanding in the World: And, as el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Miniſters, according to the natural Tendency
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004111_0035_1003D3E9300DD1A0"/>
of Age, ſhould lay aſide the Gaiety and Mirth that is natural to Youth; ſo young Miniſters, although they ſhould be of a grave Behaviour, yet ſhould not pretend to aſſume, in all Reſpects, the Gravity of old Age, leaſt it ſhould be ſuſpected to be mere Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which would prevent its anſwering any good End.</p>
            <p n="4">4 thly. <hi>Another Point of Wiſdom neceſſary to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Souls, is DILIGENCE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Buſineſs of winning Souls requires a cloſe and conſtant Application: And he that deals with a ſlack Hand in this Matter, will do but little to the Purpoſe. Miniſters, whoſe Buſineſs it is to win Souls, ſhould endeavour that no one Soul committed to their Charge ſhould periſh thro' their Neglect. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great Number of Souls, the various Circumſtances and Conditions of them, and the vaſt variety of Means that muſt be uſed with them, the Miniſter will find that he muſt be very induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or ſome of them will ſuffer.</p>
            <p>It becomes Miniſters, as much as any Men in the World, to be ſo wiſe as to <hi>redeem the Time;</hi> to watch and improve all Opportunities for doing Good to the Souls of Men. If we conſider the whole Circle of a Miniſter's Work, both in his private Studies, his private Conferences, &amp; in his publick Adminiſtrations, and it is impoſſible for him to be faithful unleſs he be diligent.</p>
            <p>Miniſters, young Miniſters eſpecially, muſt give diligent Attendance to reading and ſtudy, that they may grow in Knowledge, and in all miniſterial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, that their profiting may appear to all, and in all things They ſhould alſo be diligent to know the State of their Flocks, that they may be able to give to every one their Portion in due Seaſon: And ſhould be laying hold of every Opportunity of doing Good to them, by inſtructing them, by inculcating
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004111_0036_1003D3EC3A703098"/>
their Duty upon them, by warning, counſelling and comforting of them, as there is Occaſion.</p>
            <p>In a Word, There muſt be <hi>Line upon Line, Line upon Line; Precept upon Precept, Precept upon Precept; here a little, and there a little,</hi> dropping continually from Miniſters for the Good of Souls. And ſo, in ſhort, their main Study muſt be how to win Souls, This muſt take up their Thoughts when at home, or when they are abroad, when they riſe up and when they lay down, when they are riding or wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the Way; for as this is the Buſineſs they are devoted unto, ſo, if they be wiſe they will make a Buſineſs of it, and give themſelves <hi>wholly</hi> to theſe Things, and willingly ſpend and be ſpent in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Service.</p>
            <p n="5">5 thly, Another Inſtance of Wiſdom in winning Souls is to be <hi>very prayerful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, conſidering there is ſo much Skill and Wiſdom neceſſary to win Souls, and that this cometh forth from the Lord of Hoſts that is <hi>wonderful in Counſel;</hi> and conſidering further, that after all our Wiſdom, it is GOD who by his Spirit and Grace wins the Soul over to Chriſt; any Miniſter that is wiſe will ſee that he has ſuch a Dependance upon GOD, both for Aſſiſtance and Succeſs in his Miniſtry, that he wont pretend to go on in it, without earneſt ſeeking to GOD for Help and Grace to he vouchſaſed unto him, unto thoſe that hear him.</p>
            <p>When a Miniſter ſeriouſly conſiders the arduous and important Buſineſs that he is engaging in, he will be ready to cry with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 216 <hi>And who is ſufficent for theſe Things?</hi> and will hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and earneſtly cry unto GOD for Wiſdom and Grace that may be ſufficient for him. He will take Encouragement from thoſe gracious Words, Jam. 1.5. <hi>If any of you lack</hi> WISDOM, <hi>let him ask of GOD, who
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004111_0037_1003D3FB247FE328"/>
giveth to all Men liberally and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him;</hi> and will accordingly cry after Wiſdom, and lift up his Voice for Underſtanding, that he may know how to go in and out before the People he is ſet over in the Lord; how to manage their various Tempers, and deal with their Souls ſo as to win and ſave them. He will pray for Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Aſſiſtance in his Studies, and in every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that he compoſes, that he may be led into Truth, that he may be kept from Errors, and that ſuch things may be dictated to his Mind as ſhall be ſeaſonable and profitable to the Souls of thoſe that hear him, and to his own Soul; and that he may be aſſiſted and directed in all his Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>But then, being ſenſible alſo that his Learning, his Wiſdom, and Skill, will ſignify nothing, without the ſetting in of divine Grace upon the Souls of Men, this is what he will be much in Prayer to God for, that the divine Spirit may go forth with all the Means that he is uſing for the winning Souls; acknowledging with the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 3.7. <hi>That neither is he that planteth any thing, neither be that watereth, but God that giveth the Increaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that Miniſters if they would be wiſe muſt be Men of <hi>Prayer.</hi> And as the high Prieſt of old was to bear the Names of the Children of Iſrael upon his Heart in the Breaſt Plate of Judgment, when he went into the holy Place before the Lord, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 29.) ſo Miniſters ſhould bear their People upon their Hearts when they appear before God in Prayers, and ſhould be far from thinking it loſt time that is ſpent, in ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Caſes of their People before GOD, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to his Mercy and Grace. GOD is my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (ſays the Apoſtle) whom I ſerve with my Spirit in the Goſpel of his Son, <hi>that without</hi> CEASING <hi>I make Mention of you</hi> ALWAYS <hi>in my</hi> PRAYERS, Rom. 1.9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:004111_0038_1003D4060CB96A70"/>But it is high Time that I proceed to the APPLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION AND IMPROVEMENT of theſe Things. And here, although the foregoing Heads would afford us many uſeful Inferences, yet I ſhall only hint at a few which the preſent Occaſion calls for.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Is it the ſpecial Buſineſs of Miniſters to win Souls; How ſhould this <hi>recommend the Office, and thoſe who are faithful in it, to the Eſteem, Honour, and Love of the People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Office is there more glorious and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing than this of winning Souls? This was the great Errand Chriſt came into the World upon, even to ſeek and ſave loſt Souls. And as the Thought of this ſhould endear Chriſt unto us, ſo ſhould it Goſpel-Miniſters, who (under him) come upon the ſame Deſign. What more high, noble, and generous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, than to ſhow Men the Way to Salvation, and perſwade Men into it? And how welcome ſhould ſuch be to a People, that come to ſave their Souls from Death, to gain them over to Chriſt to Heaven and Happineſs? Is not the Soul exceeding precious, of more Worth than all the World? And is it not of infinitely greater Importance to every Man to ſave his Soul than gain the World? How thankful then ſhould we be, that Chriſt has appointed an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Men for this very Purpoſe; and how ſhould every one, that is faithful in this Office, be welcome to our very Souls? And how inſenſible are they of the preciouſneſs of their own Souls, and of their loſt and periſhing State, who undervalue the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry as a needleſs Office, and deſpiſe Miniſters?</p>
            <p>Indeed as for ſuch as diſparage their Office by their unskilfulneſs, unfaithfulneſs, and corrupt Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices; I have nothing to ſay for them. But I would ſay, it is Pity the Miniſtry in general ſhould be blamed, ſhould be undervalued, upon the Account of ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:004111_0039_1003D40FDD525CE8"/>And thoſe holy Souls who have been won thro' the Miniſtry of the Word, will honour and love thoſe that have been the Inſtruments of their Converſion; yea, and every faithful Miniſter of Chriſt, ſaying as in Rom. 10. 15. <hi>How beautiful are the Feet of them that preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good Things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Is there a great deal of Wiſdom requiſite to the winning Souls? Hence <hi>this Buſineſs ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted only to wiſe Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, to what Purpoſe will it be to commit the Care of Souls to ſuch as are unskilfull in the Word of Righteouſneſs, or that would be unfaithful in the Work? Theſe would diſparage the Office, fruſtrate the Deſign of their holy Calling, and ſo would deceive and deſtroy, rather than gain and ſave Men's Souls.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, Conſidering the Importance of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinſs, that it relates to Men's Souls, the future and eternal Salvation of them, it muſt needs be highly incumbent upon all that are concerned in chuſing and putting Men into the Miniſtry, to act with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Care.</p>
            <p>Here let me ſay, a People ſhould be very careful in the Choice of one to whom they commit the Care of their Souls, and of the Souls of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. They ſhould not proceed ſuddenly in ſuch a weighty Affair; ſhould get the beſt Advice they can, and ſhould be well ſatisfied of a Man's Wiſdom and Skill in the Art of winning Souls, before they make Choice of him. This Art of winning Souls is the grand miniſterial Gift, and ſhould be <hi>earneſtly cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by a People.</p>
            <p>And then, As to thoſe who have the Power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing and inveſting any with that ſacred Office, they ought not <hi>to lay Hands ſuddenly on any Man,</hi> but ſhould be well ſatisfied of his having a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004111_0040_1003D4172C890428"/>
at winning Souls; that he be well furniſhed with Knowledge to direct and guide Men to Chriſt, and with Arguments to perſwade, and be able to uſe them in ſuch a Manner as would convince the Judgment, and move the Paſſions, conveying (like the Sun) Light and Heat at the ſame Time; and that he be diſpoſed to lay himſelf out, and employ all his Skill for this grand Deſign.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle's Charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> was to commit this Work to <hi>faithful</hi> Men, that ſhoud be <hi>able</hi> to teach others, 2 Tim. 2.2. And who thoſe faithful Men are, and the particular Qualifications neceſſary for thoſe that are to be brought into the miniſterial Office, we have laid down by the ſame Apoſtle as a Directory to his Son <hi>Timothy, 1ſt</hi> Epiſtle <hi>3d</hi> Chapter at the Beginning.</p>
            <p n="3">III. We learn what is the peculiar Accompliſhment thoſe ſhould be ſeeking after, that are devoted to the Work of the Miniſtry, namely, <hi>the Art of winning Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Art that every Candidate for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry ſhould be learning, and that every Miniſter ſhould be perfecting himſelf in continually.</p>
            <p>We ſhould learn the Art of explaining Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and Duties, and of urging Faith and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, with the moſt moving Arguments. We muſt get acquainted with the Structure of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and with the ſeveral Ways of working upon the various Powers and Faculties of our Conſtitution. We muſt learn how to inlighten and convince the Underſtanding and Judgment, how to perſwade the Will, and ſtrike the Paſſions, yea, and the Senſes too. We muſt learn to know Men, and what kind of Addreſs will beſt ſuit them, and ſo muſt know how to accommodate ourſelves, and all our Inſtructions and Exhortations, to the ſeveral Tempers and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of Men. And laſtly, We muſt learn the Art of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004111_0041_1003D41DA32B18F8"/>
living well ourſelves; whereby we ſhall repreſent Religion in the moſt amiable Light, and recommend it moſt effectually to others.</p>
            <p>And now, DEAR SIR,</p>
            <p>Since this is the very Buſineſs you are entring upon and engaging in, even to WIN SOULS to Chriſt, and ſave them from Death, and ſince this is the Time for your <hi>publick and ſolemn Introduction into this ſacred Office, by Prayer, and the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery,</hi> I muſt ſay a few things to you.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, I hope that you yourſelf are won and gained over to Chriſt. For with what Face, or with what Proſpect of Succeſs, can any undertake to perſwade others over to Chriſt and to his Goſpel, with ſuch Arguments as he himſelf has never felt the Force of?</p>
            <p>I truſt you are perſwaded of the Truth, and convinced of the Reaſonableneſs of, and actually in love with, that Religion which you are to recommend to the Faith, the Love, and Practice of others; and that you can ſet forth the Excellencies of it from your own happy Experience: and with what Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages will you urge &amp; perſwade this People to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, if you can let them know from your own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the <hi>Ways of Religion are Ways of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and all her Paths Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are about to have a great Truſt committed to you; even that which is more valuable than any Thing in this lower World. <hi>Not the Eſtates of Men:</hi> for as our Maſter did not, much leſs ſhould his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, undertake to be Judges, and Dividers among the People: And therefore the leſs you meddle with theſe Things the better. Nor are the Bodies of Men to be committed to your Care: they muſt when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed be left to the Phyſician, under GOD the great Phyſician of all. But they are the Souls of Men, precious Souls, immortal Souls, one of which is worth
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004111_0042_1003D425DD3E1968"/>
a World, that is to be committed to your Charge: And you are to watch for them as one that muſt give an Account. They are to be committed to you as a Worker together with GOD, to win them over to Chriſt, to deliver them out of their loſt and periſhing State, and perſwade them to be happy. A glorious Work indeed! What an high and honourable Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, to have to do with Men's Souls, and be the Inſtrument of their Salvation? The Angels think it their Honour to <hi>Miniſter unto them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1.14. In what an humble and adoring Manner ſhould you then ſay to GOD, <hi>who am I, and what is my Fathers Houſe that thou haſt brought me hither unto?</hi> 2 Sam. 7.18.</p>
            <p>But then, Conſider the Difficulty as well as Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Office; it is to win Souls, corrupt and wicked Souls, from their corrupt and ſinful State, and from all the corrupt Practices they have been accuſtomed unto: and what more difficult than to change Men's Natures, and turn them from their evil Cuſtoms? Moreover; You may depend upon having the Devil with all his curſed Legions, corrupt Nature with all its wicked and unreaſonable Luſts, the Men of the World with all their enticing Arts, the Things of the World and all the corrupt Cuſtoms and Practices of it oppoſing you, with all their Subtilty and Power. And how do you think you ſhall be able to reſcue poor Souls out of the Hands of ſo many ſubtle and powerful Adverſaries as theſe? Surely the Thought of this might well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you from the Undertaking, were it not for the Aſſurance that HE, who is with you, is ſtronger than all thoſe that be againſt you. But oh! the Knowledge, the Skill, the Wiſdom you will need continually to manage with Succeſs in the Affair! This Art of winning Souls is the moſt difficult to be learnt
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004111_0043_1003D436972DBB28"/>
of any, it requires more Underſtanding, and Prudence, and Patience, and Meekneſs, and Humility, and Self-denial to manage it to good, Purpoſe, than any other Calling. You muſt therefore be repairing continually to the Fountain <hi>and Father of Lights;</hi> from whom every good Gift and every perfect Gift deſcends. And altho' we truſt you are in ſome good Meaſure qualified herefor; yet let me tell you, it is an Art that you may be growing in as long as you live; and as in other ſo in this divine Art, <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation &amp; Experience</hi> will give you great Advantage.</p>
            <p>Wherefore now ſet yourſelf to the Buſineſs with all your Might, that you may grow more and more perfect in this excellent Art, and may be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in winning and ſaving thoſe Souls in your Flock that you ſee are periſhing. And, that you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge your Office faithfully, and in the moſt likely Manner to be ſucceſsful, let me leave two or three Words of Counſel with you.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Always diſtinguiſh between winning, over to</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and to a particular</hi> PARTY. Don't think that the bringing Men over to a particular Opinion, as to ſome doctrinal or diſciplinary Points; or to a particular Side in a Controverſy, and a Quarrel, is the winning them over to Chriſt: for Men's being on the wrong or the right Side in controverſial Points, don't determine which Side they are on, with reſpect to Chriſt and the Salvation of their Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Uſe no other Arts in perſwading over to Chriſt than thoſe that <hi>the Goſpel will bear you out in, which are fair and honeſt, juſt and true. Don't ſpeak wickedly for GOD, nor talk deceitfully for him,</hi> Job. 13.7. Take Pattern by the Apoſtles, who ſay, <hi>We are not as many who corrupt the Word, or deal deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with the Word, but as of Sincerity, but as of GOD,</hi>

we have obtained Mercy we faint not, but have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the hidden Things of Diſhoneſty, not walking in Craftineſs, not handling the Word of GOD deceitfully, but by Manifeſtation of the Truth, commending ourſelves to every Man's Conſcience, in the Sight of GOD,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.2. You may not uſe any flattering Diſſimulations or Deceits, to win Men over to Chriſt: This would be to <hi>Steal</hi> Men's Hearts (as <hi>Abſalom</hi> did the Hearts of the Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) rather than fairly win them. The Cauſe of Chriſt requires no diſſembling about it, and Honeſty will always be found to be the beſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. Indeed it is frequently mentioned as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to juſtify ſome kind of Guile and Deceit in winning and perſwading Men to Chriſt, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of the <hi>Corinthians, That he being crafty caught them with Guile,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.16. But they miſtake the Apoſtle, for he therein only tells them what evil Surmiſes and Suggeſtions there were among them concerning him, and that it was their Suggeſtion among themſelves that he had caught them with Guile; that is they inſinuate, that altho' he did not Burden them by calling for any Money from them, yet, that he was crafty, and ſet others to take Money of them for his Uſe; but this he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denies in the two following Verſes. So that this Text don't give the leaſt Countenance to the uſing any Guile or Deceit in winning Souls; for the Apoſtle denies that ever he did ſo, and mentions it only as a bare Surmiſe of others.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, and laſtly. <hi>See that you have an impartial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Souls of all committed to your Charge.</hi> Don't let any Soul ſuffer thro' Cowardice or Contempt. Don't neglect the Souls of the Rich and Great thro' fear of offending; but remember that if they looſe their Souls, their worldly Riches will by no Means anſwer in Exchange for them: therefore in a friendly
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004111_0045_1003D44EA49FC350"/>
faithful Manner, endeavour that they may not have all their good Things in this Life. And don't let the Poor be deſpiſed and ſink below your particular Watch and Care; but remember that their Souls are equally precious with the Souls of others, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that thoſe who are poor in this Word may be rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And now, What ſhall I ſay unto you, to put you upon the utmoſt Faithfulneſs and Diligence in this Buſineſs? You know the Worth of Souls, you know the ineſtimable Price that has been paid for their Ranſom, and that ſuch corruptible Things as Silver and Gold could not redeem them. You know alſo that if they periſh thro' your Neglect, their Blood will be required at your Hand: Whereas if you are but the Means of winning, converting, and ſaving them, what a Joy and Crown of Rejoycing would they be to you? What a Comfort will they be to you in this World? For if you win their Souls over to Chriſt, you will gain a great Share of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to yourſelf; ſo that you need not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſecure the Affections and Kindneſſes of your People, any other Way than by winning them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Chriſt; for ſuch will think nothing too much to do, according to their Ability, for the honourable and comfortable Support of him that GOD has made the Inſtrument hereof.</p>
            <p>But then, What a Glory will ſuch Souls be to you hereafter? How will they love and thank you, and how will they praiſe GOD and Chriſt for you, throughout Eternity? Verily, Every ſuch Soul ſhall be like ſo many Pearls and precious Diamonds, ſet in that unfading Crown of Glory, which you ſhall receive when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear: <hi>For they that be Wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs as the Stars forever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12.3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:004111_0046_1003D45B00C0CF60"/>I ſhall conclude with a brief Addreſs to the <hi>Church and Congregation,</hi> at whoſe Deſire, and upon whoſe Account, we are met together at this Time. You have been ſeeking and praying to the GOD of the Spirits of all Fleſh, to ſet a Man over the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that may go in before you, and go out before you in ſpiritual Things. And now <hi>behold the</hi> MAN; The <hi>Man</hi> whom, we truſt, the Lord hath choſen for you. He is coming among you (we truſt) not to ſeek yours but you; not to get your worldly Riches, but to gain your precious Souls. With what Eſteem then, and hearty Affection, ſhould you receive him?</p>
            <p>Surely, Since he comes to ſeek and win your Souls, you ought to open them unto him, and let him into them, that is, into the Affections of them; yea, and into the Circumſtances of them, ſo far as is neceſſary for his working and winning upon them.</p>
            <p>I charitably hope that many of you, according to your Profeſſion, are already won over to Chriſt; and then his Buſineſs, as to you, will be to ſtrengthen your Faith, your Love, and Obedience to Chriſt, and cauſe you to grow in Grace, and to abound more and more in the Fruits of Righteouſneſs; even to build them up in Faith, Holineſſ, and Comfort unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe of you that are yet in your Sins, and have not as yet been perſwaded over to Chriſt, ſee that you be won by his Counſels &amp; his good Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt. Don't harden your Hearts againſt the moving Arguments that he ſhall offer unto you: For I beſeech you, what is it that he will endeavour to win you over to, but to Chriſt and Happineſs? Will be perſwade you to any thing that will be for your Hurt, or that which will be for your greateſt Good; even for your Peace, Honour and Comfort here, and for your Glory and Happineſs hereafter? Wherefore
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004111_0047_1003D466284EB9C0"/>
don't let him have any Reaſon to complain that he labours in vain, and ſpends his Strength for nought; take heed of every thing that ſhall grieve him, or that ſhall diſcourage him in his Work.</p>
            <p>He is <hi>young and tender,</hi> and ye had need do all ye can to ſtrengthen his Hands and encourage his Heart, by living in Love, and Peace with him, and one with another. Beware of Diſcord among your ſelves, or with your Miniſter.</p>
            <p>Let the ſore Contentions that have been of late among you, and which have rent you to pieces, be a perpetual Warning to you, to guard againſt the beginning of Strife, and to leave off Contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be meddled with.</p>
            <p>And here let me ſay, That altho' your Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been ſo ſharp as to put you and your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren aſunder, yet ye muſt by no Means looſe all your Charity and Affection for them. You muſt exerciſe a forgiving Spirit towards them, as you hope that they would exerciſe the ſame towards you, and as you hope that GOD will forgive you. For thoſe Diviſions there had need be great ſearchings of Heart on all Sides, and every one ought to be jealous and fearful leaſt he has done amiſs in thoſe Days and Years of Temptation.</p>
            <p>And here I would ſay for all, (becauſe I don't intend to meddle with thoſe thorny Points) that the more humble and jealous you are of yourſelves, the more charitable, meek, and condeſcending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your Neighbours, and the more careful you are that no Injuſtice be done them, the more evident it will be that you are won over to Chriſt, for this is the Spirit of Chriſt and of his Goſpel. <hi>Put on therefore, as the Elect of GOD, holy and beloved, Bowels of Mercy, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of Mind, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffering, forbearing one another, and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004111_0048_1003D46E3AE06728"/>
forgiving one another: If any Man has a Quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye; and above all things put on Charity, which is the Bond of Perfectneſs; and let the Peace of GOD rule in your Hearts, to the which alſo ye are called in one Body and be ye thankful,</hi> Col. 3.12, —15. <hi>And now the GOD of Peace, that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, thro' the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good Work, to do his Will; working in you that which is well pleaſing in his Sight, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be Glory forever and ever,</hi>

            <p>That the Churches of Chriſt are by Him veſted with this Liberty, and indulg'd this Privilege, is evident from their Uſage in the primitive Times of Chriſtianity; and may be fairly argued even from the ſacred Scriptures themſelves: and particularly from <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. which Text rendered in our Tranſlation, <hi>And when they had ordained them Elders in every City,</hi> is rendered by Rev <hi>Beza, Quum<expan>
