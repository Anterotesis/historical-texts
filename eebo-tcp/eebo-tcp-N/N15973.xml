            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I EARLY felt an ardent deſire to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; and, embracing an opportunity that offered, I embarked on board the Union, one of the Dutch Eaſt India ſhips that lay in the Texel.</p>
               <p>On the 8th of January, 1705, the Union ſet ſail, with eight more of the company's ſhips, bound to the Eaſt Indies; and, on the 15th of March, ſteering round St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verd iſlands, we had a diſtinct view of the rocks and mountains, and of the ſituation and extent of the city of the ſame name.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of June we diſcovered the Cape of Good Hope; and the next day ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſafe in the harbour. Being introduced to the governor, that gentleman, on ſight of my recommendatory letters, treated me in a very friendly and affable manner; and ſoon aſſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſo early by the Portugueſe, as the year 1493. They attempted a ſettlement in 1498, but a party of them being cut off, they abandoned the place.</p>
               <p>It does not appear that any Europeans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards landed at the Cape, 'till the year 1600, when it began to be viſited by the Engliſh, French and Dutch, in their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to and from the Eaſt Indies. But in 1650, a Dutch fleet anchoring before it, mr. Van Riebeek, a ſurgeon on board, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that the country was well ſtocked with cattle, the ſoil rich, the harbour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and the people tractable, digeſted his obſervations; and, on his return to Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, laid them before the directors of the India company, who, after a grand conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, reſolved to attempt a ſettlement at the Cape, without loſs of time. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, four ſhips were immediately ordered out on that deſign, with all the materials, inſtruments, artificers and other hands ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſuch an expedition. The ſurgeon Van Riebeek was appointed governor and commander in chief of the intended ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with power to treat with the Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots, in what manner he ſhould think fit.</p>
               <p>With theſe four ſhips, Van Riebeek ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſafe at the Cape; and ſo captivated the natives by his addreſs and good humour, and with the preſents he brought them of braſs

               <p>After theſe wiſe regulations, in which ſo juſt a regard was paid to the natural rights of the inhabitants, mr. Van Riebeek raiſed a ſquare fort; and built in it, dwelling-houſes, ware-houſes, and an hoſpital for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſick.

this while there was a growing evil, againſt which no proviſion had been made. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean women were very ſcarce; and thoſe they had, were wives, who had ſettled there with their huſbands: while the plantation ſwarmed with young fellows, each ſettled upon his farm, and in a way of thriving, but wanting wives as much for the ſake of iſſue and domeſtic help, as for ſenſual gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and yet they had not the leaſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to marry the Hottentot women. But an account of this grievance being diſpatched to Amſterdam, a fine troop of young women were levied, who, on their arrival at the Cape, were beſtowed by the governor on ſuch as wanted wives, with all the indulgence that could be ſhewn on ſuch an occaſion, to their ſeveral fancies and inclinations.</p>
               <p>The ſettlement being thus firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, it increaſed to ſuch a degree, that being ſtill joined by other ſettlers, the Dutch, in a few years, extended themſelves in new colonies along the coaſt.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the country about the Cape is full of rocks and mountains, which, long after the diſcovery, being only viewed at a diſtance, were conſidered as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren: but their ſpacious tops are covered with rich meadows, every where enamelled with a variety of flowers, of uncommon beauty and fragrance, and abound with delicious ſprings,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020444_0007_0FAF108EB5D612F0"/>
running in many ſtreams into the valleys. Theſe mountains are in clear weather ſeen at ſea at the diſtance of fifteen leagues. On their ſkirts are interſperſed groves, that afford excellent wood for the joiners and turners. The plains and vallies are all delightful mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow lands, where nature appears with ſuch a profuſion of charms as to raviſh the eye of the beholder. They every where ſmile, and are adorned with beautiful trees, plants and flowers, that fill the air with the ſweeteſt odours, among theſe are the aloe, and other curious trees and herbs.</p>
               <p>The ſoil is ſo rich, as to be capable of every kind of culture; it bears all ſorts of grain, and every kind of fruit-trees. The country abounds with ſalt and hot baths of mineral waters, that have been found ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in many diſeaſes. The regions about the Cape are, however, ſubject to boiſterous winds, that generally blow from the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, while the ſun is in the ſouthern ſigns, and from the northweſt while in the nor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n ſigns. Theſe winds, however, though they frequently do much damage to the trees and corn, are of ſervice in purging the air, and contributing to the health of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; who, after a calm of a week or ten days, generally complain of the head-ach, and other diſorders, which vaniſh, when the winds blow again.</p>

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:020444_0008_0FAF108F713D25F8"/>Some authors have ſaid, that the Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots are ſo brutal, as to be in a manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of reflection, having no ſenſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor any notion of order or decency, and ſcarcely poſſeſſing the leaſt glimpſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or humanity: but this is far from being true. I have known many of them who underſtood Dutch, French, and Portugueſe to a degree of perfection; and one I knew, who learned Engliſh and Portugueſe in a very ſhort time. and having conquered the habit of pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation contracted from his native language, was ſaid by good judges to underſtand and ſpeak them with a ſurprizing readineſs and propriety.</p>
               <p>They are, perhaps, the moſt faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the world. The Europeans, at the Cape, are ſo fond of them in this capacity, that they are loth to part with them. Though they are infinitely fond of wine, brandy, and tobacco, and will, at any time, part with the moſt valuable things they have, to purchaſe them, yet they will neither dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, nor ſuffer any one elſe to diminiſh the leaſt drop or part of thoſe commodities, when they are committed to their truſt. It is ſurprizing to ſee the care and fidelity with which they acquit themſelves on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. They are even employed by the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans in affairs that require judgment and capacity.</p>

They can think to the purpoſe, if they pleaſe: but they hate the trouble of thought, and look upon every degree of reaſoning as a torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agitation of the mind: they therefore never reaſon but in caſe of neceſſity; that is when it is requiſite to remove ſome preſſing want of their own or their friends. If the Hottentot is not rouſed by ſome preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite or neceſſity; he is as deaf both to thought and action, as a log; when urged by theſe, he is all activity; but when theſe are gratified, and his obligation to ſerve is at an end, he retires to enjoy again his belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed idleneſs.</p>
               <p>Some authors have ſaid, that all the Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentots devour the entrails of beaſts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanſed of their filth and excrements, half broiled; and that, whether ſound or rotten, they conſider them as the greateſt delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the word: but this is not true. I have always found, that when they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails to eat, they turned and ſtripped them of their filth, and waſhed them in clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They then boiled them in blood of the beaſt, if they had any; if not, they gave them a thorough broiling. This, however, is done in ſo naſty a manner as to make an European loath their victuals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:020444_0010_0FAF1091845C7868"/>But, uncleanly as their manner of dreſſing their proviſions is, thoſe of them who keep to the diet of their country, have few diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, are ſeldom ſick, and live to an extreme old age. But thoſe who drink wine, brandy, or other ſtrong liquors, ſuffer diſeaſes before unknown to them, and ſhorten their days: even the meat dreſſed and ſeaſoned after the European manner, is very pernicious, with reſpect to them.</p>
               <p>What chiefly renders the Hottentots a naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty generation is a cuſtom, obſerved from their infancy, of beſmearing their bodies and apparel, (which is only a ſkin thrown over their ſhoulders, and another round their waiſt) with mutton fat, marrow, or butter, mixed with the foot that gathers round their boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pots, they being naturally of a nut or olive colour. This cuſtom is repeated as often as the greaſe is dried by the ſun or duſt, if they are able to get either fat or butter. The meaner ſort are moſtly obliged to make uſe of that which is rank; but the more wealthy always beſmear themſelves with the freſheſt and choiceſt that can be had. No part of the body, from the crown of the head to the ſole of the foot, eſcapes this paint; their ſkins are thoroughly daubed with it. The richer they are, the more fat and butter they employ; for this is the grand
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020444_0011_0FAF10921C632A88"/>
diſtinction between the rich and poor; but they abominate the fat of fiſh.</p>
               <p>This rubbing and greaſing promotes the ſuppleneſs of the body; and the Hottentots though a lazy race, are, perhaps, the ſwifteſt of foot in the world; for they not only dart away from the ſwifteſt European, but frequently out-run a very fleet horſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, living almoſt naked in a region where the ſun's heat is very great all the year round, by cloſing their pores with greaſe, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that exceſſive perſpiration which would, in all probability, exhauſt and deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>What renders them moſt diſagreeable, is their ſuffering their woolly hair to be matted together with fat and dirt; their offenſive ſmell, ariſing from theſe uncleanly cuſtoms; and their abominable louſineſs. Add to this, their language is a compoſition of the ſtrangeſt ſounds that ever were uttered by any people, and their pronunciation depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch colliſions of the tongue againſt the palate, and upon ſuch ſtrange vibrations and inflections of that member, as a ſtranger can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily imitate, and neither they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor hardly any one elſe, can deſcribe.</p>
               <p>Theſe people are, however, neither ſo ſmall of ſtature, nor ſo deformed and wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as they have been deſcribed by ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: for moſt of the men are from five to ſix feet high; but the women are a great

deal leſs. Both ſexes are very erect and well made, keeping a due medium between being fat and lean. There is not a crooked limb, or other piece of deformity to be ſeen among them; which is the more remarkable, as they do not take near ſo much care of their children as the European women. Their heads being generally large, their eyes are ſo in proportion. Their general mien is ſo far from being wild and terrible, that it is ſweet and compoſed, and declarative of the higheſt benevolence and good nature. The worſt features they have are their large flat noſes, and their thick lips, eſpecially the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt; however, the flatneſs of their noſes is not natural, but cauſed by art. Their teeth are as white as ivory, and their cheeks have ſomething of the cherry; but from their continual daubings, it is not eaſily diſcerned. The men have large broad feet: but thoſe of the women are ſmall and tender. Neither the men nor the women cut the nails of their fingers or toes. But what is very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, all the Hottentot women are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by having a broad callous kind of flap growing to their bellies, which ſeems intended by nature to hide, what other nations are taught moſt carefully to conceal; and ſome of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020444_0013_0FAF1093E8581060"/>
ſeen below it. This no Hottentot conſiders as a deformity; but through their naſtineſs and daubings, it is always in ſuch a condition as to make an European loath the ſight of it: yet for a little tobacco they will ſuffer you to handle and examine it. Thevenot in his travels, ſays, the negro, Egyptian, and the women of ſome other nations, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the like excreſcence; but that they ſtop the growth of it very early by ſearing: this may probably be done from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it as a deformity.</p>
               <p>In hot weather, the men conſtantly go without any other covering on their heads, than the compoſition of fat, ſoot and dirt, with which their hair is matted together: for they ſay, that the fat keeps their heads cool under the fierceſt ſun beams; but in the cold ſeaſons, and in wet weather, they wear caps made of cat or lamb ſkins, which they tie on with two ſtrings; but the face and fore-part of the neck of the men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uncovered. About the man's neck hangs a little greaſy bag, in which he carries his pipe and tobacco, with a little piece of wood of a finger's length, burnt at both ends, as an amulet againſt witchcraft.</p>
               <p>Their kroſſes, as they term them, or the mantles they hang over their ſhoulders, are worn open or cloſed according to the ſeaſon. The kroſſes of the moſt wealthy are of tyger

Theſe rings, or bracelets, ſerve as guards when they fight againſt an enemy, and when they travel, they faſten a bag to them for the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their viaticum, which they fix ſo cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly, that it is hardly any incumbrance. Round their waiſts hang what they call a kull-croſs, a ſquare piece of the ſkin of a wild beaſt, generally of a wild cat, tied o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with the hairy ſide outward. When they drive their herds to paſture, they put on a kind of leather ſtockings to ſecure their legs from being ſcratched by briers and thorns. When they are to paſs over rocks and ſands, they put on a kind of ſandals, cut out of the raw hide of an ox or elephant, each conſiſting of only one piece turning up about half an inch quite round the foot, with the hairy ſide outward, and faſtened on with ſtrings.</p>
               <p>The women wear caps all the year round,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020444_0015_0FAF10978D114E70"/>
made of the ſkins of wild beaſts, that point up ſpirally from the crown of the head. They generally wear two kroſſes round their ſhoulders, which, like thoſe of the men, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their backs, and ſometimes reach down to their hams. Between theſe kroſſes, they faſten a ſucking child, if they have one, with the head juſt peeping over their ſhoulders. The under kroſſe ſerves to prevent their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being hurt by the children at their backs. About their neck is tied a ſtring, to which is faſtened a leather bag, which they conſtantly wear, from morning till night, both at home and abroad; it contains ſome kind of food, a pipe, tobacco, &amp;c. The girls, from their infancy to twelve years of age, wear bulruſhes tied in rings round their legs, from their knees down to their ancles. Theſe bulruſh rings are then laid aſide, and their place is ſupplied with rings of the thickneſs of a little finger made of ſlips of ſheep or calf-ſkins, from which the hair is ſinged; for the Hottentot ſheep have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like wool. Some of the women have above an hundred of theſe rings upon each leg ſo curiouſly joined, and ſo nicely fitted to the leg, and to each other, that they ſeem like curious pieces of turnery. They are ſmooth, and as hard as wood, and make a clattering noiſe in dancing. Theſe rings are kept from ſlipping over their heels, by
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020444_0016_0FAF1097B6F532D8"/>
wrappers of leather or ruſhes about their ancles; and as the women are obliged every day to walk through buſhes and brambles to gather roots and other things for food, they preſerve their legs from being torn by the thorns and briers. Theſe rings are one great diſtinction of their ſex, and are conſidered as very ornamental; for the more rings they wear, the finer they are reckoned: but this is not all, they are proviſions againſt an hour of hunger and great ſcarcity; for when that arrives, they pull them off and eat them.</p>
               <p>But the principal part of the finery of both ſexes, among the Hottentots, are braſs but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, and plates of the ſame metal, which they buy of the Dutch, and then poliſh to an amazing luſtre; theſe dangle in the men's hair. They are alſo extremely fond of bits of looking-glaſs, which they likewiſe fix in their hair, and conſider as very ſplendid or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments. Diamonds are not more admired in Europe, than theſe trinkets in the Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentot nations. They wear ſmall ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, made of braſs wire, which they always poliſh very neatly, and to theſe rings the moſt wealthy and eminent hang bits of mother of pearl, to which they have the art of giving a curious ſhape and poliſh. Theſe are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in point of ornament, of which they are extremely proud; for they imagine they
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020444_0017_0FAF10986BCB1710"/>
draw upon them the admiration of all who behold them.</p>
               <p>To their commerce with the Europeans they owe likewiſe ſeveral other ornaments for the body, as braſs and glaſs beads, of which they are extravagantly fond. Hardly a Hottentot of either ſex can be met with, who is not adorned with ſome of them. But the preference is univerſally given to beads of braſs, becauſe they are not ſo liable to break as thoſe of glaſs. They wear them in neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, bracelets, and girdles; of which every one has more or leſs according to his ability. They chuſe the ſmalleſt beads they can meet with for the neck and arms. The large ones they wear about their waiſts. Some wear half a dozen necklaces together, and others more, ſo large that they fall very gracefully to their navels. They likewiſe cover their arms with bracelets from their elbows to their wriſts, which are the largeſt they can get, and ſtained with various colours. For theſe ornaments the Hottentots part with their cattle very freely. If they ſerve the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, they always ſtipulate for ſome ear-rings, if they are not already provided: and whenever one of them ſerves a European, though it be but for a week or a day, he hardly ever fails in the bargain to article for beads.</p>
               <p>It is an invariable cuſtom among the men, to wear the bladders of the wild beaſts they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020444_0018_0FAF10992A459FF0"/>
have ſlain, blown up and faſtened to their hair, where they hang as honourable tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of their proweſs.</p>
               <p>But with all this finery, the men do not reckon themſelves completely dreſſed, unleſs their hair be alſo laviſhly powdered with a pulverized herb called Buchu; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, they are beaux and grandees, and appear in their utmoſt magnificence. As the hair of the women is conſtantly hid under their caps, they lay this powder as thick as they can upon their foreheads, where, being rubbed into the greaſe, it ſticks very firmly. The women alſo paint their faces with a red earth, with which they make a ſpot over each eye, one upon the noſe, one upon each cheek, and one upon the chin. Theſe red ſpots they conſider as ſtriking beauties, and therefore this is their conſtant practice, when they are called to mirthful aſſemblies, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

government. He was antiently diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by the beauty of the ſkins of which his kroſſes were compoſed: but the Dutch, ſoon after their eſtabliſhment at the Cape, made a preſent of a braſs crown to the chief of every nation in alliance with them, which they wear upon ſolemn occaſions. However, in time of peace, the chief has little elſe to do but to govern the kraal or village where he reſides.</p>
               <p>The captain of a kraal preſerves the peace, and adminiſters juſtice; and in time of war has, under the chief of the nation, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the troops furniſhed by his kraal. His office is alſo hereditary, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not execute it till he has ſolemnly engaged before the people not to alter or deviate from the antient laws and cuſtoms of the kraal. Theſe kraal captains were likewiſe anciently diſtinguiſhed only by the fineneſs of the ſkins they wore, which were thoſe of tygers, or of wild cats: but all of them have now a cane with a braſs head, given them by the Dutch, which deſcends along with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But neither the chiefs of the nations, nor theſe captains, have any revenue from the public, or any perquiſite attending the execution of their office.</p>
               <p>The captain of a kraal decides all diſputes of right and property, and tries and puniſhes for murder, theft, adultery, and other crimes
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020444_0020_0FAF109BF1078F38"/>
committed within his juriſdiction, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by all the men of the kraal; and from his ſentence there lies no appeal: but ſtate criminals are tried by a chief, aſſiſted by all the captains of kraals.</p>
               <p>Whenever a diſpute about property ariſe, the captain ſummons all the men of the kraal into the open field, who ſquat down in a circle. The plaintiff and defendant plead their own cauſes, and the witneſſes on both ſides are heard. The depoſitions being finiſhed, the captain, after ſome debate, collects the voices, and immediately pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the decree according to the majority; when full and quiet poſſeſſion is inſtantly ſecured to the party in whoſe favour the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree paſſes.</p>
               <p>The criminal matters which employ the kraal courts are murder, adultery, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery: for adultery is puniſhed with death. When a Hottentot is known or ſuſpected to have committed any of theſe crimes, notice is given to all the men of the kraal to which he belongs; who, conſidering themſelves as officers of juſtice, look out ſharply in order to ſeize the ſuſpected party; and it is in vain for him to think of finding ſanctuary in any other Hottentot nation, for he would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up as a fugitive or a ſpy. The criminal being apprehended, he is ſecured till the men of the kraal can aſſemble, which is done the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020444_0021_0FAF109CEC3D8020"/>
very day he is brought back to the kraal. The court ſitting ſquat upon their hams in a circle, the priſoner is placed in the middle; becauſe the Hottentots ſay, that in an affair in which a man's life is at ſtake, he ought to have the beſt ſituation for hearing and being heard. The priſoner being in this place, the charge againſt him is pronounced by the proſecutor, and the proſecutor's witneſſes give their evidence. Next the priſoner makes his defence, calling his own witneſſes, who are heard with the greateſt indulgence. Then the captain, after ſome debates on the evidence, collects the voices, a majority of which acquits or condemns him. If he is acquitted, the court aſſigns him damages out of the proſecutor's cattle. If he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, and judged worthy of death, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is immediately pronounced: the court riſes, while the priſoner ſtirs not a limb: for a minute or two, all is ſilent; when ſuddenly the captain flies at the priſoner, and with one blow on the head with his ſtick lays him ſprawling on the ground. This is followed by all the reſt, who ruſh forwards, and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with all their might, he in a moment expires. They then bending the corpſe neck and heels, wrap it up in his kroſſe, and bury it with every thing they find about it, except his ear-rings, and other ornaments of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or braſs, which are given to his family
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020444_0022_0FAF109E4D4B03E0"/>
or his heir, who ſuffer nothing either in name, privilege, or property. His family, relations, and friends are treated with the ſame reſpect as before: and every thing proceeds as if no ſuch misfortune had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. Even the memory of the criminal is ſo far from being inſulted, that his corpſe is interred with the ſame ceremonies, and as much pomp as is ſhewn at the funerals of the richeſt and moſt virtuous among them.</p>
               <p>All the riches of the Hottentots deſcend to the eldeſt ſon, or, when a ſon is wanting, to the next male relation; and the youngeſt ſons of a Hottentot, who are at home and unprovided for at the death of their father, are at the courteſy of the eldeſt, both with reſpect to their fortune and their liberty. Marriage with firſt and ſecond couſins is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and puniſhed by being cudgelled to death: but yet a Hottentot may have as many wives as he can maintain though the richeſt ſeldom exceed three. A man may be divorced from his wife, and a woman from her huſband, upon ſhewing ſuch cauſe as ſhall be ſatisfactory to the men of the kraal. But one of the moſt extraordinary of their laws is, that a widow, for every huſband ſhe marries after the firſt, is obliged to cut off a joint of a finger, which ſhe preſents to her huſband on the wedding-day, beginning at one of the little fingers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:020444_0023_0FAF109F58B76480"/>The Hottentots have no lawyers; and the only public officers, beſides thoſe already mentioned, are the phyſician and the prieſt. In every kraal there is a phyſician, and the large ones have two, who have ſome ſkill in botany, ſurgery, and medicine. They are choſen out of the ſages of each kraal, and appointed to watch over the health of the inhabitants. This they perform without fee or reward, the honour of the employment being judged a ſufficient recompence for their trouble. They ſuffer none to ſee them gather and prepare their remedies, for all their preparations are kept a profound ſecret; and if a patient dies under their hands, they conſtantly aſſert that all their medicines were rendered ineffectual by witchcraft.</p>
               <p>The prieſt is, at the Cape, inferior to the phyſician. His office is alſo elective; but he is neither to pray for the people, nor to inſtruct them in religious matters. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides at their offerings, and has the ordering of all ceremonies.</p>
               <p>As the chief of a Hottentot nation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides over the captains of the kraals, ſo the Hottentots call the ſupreme being the great or ſupreme captain, whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be the creator of all things and the governor of the world, and that he is endowed with unſearchable perfections. They commonly call him Gounja Gounja,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020444_0024_0FAF10A0322A6840"/>
or Gounja Tiquoa, the God of all Gods; and ſay that he is a good man, who does nobody any hurt; and that he dwells far above the moon: but it does not appear that they addreſs any act of devotion immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſupreme God. Their adorations are paid to what they call inferior deities, dependent upon him; for the moſt ſenſible of them, when they are in the humour to anſwer the queſtions aſked them on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſay, their firſt parents ſo grievouſly offended the God of all Gods, that he curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with hardneſs of heart; therefore they know little of him, and have ſtill leſs inclination to ſerve him.</p>
               <p>The moon with them is an inferior viſible God. They call this planet Gounja, or God; and ſay that it is the ſubject and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of the high and inviſible. They aſſemble for the celebration of its worſhip at the change and full, and no inclemency of the weather prevents them: they then throw their bodies into a thouſand different poſtures, ſcream, proſtrate themſelves on the ground, ſuddenly jump up, ſtamp like mad creatures, and cry aloud, "I ſalute thee; thou art welcome: grant us fodder for our cattle, and milk in abundance." Theſe and other addreſſes to the moon they repeat over and over, ſinging ho, ho, ho, many times over, with a variation of notes, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

when they ſaw it in his hand! They ſtared at him, and at each other, with looks of diſtraction.
<q>See, ſee, ſee, cried they; What is he going to do? Will he kill it? Will he kill it?</q>
Mean while every limb ſhook with fear. He aſked them why they were in ſuch agonies for that paltry inſect.
<q>Ah, Sir, (they replied with the utmoſt concern) 'tis a Divinity. 'Tis come from heaven: 'tis come on a good deſign. Ah! do not hurt it; do not offend it. We ſhall be the moſt miſerable wretches upon earth if you do. This ground will lie under a curſe, and the crime will never be forgiven.</q>
He appeared unmoved by their petitions, but ſeemed as if he intended to maim or deſtroy it. On which they ſtarted, and ran about like people frantic, aſking where was his conſcience? and how he dared to think of perpetrating a crime that would bring upon his head all the curſes and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of heaven? But this not prevailing, they all fell proſtrate on the ground, and, with ſtreaming eyes and the loudeſt cries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to ſpare the creature, and give it liberty. The young man now yielded, and let the inſect fly, on which they capered and ſhouted in a tranſport of joy, and, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after it rendered it the cuſtomary honours.</p>

whom they honour, not with tombs, ſtatues or inſcriptions, but conſecrate woods, mountains, fields and rivers, to their memory. On paſſing by one of theſe places, they ſtop to contemplate the virtues of the deceaſed, to whoſe memory it was dedicated, and to implore his protection for them and their cattle. Mean while they ſtand with their heads muffled up in their kroſſes or mantles; and ſometimes they alſo dance round theſe places, ſinging and clapping their hands.</p>
               <p>The Hottentots likewiſe worſhip an evil Deity, whom they conſider as the father of miſchief; the ſource of all their afflictions, and the inſtructor of the wicked Hottentots in the curſed arts of witchcraft, by which they believe that innumerable miſchiefs are done to the perſons and cattle of thoſe who are good. They call him Touquoa, and ſay he is a little crabbed inferior captain, whoſe malice will ſeldom let him reſt, and therefore they woſhrip him in order to avert it, and wheedle him by the offering of an ox or a ſheep.</p>
               <p>The Hottentots believe that the ſoul ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives the body, and therefore upon the death of any man, woman, or child, remove their kr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020444_0029_0FAF10A3ADE9C8C0"/>
then they apprehend the departed ſouls will follow a kraal, and be very troubleſome: they therefore leave the huts they died in ſtanding, and in them all the utenſils belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deceaſed.</p>
               <p>This is the abſurd ſyſtem of the Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tot religion, of which thoſe people are ſo fond, that I never heard of one of them dying a chriſtian. Though the Dutch have ſent miſſionaries among them, who have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone numberleſs fatigues, and taken the greateſt pains to make proſelytes, it has been without effect, and they have been compelled with ſorrow to abandon the generous deſign, without leaving the leaſt trace of it on the minds of the Hottentots. Of this the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing incident may ſerve for a proof. Mr. Vander Stel, governor of the Cape, took an infant Hottentot, whom he educated in the knowledge of the chriſtian religion, and after the genteel manners of the Europeans, allowing him little or no converſation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the Hottentots. He became well verſed in the myſteries of religion, and in ſeveral languages; he was always richly dreſſed, and his manners were formed after the beſt European models at the Cape. The governor ſeeing him thus qualified, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained great hopes of him, and ſent him with a commiſſary general to the Indies: he remained employed in the commiſſary's
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020444_0030_0FAF10A56A7C7AE8"/>
affairs, till the death of that gentleman, when he returned to the Cape. A few days after, at a viſit among his relations, he ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped himſelf of his European apparel, and equipped himſelf in the manner of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in a ſheep-ſkin. This done, he packed up his caſt-off cloaths, ran with them to the governor's, and preſenting himſelf before his patron, laid the bundle at his feet, and addreſſed his excellency to the following purport:
<q>Be pleaſed, ſir, to take notice, that I for ever renounce this apparel. I likewiſe for ever renounce the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It is my deſign to live and die in the religion, manners, and cuſtoms of our anceſtors. I ſhall only beg you will grant me (and I am perſuaded you will grant me) the collar and hanger I wear. I will keep them for your ſake.</q>
Here he ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and turning his back, fled ſwiftly away, and was never more ſeen in that quarter. This man I frequently converſed with, up in the country, and found, to my great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, that he had a ſurpriſing ſtock of chriſtian knowledge. But though I made uſe of the moſt perſuaſive and endearing language, to call him back into the fold of Chriſt, he continued deaf to all my reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and remonſtrances.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now take a view of thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies that are generally conſidered as
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020444_0031_0FAF10A66AE99880"/>
of a religious nature, and begin with the marriages of the Hottentots. If a bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor or widower has a mind to marry, he diſcovers his views to his father, and if he is dead, to the next authority of kindred; who if he conſents, attends him to the woman's relations, whom they regale with a pipe or two of tobacco, or of dachu, which they all ſmoke. The father of the lover then opens the buſineſs to the woman's father, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard it, generally retires to conſult his wife, and ſoon returns with a final anſwer, which is generally favourable. If the lover's father receives a denial, which rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, nothing more is ſaid about it, and the lover at once tears his choice from his heart, and looks out for another. If it be complied with, the lover chooſes two or three fat oxen from his own herd, or his father's, and drives them to the houſe from whence he is to take his deſtined bride, accompanied by all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of both ſexes who live near him: they are received with careſſes by the woman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> kindred; the oxen are immediately ſlain; and the whole company beſmear their bodies with the fat, and then powder themſelves all over with buchu; while the woman ſpot their faces as already deſcribed, with a kind of red chalk. The men then ſquat on the ground in a circle, the bridegroom ſquatting in the center; the women at ſome diſtance
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020444_0032_0FAF10A79C57A550"/>
alſo ſquat in a circle about the bride. At length the prieſt who lives at the bride's kraal, enters the circle of the men, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the bridegroom piſſes a little upon him. The bridegroom receiving the ſtream with eagerneſs, rubs it all over his body, and makes furrows with his long nails, that the urine may penetrate the farther. The prieſt then goes to the other circle, and evacuates a little upon the bride, who rubs it in with the ſame eagerneſs as the bridegroom. To him the prieſt then returns, and having ſtreamed a little more, goes again to the bride, and again ſcatters his water upon her. Thus he proceeds from one to the other till he has exhauſted his whole ſtock, uttering from time to time to each of them the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſhes, till he has pronounced the whole upon both: "may you live long and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily together. May you have a ſon before the end of the year. May this ſon live to be a comfort to you in your old age. May this ſon prove a man of courage, and a good huntſman."</p>
               <p>The nuptial ceremony being thus over, the oxen are cut into many pieces, and the whole dreſſed; ſome pieces being boiled, and the reſt roaſted in the following manner. A large flat ſtone is faſtened in the ground in the manner of a hearth, and a briſk fire made upon it, which burns till the ſtone is
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:020444_0033_0FAF10A82D03BE20"/>
thoroughly heated. The fire is then remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſtone cleaned from the aſhes, and the meat placed upon it. It is then covered with a flat ſtone, as large as that upon which the meat lies; round which a fire is kindled, as well as upon the upper ſtone, by which the meat is ſoon roaſted, or rather baked. The proviſions being thus dreſſed, the men and women ſit in different circles, the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom alone eating in company of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. They are all ſo naſty as to uſe the lappets of their greaſy kroſſes or mantles for plates; but their ſpoons are ſea ſhells. Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being over, what is left, is ſet by, and they go to ſmoking; each company having one tobacco-pipe. The perſon who fills it, after taking two or three whiffs, gives it to his or her neighbour, and thus it goes round: the beſt part of the night is ſpent in ſmok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and merriment, till the bridegroom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires to the arms of his bride, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſeparate. The next day they again aſſemble, and feaſt and ſmoke as before; and this is continued every day, till the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons dreſſed on the day of marriage, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. Upon theſe occaſions, they have neither muſic nor dancing; and they have only their ordinary drink, which is milk and water.</p>
               <p>A Hottentot never has a hut of his own, till after his marriage: and then his wife aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020444_0034_0FAF10A8F8D2AD38"/>
him, not only in erecting it, but in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the materials, which are all new, and in providing the furniture. This being done, he abandons to her the care and toil of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dreſſing the family proviſion, except when he goes a hunting or fiſhing: ſhe alſo bears a part in attending the cattle.</p>
               <p>At the birth of a child, the parents have a ſolemn feaſt by way of thankſgiving, of which all the inhabitants of the kraal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. But upon the birth of the firſt ſon, the rejoicings are far ſuperior to thoſe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any other birth. The parents ſlay cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle very liberally for the entertainment of the whole kraal; and every one, on ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, is particularly zealous to congratulate them on obtaining an heir. If, at any time, a woman has twins, and they are both boys, they kill two fat bullocks, and all their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, men, women, and children, rejoice at their birth, as a great bleſſing. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone is excluded from the entertainment, and has only ſome fat ſent her, to anoint herſelf and her infants. However, if the twins are girls, there is little or no rejoicing, and all the ſacrifice they make is at moſt a couple of ſheep. On theſe occaſions, they often give the lie to thoſe thankſgivings by a cruel cuſtom, practiſed indeed by other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but contrary to every ſentiment of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and humanity. If the parents are poor,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:020444_0035_0FAF10AA03404680"/>
or the mother pretends that ſhe has not milk for both the twin girls, the worſt featured of the two is either buried alive at a diſtance from the kraal, caſt among the buſhes, or tied on its back to the under bough of a tree, where it is left to ſtarve, or to be devoured by the birds or beaſts of prey.</p>
               <p>An expoſed female infant is ſometimes found by an European, when, if it be dead, he generally ſtays to bury it: but, if it be alive, he always takes it home; and, if he is not willing to breed it up, he eaſily finds thoſe that are. Theſe children always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a good education; and great care is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to inſtruct them thoroughly in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of chriſtianity, and to ſecure them from falling off to the Hottentot naſtineſs and idolatries; but theſe generous labours have never produced any laſting effect. Not once has it appeared that a Hottentot mind is to be deprived of its native bias: for thoſe unhappy females no ſooner come to years of maturity, than, flying to their own people, they conſtantly renounce the chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the European manners and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, embrace the religion and cuſtoms of their anceſtors, and remain with the Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots ever after.</p>
               <p>At eight or nine years of age, the young Hottentot is with great ceremony, deprived of his left teſticle; but the poverty of the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:020444_0036_0FAF10AAC4A16108"/>
parent ſometimes makes it be deferred till the youth is eighteen years of age; this cruel ceremony being attended with ſome expence. This is ſuppoſed to contribute to the agility of the Hottentots: they have alſo a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opinion, that a man with two teſticles conſtantly begets two children; and was a young man to try the experiment, both he and the woman would lie at the mercy of the rulers, and the woman would, for ſo great a crime, be perhaps torn to pieces by her own ſex.</p>
               <p>This is one act of legitimation for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the males; but is not the only one. Till they are about eighteen years of age, they are confined to the tuition of their mothers, and live and ramble about with them: there is therefore a ſecond act of legitimation, by which they are made men. When the father, or the generality of the men of a kraal, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to call a young man into their ſociety, all the inhabitants aſſemble in the middle of the kraal, and ſit upon the ground in a circle.

               <p>A Hottentot, thus freed from the care of his mother, may be ſo brutiſh and unnatural as to cudgel her, to ſhew his independence; and it is common for a young fellow on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted into the ſociety of the men, to go and abuſe his mother, and, as a teſtimony of the ſincerity of his intentions to follow the admonitions given him, to inſult and triumph over her, on his being diſcharged from her tuition.</p>
               <p>I have already obſerved, that ſome of the Hottentots have a kind of honourable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in wearing bladders tied to their hair as trophies of their valour.

The deputy then marches up to the hero and ſprinkles him plentifully as already related, pronouncing over him certain terms, which I could never get explained. The hero, as in other caſes, rubs in the ſtream upon his face and every other part with the greateſt eagerneſs. This done, the deputy lights his pipe, and having taken two or three whiffs, gives it to whoever he pleaſes in the circle; who, having taken the ſame ſolace, gives it to another; and thus it goes round, till on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſhes remain, which the deputy ſhakes upon the hero, who rubs them into the fat on his body with an eager motion, as if he would not loſe one particle of it. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle then riſes; he does ſo too; and every one congratulates him on the high honour he has received, thanking him for the ſervice he has done his country. The hero now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders himſelf as raiſed to the higheſt ſummit of human glory; and by the bladder of the beaſt he has killed, which he wears faſtened to his hair, and the majeſtic port he ever after aſſumes, demands the homage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which Hottentot cuſtom aſſigns to his high dignity, and which all his countrymen conſtantly pay him.</p>
               <p>The death of no wild beaſt gives ſuch joy to a kraal, as that of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yger. The Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots are infinitely fond of the fleſh, which,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020444_0040_0FAF10AF693E45F8"/>
indeed, I found to be moſt delicious food, and much ſuperior to the fineſt veal.</p>
               <p>I now come to the laſt ceremonies, that have a reference to a private perſon; thoſe that attend and ſucceed his departure out of life. A Hottentot man, woman or child, being in the agony of death, the friends and relations aſſemble and ſet up a terrible howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but the breath is no ſooner out of the body, than they join in ſo dreadful a chorus of ſcreaming, howling, yelling, roaring, and clapping of hands, that it is impoſſible for an European to ſtay in the kraal with ſafety to his brains. The corpſe is inſtantly wrapt up neck and hee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s together, much in the poſture of a child in the womb, in the kroſſe of the deceaſed, ſo cloſe that not the leaſt part of it is to be ſeen. The grave is almoſt always either a cleft in a rock, or a hole made by a wild beaſt; for the Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots never dig one when either of theſe is to be found at a convenient diſtance. About ſix hours after the death, the burial is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. When the corpſe is ready to be brought out, all the men and women of the kraal, but ſuch as are employed about the corpſe, aſſemble before the door of the hut, and ſquatting in two circles, the men in one, and the women in another, they clap their hands, crying in doleful accents, bo, bo, bo, or father, father. The bearers are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:020444_0041_0FAF10B0AC5CE348"/>
by the captain of the kraal, or by the relations of the deceaſed, and carry the body in their arms. When it is brought out, the circles before the door riſe and follow it to the grave, the men and women in ſeparate bodies, all the way wringing their hands; howling out bo, bo, bo, and putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch ridiculous poſtures, that it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for an European to be preſent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear laughing. Having put the corpſe into the hole, they fill it up with the mould of ant-hills, that it may be the ſooner conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and cram ſtones and pieces of wood into the grave to prevent its being devoured by wild beaſts. This being done, they return to the kraal, ſquat again in two circles before the door, and for about an hour longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their lamentations, till the word being given for ſilence, two old men, the friends or relations of the deceaſed, enter into each circle, and ſparingly diſpenſe their ſtream upon each perſon, ſo that all may have ſome: all the company receive it with much eagerneſs and veneration. This being done, each ſteps into the hut, and taking up a handful of aſhes from the hearth, comes out by the paſſage made for the corpſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the aſhes by little and little, upon the whole company. This, ſay they, is done to humble their pride; to baniſh all notions of diſtinction; and ſhew them, that old and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:020444_0042_0FAF10B12EF335F8"/>
young, rich and poor, the weak and the ſtrong, the beautiful and the ugly, will all be alike, and reduced to duſt and aſhes. If the deceaſed left any cattle, the heir now kills a ſheep, and ſome of his neareſt relations, if they are able, do the ſame, for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the kraal. The caul of the ſheep killed by the heir, is well powdered with buchu, and put about his neck, and he is obliged to wear it till it rots off. The other relations wear likewiſe about their necks the cauls of the ſheep they kill on this occaſion. Theſe cauls are the mourning the rich Hottentots put on for the dead. But if the relations are ſo poor, that they cannot afford to kill any cattle for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the kraal, they ſhave their heads in narrow ſtripes, alternately leaving a ſtripe of hair, and another ſhaved.</p>
               <p>But they have a moſt horrid cuſtom with regard to thoſe of both ſexes who are grown ſuperannuated. So long as an old man or woman is able to fetch in a ſtick a day, or can perform an office of kindneſs, care is taken to render their lives as eaſy as poſſible: but when they can be of no manner of ſervice, they are by the conſent of the kraal placed in a ſolitary hut at a conſiderable diſtance, with a ſmall ſtock of proviſions without any one to aſſiſt them, to die of hunger, or to be devoured by the wild beaſts. Cruel as this
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020444_0043_0FAF10B1F6E01C68"/>
cuſtom is, they conſider it as an act of mercy; and are filled w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h amazement at hearing the Europeans ſpeak of it with horror.</p>
               <p>It may here be proper to deſcribe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of building their huts, and diſpoſing of their kraals. The huts are all oval, about fourteen feet the longeſt way, formed of ſticks; one end of which is fixed in the ground, and the other bent over the top ſo as to make an arch: but they are rarely ſo high as for a man to ſtand upright within them. The arches being fixed by tying bent ſticks with a kind of rope made of ruſhes, the whole is covered with mats, which are made ſo faſt to each other and the ſticks, as not to be removed by the wind or rain. Thoſe of the wealthy Hottentots have alſo a covering of ſkins: they have no other opening but at the entrance, which is alſo arched, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y about three feet high; on the top of which is fixed a ſkin to be taken up and let down, in order to keep out the wind; and this is the only paſſage for the ſmoke. Their furniture conſiſts, of earthen pots for dreſſing their victuals, and ſeveral other veſſels for holding water, milk, and butter. Their fire-place is a hole made in the middle of the hut, and their bed a ſkin ſpread in a hole ſunk a little below the ſurface of the ground. A kraal conſiſts of twenty or more of theſe huts, placed near each other in a circle,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020444_0044_0FAF10B2A8B29C10"/>
leaving an area in the middle; each kraal containing from one to three or four hundred ſouls. The huts of the wealthy are often hung with beautiful ſkins: and a variety of trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets: but though all the Hottentots huts are narrow, dark, and filthy, harmony reigns continually in almoſt every one of them; that heavenly charm, ſo rarely to be found in the palaces of Europe. When a difference hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens between a man and his wife, it is ſoon accommodated. All their neighbours inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpoſe, and the quarrel is ſpeedily made up. The Hottentots run to the ſuppreſſion of ſtrife, when it has ſeized a family, as we do to put out a fire that has ſeized a houſe, and allow themſelves no reſt till every matter of diſpute is adjuſted.</p>
               <p>The cattle of a kraal run all together, and the meaneſt inhabitant, who has but a ſingle ſheep, has the privilege of turning it into the flock, where as much care is taken of it, as of the ſheep of the richeſt and moſt powerful of the kraal. They have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular herdſmen or ſhepherds, for driving their cattle to the paſture, and guarding them from wild beaſts. This office they take upon them by turns, three or four of them together; the women milking the cows morning and evening. Between five and ſix in the evening, they generally drive them home. In the area of the kraal they lodge the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020444_0045_0FAF10B4DDE95558"/>
calves and all the ſmall cattle, and on the outſide range their great cattle, tying two and two together by the feet. Theſe are in the night guarded by the dogs, of which every hut has one or two.</p>
               <p>The Hottentots have what they call backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyers, or fighting oxen, which they uſe in their wars, as ſome nations do elephants: thoſe gore, kick, and trample the enemy to death with incredible fury. Each army has a drove of them, which they take an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to turn upon their foe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The courage of theſe creatures is amazing, and the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline upon which they are formed, does not a little honour to the Hottentot genius and dexterity. They are alſo of great uſe to them in the government of their herds at paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for upon a ſignal they will fetch in ſtragglers Every kraall has at leaſt half a dozen of theſe oxen, and when one of them dies, or grows ſo old as to be unfit for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the moſt ſtately young ox is choſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean, approaches the herd, without having with him a Hottentot of the kraal to which they belong, they make at him full gallop; and if he is not within hearing of any of the Hottentots who keep the herds, if there is not a free which he can immediately climb,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:020444_0046_0FAF10B5DFDF1A78"/>
or if he has not a light pair of heels, or a piece of fire-arms, he is certainly demoliſhed. But they no ſooner hear the whiſtling of the keepers thro' their fingers, or the report of a piſtol, than they return to the herd.</p>
               <p>The Hottentots, have likewiſe great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of oxen for carriage, whom they break with ſuch art that they render them as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their drivers, as a taught dog in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope is to the commands of his maſter.</p>
               <p>The Hotttentots are very expert at ſeveral arts. They point their weapons with iron, which they even draw from the ore: for this purpoſe they make a hole in a raiſed piece of ground, and about a foot and a half on the deſcent make another of leſs extent, to receive the melted iron, which is to run into it by a channel made from one hole to the other. They then kindle a fire in the upper hole, and when the earth about it, is thoroughly heated, put in the iron ſtones, and make a large fire over them, which they ſupply with fuel, till the iron runs into the receiver. When the iron is cold, they take it out, heat it in other fires, and with no other implement but ſtones, beat it out, and ſhape it into weapons, after which they grind and poliſh it ſo nicely, upon a flat ſtone, as to render it a valuable piece of work, both for uſe and beauty. This inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity is not inconſiſtent with their habitual
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020444_0047_0FAF10B776ADBDE0"/>
lazineſs: for a poor Hottentot having made a ſet of arms for his own uſe, and another for ſale to a rich one, by which he has got two or three heads of cattle, can hardly ever be induced to ſet his hand to the ſame labour a third time.</p>
               <p>The-dexterity of the Hottentots in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging an arrow, and throwing what they call the haſſagaye and rackum-ſtick, is very aſtoniſhing. A Hottentot arrow conſiſts of a ſmall tapering ſtick, or cane of about a foot and a half in length, pointed with a ſmall thin piece of iron bearded, and joined to the ſtick or cane by a barrel. Their bows are made of olive or iron wood, and the ſtring of the ſinews or guts of beaſts, faſtened to a ſtrong wooden or iron Look at each end of the bow. The quiver is a long narrow bag, made of the ſkin of an ox, elk, or elephant, and ſlung over the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by a ſtrap faſtened to it; but to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the quiver is fixed a hook, on which the bow is hung, when they go to war, or to the chace. The haſſagaye is a kind of a half pipe; the ſhaft is a taper ſtick the length and thickneſs of a rake han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, armed at the thickeſt end with a little thin iron plate tapering to a point, and very ſharp on the edges. The rackum-ſtick is a kind of dart, little more than a foot long, made of hard wood. In the uſe of theſe
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:020444_0048_0FAF10B876F1FE88"/>
weapons, the Hottentots ſhew ſuch quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of eye, and ſureneſs of hand, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no people upon earth have beſides themſelves. If a Hottentot ſees a hare, deer, or wild goat within 30 or 40 yards of him, away flies the rackum-ſtick, and down falls the animal, generally pierced through the body. They are not leſs expert in the uſe of the bow and arrow, for if there be no wind, they will hit a mark no bigger than a ſilver penny, at a conſiderable diſtance. They are equally expert in throwing the haſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agaye, and ſlinging a ſtone. In all theſe caſes they ſtand not, as the Europeans, like ſtatues, to take their aim, but while they gather it, which they are not long in doing, they ſkip from ſide to ſide, and brandiſh and whirl the weapon about in ſuch a manner, that you would take the whole for idle flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; but on a ſudden away it flies to the mark. Their dexterity on theſe occaſions is quite incredible, and can hardly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>When all the men of a kraal are out upon a chace, and diſcover a wild beaſt of any conſiderable ſize, they endeavour to ſurround him, which they generally do very ſoon, tho' the beaſt, of whatever kind, betakes himſelf to his heels. If thus they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs an elephant, or rhinoceros, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him with haſſagayes, the hardneſs and

thickneſs of his hide fortifying him againſt a ſhower of arrows. If they do not lay him dead upon the ſpot, and he is able to return the attack upon the Hottentots, they form as large a ring as they can make, ſo as to reach him with their haſſagayes. The creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded, runs with great noiſe and fury at the perſon who threw the weapon. Then others attack him in the rear. He turns about, to attack the laſt aſſailants, and is again attacked in the rear. Again he turns about, and is again attacked. The haſſagayes multiply upon his body. He roars, tears up the ground, and has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as it were a foreſt of haſſagayes upon his back before he falls.</p>

avoid him with equal quickneſs, and ſtill he fights only with the air. All this time the arrows and haſſagayes are ſhowering upon him in the rear. He grows mad with pain, and running and leaping from one party of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to another, and tumbling from time to time to break the arrows and haſſagayes that are faſtened in him, he foams, yells, and roars in the moſt terrible manner. Nothing in the world can be more admirable than the activity and addreſs with which the Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots eſcape the paws of the beaſt, and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeed and reſolution with which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve each other. If he is not quickly ſlain, he is ſoon convinced that there is no dealing with ſo nimble an enemy; and then he makes off with his ut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the Hottentots do not often engage an elephant, a rhinoceros, or an elk after this manner: the elephants, going always to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in troops in a line, make a path from their haunts to the water ſide.

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020444_0051_0FAF10BA52D76128"/>
boughs, leaves, mould, and graſs, ſo that no man living would ſuſpect the trap. The elephants keeping pretty cloſe to the track, one or other of them is ſure to fall in with his fore feet, when his neck or breaſt being pierced by the ſtake on which his whole body reſts, the more he ſtruggles, the farther it penetrates. The reſt of the elephants imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately make off as faſt as poſſible. Mean while the Hottentots ſeeing the elephant thus caught, iſſue out of their covert, get upon the neck of the beaſt, and either break his ſkull with heavy ſtones, or cut his large veins with their knives. The carcaſe is then cut in pieces and carried to the kraal, where all the inhabitants feaſt upon it very jovially. The rhinoceros and the elk are alſo frequently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>The Hottentots are likewiſe very dextrous ſwimmers: this they perform in a different manner from other nations; they beat the water with their feet, and, raiſing themſelves erect, paddle along with their necks and arms above the ſurface. Thus they croſs deep ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and proceed with great ſwiftneſs in the ſea, dancing forward without the leaſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger, in the manner which the European ſwimmers call treading the water, riſing and falling with the waves like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corks. They are alſo extremely expert at fiſhing.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:020444_0052_0FAF10BB567CDDD0"/>I have already obſerved, that the wealth of the Hottentots co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Generally ſpeaking, however, they part with their cattle, both to the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans and to one another, at ſo cheap a rate as is almoſt incredible. I never offered a pound of tobacco to a Hottentot for an ox, half a pound for a large ſheep, and a quarter of a pound for a fat lamb, but the offer was accepted; tho' I had the bargain the ſooner, if I offered to crown it with the preſent of a dram.</p>
               <p>The wild beaſts of the country are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fierce and ſavage. The lions here, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their ſtrength. When they come upon their prey, they knock it down, and never bite it till they have given it the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blow, which is generally accompanied with a dreadful roar. When the lion is pinched with hunger, he ſhakes his mane, and laſhes his ſide with his tail. When he is thus agitated, 'tis almoſt certain death to come in his way; and as he generally lurks for his prey behind the buſhes, travellers ſometimes do not diſcover the motion of his tail till it is too late; but if the lion ſhakes not his mane, nor laſhes himſelf with his tail,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:020444_0053_0FAF10BBCCE646D0"/>
a traveller may paſs ſafely by him. The fleſh of a lion eats ſomething like veniſon.</p>
               <p>The leopard and tyger, which nearly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble each other, are next in fierceneſs to the lion. The tyger is much larger than the leopard, and is diſtinguiſhed by rings of black hair incloſing ſpots of yellow: but the black ſtreaks of the leopard are not round, but formed with an opening in the manner of a horſe ſhoe. They will neither of them eat the fleſh of any beaſt they have not killed themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Cape elephants are much larger than thoſe of any other country, and their teeth are from 60 to 120 pounds weight. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male is much leſs than the male, and her dug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Cape rhinoceros is of a dark aſh-colour approaching to a black. His ſkin is alſo without hair, and ſo hard that it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to pierce it with a ſharp knife. He is
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:020444_0054_0FAF10BCA5BD6468"/>
repreſented as armed all over with ſcales: but at the Cape he has really none, though the numberleſs ſcars and ſcratches on his hide, make him look at a diſtance as if fenced with ſcales. His mouth reſembles that of a hog, and upon his ſnout grows a ſolid dark grey horn near two feet long, ſomewhat bent, with which, when he is angry, he will tear up the ground, and throw ſtones a great way over his head; and on his forehead is another horn, about ſix inches in length, hollow and in the form of a half <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With that animal he is at perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enmity, and whenever he ſurpriſes him, he rips open his belly with the horn on his ſnout. He catches the ſcent of any creature that is to the windward of him, and marches towards it on a right line, grunting and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his way thro' all oppoſition of trees and buſhes. He never attacks a man unprovoked, unleſs he wears a red coat, in which caſe he rends and deſtroys every thing that ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the object of his rage; if he ſeizes him, he throws him over his head with great violence, and then feeds upon him by licking the fleſh off the bones with his rough and prickly tongue. His eyes are very ſmall, and he only ſees ſtrait forward: though he is pretty ſwift of foot, he is very ſlow and auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in turning. The way therefore to avoid
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:020444_0055_0FAF10BF08A94900"/>
him is to ſuffer him to come within eight or ten paces of you, and then to ſlip a few paces aſide, by which means he loſes ſight of you, and it coſts him a great deal of aukward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to get you again in view. He feeds chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on ſhrubs, brooms, and thiſtles.</p>
               <p>The buffaloes of the Cape are larger than thoſe of Europe, and of a brown red. Their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are alſo enraged at the ſight of any thing red, and at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a gun near them: on theſe occaſions they roar, ſtamp, tear up the ground, and run with fury at the offending party.</p>
               <p>The earth hogs in the Hottentot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are not unlike the hogs in Europe, only they are ſomewhat red; their heads are longer, their ſnouts more pointed, and they are quite toothleſs. The tongue of this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is very long and ſharp. When he is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry he looks out for an ant-hill, and placing himſelf near it, he ſtretches out his tongue to a great length, when the ants mount upon it in vaſt numbers, where they are held by a glutinous matter; and when it is well cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he draws it in, ſwallows them, and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ays out his tongue for more. His legs are long and ſtrong. He ſcratches holes in the ground, in which he hides himſelf, and is very expeditious at his work. If he gets but
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:020444_0056_0FAF10C022A12490"/>
his head and fore-legs into the earth, he holds ſo faſt, that the ſtrongeſt man cannot pull him out. His fleſh taſtes much like that of a wild hog.</p>
               <p>The porcupines of the Cape are about two feet high, and three long. The body of this animal is armed with a ſort of black and white quills very ſharp at the out-points, and not unlike gooſe quills ſtripped of the feathers. Thoſe on his back are about ſix inches long; but the longeſt are on his hind part: and theſe he darts at his purſuer, whether man or beaſt; but never does till they are pretty near him, and ſometimes does it ſo effectually that they ſtick in the fleſh, and cauſe a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pain and inflammation. His head and feet are like thoſe of a hare, and his ears re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe of a man. His fleſh is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and well taſted. This animal does great miſchief in the gardens; and therefore, when the breach is diſcovered by which he enters them, a muſket is planted againſt it charged and cocked: to the trigger is tied a ſtring, which runs cloſe along by the barrel to the muzzle, where a carrot or turnip is faſtened. The porcupine on ſeizing this bait, pulls the trigger, and is ſhot.</p>
               <p>The baboons at the Cape are very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and frequently enter the gardens and orchards, they being great lovers of fruit. On their entering them, they ſet a party to
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:020444_0057_0FAF10C0417F1E20"/>
watch upon the fences, and a number of them begin to ſtrip the trees, while the reſt ſtand at a diſtance from each other, in a line from the orchard or garden, to the place of rendezvous on the mountains. The fruit, as it is gathered, is toſſed to the baboon at the head of the line, and it immediately paſſes from paw to paw up to the mountains; they being ſo very nimble and quick ſighted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s hardly ever to fail catching in their paws the fruit that is thrown to them. All this is done with great ſilence and diſpatch. When the baboons upon the watch diſcover any body approaching, they give a loud cry, and the whole troop ſcowers away, as if deſtruction was at their heels, the young ones jumping up on the backs of their mothers. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they puniſh neglect in the ſentinels with death; for when any are taken or ſhot before the alarm is given, a quarrelling noiſe is heard among them on their getting back to the mountains, and it is not uncommon to find the bodies of ſome of them torn to pieces on the way.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt extraordinary animals at the Cape is called by the Dutch ſtinkbingſem, or ſtinkbox; ſtinking being the grand defence nature has given this creature againſt all its enemies. It is ſhaped like a ferret, and is of the ſize of a middling dog. When its purſuer, whether man or beaſt, is come pretty near,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:020444_0058_0FAF10C0F28D6BE8"/>
it pours from its tail ſo horrid a ſtench, that it is impoſſible to endure it. A man is almoſt knocked down by it before he can get away; and a dog, or other animal, is ſo ſtrangely confounded by it, that he is obliged every minute to ſtop, to rub his noſe in the gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, or againſt a tree. The ſtinkbingſem having thus ſtopped his purſuer, gets a great way a-head of him before the chace can be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if he comes up with him a ſecond time, he gives him another doſe, and by that means eſcapes again. Thus he proceeds till his purſuer is ſtunk out of the field. This animal is ſometimes ſhot by the Europeans, but they are obliged to ſuffer it to lie till it rots; for it is no ſooner dead, than its body contracts all over ſo nauſeous a ſmell, that if you do but touch it with your fingers, they retain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their houſes are generally no more than one ſtory high, and thoſe of Paris are, one with another, five.

The nobility of China are, indeed, like thoſe of other nations, fond of making a great appearance; but they are curbed by the cuſtoms of the country, and the danger of being taken notice of. While I was at Pekin, one of the chief Mandarines built himſelf a houſe ſomewhat more lofty and magnificent than the reſt. For this crime he was accuſed before t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In treating of Pekin, it would be doing that city great injuſtice to paſs-over in ſilence its noble gates, and ſtately walls.

                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:020444_0068_0FAF0FAB7087E3A0"/>The walls are anſwerable to the gates, ſo lofty that they hide the whole city, and ſo thick that ſentinels are placed upon them on horſeback. Square towers are raiſed at the diſtance of a bow-ſhot from each other. The ditch is dry, but very broad and deep, and the city is as regularly defended by a ſtrong garriſon, as if the people were under the continual apprehenſion of a ſiege.</p>
               <p>Among the moſt ſumptuous buildings of China, we ought not to omit their temples or pagods, erected to fabulous deities by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the princes as well as of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Of theſe there are a prodigious number, the moſt celebrated of which are built in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren mountains, to which, however, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the people has given the beauties and advantages denied them by nature: the canals cut at a great expence to conduct the water from the heights into reſervoirs made for that purpoſe, with gardens, groves and grottos made in the rocks, for ſhelter againſt the exceſſive heat of the climate, render their ſolitudes delightful.</p>
               <p>Theſe temples conſiſt partly of porticos, paved with large ſquare poliſhed ſtones, and partly of halls or pavilions that ſtand in the corners of courts, and communicate by long galleries adorned with ſtatues of ſtone, and ſometimes of braſs. The roofs of theſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhine with beautiful tiles japanned with
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:020444_0069_0FAF0FAC5260F4C0"/>
green and yellow, and at the corners are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with dragons of the ſame colour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting forward. Moſt of theſe pagods have a great tower ſtanding by itſelf, and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a dome, to which they aſcend by a handſome ſtair-caſe that winds around it. A ſquare temple commonly occupies the middle of the dome, which is often adorned with Moſaic work, and the walls covered with ſtone figures of animals and monſters in relievo. This is the form of moſt of the pagods, and theſe are the habitations of the bonzes, or the prieſts of the idol.</p>
               <p>The frontier towns, eſpecially thoſe near Tartary, are fortified with good bulwarks, towers, brick walls, and large and deep ditches filled with running water: in theſe all the ſkill of the Chineſe engineers conſiſts, which is no wonder, ſince none elſe were known in Europe before cannon were in uſe. Their moſt ſingular fortification is the great wall, which extends from the eaſtern ocean, to the province of Chanſi, and, if all its windings be reckoned, is no leſs than 500 leagues long. It is fortified with towers, much like thoſe of the cities; and where the paſſes might be more eaſily forced, they have raiſed two or three bulwarks one behind another, of an enormous thickneſs; theſe with the forts that command all the avenues, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:020444_0070_0FAF0FACF0754DD0"/>
protect the Chineſe from all attempts on that ſide. As China is divided from Tartary by a chain of mountains, this wall has been carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only through the valleys, but over the higheſt hills: it is every where of a great height, but rather lower than the walls of their cities, and only four or five feet in thickneſs: it is moſtly built with brick, and bound with ſuch ſtrong mortar, that tho' it is 1800 years ſince it was built, it is ſcarce the worſe. This work was at once one of the greateſt and the moſt ridiculous ever made by man: for notwithſtanding its being extremely pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thus to guard all the paſſes and the eaſieſt avenues, how abſurd was it to carry this wall to the top of ſome precipices which the birds can ſcarcely reach with their flight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to which it is impoſſible that the Tartarian horſe ſhould ever aſcend? beſides, if they could fancy it poſſible for any army to clamber up thither, how could they imagine that ſo thin and low a wall could be any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Yet it is amazing how the materials were conveyed thither, which was not done without a vaſt expence, and the loſs of more men than would have periſhed by the greateſt fury of their enemies, 'Tis ſaid, that during the reigns of the Chineſe emperors, this wall was guarded by a million of ſoldiers; but as that part of Tartary now belongs to China,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:020444_0071_0FAF0FADF3880058"/>
they are contented with manning well the worſt ſituated, but beſt fortified parts.</p>
               <p>There are in China above a thouſand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of the firſt rate; but though the reſt ſcarcely deſerve the name, they are all well garriſoned, whence ſome judgment may be formed of the vaſt armies conſtantly kept on foot.</p>
               <p>But what is far more aſtoniſhing is the number, the largeneſs, and the government of their trading towns. Theſe are generally di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ided into three claſſes, the firſt conſiſting of above an hundred and ſixty, the ſecond of two hundred and ſeventy, and the third of near twelve hundred. Beſides, there are near three hundred walled cities, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as not worth notice, though moſt of them are populous, and places of trade. The largeneſs of theſe cities is not leſs amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than their number. Pekin is not to be compared to Nankin, or, as it is now called, Kiam-nin, which was formerly encloſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three walls, the outermoſt of which was ſixteen leagues round; and though this city has loſt much of its former ſplendor, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thoſe who live in its ſuburbs, and on the canals, it is ſtill more populous than Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin. The ſtreets are of a moderate breadth, and very well paved; the houſes are low, but cleanly, and the ſhops richly furniſhed with ſilks, and other coſtly goods. Thither all
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:020444_0072_0FAF0FAE905ACC50"/>
the curioſities of the empire are brought. There the moſt famous doctors, and the mandarins out of employment, uſually ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, on account of the convenience of ſeveral libraries filled with choice of good books. Their printing is fairer, their artificers more ſkilful, the language more polite, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſmoother than elſewhere. Beſides the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Kiam on which it is ſituated, is the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, deepeſt, and moſt navigable in the whole empire.</p>
               <p>Nankin is famous for what is called the China tower. Of which it may be proper to obſerve, that there is without the city a houſe named by the Chineſe, the temple of Gratitude, built 300 years ago by the emperor Yonlo. It is erected on a maſſive baſis built with brick, and ſurrounded with a rail of unpoliſhed marble. Around it are ten or twelve ſteps, by which you aſcend to the lowermoſt hall, the floor of which ſtands one foot higher than the baſis, leaving a walk two feet wide all round it. The front is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with a gallery and ſome pillars. The roofs, which in China are generally two, one next the top of the wall, and a narrower over that, are covered with green ſhining tiles; and on the inſide the cieling is painted, and formed of little pieces differently wrought one within the other, and this the Chineſe eſteem very ornamental. Indeed ſuch a med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:020444_0073_0FAF0FAF2E921E80"/>
of beams, joiſts, rafters, and pinions, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſurpriſingly ſingular from our judging that ſuch a work muſt be very expenſive: but it only proceeds from the ignorance of the workmen, who are unacquainted with that noble ſimplicity, which renders our buildings at once ſolid and beautiful.</p>
               <p>The hall has no other light beſides that admitted at the doors, of which there are three very large ones, that open into the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Tower. This laſt ſtructure joins to the temple, and is of an octogonal figure, each ſide fifteen feet wide. A wall in the ſame form is built round it, at the diſtance of two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The tower is nine ſtories high, each ſtory being adorned with a cornice three feet wide at the bottom of the windows, and diſtinguiſhed by little penthouſes like the former, but narrower, and, like the tower, decreaſing in breadth as they increaſe in height. The wall, which, at the bottom is at leaſt twelve feet thick, and above eight feet and a half at the top, is all over incruſted with coarſe China ware, which has in a great meaſure retained its beauty, though the tower <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="unknown:020444_0074_0FAF0FAFF905B3B8"/>
in the walls of the upper rooms are ſeveral ſmall niches, in which are carved idols gilt. The firſt floor is the moſt lofty, and all the reſt of an equal height. This tower, from the bottom of the baſe to the top of the cupola, riſes at leaſt 200 feet from the ground. Towers of the ſame kind are erected in almoſt every city, and are ſome of their greateſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.</p>
               <p>Nankin was once famous for the largeneſs of its bells; but their weight brought the whole ſteeple to the ground. One of theſe which is ſtill entire, is eleven feet in height, and that of its ear is two feet, and its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumference is twenty two feet. But this is nothing, when compared with ſeven bells at Pekin, caſt 300 years ago, each of them weighing 120,000 pounds; theſe are eleven feet wide, forty round, and twelve high, beſides the ear, which is at leaſt three feet: but as much as their bells exceed ours in ſize, ours exceed theirs in ſound; perhaps chiefly owing to their clappers being o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> wood. Theſe bells are uſed to diſtinguiſh the watches of the night, of which they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reckon five. They begin the firſt with ſtriking one, which they repeat a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after, and thus continue till the ſecond watch; when they ſtrike two ſtrokes; at the third watch they ſtrike three, and ſo on; ſo that theſe bells ſerve as ſo many repeating
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:020444_0075_0FAF0FB10229D928"/>
clocks, which every minute inform you of the time of night. For the ſame purpoſe they in the ſame manner beat very large drums.</p>
               <p>Of all the public works in China, none do the people ſuch honour as their canals and bridges; nor is any thing more worthy of the attention of the curious. By means of theſe canals the whole trade of the empire is carried on, with the advantage of water car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and in this manner one may travel from Canton, the moſt ſouthern city, to Pekin the moſt northern, without travelling above one day by land. This, which is called the great canal, is 160 leagues in length. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe canals is very ſurpriſing; they are often lined on each ſide to the height of ten or twelve feet with fine ſquare ſtone, and in ſome places with a kind of marble of the colour of ſlate. The banks of ſome of them are 20 or 25 feet high on each ſide, and ſome extend above ten leagues together in a ſtraight line. But what moſt charms the eye is the great number of beautiful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mperial barks, loaded with the beſt productions of different provinces; many of them 80 tons burthen.</p>
               <p>As in an extent of 400 leagues in length, the earth cannot be every where, level, there are ſeveral cataracts, where the water is precipitated with greater or leſs violence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:020444_0076_0FAF0FB47574CC98"/>
to the difference of the level; but the induſtry of the Chineſe has found out a means of remedying the inconveniences that might ariſe from them with reſpect to navigation. At each of theſe waterfalls live a number of men who are employed in raiſing the barks. Theſe having drawn cables to the right and left, to lay hold of the veſſel, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that it cannot eſcape from them; they have ſeveral capſterns, by the help of which they raiſe it by little and little, till it be in the upper canal, and in a condition to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue its voyage.</p>
               <p>In ſome places where the waters of two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals have no communication, they have a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of making the boats paſs from one to the other, though the level may be above 15 feet different. At the end of the canal they have built a double ſloping bank of freeſtone, which uniting at the top extends on both ſides to the water of each canal. The bark is hoiſted up the ſlope by means of ſeveral capſterns, till being raiſed to the top, it ſlides down the other bank, like an arrow ſhot from a bow, and entering the other canal ſkuds away with prodigious ſwiftneſs. There are no ſuch obſtructions in the grand canal, and, indeed, the emperor's barks, which are as large as our frigates, could not be thus raiſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe canals are at proper diſtances covered
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:020444_0077_0FAF0FB6A1D51648"/>
with bridges of three, five, or ſeven arches; that in the middle is ſometimes 36, and even 40 feet wide, and ſo high that barks may paſs through without taking down their maſts; thoſe on each ſide are ſeldom leſs than 30, and diminiſh in proportion to the ſlopings of the bridge. Some of theſe bridges have but one arch, which is ſometimes ſemi-circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and built of arched ſtones five or ſix feet long, and only five or ſix inches thick. Theſe arches not being thick at the top, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſtrong; but then carts never paſs over them; for the Chineſe make uſe of porters to carry their bales. Several bridges have three or four great ſtones from 12 to 18 feet long placed on piers, like planks. There are a conſiderable number of this ſort neatly built over the great canal, whoſe piers are ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that theſe bridges ſeem to hang in the air.</p>
               <p>Many of theſe bridges are very handſome: one two leagues and a half from Pekin, was one of the fineſt that ever was ſeen, before part of it was b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On each ſide were ſeventy pillars, ſeparated by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges of fine marble, curiouſly carved in flowers, foliages, birds, and ſeveral ſorts of animals. On each ſide of the entrance at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>One of the moſt extraordinary bridges is built over the point of an arm of the ſea. It is 2500 Chineſe feet in length, and 20 in breadth. It is ſupported by 252 ſtrong piers, 126 on each ſide. All the ſtones are of the ſame bigneſs, as well thoſe laid from pier to pier, as thoſe that are laid croſſwiſe. It is difficult to conceive how ſtones of ſuch an enormous ſize ſhould be placed with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, or even raiſed to the top of ſuch high piers.</p>
               <p>In the way leading from Han-tchong-fou to the capital, the Chineſe have levelled mountains, and made bridges from one moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to another, and when the vallies were too wide, they erected pillars to ſupport them; theſe bridges which form part of the road, are ſo high, that one cannot look down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horror: four horſemen can ride abreaſt upon them, and for the greater ſecurity, they have rails on each ſide.</p>
               <p>Kircher obſerves, that in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince is a bridge of one arch, extending from mountain to mountain, whoſe length is 400 cubits, and its perpendicular height 500 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Saffron river, which runs under it.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:020444_0079_0FAF0FB85BA26EB0"/>To theſe extraordinary inſtances of induſtry, it will be proper to add, that the road from Signanfu to Hamtchoum, is ſaid to be one of the ſtrangeſt pieces of work in the world. I have been told, that upon the ſide of ſome mountains that are perpendicular, and have no ſhelving, the inhabitants have fixed large beams into them, upon which they have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a kind of balcony without rails, extending along the ſides of ſeveral mountains. Thoſe unuſed to theſe kind of galleries, cannot tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel over them without great apprehenſion; but the people of the place who have mules uſed to theſe roads, travel with as little fear and concern over theſe ſteep and hideous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, as they could do in the plaineſt heath.</p>
               <p>One cannot imagine the care that is taken of the common roads: theſe are as fine as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and are generally near 80 feet broad. At about a mile and a half diſtance from each other, are erected wooden ſtructures about 30 feet high, reſembling triumphal arches, with three gates, over which is wrote upon a large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The origin of the empire of China is as obſcure as the ſource of thoſe rivers that can ſcarce be diſcovered. The vulgar hiſtory of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:020444_0080_0FAF0FB8EA5F9478"/>
its monarchy is indeed manifeſtly falſe, ſince forty thouſand years are ſuppoſed to have paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince its foundation: but according to their regular hiſtory, which none of their learned men ever queſtioned, China has had its kings for above four thouſand years. It ſeems probable that the children or grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children of Noah diſperſed themſelves into Aſia, and at length penetrated into the moſt weſterly part of China, where they lived at the beginning in families, and the kings were fathers, to whom a long ſucceſſion of years, abundance of flocks, and other paſtoral riches, added authority. The foundation of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was laid by Fohi, whoſe wiſdom, power, reputation and virtue, together with his great age, made the people liſten to him as to an oracle. He regulated all private, as well as political, and religious affairs: thus the ſtate ſoon became in a flouriſhing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His ſubjects at firſt poſſeſſed the province of Homan, and ſome years after all the lands and territories that extend as far to the ſouth as the ſea.</p>
               <p>The people now principally applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the education of their children, and to agriculture, for which they had the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eſteem; they were laborious to exceſs. The judges and governors of provinces were grave and ſober, and by the equity of their deciſions gained the love and reſpect of all the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:020444_0081_0FAF0FB9C08A5228"/>
people; while the emperor placed his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt felicity in rendering his ſubjects happy, and did not ſo much conſider himſelf the ſovereign of a grand empire, as the father of a numerous family. By this means the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe acquired ſuch reputation, that they were conſidered by all the neighbouring nations as the oracles of wiſdom; and it is probable that from their firſt origin they conſidered themſelves as ſuperior to all other men; an opinion which they ſtill entertained after they had ſuffered as great revolutions in morals as in politics; and became ſo vain, that they fancied heaven had placed them in the centre of the univerſe to give laws to mankind, the wretched outcaſts who had been placed on the extremities of the creation, and who had ſcarcely the human form. But perceiving the Europeans inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all ſciences, they were ſtruck with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment. How can it be poſſible, ſaid they, that a people ſo far remote from us, ſhould have any wit or capacity? they have never peruſed our books; they were never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by us, and yet like us, they ſpeak and reaſon right. On ſeeing our ſtuffs, clocks, watches, and mathematical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their ſurprize encreaſed; for they had imagined that expert artificers were no where to be found but in China. They ſaw that we were not ſo barbarous as they had imagined, and in a joking way, cried,
<q>We ſuppoſed
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:020444_0082_0FAF0FBADEFEBCF8"/>
all other people to be blind, and that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had beſtowed eyes upon none but the Chineſe; that is not univerſally true; for though the Europeans do not ſee ſo clearly as we, they have at leaſt each of them one eye.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The countenance, air, language, diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manners of the Chineſe, differ not only from ours, but alſo from thoſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations. Of the perſons of the Chineſe in general we may form a pretty diſtinct idea, by conſidering that they entertain of beauty. They would have a man tall and fat, with a broad forehead, ſmall eyes, a ſhort noſe, great ears, a mouth of middling ſize, a long beard, and black hair. They are naturally as fair as we, eſpecially towards the north; but their faces being continually expoſed to the ſun, commonly renders them tawny as the Portugueſe in the Indies. Thoſe in the ſouthern provinces are of an olive complexion. The learned, eſpecially if of baſe extraction, never pare the nails of their little fingers, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them grow an inch long or more, to ſhew that they are not driven by neceſſity to work for their living.</p>
               <p>The men ſhave their heads all over, except the crown, where they ſuffer a long lock to grow; but they continually wear a bonnet or cap, which civility forbids their pulling off. That worn in ſummer is the form of a cone,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:020444_0083_0FAF0FBB2B2AB860"/>
round below, and terminating in a point. It is lined with ſattin, and the top covered with a fine mat, much worn in the country: to which they add a piece of red ſilk, that falls round about it and reaches to the edges; but when they walk, this ſilk ſlows irregularly on all ſides, and the continual motion of the head gives it a particular pleaſing grace. Sometimes inſtead of ſilk they wear long hair of a vivid ſhining red, and this is more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally uſed when they ride. This hair grows upon the legs of certain cows, and is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally white: but they give it a tincture that makes it dearer than the fineſt ſilk. In win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they wear a pluſh cap, bordered with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or fox-ſkins; the reſt is of fine black or purple ſattin, covered with a flake of red ſilk <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They in a manner cover the whole hand, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to be ſeen but the fingers ends. They keep the veſt cloſe about the body with a broad ſilk ſaſh, the two ends of which hang down to their knees. The Tartars ſtick a handkerchief to it on each ſide, with a ſheath for a knife and fork; a purſe, a tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, and other things. In ſummer they have the neck quite bare; but in winter they cover it with a ſattin collar faſtened to the veſt, or with a tippet of ſable or fox-ſkins, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three or four fingers broad, faſtened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a button.</p>
               <p>Over this they wear an upper garment with ſhort wide ſleeves like thoſe of the barriſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It begins with 24 trumpets, adorned with gold coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and 24 drums, each ranked in two files; 24 men with ſtaves ſix or eight feet long, varniſhed and gilt, follow in the ſame order. Then come 100 ſoldiers bearing halberts, on each of which is a ſemicircle of iron, in the form of a creſcent, followed by 100 ſerjeants at mace, and two officers bearing pikes pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with red varniſh, with flowers, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in gold. Then appear 400 lanterns curiouſly wrought, 400 flambeaux of a gilt wood that flames like our torches, 200 lances charged with huge tufts of ſilk, 24 banners, on which are painted the ſigns of the Zodiac, and 56 others that repreſent the celeſtial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations: there are alſo to be ſeen 200 large fans, with the figures of dragons and other animals; 24 umbrellas ſtill more magnificent, and a kind of beaufet filled with utenſils of gold, and borne by the officers of his palace.

<pb n="89" facs="unknown:020444_0091_0FAF0FC4FB4EE450"/>
court, all in their formalities. After them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear 500 young gentlemen of quality, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by 1000 footmen, dreſſed in carnation ſilk bordered with flowers, and ſpotted with ſtars of gold and ſilver. Immediately after appear 36 bearing an open triumphal chariot, and 120 bearers ſupport another cloſe one, ſo large, that it might be taken for an entire apartment. Then come four chariots, the two firſt drawn by elephants, and the other two by horſes: each of theſe carriages is guarded by a company of fifty men: the charioteers of the four laſt are richly dreſſed: and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants as well as the horſes are covered with embroidered houſings. At length this pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calvacade is cloſed by 2000 Mandarin officers, and 2000 officers of the army, all in rich habits, and marching with a ſolemn gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. It is not neceſſary for the court to be at great expence for this pomp; for whenever the emperor is pleaſed to make known his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to offer ſacrifice, they are always ready to attend him.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this parade, the houſes of the great have neither looking-glaſſes, tapeſtry hangings, nor wrought chairs: and even gildings are only uſed in the apartments of the emperor and the princes of the blood: all their magnificence conſiſts in their cabinets, tables, and varniſhed ſkreens, in their pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are not very extraordinary, and

in having ſeveral pieces of white ſattin inſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a moral ſentence on each in large cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, hung here and there in the chamber. Beſides theſe, porcelain or China ware is the ornament of every houſe; it is found on the tables, ſide-boards and even in the kitchen; for theſe are the ordinary veſſels, out of which they eat and drink. There are likewiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny huge flower-pots of it. The very architects cover roofs with it, and ſometimes make uſe of it to incruſt buildings.</p>
               <p>The Chineſe painters are very deficient in the art of drawing, particularly of human fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and they have a very imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of perſpective. Though ſtrangers are not admitted into the bed-chambers, yet their beds are very fine; in ſummer they have taffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty curtains powdered with flowers, trees, and birds, in gold, ſilk, and embroidery. Others have curtains of the fineſt gauze. In winter they make uſe of coarſe ſattin worked with dragons, and other figures; and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpanes are in the ſame taſte. They ſleep on thick cotton quilts inſtead of feather beds; and their bed-ſteads are of joiner's work, ſometimes finely wrought in figures.</p>
               <p>The emperor's authority is unbounded: he is almoſt adored by his people, who ſtile him the ſon of heaven, and the only maſter of the world. His words are conſidered as oracles; he is ſeldom ſeen, and never ſpoken to but on

the knee. In which poſture the grandees of the court, the princes of the blood, nay, his own brothers, bow to the ground, not only when he is preſent, but even before his throne. All places in the empire are at his diſpoſal: he confers them on whom he thinks fit, and none of them are ever ſold; honeſty, learning, long experience, and a grave and ſober beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour are the only qualifications in the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates; but if he diſlikes their management, he diſmiſſes them without ceremony. He has even the liberty of chuſing his ſucceſſor, whom he may nominate not only from the royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but from amongſt the pooreſt of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The old law-givers have from the firſt foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Yet every mandarin may tell the emperor of his faults, provided it be in a ſubmiſſive manner: and if he has any regard for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, the manner in which their hiſtories are written, is alone ſufficient to keep him in due bounds.

office appointed for that purpoſe.
<q>Such a day, ſay they, his behaviour was unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and intemperate; he ſpoke after a manner that did not become his dignity. The puniſhment he inflicted on ſuch an offender, was rather the reſult of paſſion, than of juſtice.</q>
Or elſe,
<q>He gave ſuch and ſuch marks of his love to his people. Notwithſtanding the commendations of his flatterers, he was not puffed up, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with his uſual modeſty; his words were tempered with ſweetneſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That theſe men may be neither biaſſed by fear nor hope, this office is never opened du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the prince's life, nor while any of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſit on the throne: but when the crown goes to another line, which often happens, theſe looſe memoirs are gathered together, and by comparing them, they compoſe the hiſtory of that emperor, to propoſe him as an example to poſterity, if he has acted wiſely, or to expoſe him to the public cenſure, if he has been negligent of his own duty, or the good of his people.</p>
               <p>The emperor has two ſovereign councils; one compoſed of the princes of the blood alone, and the other into which the miniſters of ſtate are alſo admitted. Beſides theſe, there are at Pekin ſix ſovereign courts, whoſe authority extends over all the provinces of China, and who have different departments
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:020444_0095_0FAF0FC7EA6FD4A0"/>
aſſigned them. One preſides over all the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darins; another has the management of the treaſury, and the care of raiſing the taxes; another has the care of religion, arts, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and foreign affairs; another preſides over the army; another over the public buildings and palaces, and another takes cognizance of all criminals. In each of theſe courts is a cenſor, who, though he is not of the council, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at all aſſemblies, and accuſes the manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins for the faults they commit both in their private capacities and in the execution of their office. Tis ſaid, that he who undertakes this office can never accept of another, that the hope of preferment may never tempt him to be partial to any one, nor the fear of loſing his place deter him from accuſing the guilty. Of theſe officers even the princes of the blood ſtand in awe.</p>
               <p>The province<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are under the immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of two ſorts of viceroys; one ſort has the government of only one province; and the other have under their juriſdiction, two or three, and ſometimes four provinces, all of whom have courts of the ſame nature as thoſe of Pekin, but are ſubordinate to them. The viceroy, in whom reſides the imperial autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, convenes the principal mandarins of his province to take cognizance of the good or bad qualities of the governors, lieutenants, and inferior officers, and privately informs
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:020444_0096_0FAF0FC8AA96EC70"/>
the emperor of thoſe who miſbehave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who are either deprived of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or cited to appear and juſtify their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. On the other hand the power of the viceroy is counterpoiſed by that of the great mandarins, who may accuſe him when he acts inconſiſtently with the good of the public, and even the people when oppreſſed by him, may petition the emperor for his removal. The leaſt inſurrection is laid at his door, which, if it continues three days, he muſt anſwer for at his peril. It is his fault, ſay the laws, if diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances ſpring up in his family, that is, in the province over which he has the charge.</p>
               <p>Cauſes are generally decided and ſentence given by a ſingle mandarin, who, after a ſhort proceſs, and the examination of both parties, orders the loſer to be baſtinadoed, either for carrying on an unjuſt proſecution, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a cauſe contrary to equity. This is the common puniſhment for the meaner ſort; but cannot be inflicted on a mandarin, till he is deprived of his office.</p>
               <p>The next puniſhment is a collar, made of two pieces of wood hollowed in the middle, and ſmaller or greater, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the crime; this is put on the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent's neck, and ſealed with the ſeal of the tribunal, with a piece of paper denoting the nature of the crime, and the duration of the puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:020444_0097_0FAF0FC9B43013B0"/>Theſe, except impriſonment, are all the puniſhments, which the Chineſe laws permit the mandarins to inflict on criminals: they may indeed condemn to exile; but their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence muſt be examined by the ſupreme courts. The capital puniſhment is ſtrangling. Mean and ignoble perſons are beheaded; for in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na the ſeparation of the head from the body is diſgraceful. On the contrary, perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are ſtrangled, which is a more honourable death: but if their crimes are great, they are puniſhed like mean perſons, and ſometimes their heads are cut off, and hung on a tree in the highway. Rebels, traitors, the children who murder a parent, and the ſervants who murder their maſter, are cut in pieces. After the executioner has tied them to a poſt, he cuts the ſkin of their foreheads, and tears it by force till it hangs over their eyes, that they may not ſee the torments they are to endure. Afterwards he cuts off the fleſh from their bodies wherever he think fit, and when tired of this barbarous employment, he leaves them to the tyranny of their enemies, and the inſults of the mob.</p>
               <p>As the emperor is conſidered as the father of his people, the greateſt reſpect is paid to the parental authority, and one cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how far this firſt principle of nature is carried. There is no ſubmiſſion, no point of obedience which a father cannot command:
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:020444_0098_0FAF0FCA415366B8"/>
he is an abſolute ſovereign in his own family while he lives, and at his death, is honoured as a God. He is not only abſolute maſter of his eſtate, which he may diſtribute to whom he pleaſes; but alſo of his concubines and children, whom he may even ſell to ſtrangers, if their behaviour diſpleaſes him; and if a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accuſes his ſon of any crime before a mandarin, there needs no proof of it; for if a father complains, they make no doubt but that the ſon is in the fault. If a ſon is ſo wicked as to mock his parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if he arrives at ſuch a height of madneſs as to lay violent hands on them, the province where it is done, is alarmed; the emperor himſelf judges the criminal; all the mandarins near the place are turned out, eſpecially thoſe of that town, who have been ſo negligent in their inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The neighbours are all reprimanded for neglecting, by former puniſhments, to ſtop the iniquity of the criminal before it aroſe to ſuch a height; for they ſuppoſe that ſuch a diabolical diſpoſition muſt have ſhewn itſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As to the criminal, they cauſe him to be cut in a thouſand pieces; they burn his mangled corpſe, deſtroy his houſe to the ground, and even thoſe that ſtand near it, and ſet up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents and memorials of ſo horrid an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:020444_0099_0FAF0FCAEA75D3C8"/>TO preſerve peace and order, the utmoſt modeſty and civility are inculcated; they have preſcribed forms of ſalutation and addreſs, and in paying viſits a great number of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ceremonies, kneeling, and cringing geſtures are to be obſerved. Their feaſts are ceremonious even to the moſt extravagant and ridiculous exceſs.</p>
               <p>Every gueſt has a ſeparate table without table-cloth, napkin, knife or ſpoon; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is ready cut to their hands; and they never touch any thing but with two little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments tipped with ſilver, which the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe handle very dexterouſly. They begin their feaſts with drinking wine, which is given to every gueſt at one and the ſame time, in a ſmall ſilver or china cup, which all the gueſts lift with both hands as high as their heads, thus preſenting their ſervice to each other without ſpeaking, and inviting each other to drink firſt. After the firſt cup, a large veſſel of haſhed meat is ſet on the table. Then every one obſerves the motions of the maſter of the feaſt: according as he gives the ſign, they take their two little inſtruments, brandiſh them in the air, and after twenty different motions, ſtrike them into the diſh, from which they bring up a piece of meat, which muſt neither be eaten too haſtily nor too ſlowly: in all this you muſt obſerve time, that all may begin and eat at once. Soon wine

                  </gap> ſame ceremonies as before. Then comes a ſecond meſs, which they dip into as in the firſt, and thus the feaſt is continued, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between every mouthful, till there have been twenty-four different diſhes at table, and they have drank as many cups of wine; but they drink as little as they will at a time, and their wine is ſmall. When all the diſhes are ſerved, no more wine is brought, and the gueſts may take out of any one of the diſhes before them; but it muſt be done when the reſt of the gueſts take out of ſome of the diſhes; for order and uniformity are held ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred. At this time they bring in rice and bread; for as yet nothing but meat has been brought; they alſo bring fine broths made of fleſh or fiſh, in which the gueſts may mingle their rice. They ſit at table grave and ſilent, till the maſter ſeeing they have all done, gives the ſign to riſe, on which they retire into the hall or garden; but in about a quarter of an hour return, when they find the tables cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſweetmeats and dried fruit, which they keep to eat with their tea. This enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment is followed by the entrance of a company of ſtrollers, who act a long tedious play.</p>

women invited thither for that purpoſe, who ſpend the day together in feaſting and ſports, while the huſband entertains his friends in another room. This being the firſt time in which the bride and bridegroom fee each other, both, or one of them frequently diſlik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bargain, it is a day of rejoicing to their gueſts, but of ſorrow to themſelves. The woman muſt ſubmit, though ſhe don't like the man; but the huſband is not always ſo complaiſant; for ſome on opening the chair to receive the bride, repulſed by her ſhape and aſpect, have ſhut it again, and ſent her back to her friends, chuſing rather to loſe their money than take poſſeſſion of ſo bad a purchaſe.</p>
               <p>A huſband cannot divorce his wife, except for adultery, and in a few other caſes that ſeldom happen; the huſband may then ſell his wife; but if he diſpoſes of her without juſt reaſon, both the buyer and ſeller are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed; yet the huſband is not oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take her again. The Chineſe are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo extremely jealous, that they will not ſuffer their wives to be a moment in private even with their own brothers. The men may have as many concubines as they pleaſe, and their children have an equal claim to the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; they are indeed eſteemed the children of the wife, and they accordingly call he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

houſe; and the concubines ſerve and honour her.</p>
               <p>Yet the people who are diſtreſſed by want, are permitted to expoſe their children. Thus when the family feels the diſtreſs of penury, when the mother falls ſick, or when ſhe has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o milk, it is common to condemn the poor helpleſs innocent to periſh in the ſtreets: and frequently they are ſo void of humanity as to engage their midwives to ſtifle the females in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As the whole frame of the Chineſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is founded on filial piety, they pay the greateſt honour to their deceaſed parents. The uſual time of mourning is three years; but it is commonly reduced to 27 months, during which they cannot exerciſe any public office; ſo that a mandarin is obliged to quit his government; to live retired, and give himſelf up to grief. The mourning colour is white. The funeral is pompous and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and a ſon will ſometimes ſell himſelf to buy a magnificent coffin for his father. They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

pitch, and without japanned: however, if a ſon does not, at laſt, cauſe the corps of his father to be laid in the tomb of his anceſtors, however diſtant it may be, he will loſe his reputation.</p>
               <p>The Chineſe are pagans of ſeveral ſects: one of the principal of which is compoſed of the worſhippers of Foe or Fo; a religion brought from India. Theſe believe tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, and their bonzes, or prieſts, who are frequently great hypocrites, groſly impoſe on the credulity of the people. Two of theſe bonzes one day ſeeing two large ducks in a rich farmer's yard, fell on their faces before the door, and burſting into bitter lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the good woman, who ſaw them from the chamber window, came down to aſk the cauſe of their affliction. They informed her, that the ſouls of their fathers inhabited the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of thoſe creatures; and that the dread of her killing them, was what they could not ſupport. The woman anſwered that ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſell them; but as they were thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> two ducks to their care, and allowed them to
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:020444_0105_0FAF0FD32F9BA328"/>
keep them for ſome time. They took them with the appearance of the greateſt reſpect; and proſtrated themſelves before the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious ducks; but that very evening made an entertainment for ſome others of their order, and the ducks were eaten for ſupper.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe get money from the people by public acts of penance, which are ſure to procure them the eſteem and compaſſion of the ignorant multitude. I have ſeen them drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a long iron chain, as thick as one's arm, and about 30 feet long, faſtened to their neck or legs. Thus it is, ſay they, at every door as they paſs, that we expiate your faults; and ſure this deſerves ſome alms. Others in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic places ſtrike their heads with large bricks, till they are almoſt covered with blood. One day I met in the middle of a town, a young bonze, of a good mein, and with ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and modeſt look as might eaſily move compaſſion. He ſtood upright in a ſort of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Two fellows were hired to carry him from houſe to houſe, while he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to excite compaſſion, by telling the people that he was ſhut up in that chair for the good of their ſouls, and was reſolved never to leave it till they had bought all the nails, of which there were above 2000, at the value of ſix-pence
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:020444_0106_0FAF0FD3E974CEE8"/>
each; the ſmalleſt of which, he ſaid, would derive incomparable bleſſings on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and families; ſince their charity would be beſtowed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the God Fo, to whoſe honour they were going to build a temple. The bonze directing his diſcourſe to me, I adviſed him to leave his priſon, and go to the temple of the true God, to be inſtructed in heavenly truths, where he might ſubmit to penances leſs ſevere, but more wholeſome. He calmly replied, that he was obliged to me for my advice; but would be much more ſo, if I would buy a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of his nails, which would certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me a good journey. Here, hold your hand, ſaid he, take theſe, on the faith of a bonze, they are the beſt in all my ſedan, for they prick me the moſt, yet you ſhall have them at the ſame rate, at which I ſell the others. The tone in which he uttered theſe words would, on another occaſion, have made me laugh: but I left him with a mixture of pity and contempt.</p>
               <p>The Chineſe are, however, ſometimes wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of paying uſeleſs addreſſes to their idols, which are very numerous: for it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that if after worſhipping them a great while, the people do not obtain the bleſſing they deſire, they uſe them in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful manner; ſome load them with hard names, and others with hard blows: we lodge you, ſay they, in a magnificent temple, we
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:020444_0107_0FAF0FD4AE8D6390"/>
cover you with gold, and offer to you food and incenſe, and after all you are ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to refuſe our requeſts. They then tie the idol with cords, pluck it down, drag it along the ſtreets, through all the mud and dunghills. Yet if they ſoon after obtain their deſire, they then take the idol, and with great ceremony carry it back, and place it again on its niche, after they have waſhed it clean, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down before it, and made excuſes for what they have done; promiſing that if it will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what is paſt, they will gild it again.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſects are, however, only tolerated; the religion of the court, and that of the mandarins, conſiſts in following the precepts and doctrines of Confucius, an excellent moral philoſopher, and thoſe of the other ſages of antiquity; which they have intermixed with many idolatrous and ſuperſtitious cuſtoms. They are far from abſtaining from fleſh: and almoſt all the people not only feed on the animals that are uſually eaten in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; but on cats, dogs and horſes, and even on ſuch creatures as die of themſelves; though their principal food is hogs.</p>
               <p>The Chineſe in writing do not uſe pens made of quills, like the Europeans, nor canes or reeds like the Arabians, nor crayons like the Siameſe; but only hair pencils. When they ſit down to write, they have upon the table a piece of poliſhed marble, with a hollow at
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:020444_0108_0FAF0FD5701130E8"/>
one end, that contains a little water, into which dipping a ſtick of Indian ink, they rub it upon the ſmooth part of the marble, and into the liquid ink thus made, dip their pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Every word has a different character; for they have no idea of expreſſing ſounds on paper, by the letters of an alphabet. They write from the right to the left, and end their books where we begin ours; ſo that our laſt page ſtands in the place of their firſt.</p>
               <p>The Chineſe paper is made of the inner bark of the bamboo, which is ſoft and white: this they beat in clear water; after which it is formed into ſheets by being taken up in long and broad frames. Some of theſe ſheets are ten or twelve feet long; they are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing white and ſmooth, and each ſheet is dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in allum water, inſtead of ſize. They have alſo paper made of cotton, which is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the whiteſt, fineſt and moſt uſed.</p>
               <p>Printing, which is in a manner in its infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Europe, has been uſed from all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in China: but their manner of printing is very different from ours. As they have no letters, they are obliged to cut the marks which ſtand for words on even blocks of wood. He who intends to print a book, has it fairly wrote, and then the wood cutter glews each leaf upon an even ſmooth pear-tree board, and cuts out whatever is not to appear when
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:020444_0109_0FAF0FD62B253250"/>
printed, leaving the characters as perfect as thoſe of the original. Having thus prepared the block, they rub it over with a bruſh dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in ink, and placing the paper upon it, they rub a dry bruſh gently over the back of the paper, preſſing it down a little, that it may imbibe the ink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and take the impreſſion. All this is done with great expedition. They print only on one ſide of the leaf, and finiſh a whole book in the manner here deſcribed; after which it is bound, and covered either with a neat ſort of grey paſteboard, or with fine ſattin or flowered ſilk, which coſts little, and ſome are covered by the binders with red brocade, interſperſed with gold and ſilver flowers.</p>
               <p>The Chineſe have a variety of books on morality, medicine, on agriculture, on plants, on the military arts, on hiſtory, aſtronomy, philoſophy, and the mechanic art, romances, comedies, tragedies, and abundance of treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es compoſed by the bonzes, on the worſhip of the deities of the country: ſo that ſome of their public libraries are ſaid to contain 40,000 volumes.</p>
               <p>The Chineſe are well ſkilled in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſilk-worm, and in raiſing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing the richeſt ſilks; in making cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets reſembling thoſe of Japan; and are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly famous for their porcelain, ſo well known in Europe by the name of China.</p>

employed in nothing but levelling them; and their manner of meliorating their ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to let water through it, they could not think of a better way of rendering the whole country fertile, than that they have taken; for was it not for their numerous canals, thoſe parts that lie higheſt would have been ſubject to continual drought, and the reſt have lain always under water. Their mountains are cut out like a pair of ſtairs, from the top to the bottom, that the rain-water may ſpread equally, and not waſh down the ground with its ſeeds. A long ſeries of ſuch hills, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with ſuch terraſſes, loſing in breadth as they gain in height, afford a very entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing landſcape.</p>
               <p>Their mountains are, for the moſt part, leſs ſtony than ours, and covered with a mould that is light, porous, and eaſily cut; and what is moſt ſurpriſing, ſo deep, that in moſt provinces you may dig three or four hundred feet in depth before you come to the hard rock. Nature, however, has not every where equally diſtributed her favours; for ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are naturally ſo fertile, as to yield two crops a year; while others owe their fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the indefatigable labour of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen. They have mountains, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce gold and ſilver, iron, tin, and mercury. Their ſilver mines are not now worked; but as for their gold, the torrents waſh great
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:020444_0115_0FAF0FDAF1676278"/>
quantities of it into the plains, and a number of people are ſolely employed in looking for it among the ſand and mud, where it is found ſo pure as to need no refining.</p>
               <p>The mines of common copper ſupply the empire with ſmall money. But the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſort of this metal is white copper, which is of that colour when dug out of the mine, and more ſo on the inſide than without. It appears by many experiments made at Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, that its colour is owing to no mixture: on the contrary, all mixtures diminiſh its beauty; for when it is rightly managed, it looks exactly like ſilver; but there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of mixing a ſmall quantity of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther metal with it, to ſoften it and prevent its brittleneſs; and therefore thoſe who would have it keep its fine colour, mix it with a fifth part of ſilver.</p>
               <p>There are in China alſo many mines of pit-coal, of which there is a very great conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the mountains are found lapis arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, cinnabar, vitriol, allum, jaſper, rubies, rock cryſtal, load-ſtones, porphyry, and quarries of different kinds of marble.</p>
               <p>The canals of China have been mentioned among the works which ſhew the art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the inhabitants; and the rivers from whence they derive their ſources are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. The river Kiam riſes in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Yunnan, and after having watered
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:020444_0116_0FAF0FDBF6850418"/>
three other provinces, and run a courſe of 400 leagues, diſcharges itſelf into the eaſtern ſea. The Chineſe have a proverb, that "The ſea has no bounds, and the Kiam no bottom:" and indeed in ſome places they have found none; but as their pilots never carry a cord of above fifty or ſixty fathoms in length, the impoſſibility of finding a bottom with their ordinary plummet, probably gave riſe to this hyperbole. This river is in many places extremely rapid, and the paſſage along it is very dangerous.</p>
               <p>China abounds with lakes, one of which named the Jau, is thirty leagues in circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and is like the ſea, ſubject to ſtorms: indeed almoſt every province, has lakes of a prodigious extent; theſe have a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the rivers and canals, and are well ſtocked with fiſh.</p>
               <p>The plains are extremely beautiful, they are all cultivated, and ſo afraid are the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of loſing an inch of ground, that they have neither hedge nor ditch. All the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern and weſtern provinces bear wheat, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, ſeveral kinds of millet and tobacco, with black and yellow peaſe, with which they feed their horſes, as we do with oats: the plains to the ſouth, being a watery country, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce rice. The huſbandmen firſt ſow it like other corn, and when it is grown about two feet from the ground, pull it up by the roots,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:020444_0117_0FAF0FDC80DF05C0"/>
and ſet it in ſtrait lines, checquerwiſe, in ſmall parcels like ſheaves, that the ſtalks may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port each other, and the eaſier reſiſt the wind.</p>
               <p>The ſoil is proper for all manner of fruits; it produces apricots, peaches, pears, apples, ſigs, grapes of all kinds, and eſpecially excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent muſcadines. There are alſo pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, walnuts, cheſnuts; and in general all that we have in Europe; but as the Chineſe are ſtrangers to the art of grafting, they are for the moſt part inferior in goodneſs to ours, and there is no great variety among each diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct ſort.</p>
               <p>In the ſouthern provinces grow other fruits that are in greater eſteem among the natives; for beſides oranges of ſeveral kinds, lemons and citrons, which were many years ago brought into Europe, there are other fruits that have a fine taſte and flavour, that ſeem peculiarly natives of the country; particularly what they call the linchi, which is of the ſize of a date, and has a ſoft pulp of a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able taſte, which it partly loſes on its becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dry and wrinkled like a prune. Ananas, gauvas, bananas and cocoas have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted from the neighbouring iſlands. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe there is a tree which bears a ſmall fruit that in ſhape, colour, ſhell, and taſte, is extremely like a pea. This tree is common in ſeveral provinces, and in reſpect to its
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:020444_0118_0FAF0FE01867BDE0"/>
height, its ſpreading branches, and the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its trunk, is excelled by few.</p>
               <p>Among their trees are the four following. The firſt is the varniſh tree, which is of a ſmall ſize, and has a leaf reſembling the wild cherry: a gum diſtils from it drop by drop like the tears of the turpentine-tree; and if an inciſion be made in it, it yields a greater quantity of liquor; but then it ſoon deſtroys the tree. The varniſh is much uſed, and is greatly eſteemed by the artificers: it takes all colours alike, and if it be well managed, neither loſes its luſtre by the change of the air, nor the age of the wood to which it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another tree from which a liquor is obtained that differs but little from varniſh.</p>
               <p>Another is termed the tallow-tree. This is as large as a high cherry-tree: the leaves are of a lively red, and the ſhape of a heart; the fruit is contained in a rind, which, when ripe, opens in the middle like a cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut: it conſiſts of white kernels of the ſize of a hazel-nut, whoſe pulp has the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of tallow, and of which candles are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly made.</p>
               <p>The white wax-tree is no leſs extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It is not ſo tall as the tallow-tree; and has longer leaves and a whiter bark. A ſmall kind of worm fixes itſelf to the leaves, and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:020444_0119_0FAF0FE1A0570998"/>
forms a ſort of comb, much ſmaller than an honey-comb, the wax of which is very hard and ſhining, and of far greater value than the common bees-wax.</p>
               <p>They have moſt kind of woods that are to be found in Europe, and ſeveral others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which is the tſe-tam, or roſe-wood, which is of a reddiſh black, and full of fine veins that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ems painted. This wood is fit for the fineſt ſort of joiner's work.</p>
               <p>Among the ſhrubs, the moſt extraordinary is that of tea, which is diſtinguiſhed into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral different ſorts. One of the principal of them is the ſong-lo, which we call green tea. It is planted in the manner of vines, and if not cut, will grow ſeven or eight feet high. The flower is white, and in the ſhape of a roſe, in the autumn; when it drops off, there appears a berry in ſhape of a nut, a little moiſt, and of no bad taſte.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of the tea ſhrub which grows in the province of Fo-kien, and is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vui, or bohea. The only difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this tea and the former, is, that the leaves of that are longer and ſharper pointed, and thoſe of the latter of a darker colour. This laſt being eſteemed more ſalutary is moſt generally uſed throughout the empire</p>
               <p>From this ſhrub are prepared three ſorts of tea; the firſt, of the tender leaf when newly planted, which is ſeldom expoſed to ſale; but
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:020444_0120_0FAF0FE2318381B0"/>
ſerves to make preſents of, and to ſend to the emperor: this is called man-cha, or imperial tea. The ſecond conſiſts of leaves of a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible growth, and is eſteemed a very good ſort. The remaining leaves are ſuffered to arrive at their full growth, and this makes a third ſort; and a fourth is made of the flower itſelf.</p>
               <p>There are alſo ſeveral other kinds of teas: but they are very little different from the two principal ſorts, except in what is owing to the nature of the ſoil in which they are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>The flowering trees and ſhrubs are very numerous throughout the empire. In th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe the Chineſe have the advantage of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, as the Europeans have of them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the flowers that ſpring from ſeeds, and ſmall roots. Large trees are to be ſeen there that perfectly reſemble tulips; the flowers of others are like roſes, which intermixed with the green leaves, make a very beautiful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
               <p>Among the animals is an odoriferous deer, which is without horns; the hair is of a blackiſh colour; and its muſk-bag is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a very thin ſkin, covered with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fine hair; the fleſh is good to eat, and ſerved up at the beſt tables.</p>
               <p>Among the other animals horſes, which are very indifferent, ſmall aſſes and mules,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:020444_0121_0FAF0FE304976E28"/>
ſome cows and buffaloes, white goats and black hogs, which laſt are excellent food, greatly ſuperior to the pork of Europe. There are alſo a prodigious number of bucks, does, wild boars, elks, hares, rabbits, and ſquirrels.</p>
               <p>In the ſouthern provinces are parrots of all ſorts, exactly reſembling thoſe brought from America. They have the ſame plumage, and the ſame aptneſs for talking: but they are not comparable to the bird called the golden hen. There is no bird in Europe any thing like it. The livelineſs of the red and yellow, the plume on the head, the delicate ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the tail, the variety of colours in the wings, together with a well ſhaped body, render it the moſt beautiful of the feathered kind; beſides, the fleſh is more delicate than that of the pheaſant.</p>
               <p>I cannot conclude this account of China without mentioning a ſingular method by which all kinds of fiſh are diſperſed into diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent provinces even before they have life. About the month of may the Chineſe draw mats acroſs the great river Yang-tſe-Kyange in order to ſtop the ſpawn, which they know how to diſtinguiſh at firſt ſight, tho' the water is ſcarce altered by it, with this water mixed with ſpawn, they fill many veſſels, which they ſell to the merchants, who go thither at that ſeaſon in great numbers to buy
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:020444_0122_0FAF0FE4083A4708"/>
it, and tranſport it into different provinces. This they ſell by meaſure to thoſe who have fiſh-ponds belonging to their houſes. In a few days the young fry begin to appear in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhoals; but the different kinds of fiſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſoon diſtinguiſhed.</p>

The two former are of the maſculine gender, and differ only in this circumſtance, that the firſt have theſe two large and long tuſks, while thoſe of the majanis are but ſmall. The females have none at all: on the other hand, they have two breaſts between their fore-feet; by means of which they ſuckle their young. They do not walk or run in a diagonal manner like other quadrupedes, but rather ſideling, lifting up the two feet, which are on the ſame ſide, from the ground at once; in conſequence of which, they do not run very faſt. It is almoſt ſuperfluous to mention here, that the elephant's ſkin is of an aſh grey colour, ſmooth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without ſcales; and that there is only one part of him in which he is vulnerable by a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ſhot, and that is, between the eye and the ear.

Theſe trees ſtand very cloſe and near to each other; and where there is any gap, very ſtrong paliſades are brought to fill it up, ſo that the elephants cannot by any means get out. As ſoon as the hunters have given information that they have diſcovered a tolerable numerous troop of elephants, the principal people of Ceylon are obliged to bring together ſeveral thouſand men. By means of theſe the whole drove, thus incloſed is driven ſlowly towards the firſt opening of the korahl, that takes up an enormous ſpace. When they have got them thus far, the game is, as it were in their hands. The whole train of huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and country people now unite, and draw up cloſe into this opening, and making a great noiſe and uproar, as well by their cries as inſtruments, which they carry with them for the purpoſe, they contrive to get the elephants, who keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one drove, like a happy and peaceful family, into the ſmaller ſpace, which is called the ſporting korahl. Here there is likewiſe formed a paliſadoe (as it were) of ſix or ſeven thouſand men, who make a large fire, and at the ſame time an intolerable din with ſhouting, drumming and playing on the hautboy of that country, ſo that the elephants are frightened; and inſtead of going backwards, move forwards towards the ſmalleſt ſpace, called the <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When one of theſe beaſts has thus been led out of the korahl, the others follow more willingly, being all in hopes of obtaining their liberty, as they have ſeen nothing to make them ſuſpect the fate of the firſt that went out. When the hunt is quite finiſhed, and all the elephants are ſeen faſt bound to trees. In that manner they are to ſtand ſeveral days, being all the while kept low in point of food, in order that they may know that they are not now their own maſters, but ſubject to the will of others. Attendants are placed by the ſide of each animal, who give him his food by little and little, to the end that he may learn to diſtinguiſh, and grow acquainted with mankind. At firſt he looks very ſour on an attendant of this kind; in the courſe of a few days, however, he becomes more reſigned to his fate, and allows the former to come near him and handle him. He likewiſe ſoon comes to underſtand what his governor ſays to him; and even ſuffers a ſtrong rope to be thrown round his neck, with which
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:020444_0129_0FAF0FE96D5FC0D0"/>
rope he is coupled to a tame elephant, and ſo led into the ſtable. This is performed in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. A tame elephant has, on either ſide of him a wild one; and, if he is of a great ſize, he has even two ſmaller ones on each ſide. The kornack ſits on the tame animal with his ſharp-pointed hook, with which he turns the creature by the head the way he would have him go, and thus leads his captured elephants to their ſtables, in which are driven down ſtout poles, or trunks of trees. To theſe they are faſtened by the hind leg, at ſome diſtance from each other, ſo that they cannot come together; and thus they are ſuffered to ſtand, being fed daily with cocoa-nut leaves, and once a day led to water by the tame ones, till the proper time arrives for taking them to market and ſelling them. It is eaſy to imagine, that this kind of hunting is attended with more trouble, noiſe and tumult, than thoſe which are ſet on foot by our princes and great people in Germany, as neither dogs nor fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms can be uſed here. But what is moſt to be admired in all this affair is, the great boldneſs of the huntſmen, who know how to manage this animal, in itſelf ſo terrible, as readily as a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful huntſman in our country manages his hounds. Theſe kornacks or huntſmen, have a trifling pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but the country fellows that help to drive the elephants together, have only that one day taken off from the number of days on which they
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:020444_0130_0FAF0FEA35D1B1D8"/>
are obliged to labour, as vaſſals, on ordinary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another method of taking theſe animals, is that which is practiſed (in the countries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively ſubject to them) by the orders of the ſeven tributary princes, whom I mentioned in a curſory manner, when I was treating of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive power of the governor. They have pits, ſome fathoms deep, in thoſe places whither the elephant is wont to go in ſearch of food. Acroſs theſe pits are laid poles, covered with leaves, and in the middle baited with the food of which the elephant is fondeſt. As ſoon as he ſets eyes on this, he makes directly towards it, and on a ſudden finds himſelf taken unawares. His new ſituation at firſt ſets him almoſt mad; at length however he becomes cooler, and bethinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what he ſhall do in theſe diſagreeable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Accordingly, having firſt thrown from him the materials of his ſnare, which had fallen in with him, he makes ſome endeavours at getting out; but finding himſelf too heavy to accompliſh this, he cries out for ſome of his own ſpecies, to come to his aſſiſtance. At length he ſees ſome of them coming towards him, and flatters himſelf that they are come to help him out. This, in fact, they do; but being of the tame, domeſticated kind, as ſoon as they have pulled him out by means of ropes, they make him priſoner, and deliver him up into the hands of their leader. If he appears diſcontented at this
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:020444_0131_0FAF0FEA73F740D0"/>
treatment, and endeavours to regain his liberty, he gets well thraſhed; and is diſciplined in this manner, till he ſubmits with a good grace to be fettered and led any where, juſt as his driver pleaſes. That he may be got out the eaſier, the pit is made rather ſhallow, and ſhelving on one ſide, ſo that he can in ſome meaſure help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out; otherwiſe it would not be poſſible to draw out ſuch a large and heavy animal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing him ſome damage.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third and laſt ſpecies of capture, is that practiſed by the Moors (as they are called in thoſe parts, from their following the doctrines of the Koran) who by theſe means are enabled to pay their rents to the lords of the manor, the Dutch Eaſt India Company. It conſiſts of the following manoeuvres: in times of drought, when the elephants, being in want of water, are uſed to haunt certain particular ſpots, where they know they ſhall find water to quench their thirſt; theſe people (a ſtrong and hardy race of men) go a hunting in parties, conſiſting of four men each, accompanied by ſome ſtout young lads, their children, whom they have brought up to this buſineſs; and in this manner ſearch the wood through, till they have found a herd of elephants. Having attained this point, they pitch on the largeſt of theſe animals, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually hovering about him, endeavour to get him away from the reſt. The elephant, on his part, wiſhes for nothing ſo much as to get
