            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AUTHORISED by a divine precept, <note n="*" place="bottom">Exodus 34.22.</note> and excited by the feelings of gratitude, the inhabitants of theſe northern provinces, have made it their conſtant practice, to meet in their religious aſſemblies, at the cloſe of the year, and devoutly offer unto the LORD, their ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>WHEN the fruits of the earth are gathered in, and we are furniſhed with proviſions for an expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive winter ſeaſon, nothing can be more proper, than for a people profeſſing godlineſs, to unite in paying their thankful acknowledgments to the father of the univerſe, for the expreſſions of his goodneſs.—And we rejoice, that the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tives of this Province, who, in the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſtate of our public affairs, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the moſt proper ways to <hi>recover</hi> and <hi>ſecure</hi> our invaded liberties, were not unmindful of the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013370_0004_0F90571AC8F793F8"/>
bleſſings we receive from GOD almighty; but have invited us to obſerve <hi>this</hi> as a day of general thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>BUT although we have much reaſon to bleſs the Lord, for the many expreſſions of his goodneſs, through the courſe of the laſt year, it is proper, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on this day of feſtivity,
<q>to humble ourſelves before GOD, on account of thoſe ſins, for which he hath ſuffered our preſent calamities to come upon us, and implore the divine bleſſing, that by the aſſiſtances of his grace, we may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to reform whatever is amiſs, that ſo GOD may be pleaſed to continue to us the bleſſings we enjoy, and remove the tokens of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See the recommendation from the Provential Congreſs, for a day of thankſgiving.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE exerciſes of this day, will therefore be different from what have been uſual; and I could think of no paſſage of ſcripture, more ſuitable to place at the head of a diſcourſe, in which we are to have reſpect, both to the bleſſings of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the public calamities which have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen us, than the words of David, which have now been read.</p>
            <p>A celebrated commentator on the text, has the following obſervations:—
<q>When GOD in his providence exerciſeth us with a mixture of Mercy and Judgment, it is our duty to ſing, and ſing unto him both of the one and the other: We muſt be ſuitably affected with both, and make ſuitable acknowledgments of both.</q>

Agreeable to the Chaldee paraphraſe,—
<q>If thou beſtoweſt mercy upon me, or if thou bringeſt any judgment upon me, before thee, O Lord, will I ſing my hymns for all.</q>

            <p>YOU will be ſenſible, the time allowed the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher on a day of thankſgiving, will not admit of an exact enumeration, either of the Bleſſings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us, or the calamities under which we ſuffer; we muſt therefore confine our attention to thoſe which are confeſſedly of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: But ſhould I a little exceed the limits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerved on theſe Occaſions, the nature of the ſubject, I hope, will be an apology for me.</p>
            <p>ALL who profeſs their belief of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, will be free to acknowledge, the mercy of God revealed in the goſpel, demands our firſt, our principle attention.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the darkneſs of the human mind, that had not the children of men, been favoured with the light of divine truth, they would never have found the way to glory. But the father of the univerſe, in compaſſion to the human race, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to miſery, in conſequence of the ſpread of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil through the World, was pleaſed to give his Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould

            <p>DEPUTIES were accordingly choſen by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral colonies from New-Hampſhire to South-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina.—They entered upon the important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to which they were appointed, as it become men profeſſing the religion of Chriſt.—They made their humble addreſſes to the Lord of the univerſe for the influences of his Spirit, to lead them in a ſafe path, ſucceed their endeavours to extricate an injured people from their preſent difficulties, and lay a foundation for laſting tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, both in Great-Britain and America.— Many prayers were made for them in our reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive churches, and by ſerious people in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate retirements.</p>
            <p>THE members who met in that illuſtrious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, were men of the firſt character in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral provinces: Men who beſt underſtood the rights of America, and were beſt able to judge what meaſures would be moſt proper for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in general to adopt, in order to recover and ſecure them.</p>

Had the Congreſs diſſolved without forming any general plans, or had the members been greatly divided in their opinions, it would have diſcouraged the friends of Liberty, and perhaps given a fatal turn to our public affairs: But their <hi>Union</hi> has not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the <hi>Union</hi> of their conſtituents, but had an happy influence to eſtabliſh many in their friendſhip to the American cauſe, who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wavering —Their doings <hi>will,</hi> as they moſt certainly <hi>ought to,</hi> have <hi>the force of laws.</hi>—The man that ventures to riſe in oppoſition to them, oppoſes both the wiſdom and ſtrength of this amazing continent; and certainly no man in his ſenſes will act ſo fooliſh, ſo deſperate a part.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013370_0017_0F90F3CCF60E1AB0"/>
declare it.—Whenever it ſhall appear to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees which are, or may be choſen in every county, city, and town, for executing the plans of the continental Congreſs, that any perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their reſpective limits, has violated the Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the truth of the caſe is to be publiſhed,—
<q>To the end, that all ſuch foes to the rights of Britiſh America, may be publickly known, and univerſally contemned as the enemies of American Liberty; and thenceforth we reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively will break off all dealing with him or her —And we do further agree and reſolve that we will have no trade, commerce, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or intercourſe whatſoever, with any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony or Province in North-America, which ſhall not accede to, or which ſhall hereafter violate this Aſſociation, but will hold them as unworthy of the rights of freemen, and as inimical to the liberties of their Country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHO would not dread ſuch a puniſhment, as much as any temporal evil that can be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?—To be cut off from the privileges of human ſociety and lie expoſed to univerſal contempt, is next, if not equal to being cut off from among the living.—People may affect to ſport with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular reſentment as much as they pleaſe, when they have a few companions to flatter and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them; but when that puniſhment, which they may ridicule at a diſtance, or think little of in its beginnings, falls upon them in earneſt, they muſt have fortitude more than human, to ſupport long under it.—A man of any tender feelings will be unhappy, when he knows a few of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance are offended with him; how wretched

muſt <hi>he</hi> then be, who is aſſured the reſentments of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt this whole continent, are raiſed againſt him, and that there is no town or village that he can viſit, on buſineſs, or for amuſement, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expoſed to the indignation of the inhabitants!</p>
            <p>I have dwelt the longer on this particular, becauſe it appears to me of ſingular importance.— The union which remarkably prevails through the Continent, at this <hi>alarming criſis</hi> affords great encouragement, and requires our thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to almighty GOD.</p>
            <p>IT is our duty, as we love righteouſneſs,—as we love peace,—as we love our Country,—as we love the parent ſtate,—ourſelves and millions of unborn poſterity, it is our duty, to do all in our power, to ſtrengthen and perpetuate, <hi>this union.</hi>— And was I not ſure, you are ready even of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I would urge you my friends and fellow citizens, by arguments which influence my own mind,

But a controverſy now ſubſiſts, which has a threatning aſpect on America, and Great-Britain herſelf.</p>
            <p>MANY calamities are already felt, more and greater are much to be feared.—Inſtead of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love, and a deſire of each others greatneſs, mutual jealouſies are ſtrongly exerciſed: The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing conſequence of which will be, <hi>mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prevent each others intereſt.</hi> A princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of ſelf preſervation, that law of nature, which has an uniform influence on the children of Men, will excite them to wiſh the diminution of that power which they ſuppoſe, is at preſent engaged againſt them, or in ſome future time may rival them.

            <p>IF Great-Britain is jealous of the increaſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the colonies, no doubt ſhe will exert her power to cheek their growth, or her policy to draw off their riches as faſt as they acquire them. And from the meaſures which have been purſued, with unremitting zeal for ſeveral years paſt, the Americans are made to believe, that Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain does not wiſh the Colonies to make further advances towards "<hi>powerful States</hi>".—The buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then is to embarraſs new ſettlements,—to lay ſuch burdens on the colonies now planted as to prevent emigrations to them from the crowded parts of Europe, and eſtabliſh ſuch laws as ſhall render, not only the money, but the <hi>perſons</hi> of Americans, the property of the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of the crown. <note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>THE execution of this buſineſs has given riſe to the calamities, we are this day called to lament.— The time would not allow us to go into a very particular conſideration of the calamities we now feel, together with thoſe which we fear may be permitted to fall upon us: Let it ſuffice to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thoſe which moſt ſenſibly affect us.</p>
            <p>SEVERAL laws, have of late been enacted by the Parliament of Great-Britain, for the expreſs purpoſe of raiſing a revenue in America. Had thoſe laws been executed according to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſign, the natural operation of them, would have conſtantly weakened the intereſt of the people in general, by giving their wealth to the ſervants of the crown.—Had thoſe laws been regularly executed the ſervants of the crown, would have had it in their power, either to riot on the ſpoils taken from the honeſt and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, or accumulate to themſelves great riches. The body of the people, being oppreſſed, would in time be obliged to ſell their lands, and other eſtates, and content themſelves, if contentment be poſſible in ſuch a ſtate, to be the ſlaves of imperious lords, on whom, hard neceſſity had taught them to depend, for their bread.—And ſhould they, remembering their former happy circumſtances, grow uneaſy and factious, a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

            <p>THAT ſuch laws have been enacted, and that any of them are now in force, we conſider as a calamity, and lament that GOD has in judgment, ſuffered it to befal the American colonies.—The laws now referred to, have already done unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable damage. The ſtruggles which have been made by adminiſtration to inforce them, and by the Americans in oppoſition to them, have not
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013370_0026_0F90F3D24C35AFC8"/>
only kept the whole continent in a ferment, but created ſuch an alienation of affections, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy jealouſies between the two countries, as we have reaſon to fear, will never be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p>IT is a calamity that the parliament have reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<q>That coloniſts may be tranſported to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and tried there upon accuſations for treaſon,—or concealments of treaſons commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the colonies.</q>
—Should any unhappy Americans be accuſed of treaſon, and proſecuted according to this act, a ſevere puniſhment would neceſſarily be inflicted on them, before it could be determined whether they were guilty or not.</p>
            <p>IT is a calamity that the roman catholic reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is eſtabliſhed through the vaſt province of Quebec, when, as a writer obſerves,
<q>The abject of the bill, is to cut off all the liberties of the reſt of the colonies.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The Canada Act has met with ſome <hi>ſmall</hi> advocates in theſe parts, who pretend the roman catholic religion is <hi>not</hi> eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by it; and that nothing more is deſigned by that part of it which has reſpect to religion, than a confirmation of what was ſtipulated by the treaty of peace.—But what ſay the GRAND AMERICAN CONGRESS to this matter?—
<q>In the ſeſſion of Parliament laſt mentioned, an Act was paſſed, for changing the government of Quebec, by which Act the Roman Catholic religion, inſtead of being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, as ſtipulated by the treaty of peace, is eſtabliſhed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE EARL OF CHATHAM has declared, that by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> Act, popery is <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi>: And LORD LYTTLETON, in his Letter to the abovementioned EARL, does not deny that the Roman catholic religion is <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Quebec, but endeavours to defend the whole Act, without exception.—After having ſaid,
<q>The Canadians are above one hundred thouſand, the Engliſh not more than two thouſand men, women, and children.</q>
And that
<q>the legiſlature was therefore to conſider whether the law and government ought to be adapted to the <hi>many</hi> or the <hi>few,</hi>
                     </q>
he goes on, to conſider that part of the bill which has reſpect to religion; and ſays,—
<q>The beſt diſtinction I know between <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> and <hi>toleration</hi> is, that the greater number has a right to the <hi>one,</hi> and the leſſer to the <hi>other.</hi> The public maintenance of a clergy is inherent to <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi>; at the reformation, therefore, as much of the church eſtates as were thought neceſſary for its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port were transferred to the proteſtant church, as by law eſtabliſhed. Surely then when the free exerciſe of the national religion was given to the Canadian nation, it could never be underſtood that they were to be deprived of their clergy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if not, a national proviſion for that clergy followes of courſe.</q>
—What we have here quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his LORDSHIP's Letter, is ſufficient to ſhew, that he not only conſidered the Canada Act as eſtabliſhing the Roman catholic religion in that country, but that he ſuppoſed the Britiſh Legiſlature, acted a wiſe and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part in ſo doing.—But his LORDSHIP's reaſoning does not carry with it the <hi>fulleſt</hi> conviction.— Suppoſe, by a ſtrange <hi>jeſuitical</hi> influence, in ſome future period, more than one half the inhabitants of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhould be converted to the Roman catholic religion, would the legiſlature be bound in duty to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> that religion, and only <hi>tolerate</hi> Proteſtants?—It muſt be ſo, it ſeems, if the beſt diſtinction between <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> and <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi> is, that the greater number has a <hi>right</hi> to the one, and the leſſer to the other.</p>
                  <p>Wiſe legiſlative bodies, will examine the nature and doctrines of a religion, before they favour it with an <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi>; If they find the doctrines of any religion are contrary to the holy Scriptures, and are perſuaded that it is, in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unfriendly to the ſafety and happineſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, certainly they will not <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> it, although, <hi>the greater number,</hi> (of the community) may, at preſent, be fond of it.—</p>
                  <p>Let us hear what the learned and pious BISHOP BURNET has ſaid of roman catholics, and their religion.—
<q>It is certain, that as all Papiſts muſt, at all times, be <hi>ill</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to a proteſtant Prince, ſo that is much more to be apprehended, when there is a pretended Popiſh <hi>heir</hi> in the caſe.</q>
—
<q>Learn to view popery in a true light, as a conſpiracy to exalt the power of the clergy, even by ſubjecting the moſt ſacred truths of religion to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances for raiſing their authority, and by offering to the world <hi>another method of being ſaved, beſides that preſcribed in the goſpel.</hi>— Popery is a maſs of impoſtures, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men, who manage them with great <hi>advantages,</hi> and impoſe them with inexpreſſible <hi>ſeverities,</hi> on thoſe who dare call any thing in queſtion that they dictate to them.</q>

                  <bibl>BISHOP BURNET's <hi>Hiſtory of his own times.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>If the roman catholic religion is what the good Biſhop has here declared, is it not aſtoniſhing, that any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can plead for its <hi>eſtabliſhment!</hi> For a Britiſh legiſlature to <hi>tolerate</hi> ſuch a religion, is as much, one would think, as they could do conſiſtent with their duty to GOD, and to that conſtitution of civil government, which they are bound to maintain.—</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid a religion is eſtabliſhed, where there are laws for the ſupport of it.—Thus is the church of England eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in a great part of the Britiſh dominions.—Thus are the congregational order and diſcipline eſtabliſhed in this Province, and thus is the roman catholic religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Canada.</p>

            <p>WE view it as a calamity, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have paſſed an act to alter our ancient method of appointing Juries.—With a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Council intirely dependent on the crown: With Judges and Sheriffs dependent on the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and all intirely independent on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we cannot ſuppoſe there is proviſion for the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice: But we have the greateſt reaſon to fear, ſhould any Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans be ſo unhappy, as to be brought into a diſpute with crown officers, or any, who on account of their <hi>good diſpoſition</hi> towards ſome late acts of Parliament reſpecting the Colonies, are called <hi>friends of Government,</hi> a jury returned by ſuch ſheriffs, would be under an influence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely threatning to the lives and liberties, of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013370_0031_0F90F3D6CDAD6378"/>
ſuch unfortunate ſubjects.</p>
            <p>THE noble Lords who entered their diſſent, have given a reaſon, which has reſpect to this part of the Act for regulating the government, ſufficient to convince every mind capable of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the force of argument, and is worthy to be writ in letters of gold.—They diſſent,—
<q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Governor and Council have the means of returning ſuch a Jury, in each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſe, as may beſt ſuit with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of their paſſions and intereſts. The lives, liberties and properties of the ſubject are put into their hands without controul, and the invaluable right of trial by jury is turned into A SNARE FOR THE PEOPLE, who have hitherto looked upon it as their main ſecurity againſt the licentiouſneſs of power.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Much to our purpoſe is the following extract from Doctor PETTINGAL's celebrated Enquiry into the uſe and practice of Juries among the Greeks and Romans.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The privilege that every Engliſhman enjoys of having his perſon and property ſo far ſecured, that no injury, under pretence of law can be done to one or the other, but by the conſent and approbation of twelve men of his own rank, is the greateſt happineſs that can belong to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the moſt valuable bleſſing that can attend ſociety; for by this means the poor ſtands in no fear of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his governor or powerful neighbour; and the hands of the great are tied up from diſturbing the public by making inroads upon the eaſe and property of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals below them.—So that the powers of each, in their reſpective ſtations, are hereby happily directed to carry on one and the ſame end, the peace, order, and good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the whole.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another place the ſame great Man writes,—
<q>The trial by Jury was founded on liberty, and contrived both in the Grecian and Roman polity, as a guard and protection of the lower people, againſt the <hi>power</hi> and arbitrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their ſuperiors.</q>
—And again,
<q>Civil liberty, being thus, both in Grece and Rome, founded in <hi>equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that is, a joint power and participation of enacting and executing laws, we hence ſee the reaſon why the <hi>trial by our equals,</hi> the <hi>legale judicium parium ſucrum,</hi> makes ſo great a figure in the character of Engliſh liberties; for while we are bound by no laws but thoſe <hi>we conſent to,</hi> and ſuffer no judgment under thoſe laws but by the approbation of honeſt men of our own rank and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who have no intereſt in injuſtice, but an expectation of the ſame candor and integrity in us upon ſome other occaſions, where perhaps we may be a jury on them or their affairs, there is no danger of being ruined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by arbitrary laws, or oppreſſed by the partial deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a corrupt Judge. This was the liberty and happineſs that aroſe from the <hi>equality</hi> which was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Greek and Roman conſtitution, and is <hi>the very ſpirit and life of our own.</hi>

               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:013370_0032_0F90F3D77130E540"/>WE view it as a calamity that the Britiſh Parliament have lately paſſed "an Act for regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the government" of this Province, by which the moſt important rights of our char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are violated, and the way is prepared for exerciſing an arbitrary and deſpotic government over us.</p>
            <p>ATTEMPTS to execute this act have already ſlung the Province into great diſorder.—The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants conſider their charter, granted on the faith of Kings, as ſacred, and they cannot be prevailed with, either by flattery or threats, to give it up.—Thoſe Gentlemen who have accepted the place of Counſellors on the new plan, are viewed as unfriendly to our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional liberties:—Our Courts of Juſtice are ſhut

up: And we are nearly reduced to a ſtate of nature,—In ſhort we have no ſecurity for life, or property, or any of the bleſſings of ſociety, but from the virtue and reſolutions of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in general.</p>
            <p>"TO change the government of a people", ſays the BISHOP of St. ASAPH, who is an honour to the <hi>ſacred order,</hi> and an ornament to human nature,—
<q>to change the government of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without their conſent, is the higheſt and moſt arbitrary act of ſovereignty that one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can exerciſe over another. The Romans hardly ever proceeded to this extremity, even over a conquered nation, 'till its frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts and inſurrections, had made them deem it incorrigible.—The very idea of it implies a moſt total and abject, ſlaviſh depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the inferior ſtate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THAT great and good man well knew, that attempts to change the government of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, would be productive of the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion:—<hi>"It will make them mad."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE noble Lords, who oppoſed the bill for regulating the government of this Province, entered their diſſent,—
<q>Becauſe, ſay they, we think the appointment of all the members of the Council, which by this bill is veſted in the crown, is not a proper proviſion for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the equilibrium of the colony conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. The power given to the crown of occaſionally increaſing and leſſening the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the council on the report of governors,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013370_0034_0F90F3DAD8B4DFF8"/>
and at the pleaſure of miniſters, muſt make thoſe governors and miniſters maſters of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry queſtion in that aſſembly, and by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its freedom of deliberation will wholly annihilate its uſe.</q>—</p>
            <p>BUT the calamities ariſing from the unhappy controverſy at preſent ſubſiſting between Great-Britain and America, with which <hi>we,</hi> the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>this town,</hi> are moſt ſenſibly, and in a peculiar manner affected, are yet unnoticed.</p>
            <p>WHEN we look back, on our once happy ſtate, and compare the bleſſings of peace and plenty, which we freely enjoyed, with our preſent diſtreſſes, "<hi>the tears are on our cheeks</hi>".
<q>How doth the the city ſet ſolitary that was full of people! How is ſhe become as a widow! She that was great among the nations, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs among the provinces, how is ſhe become tributary!</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Lamentations Chap. 1.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE GOD of nature has taught us by the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and uncommon advantages of this place, that it was deſigned for extenſive buſineſs: And <hi>here</hi> our fathers planted themſelves, that they and their poſterity might proſecute thoſe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of trade and merchandiſe, which give riches and ſtrength, to nations and ſtates.—And <hi>this,</hi> for many years, has been the peaceful reſidence of commerce and wealth.</p>
            <p>WHAT joy have we felt to ſee this capacious and ſafe harbour, <hi>white,</hi> with the canvaſs of our
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013370_0035_0F90F3DC4E8ABF70"/>
own ſhips, or of foreigners who came to exchange their treaſures, for the commodities which we had to ſpare.</p>
            <p>BUT how affecting is the change; How gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is the preſent appearance!—Look to our port, and you ſee it blocked up with Britiſh Ships of war —No veſſels of trade are allowed to enter this harbour.—Commerce which gave wealth to many, and the means of a comfortable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to thouſands, has now ceaſed.—The well built wharfs are either left naked, or lined with tranſports, which have been employed to bring the King's troops to this place.—Stores which were deſigned for merchandiſe, are, either unoccupied, or ſtrange to relate!—turned into bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks!—Our public ſtreets,—our moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant walks are filled with armed ſoldiers.—The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avenue to the town by land is fortified on each ſide, with heavy cannon, and ſtrongly guarded day and night.—In ſhort, all things wear the ſhocking appearances of war: Of war, not with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the wilderneſs, or thoſe foreign enemies with whom we have formerly engaged with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.—But,—how ſhall I ſpeak?—Of war between Great-Britain and the colonies!—Between fellow ſubjects!! Between brethren!!!</p>
            <p>BUT why theſe ſtrange appearances? Why is the power of Great-Britain <hi>ſo unnaturally</hi> directed againſt America?—Why is this Town filled with troops? Why is this port blocked up, and the trade of the place ruined?—certainly we muſt have been guilty <hi>as a people</hi> of the moſt daring crimes.— Nothing leſs than an open and generally avowed
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013370_0036_0F90F3DD1B01B628"/>
rebellion againſt the beſt of Princes, one would think, could juſtify ſuch treatment.—Have we been thus guilty?—Are we, thus charged?—No.— What then is our crime?—It is not <hi>pretended</hi> to be any more than a treſpaſs, committed by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known perſons, on private property.—Becauſe a number of people, we know not who, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome cargoes of Eaſt-India <hi>Tea,</hi> this whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity has been condemned, without trial, and is this day ſuffering in a manner that can ſcarcely be parallelled in the hiſtory of the world.</p>
            <p>IT is ſuppoſed by the rigorous manner in which the port act is executed, poverty, diſtreſs and calamity, are brought on 30,000 ſouls. <note n="*" place="bottom">The damages ariſing from the execution of the Port Act are immenſe: Suppoſing 30000 people ſuffer the loſs of 1<hi>ſ</hi> ſterling pr day, one with another; which I believe will be judged far ſhort of what is <hi>real,</hi> conſidering the deſtruction of Trade,— the multitudes flung into idleneſs,—the uſeleſs condition of ſhipping, Wharfs, Stores, Ware-Houſes &amp;c.

            <p>OTHER calamities might have been mentioned, and thoſe we have taken notice of enlarged upon, did the time admit.—You will juſt allow me to ſay, ſhould the Britiſh adminiſtration deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine fully to execute the laws, of which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain: Or in other words,—ſhould the prime mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter determine to LAY THE AMERICANS AT HIS FEET; and ſhould the new parliament grant ſupplies for that purpoſe, we have yet to fear the calamities of a <hi>long</hi> civil war: For, from the ſpirit now raiſed through this continent, and the <hi>firm union</hi> which ſubſiſts, it may be preſumed the ſtruggle would be obſtinate.</p>

            </p>
            <p>BUT we hope in GOD, and it ſhall be our daily prayer, that matters may never come to this.—We hope ſome wiſe and equitable plan of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation may take place.—For the ſalvation of the parent ſtate, as well as of theſe provinces, we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely hope the meaſures, with reſpect to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, adopted by the <hi>laſt</hi> parliament, and purſued with vigour by the miniſtry, may be eſſentially altered by <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE hope the rights and liberties of the colonies may be eſtabliſhed on a ſolid and immoveable ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis: And that this Town may emerge from its preſent diſtreſſed and moſt calamitous ſtate, and be a more proſperous, more rich and happy place than ever yet it has been.</p>
            <p>LET us then humble ourſelves before God on account of our ſins: Let us reform whatever is amiſs,—
<q>That ſo God may be pleaſed to continue to us the bleſſings we enjoy, and remove the tokens of his diſpleaſure, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing harmony and union to be reſtored be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great-Britain and theſe Colonies, that we may again rejoice in the ſmiles of our ſovereign, and the poſſeſſion of thoſe privileges which have been tranſmitted to us, and have the hopeful proſpect that they ſhall be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded down intire to poſterity, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant ſucceſſion, in the illuſtrious Houſe of HANOVER.</q>
