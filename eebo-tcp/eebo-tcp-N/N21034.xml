            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO contemplate the being and the works of GOD, is an employment at once the moſt noble, the moſt ſatisfying and delightful, that can poſſibly engage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the minds of intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Indeed this is the great end of their being. This is the employment of angels, and of all the heavenly hoſts. Their diſtinguiſhed powers, are conſtantly engaged in "looking into," and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring "the manifold wiſdom," order and beauty, which ſhine with peculiar glory in the works of their Maker. And after all the diſcoveries they have made, ſtill new, and increaſing wonders arise,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027629_0004_0FD554FCC114CB60"/>
which add freſh ardor to their deſires, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delight and happineſs to their minds. And thus it will continue to be, to all eternity.—And the nearer we reſemble theſe heavenly intelligences, the greater pleaſure ſhall we take in viewing and contemplating theſe objects: until, loſt in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, we ſhall be ready to exclaim,
<q>Great and marvellous are thy works, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of ſaints!</q>
            </p>
            <p>That which principally engages the pious mind in this delightful employment, is, that in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the glory of the divine character, diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his works, he is led to more high and exalted ideas of the bleſſed God, and is thence excited to praiſe and adore him, to love and truſt in him as the alone SUPREME GOOD—the only ſoul-ſatisfying Object, "in whom is all his ſalvation and all his deſire."</p>
            <p>It was on this ground, the Pſalmiſt uttered the pious reſolution in the text, "I will remember the works of the Lord—ſurely I will remember thy wonders of old." No object afforded him ſo much delight—no hours were ſo agreeably employed, as thoſe ſpent in meditating upon, and recalling to his mind, the great things GOD had done for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men; and particularly, the mighty acts of his power and grace, in favour of his ancient choſen people, in times of old.—He refers here, doubtleſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027629_0005_0FD6197938D8CBA0"/>
to the <hi>wonders</hi> which were wrought by the almighty hand, in the emancipation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from their cruel bondage in Egypt, and the great ſalvation they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced afterwards.</p>
            <p>The paſſage before us would lead us into a wide and delightful field for ſerious and uſeful medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the time allotted me, and the preſent ſeaſon, will only permit me to conſider ſome of them, which I ſhall endeavour, under this general DOCTRINE—</p>
            <p>That it is a <hi>duty</hi> incumbent on ALL, and it will be the <hi>delight</hi> of the truly <hi>pious mind,</hi> frequently to <hi>recollect</hi> the WORKS of GOD, and to acknowledge with gratitude his ancient WONDERS to our FATHERS.</p>
            <p>Since, by the providence of God, my brethren, this day falls out on the <hi>anniverſary</hi> of the landing of our FOREFATHERS in this place, this ſubject ſeems well calculated to afford us ſome agreeable and profitable improvement of that great and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing event—an event, which has been followed with ſuch great and important conſequences to this land; which has laid the foundation of this NEW WORLD; and all thoſe ſurpriſing ſcenes which have <hi>already</hi> taken place in it—as well as thoſe ſtill greater ones which are <hi>now</hi> in action, and others which <hi>will</hi> ſucceed them, to the end of time.</p>
            <p>We who are <hi>now</hi> on the ſtage, have ſeen ſo much in <hi>our</hi> day, that, it is hoped, we ſhall never forget
<pb facs="unknown:027629_0006_0FD55500A90D56A0"/>
"the works of the Lord;" beſides thoſe ancient "wonders" which
<q>we have heard with our ears, and of which our fathers have told us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It will be proper for us to conſider</p>
            <p n="1">I. FIRST, what theſe <hi>works of the Lord</hi> are, which we ſhould remember.</p>
            <p n="2">II. What is implied in the <hi>remembrance</hi> of them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>benefits</hi> which reſult from a due remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the works of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We are firſt to conſider what thoſe <hi>works of the Lord</hi> are, which demand our devout recollection.</p>
            <p>The WORKS of God are great and manifold, and none of them are to be forgotten, or excluded from pious obſervance. For "ALL <hi>his works praiſe him.</hi>" They are all wonderful, and loudly proclaim the glory of their divine Author.—But when we ſpeak of the <hi>works</hi> of the Lord, they are uſually diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under theſe three heads—the work of <hi>creation</hi>— the works of <hi>providence</hi>—and his works of <hi>grace.</hi> All theſe bear the moſt evident and glorious ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God.</p>
            <p>The work of CREATION exhibits ſuch a diſplay of the divine perfections of its Author, as demands the moſt explicit acknowledgement and praiſe of all rational intelligences. How aſtoniſhing muſt be the power of that Being, who, by a ſingle <hi>act</hi> of his <hi>will,</hi> could cauſe this glorious fabrick of the UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSE, in a moment, to ſpring from <hi>nothing</hi> into
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027629_0007_0FD555019EB41B80"/>
exiſtence; and in ſuch beautiful order, grandeur and harmony! How ſtriking and how ſolemn are thoſe words, God ſaid, "LET there be light, and there WAS light!" "He <hi>ſpake</hi> and it was <hi>done</hi>— he commanded, and it ſtood faſt." How is the ſerious, reflecting mind ſtruck with amazement, likewiſe, at the vaſt <hi>number,</hi> and almoſt infinite <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> of created exiſtences, in every part of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe! "The heavens" above us, with all their ſhining train, "declare" in the moſt expreſſive language, "the glory of their Creator." "The firmament ſheweth his handy work." Wherever we turn our eyes, divine <hi>power, wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> meet them. All creatures, animate and inanimate are full of glowing evidences of Deity. Our own <hi>bodies</hi>—"how fearfully and wonderfully are they made!" Our immortal <hi>ſouls</hi> bear a ſtill nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to, and more clearly diſplay the wiſdom and glory of their great Original.—Thus, by the work of <hi>creation,</hi> and "by the things that are <hi>made,</hi> are to be ſeen and underſtood his ETERNAL POWER and GODHEAD."</p>
            <p>The works of PROVIDENCE are no leſs remarkable, than thoſe of creation. Indeed, ſo neceſſary is a DIVINE <hi>power</hi> for the <hi>preſervation</hi> of the world in exiſtence and order, that this has been, and not improperly, called a <hi>continued act of creation.</hi> None but the ſame omnipotent hand, which <hi>made</hi> the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027629_0008_0FD6193DDB162C70"/>
world, could uphold it, a moment, in being. The conſtant <hi>preſervation</hi> of created exiſtence, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as ſtrong an argument for the being of a GOD, as the firſt production of them from nothing. It is as much "<hi>in</hi> HIM" and <hi>from</hi> him, that "we <hi>live</hi> and <hi>move,</hi>" as that we "<hi>have our being.</hi>"—But the <hi>providence</hi> of God, is not only concerned in uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creation, and continuing all things in being, but in the ſpecial <hi>ordering</hi> and <hi>directing</hi> all creatures and things, ſo as to anſwer the great and wiſe ends for which they were made. And this extends to all things in the <hi>moral,</hi> as well as the <hi>natural</hi> world: and comprehends all <hi>events</hi> which take place in both. Accordingly God is ſaid to "work all things according to the counſel of his will." And that he hath not only "the <hi>ſparrow,</hi>" and the <hi>hairs</hi> of our heads, and all <hi>material</hi> things, but even "the <hi>hearts</hi> of all in his hand, and turneth them whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſeth, as the rivers of water are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." And that he "worketh in men, both to <hi>will</hi> and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>DAVID juſtly received it as a moſt joyful conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation (and ſo do all good men) that every thing was under God's direction and controul. That all creatures and all events were entirely and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely at his diſpoſal. "The <hi>Lord reigneth,</hi> let the <hi>earth rejoice.</hi>" The government of the univerſe is in ſafe hands, becauſe in the hands of a Being who is
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027629_0009_0FD61947ED80D978"/>
infinitely juſt and wiſe—who cannot err, and who will direct all to the beſt ends poſſible. "The Judge of all the earth will do right"—however dark many things in providence, may now appear to us. For he is as wiſe as he is powerful, and as good as he is wiſe.</p>
            <p>In conſidering <hi>this</hi> part of the ſubject, the works of <hi>providence,</hi> a very large field opens to our view; in which, it is my purpoſe principally to walk, at this time; and to endeavor to aid our mutual contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on ſo pleaſing a theme. And I have no doubt, that before we ſhall have finiſhed our <hi>mental</hi> walk, we ſhall ſee what abundant reaſon we have, to unite with the Pſalmiſt in the text, and ſay,
<q>we will remember the works of the Lord; ſurely we will remember his wonders of old.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If the divine PROVIDENCE extend to the ſmalleſt, and moſt minute events, as we have heard; how much more to thoſe <hi>great</hi> revolutions and thoſe important affairs, which have, and which are contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually, taking place in the world, in all ages: and eſpecially to thoſe which more immediately reſpect MAN, as the ſubject of moral government. But we will purſue <hi>this path</hi> a little further.—</p>
            <p>In "remembring the works of the Lord," in the government of <hi>providence,</hi> our minds are carried back to the commencement of ages—to the earlieſt dawn of time. For no ſooner had JEHOVAH ſpoke crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027629_0010_0FD555080765CC80"/>
into exiſtence, but he began to exhibit his own glorious character on its theatre; and to give the moſt clear evidences of his wiſdom, goodneſs and power, in his conduct towards his new world; and particularly, his noble creature MAN—the brighteſt image of himſelf, among all the creatures of this lower world. Here we are led to take a view of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <hi>covenant,</hi> which God made with the firſt father of our race—His <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> condition, at his firſt formation—the delightful <hi>ſituation</hi> aſſigned him in the garden of <hi>paradiſe</hi>—and the more delightful <hi>communion</hi> he enjoyed with his Maker, GOD—in full poſſeſſion of his <hi>love,</hi> and of all the joys of <hi>innocence</hi>— a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to <hi>want</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> becauſe a ſtranger to ſin.</p>
            <p>But, alas! from this pleaſing ſcene, this ſtate of primitive happineſs and moral rectitude, we are led, by the hiſtory of <hi>providence,</hi> ſoon to behold a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly reverſe of things—in that awful cataſtrophe, preſented to us, in the guilty <hi>apoſtacy</hi> of man from his God, by a tranſgreſſion of his law.—Thence to the deplorable ſtate of the whole human race, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his ſin—the death and ruin which have overwhelmed the world, "by one man's diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence," by which, "many were made ſinners."</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of this ſcene of darkneſs, and woe, we are led to behold the firſt <hi>beam of hope,</hi> which ſhone upon this ruined world, in the gracious <hi>promiſe</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:027629_0011_0FD5550922E2C558"/>
of a SAVIOUR, under the character of "<hi>the ſeed of the woman.</hi>"—In further looking into the records of <hi>providence,</hi> we are carried on to view the ſad effects of the apoſtacy of man, in the dreadful <hi>deſtruction of the old world,</hi> by a univerſal flood of water, for their daring wickedneſs, and their awful defection from God.—After this, to the divine kindneſs to NOAH, in preſerving him and his houſhold from the common deſolation, by means of an <hi>ark</hi>; precious emblem of that glorious <hi>ſanctuary</hi>—that <hi>ark</hi> of ſafety, JESUS CHRIST—the only "hiding-place" for guilty ſinners, from a more terrible flood of divine indignation, coming upon all the finally impenitent.—Thence we are led to ſee the exemplary vengeance which fell on the devoted cities of <hi>SODOM</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> which were
<q>turned into aſhes, and condemned with an overthrow, for an example to thoſe, who, after, ſhould live ungodly.</q>
—With pleaſing wonder, we then contemplate God's gracious calling of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his diſtinguiſhed regard to this Father of the faithful, and to his <hi>ſeed</hi> after him—The miraculous preſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi>; and his call and commiſſion to be the meſſenger of God's mercy to his afflicted people, and the inſtrument of their deliverance from bondage.—Thence we come to the amazing ſtory of the hardened <hi>monarch of Egypt</hi> who
<q>knew not the Lord, nor would he</q>
though at Heaven's order, "let Iſrael go:" And whoſe ſignal obduracy would
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027629_0012_0FD5550CA5D4E7F0"/>
not be overcome by all the <hi>plagues</hi> of Egypt.— From thence to the final <hi>reſcue</hi> of the armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from his oppreſſive hands—The inſtitution of the <hi>paſſover,</hi> an inſtructive rite, to be obſerved in grateful commemoration of their deliverance— Their diſtreſs, ſoon after at the <hi>Red ſea</hi>—Their miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>eſcape</hi> from their enraged enemies—the <hi>ſong of praiſe,</hi> they then ſung, and their <hi>ſeeming gratitude</hi> to their God, for this ſignal ſalvation—but—their ſpeedy <hi>revolt,</hi> and awful
<q>
                  <hi>murmuring</hi> againſt the Lord and his ſervant Moſes.</q>
—The <hi>anger</hi> of God againſt their ingratitude, and yet his aſtoniſhing <hi>patience</hi> towards them, under all their rebellion—Their long wanderings a 40 years journey, in the wilderneſs— where thouſands of their carcaſes fell, for their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief—Their ſafe arrival at laſt, and their happy ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Lord "driving out, by little and little, the Heathen nations, and thus fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his promiſe made 400 years before, to <hi>Abraham</hi> their FOREFATHER.—</p>
            <p>THESE, which I have but briefly hinted at, are ſome of thoſe "<hi>works of the Lord</hi>" which belong to his <hi>providential</hi> government of men—and theſe are "<hi>the wonders of old,</hi>" which ought to be remembered with devout acknowledgment and praiſe to God.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe, the Lord, "whoſe hand is not ſhortened," hath wrought great and <hi>marvellous works</hi> in PROVIDENCE, towards <hi>other</hi> nations and people; and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027629_0013_0FD6193F788D10E8"/>
that, in every ſucceſſive generation, down to the preſent eventful period. And we may juſtly view, as none of the leaſt of theſe, the great and aſtoniſhing events, which have taken place in our <hi>own land,</hi> within eighteen years paſt—and which have been attended with <hi>conſequences,</hi> ſo important not only to <hi>this</hi> country, but to <hi>others,</hi> and moſt probably, will be in the event, to all the nations of the world. To the revolution in <hi>America,</hi> as a <hi>mean,</hi> in the hand of providence, may probably, be aſcribed, the ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſcenes which are acting on the <hi>European</hi> Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent at the preſent day; where
<q>the nations, like a <hi>potters veſſel,</hi> are <hi>daſhing to pieces,</hi>
               </q>
one againſt another. The preſent period appears to be big with as important events, as ever the world has witneſſed, as it reſpects the <hi>political</hi> ſtate of mankind; and I believe, ultimately, the <hi>moral</hi> ſtate too.—The grand conteſt between <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>tyranny—liberty</hi> and <hi>ſlavery,</hi> is carried on with amazing ardour—with the moſt obſtinate reſolution. And the event muſt be, ſoon, either glorious or dreadful.—But it is a ſweet and quieting conſolation to the friends of religion, that "the <hi>Lord God omnipotent reigns</hi>"—that events are entirely in his hands—That he ſitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as graſshoppers—that he bringeth the PRINCES to <hi>noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> he maketh the JUDGES of the earth as <hi>vanity.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. xl.22.</note>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:027629_0014_0FD619443135AFD0"/>
And it is matter of unſpeakable thankfulneſs and ſatisfaction that God is the unalterable friend of righteouſneſs, and "abhorreth the oppreſſor and evil doer." And that, "wherein any deal <hi>proudly,</hi> the Lord is above them."</p>
            <p>It was obſerved juſt now, that theſe great revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>providence,</hi> will, moſt likely, produce great changes in the <hi>moral</hi> as well as political ſtate of the world.—It ſeems to have been, for a number of years paſt, my brethren, the evident deſign of Heaven, by theſe convulſions and overturnings in the world, to bring on, or at leaſt, to prepare the way for uſhering in thoſe glorious and important events, which are ſo frequently foretold in ſcripture, reſpecting the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs— the more univerſal ſpread of the goſpel, and the enlargement of the kingdom of our divine Redeemer on earth—when "the kingdom of this world ſhall be given to Chriſt—and all the ends of the earth ſhall ſee and rejoice in his ſalvation.—And when the Lord ſhall <hi>build up Zion,</hi> he will appear in his GLORY."—</p>
            <p>But to return—among other various "works of the Lord" in <hi>providence,</hi> let us, on this occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more particularly look into the hiſtory, of our <hi>own country,</hi> and this day call to "remembrance, thoſe wonders of old" which the Lord wrought for our
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027629_0015_0FD61945257CD8F8"/>
               <hi>pious progenitors,</hi> whoſe <hi>bodies</hi> lie mingled with the <hi>duſt,</hi> in THIS PLACE, where we <hi>their children</hi> dwell— but whoſe <hi>ſouls,</hi> have long time no doubt been <hi>at reſt</hi> with GOD.</p>
            <p>As, in the <hi>firſt diſcovery</hi> of AMERICA, the hand of God was moſt viſibly ſeen, and ought forever to be remembered with gratitude—ſo, it has evidently been the object of the peculiar care of Heaven, through every ſucceſſive period of time, to the <hi>preſent day.</hi> It ſeems to have been, from the beginning, a remarkable <hi>Theatre</hi> of great and aſtoniſhing "works of the Lord." Our hiſtory, from the <hi>firſt landing</hi> of our FATHERS in this town, has been a hiſtory of wonders; and will furniſh, to every generation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, as much matter for pious reflection and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as that of any nation or people that ever exiſted on earth. That of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeems the neareſt to reſemble it: as any one may obſerve, who is acquainted with them both.</p>
            <p>I propoſe here, agreeably to the words of our text, to give a brief narration of ſome of "the wonderful works of God, towards our <hi>anceſtors,</hi> which we, their poſterity, ought to remember," and which, it is peculiarly proper, we ſhould call to mind, on this <hi>anniverſary.</hi> In doing this, although the accounts chiefly muſt be derived neceſſarily from hiſtorical facts, the ſubſtance of which ſome of you, perhaps, may have been already acquainted with—yet, I ſhall
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027629_0016_0FD6188E29E261B0"/>
bring to your view, <hi>ſome</hi> circumſtances—ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient anecdotes, which, I preſume, have never yet been made public, at leaſt, which I have never ſeen. I ſhall take them from the firſt book of the very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>records</hi> of this church, now in my hands. And I hope ſome uſeful entertainment, may be afforded at leaſt to the <hi>riſing generation</hi> among us; and on the preſent occaſion, it will not be improper to have the minds of <hi>all,</hi> even of thoſe who
<q>once knew them, to be ſtirred up by way of <hi>remembrance.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I would begin, by obſerving to you, that the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe of our <hi>fathers</hi> leaving ENGLAND, their native land, and tranſplanting themſelves, finally, in theſe then "dark corners of the earth," was, the cruel perſecution and religious oppreſſion, they met with in their own land: originating in a ſpirit of intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which then prevailed, eſpecially in the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> hierarchy; a ſpirit, now abhorred, as much by the enlightened and pious members of <hi>that</hi> communion, as perhaps by any others whatever; and which is viewed as a miſerable relick of ancient popiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and bigotry. Our <hi>fathers</hi> were not indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the reaſonable liberty of worſhipping their God agreeably to their own conſciences. And though they made no diſturbance in the State, but were peaceable members of ſociety, yet becauſe they could not, in conſcience, ſubmit to unſcriptural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, nor bow their necks to the yoke of human
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027629_0017_0FD55515EE334D10"/>
inventions, they were loaded with heavy fines and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures—nay, hunted about like "partridges on the mountains," and perſecuted as peſts to ſociety. And merely for exerciſing that Chriſtian liberty, which Chriſt hath given them, they were ſeized and many of them impriſoned—others had their houſes beſet, and watched night and day, and with difficulty eſcaped their hands; and moſt of them were obliged to fly and leave their habitations, and all means of ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>Under theſe burdens they groaned for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, but ſtill continued, as they had done, to meet as often as they could for the worſhip of God, (though privately for fear of their enemies) under the paſtoral care of that famous and learned divine, Mr. <hi>John Robinſon,</hi> the FIRST PASTOR of this ANCIENT CHURCH: until at length, their burdens became intolerable; and they, by joint conſent, reſolve to fly their native country, and ſeek an aſylum in <hi>Holland,</hi> where they had heard, was a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral toleration given to all denominations of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians; and where ſome of their own countrymen had gone before, under like troubles. The undertaking, they knew, was hazardous, and likely to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great expence and difficulty. For their enemies watched them continually, and would do every thing in their power to prevent their eſcape. What a dreadful ſituation! They can neither be
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027629_0018_0FD6194BD6432860"/>
ſuffered to live at home, in peace, nor to go abroad for it. The ports and harbours are watched: ſtrict orders given by authority, not to ſuffer them to eſcape. They are obliged to uſe the moſt private methods poſſible, and give extravagant fees to the ſailors—and yet were often betrayed by them. Twice they attempted to remove, and though with the utmoſt poſſible privacy, yet they were diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before they could get away.—One inſtance of this, I find, which is very affecting, and which I ſhall here mention, in the words of the records.</p>
            <p>"There was a large companie of them purpoſed to gett paſſage att <hi>Boſton</hi> in Lincolnſhire, for HOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND; and for that end, had hiered a ſhip wholly to themſelves, and made agreement with the maſter, to be ready att a certaine day, and take them and theire goods in at a convenient place appointed; where they all, accordingly, attended in reddineſs. After longe waiting, and large expences, the maſter, thô he kept not his word as to the <hi>day,</hi> yett came at laſt, and tooke them in, in the night—and when hee had got them and theire goods aboard, he betrayed them; having before-hand, complotted with the ſearchers and other officers ſoe to doe, whoe took them and putt them into open boates, and there rifled and ranſacked them, ſearching them to theire ſhirts for money—" offering the moſt brutal violence
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027629_0019_0FD6194D41E03598"/>
to the women, ſuch as is not fit to be named: "and then carrye'd them backe into the towne, marching them aboute the ſtreets, and making them a ſpectacle and wonderment to the multitude, who came fflock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge on all ſides to behold them."</p>
            <p>Thus their deſign is broken up, and they come off with loſs, indignity and ſhame.</p>
            <p>The next year, however, they made another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, though with little better ſucceſs than the former. There are ſome circumſtances attending <hi>this</hi> alſo, which are ſo very peculiar and affecting, that it may not be amiſs to give a particular account of them, which I ſhall do likewiſe, nearly in the words of the records.</p>
            <p>"Theſe adventurers, not willing to truſt their own countrymen the <hi>ſecond</hi> time, after they had met with ſuch baſe treatment from them, heard of a <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhipmaſter at <hi>Hull,</hi> having a ſhip of his own, belonging to ZEALAND. They made an agreement with him, and acquainted him with their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſign, hoping to find more friendſhip in him, than in thoſe of their own nation. He bad them not fear, for he would do well enough. He was, by appointment, to take them in between <hi>Grimſley</hi> and <hi>Hull,</hi> where was a large <hi>common,</hi> a good way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from any town. Now againſt the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, that they might be in leſs danger of being diſcovered, they divide their company, and ſend on
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027629_0020_0FD5551BA43CD718"/>
the <hi>women</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> with the goods, to the place firſt, in a ſmall <hi>barque,</hi> which they had hired for that purpoſe. And the <hi>men</hi> were to go by land and meet them there, at the day appointed. But it ſo fell out, that they were all at the place, a day or two before the ſhip came. When ſhe arrived, they found the <hi>barque,</hi> with the women, &amp;c. aground, near the ſhore, it being low water. The ſhipmaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perceiving this, in order to loſe no time, ſent his boat to take the <hi>men</hi> aboard, whom he ſaw walking along the ſhore. But after the <hi>firſt</hi> boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was got aboard, and ſhe was ready to go for more, they lift up their eyes, and behold a large company of horſe and footmen coming with full ſpeed upon them. For by ſome treachery, their enemies had got notice of it, and the whole country thereabout was raiſed to take them. The men on the ſhore, had juſt time, by flight, to eſcape their purſuers.—But think, reader, of the ſorrowful fate of the poor, piteous <hi>mothers</hi> and <hi>children</hi> in the <hi>barque,</hi> who fall a prey into their mercileſs hands! Canſt thou think of this ſcene of heart-felt diſtreſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a tear of ſympathy for them!</p>
            <p>'But what becomes of the few that had juſt been carry'd aboard the ſhip? Here is preſented another ſcene, courteous reader, almoſt too much for the writer to narrate.—The <hi>Dutchman,</hi> ſeeing they were detected by the Engliſh, ſwore his country's oath
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027629_0021_0FD61951B030BF08"/>
(ſacrament!) he would not wait a minute longer. And having a fair wind, he gave orders to weigh anchor, hoiſt ſail, and away for <hi>Holland.</hi>—Our men on board, in vain repreſent to him, their <hi>own,</hi> and the diſtreſs of their <hi>wives</hi> and <hi>children</hi> left behind in the barque. And with their parting eyes, they ſaw them taken by their enemies, and could give them no relief. Themſelves alſo, were in the moſt deſtitute condition, not having a ſhift of clothes, more than they had on their backs, and ſome of them ſcarce a penny to help themſelves withal— All they had being put aboard the <hi>barque.</hi> O what would we give, ſaid they, to be on ſhore again! but all in vain—there is no remedy. They muſt ſadly part, rent from their families and friends, and going to a ſtrange country, where they know neither people nor language.—Yet this is but, in a ſenſe, the beginning of ſorrows to this deſolate few. A terrible ſtorm comes on, in their paſſage, which continued for ſeven days and nights together, in which they ſaw neither ſun, moon nor ſtars, and were driven to the coaſt of <hi>Norway.</hi> At length it increaſed to ſuch violence, that all hopes of life ſeemed gone—the mariners themſelves deſpairing of ever ſeeing land. After ſome time, a doleful ſhriek is heard—"ſhe founders—ſhe ſinks—ſhe ſinks!"—But behold, "in the mount the Lord is ſeen!" when man's hope and help wholly falleth,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027629_0022_0FD6195367C8B140"/>
then the Lord's power and mercy appeared. And while the poor ſailors, with trembling, yield to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, our pious company on board are <hi>plying the oar of prayer.</hi> And with great faith and fervency, but calm and "without diſtraction," even while the <hi>water ran into their mouths and ears,</hi> are heard to cry, "<hi>Yet LORD thou canſt ſave!—yet LORD thou canſt ſave!</hi>" When, to the aſtoniſhment of the whole crew, the ſhip riſes—the wind leſſens, and the ſtorm abates; and the mariners get courage to manage the ſhip. Their ſpirits revive, and the Lord fills the afflicted hearts of our brethren, with ſuch comforts, as every one cannot underſtand, or conceive of. And now, in a ſhort time, they arrive at their deſired haven, where the people come flocking about them, being amazed at their deliverance." And while their hearts overflow with gratitude, their mouths repeat the words of David,
<q>O that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, for his wonderful works to the children of men!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now return to the ſcattered company that were left on the Engliſh ſhore. The moſt of them, as we have obſerved before, made ſhift to eſcape and hide themſelves from their purſuers—a few only tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in order to afford, if poſſible, ſome little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the women and children. But pitiful it was, indeed, to ſee the condition of theſe poor creatures. What weeping and crying on every ſide—ſome for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:027629_0023_0FD555205C9BC6B8"/>
their huſbands, who were carried away in the ſhip— others melted in tears to ſee their poor <hi>little ones</hi> hanging about them, crying for fear, and quaking with the cold. Being thus apprehended, they are hurried away from one place to another, and from one juſtice to another; until, in the end, they know not what to do with them. To impriſon ſo many women and innocent children for no other crime or cauſe than their being obliged to go with their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, ſeemed to be unreaſonable, and they knew, all would cry out againſt them. And to ſend them home again, was as difficult; for, as the truth was, they alledged, they <hi>had</hi> no homes to go to; for they had ſold, and otherwiſe diſpoſed of their houſes and livings. In ſhort, after they had been thus '<hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiled</hi>' and harraſſed a long time, and conveyed from one conſtable to another, the officers being weary'd out, were glad, in the end, to get rid of them on any terms.</p>
            <p>A pious <hi>remark</hi> is made here, in our records, worthy of notice, which I give, as there recorded.— The writer ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <q>I may not omit the fruite that came heerby; for by theſe foe publicke troubles, in ſoe many eminent places, theire cauſe became famous, and occationed many to looke into the ſame. And theire godlye carryage and chriſtian behaviour was ſuch as left a deep impreſſion in the mindes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027629_0024_0FD61954E4266CD0"/>
And altho ſome few ſhrunke att thoſe firſt conflicts and ſharp beginninges, (as it was noe marvell,) yett many more came on with ffreſhe corrage, and greatly anymated others. And in the end, notwithſtanding all theſe ſtormes of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, they all gott over to <hi>Hollande</hi> at length, ſome att one time, and ſome att another, and mett together againe accordinge to theire hearts deſires, with noe ſmall rejoiceing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They, having thus arrived, miniſter and people, to a land, though of ſtrangers, yet, of peace and liberty, ſtayed the firſt year at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> a large city, full of trade and people. But on account of ſome unhappy diſputes and contentions of a religious nature, that prevailed there at that time, which had well nigh ruined <hi>Mr. Smith</hi>'s church, who had gone over thither from England before them, they pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently reſolved, in ſeaſon, to remove, leſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion ſhould ſpread among <hi>them</hi> alſo. They accordingly, did remove to <hi>Leyden,</hi> a city about 20 miles ſouth of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where they were kindly received, and here they ſettle themſelves, and live, in the greateſt harmony, as brethren, for about <hi>eleven years</hi>; where they enjoyed much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, under the miniſtry of their beloved and faithful paſtor, <hi>Mr. Robinſon.</hi> It ſeemed like a kind of heavenly reſt to them, after the ſtorms and troubles they had paſſed through. For here they
<q>walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027629_0025_0FD619566EAE4970"/>
Holy Ghoſt, and were edified.</q>
And here many more were added to them. For the flames of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious tyranny and perſecution continued ſo to increaſe in <hi>England,</hi> that many more fled over to them, for the ſake of enjoying liberty and the rights of conſcience. So that they became a very large congregation.</p>
            <p>But time and changes render every thing uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, even our moſt precious enjoyments, in this world. And they found, at length, that this place was not to be their "continuing city." There were a number of things concurred as reaſons for their removal to ſome other place or country—the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the land—the difficulty of getting a living from it, and the dearneſs of proviſions—Theſe were very diſcouraging to them, and cauſed many of their children to leave them and become ſoldiers or ſailors, to the great grief of their parents. Beſides, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality and looſe way of living among that people, eſpecially the prophanation of the ſabbath, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a bad example to their children—was very griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But above all, the deſired hope they had of ſpreading the goſpel of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and laying a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the advancement of religion and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>CHRIST</hi> in this remote part of the world.— <hi>Theſe,</hi> were ſome of the chief reaſons which induced our anceſtors to determine on a removal from <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, previous to ſo great an undertaking, and agreeably to their pious character, they firſt of all,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027629_0026_0FD555259A00A978"/>
ſet apart a day for <hi>prayer,</hi> to ſeek <hi>direction</hi> from God, in the important affair now under conſideration. That ſcriptural direction being always their maxim,
<q>In all thy ways acknowledge GOD, and <hi>he</hi> will direct thy paths.</q>
And after due deliberation, they come to a reſolution of removing to <hi>America</hi>; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſet about the neceſſary preparations for it. They make application to the king, for permiſſion to go under the royal ſanction, but are refuſed. They renew their requeſt, and endeavour to engage ſome of the great men of the nation, to aid their cauſe. Sometimes they meet with encouragement, and again are diſappointed. Some ſpeak well of them, others miſrepreſent and villify them; and thus they are toſſed between hope and fear—ſpend a great deal of time, are at vaſt expence and labour, until, at laſt, they gained their point ſo far, as that they are encouraged to make preparations for their voyage.</p>
            <p>They hired two ſhips for the purpoſe, concluded upon the number who ſhould go over firſt; for all could not go at this time. And as the major part of the company tarried behind, their <hi>paſtor</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them. While the others, with their pious <hi>elder,</hi> Mr. BREWSTER, prepare to embark. And now comes on another moſt trying ſcene, viz. their <hi>parting.</hi> This is almoſt too affecting to think of, when we conſider the cordial love and unanimity which bound them together, as with the tendereſt
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027629_0027_0FD55528F1A50F88"/>
cord. This, ſtill more ſtrengthened by the mutual ſorrows and diſtreſſes they had gone through—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering alſo what dangers on the ſea they were going to encounter—and that, like <hi>Abraham</hi> of old, they were "going they know not whither," into a new world—and eſpecially, as this would probably be, as it was, a <hi>final</hi> parting, with many of them. Theſe conſiderations ſerved to make this a moſt affecting occaſion to them all.</p>
            <p>But before they ſeparate, they conclude to ſpend one day more together in religious devotion, as a day of <hi>humiliation</hi> and <hi>prayer.</hi> On this occaſion, beſides pouring out their ſouls to the Lord in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer, ſupplications and tears, Mr. ROBINSON preached to them, from thoſe words in EZRA viii.21.
<q>Then I proclaimed a FAST there, at the river AHAVA, <hi>that we might afflict ourſelves there before GOD,</hi> to ſeek of him a right way for US, and for our LITTLE ONES, and for all our ſubſtance.</q>
—"And now, the trying time being come, that they muſt depart, (ſay the records) they were accompany'd by moſt of their brethren out of the city, into a town called <hi>Half-Haven,</hi> where the ſhip lay readye to receive them. So they left that goodlye and pleaſant city, which had been theire reſting-place, near twelve yeeres. But they knew they were <hi>pilgrimes,</hi> and looked not much on thoſe things, but lifted up theire eyes to Heaven, theire deareſt country, and quieted
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027629_0028_0FD619592A2CA180"/>
their ſpirits. When they came to the place, they found the ſhip, and all thinges readye. That night was ſpent with little ſleep by moſt, but with chriſtian diſcourſe and other like real expreſſions of true chriſtian love. The next day, the wind being faire, they went aboard, their friends accompanying them —but truly doleful was the ſight of that ſad partinge —to ſee what <hi>ſythes</hi> and <hi>ſobbes,</hi> and prayers did ſound among them, what teares did guſh from every eye, and expreſſions which ſoe pierſed each others harte, that ſundrye of the Dutch ſtrangers that ſtood on the Kees as ſpectators, could not refraine from teares. Yett comfortable and ſweete it was, to ſee ſuch livelye and true expreſſions of deare and unfeigned love.— But the tyde calling them to departe, theire Rev. Paſtor falling downe on his knees, and they all with him, with watery cheeks commended them, with moſt fervent prayers to the Lord, and his bleſſinge, and then with mutual embraces, and many teares, they took their leaves of one another, which proved to be their laſt leave, with manye of them. Then hoyſinge ſayle, with a proſperous wind, they came, in a ſhort time to <hi>Southampton,</hi> where the other ſhip lay, and the reſt of the companye waitinge for them."</p>
            <p>They now put to ſea—but had not proceeded far, before one of the ſhips proved ſo leaky, that they found it was, by no means ſafe to proceed on the voyage;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:027629_0029_0FD5552C128DB5C8"/>
and finally they are obliged to leave her behind, with a number of their companions who had embarked in her. But they had been inured to diſappointments, and bore it with great patience, and concluded that as many as could, ſhould take paſſage in the other larger ſhip, and on <hi>Sept.</hi> 6<hi>th,</hi> they ſailed the laſt time from <hi>England</hi> for AMERICA.—It reminds us of <hi>Noah</hi> and his little family, houſed in the ark, ſecure in the arms of divine protection and love, while ſtorms and billows roar around them. The ſame GOD protected our <hi>fathers,</hi> while they cheerfully commit themſelves, under his care, to the boiſterous element, in ſearch of an unknown land. He had, in his providence, raiſed up a number of men of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular piety and ſuperior wiſdom and fortitude, to go before them in this great undertaking; among whom, the names of <hi>Carver—Bradford—Winſlow—Prince— Standiſh—Brewſter—Morton,</hi> and others, are never to be forgotten by the inhabitants of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> or by the ſons of <hi>New-England.</hi> Theſe were raiſed up by divine providence to encourage and lead them, in this important enterprize and "on they come, all alone, a ſmall and feeble band, through contrary ſtorms and boisterous ſeas, which they were never uſed to; late in the year—a terrible winter approaching, their wives and poor piteous children with them—going to a ſtrange land.—But the Lord is with them, and is their guide.—he divides the ſeas before them, and leads
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027629_0030_0FD6195EFADC2550"/>
them through in ſafety."—And thus they are brought, after a tedious paſſage of more than <hi>nine weeks</hi> to this long-expected ſhore.</p>
            <p>"But Oh! how horrid and diſmal, do theſe new-found regions appear! on the rivers and ſhores, nothing but ſights of wretched, naked and barbarous ſavages, adorers of devils—the earth covered with hideous thickets, which will require infinite toil to ſubdue—a cold winter for a third part of the year— no friends to welcome them—no inns to entertain or refreſh them, no houſes, much leſs towns to repair unto, to ſeek for ſuccour.—It is recorded in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a great mercy to the apoſtle Paul and his ſhipwrecked companions, that
<q>the <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſhewed them no ſmall kindneſs</q>
in refreſhing them. But <hi>theſe</hi> ſavage <hi>Barbarians</hi> when they met them, (as after will appear) were readier to fill their ſides with arrows, than otherwiſe to comfort them."</p>
            <p>What could be more terrible to human appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, than their ſituation and proſpects at this time! ſurely had not "the everlaſting arm" ſupported them, they muſt have ſunk in deſpair, amidſt this gloom, at their firſt arrival. But 'tis evident the whole deſign was of God, and he was determined to compleat it—for, "as for GOD, his way is perfect."</p>
            <p>They arrived at <hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> Nov. 10th. 1620, where, on their bended knees, they, firſt of all, give
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027629_0031_0FD619630B5CB100"/>
thanks to their guardian God, for his kind protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over them through a long and dangerous voyage. In the next place, they wiſely formed a ſett of laws and regulations, for the well ordering of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and enter into, and ſign a ſolemn contract before they went aſhore; and this was the foundation of their <hi>civil government.</hi>—The whole number belonging to their company, great and ſmall, was 101 ſouls. One, indeed, had died on their paſſage, but they had anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er born at ſea, ſo that the ſame number arrived, that embarked in England.</p>
            <p>And now they enter upon a new ſcene. Though paſt the dangers of the ſeas, yet there are other, and greater difficulties to ſurmount, before they can gain a peaceable ſettlement. They are wholly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the country. They find the place where they firſt landed, by no means ſuitable for them. They travel with their arms in their hands, from place to place, through wet and cold, in this late ſeaſon of the year—often, for days and nights, lying expoſed, in the wilderneſs, to the open air and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clement ſky. And to add to their affliction, the <hi>master</hi> of the ſhip grows impatient and fretful— threatens that if they do not ſpeedily find a place for ſettlement, he will turn their families, goods and effects upon the naked ſhore. The <hi>Indians,</hi> ſeveral times, ſurprize and fall upon them with their bows and arrows, which pierce their <hi>clothes</hi>—but their
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027629_0032_0FD55531340CAD30"/>
God ſuffered them not to touch their <hi>lives.</hi>—After many days ſpent in a fruitleſs ſearch for a convenient place, they at length, conclude, by the advice of one of their company, to come in queſt of <hi>this harbour.</hi> And he engages, (having touched here once before, in a voyage of diſcovery) to be their Pilot. They accordingly man their boat for the enterprize, with ſome of their principal men, and ſet out.</p>
            <p>The particular circumſtances of this affair, having ſo immediate a connexion with this anniverſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, although minute, yet may be deemed worthy of recital—which I ſhall give in the words of the writer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>They are now in the Bay, in a ſmall ſhallop. After ſome hours ſailing, it begins to ſnow and rain. It is now <hi>Friday</hi> afternoon. The wind riſes, and blows with great violence. The ſea grows rough— they brake their rudder. It is as much as two men can do to ſteer her with oars. The ſtorm increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and night coming on, they carrying what ſail they can, to get into the harbour, broke their maſt in three pieces—their ſails fall overboard, in a very grown ſea, and they are like to founder ſuddenly. Yet, by the mercy of Heaven, they recover, and the flood being with them, they ſtrike into the <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> harbour. But the pilot was deceived—and cries out, "Lord be merciful, my eyes never ſaw
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027629_0033_0FD61963E8250DC8"/>
this place before."—They, with ſome difficulty, get her about ſoon as poſſible, and providence ſhewing a fair ſound before them, though very dark and rainy, they get under the lee of a ſmall iſland, in our harbour, <note n="*" place="bottom">Called <hi>Clark's Island,</hi> from the man who firſt ſtepped aſhore.</note> but are ſtill divided about going aſhore, leſt they fall into the midst of ſavages. Some keep the boat—but others, worn out with wet, cold and fatigue, venture aſhore, and with great difficulty kindle a fire. After midnight, the wind ſhifting, and the weather growing very cold, the reſt are glad to get to them; and here they ſtay that night. In the morning they diſcovered it to be an iſland, ſecure from Indians; and it being the laſt day of the week, here they dry their clothes, reſt themſelves, and give thanks to God for their many deliverances.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And here, I find, the next day, they kept the Chriſtian ſabbath, being about 20 in number. The <hi>firſt ſabbath</hi> ever obſerved in a religious manner, in this town, and in this part of the world.</p>
            <p>The next day, they proceeded to ſound out the harbour, find it commodious for their purpoſe, came aſhore at <hi>this place</hi>—found ſeveral running brooks and old <hi>cornfields,</hi> but no inhabitants: a dreadful <hi>plague,</hi> as they were afterwards informed, having broke out among the <hi>Indians</hi> in this place, a little
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027629_0034_0FD555349EE02CC0"/>
before, which carried off the inhabitants. Thus divine providence, in a ſignal manner ſeemed to go before them, to prepare a place for them.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, they judge this a ſuitable ſpot for ſettlement; and return to the ſhip at the <hi>Cape,</hi> with the news of their diſcovery, to the reſt of their compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions. Upon which, the ſhip ſails for this harbour; where our worthy and pious ANCESTORS, in this month <hi>December,</hi> and on this day of the month, as our history dates it, <hi>juſt</hi> 173 <hi>years ago,</hi> here, on <hi>this very ſpot</hi> which we now inhabit, began their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It would take up more time than is alloted for the preſent diſcourſe, to attempt a further enumeration of the many hardſhips they endured the following winter, and afterwards; by hunger and cold, by open enemies, and falſe friends, here and abroad; as well as by waſting ſickneſs; by which, <hi>more than half</hi> their number were carry'd off, within a year after their landing.</p>
            <p>It may ſuffice to have comply'd with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular deſign of this diſcourſe; which was, to give a brief account of ſome of the <hi>principal</hi> occurrences, relating to our <hi>forefathers,</hi> until their <hi>landing</hi> in this place. I will only obſerve in general, that as the firſt ſettlers of this country, evidently, were actuated, not by worldly motives, but by thoſe of religion
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027629_0035_0FD61965EEBB7488"/>
and conſcience, by an ardent zeal for the glory of God—the pure worſhip and unadulterated doctrines of the goſpel; and an earneſt deſire, <hi>themſelves</hi> of enjoying, and leaving to their <hi>children</hi> the enjoyment of thoſe rights and liberties which God had given them; ſo it has remarkably appeared that a peculiar bleſſing of heaven has followed them and their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, in that this land has been the ſpecial care of God's kind and gracious providence, from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation down to our day. And although their deſcendants have been called to witneſs ſome ſcenes of diſtreſs and trouble; and enemies of various deſcriptions, and in various ways, have riſen up againſt us; and at certain periods, we have ſeemed to be threatened with deſtruction; yet the Lord God of our <hi>fathers</hi> hath from time to time appeared in a moſt wonderful manner, for our deliverance. He hath
<q>ſaved us by his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten us the victory.</q>
So that we have had occaſion to
<q>ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of God—</q>
and may, with the utmoſt propriety <hi>this day,</hi> ſet up our "<hi>Ebenezer,</hi>" and ſay, with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs "hitherto the Lord hath helped us."</p>
            <p>As it is not to the purpoſe of the preſent occaſion, ſo I ſhall not proceed to mention particularly, at this time, the many "wonderful works" which "our fathers' God" hath wrought for us of <hi>later years</hi>; which ought ever to be remembered with equal grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027629_0036_0FD555385D0784C0"/>
and admiration. And our admiration may well be increaſed when we contemplate the <hi>moral</hi> ſtate and character of this people—our manifold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking abominations—our ingratitude—our abuſe of peculiar privileges—and our great degeneracy and defection from the pious ways of our <hi>forefathers.</hi>— Yet God hath not dealt with us according to our deſerts, but he has ſaved us; "not for our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, but for his own name's ſake." So that we are now become a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>independent NATION</hi>; enjoying the <hi>happieſt conſtitution</hi> and the <hi>freeſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the world. A government, the fartheſt removed from civil and religious impoſition and tyranny, of any people under Heaven.</p>
            <p>And now brethren, can we reflect upon this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of remarkable events in the government of <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ROVIDENCE, and not ſay, with the deepeſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in the language of the text, "we will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the <hi>works of the Lord</hi>; ſurely we will remember his <hi>wonders of old.</hi>"</p>
            <p>We now proceed, as was propoſed, briefly to conſider</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, his <hi>works of GRACE.</hi> And theſe 'demand a noble ſong.' Here we ſhall ſee ſuch glorious diſplays of the divine perfections, as are far more aſtoniſhing than, either the work of <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>providence.</hi> In <hi>this</hi> view of our text, we are led to contemplate thoſe ſtupendous
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027629_0037_0FD61966E39D6A98"/>
works of love and power, of wiſdom and grace, which employ the inquiſitive minds of holy angels, who "deſire to look into them," and are filled with heavenly admiration when they behold them. <hi>Theſe</hi> are the works which will employ the praiſes of unnumbered myriads of the "redeemed from among men," to all eternity. Here the whole myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, opens to our view, and exhibits the united ſplendor of all the perfections of Deity. In <hi>this work,</hi> we behold "Chriſt crucified," the only ground of the hope of guilty man. In <hi>this work,</hi> are included, all the <hi>means</hi> of ſalvation—the bleſſed WORD of God—the ORDINANCES of the goſpel—<hi>ſabbaths</hi> and all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>days</hi> and <hi>means of grace</hi> which we enjoy. In a ſpecial manner, to <hi>this</hi> belongs the <hi>gift of the HOLY SPIRIT,</hi> which is the SUM of the Redeemer's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and of all ſpiritual bleſſings—his gracious operations and <hi>ſaving influences</hi> upon the hearts of men—awakening the ſecure, convincing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting ſinners—opening the eyes of the blind— ſanctifying and comforting his own people. To the <hi>ſame work</hi> alſo, belong, Chriſt's erecting a <hi>viſible Church</hi> and <hi>kingdom</hi> in the world—making continual additions to it—guarding and defending it from its powerfull enemies, ſo that
<q>the gates of hell, have not, nor ever will prevail againſt it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>this</hi> branch of the ſubject comprehends
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027629_0038_0FD61973B65A7590"/>
all thoſe merciful <hi>reſtraints</hi> which God lays upon the luſts of men; whereby they are prevented from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the greateſt exceſs, and committing the moſt open daring, conſtant acts of wickedneſs—but for which reſtraint, this world would become a mere hell—as there is no act of impiety and wickedneſs too bad for the depraved heart of man, to be guilty of.</p>
            <p>God's <hi>works of grace,</hi> alſo include all thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>reformations</hi> and <hi>revivals of religion,</hi> which take place at any time, through the wonderful pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the HOLY SPIRIT; whereby Satan's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is weakened, and the intereſt of our bleſſed <hi>LORD JESUS</hi> gloriouſly advanced—the ſouls of men delivered from the awful bondage of ſin, and from that dreadful ſtate of guilt and condemnation, in which all unrenewed ſinners are involved—and are brought into the glorious
<q>liberty of the ſons of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And I may add, this branch of the ſubject alſo includes all thoſe <hi>works of grace</hi> which WILL take place in <hi>future times,</hi> before the end of the world— all thoſe aſtoniſhing things which ſhall come to paſs in that remarkable period called the MILLENIUM— a period ſo much, and ſo frequently ſpoken of in the holy ſcriptures; when the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> will be poured out in ſuch copious effuſions, and in ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a manner, that this preſent wicked world will,

What a glorious day will this be! The Lord haſten it in its time!</p>
            <p>Thus I have conſidered the <hi>firſt</hi> which was the principal head intended to be inſiſted on, upon the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. With reſpect to the <hi>manner</hi> in which we are to "<hi>remember</hi> the works of the Lord," it ſhould be, by a ſerious attentive obſervance of them—by a firm belief of God's univerſal government, and that all theſe works are the effects of his wiſdom, his power and goodneſs—together with a diſpoſition to give him the glory due to his name, by a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, devout, grateful acknowledgement of God in them, and a ſtudious deſire and care to live in ſome meaſure anſwerable to ſuch diſcoveries and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of his perfections.</p>
            <p n="3">III. As to the <hi>benefits</hi> reſulting from a due <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of the works of God, which was the <hi>laſt</hi> thing propoſed—they are very many and great. It will excite us to a humble and joyful <hi>adoration</hi> of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:027629_0040_0FD61977669215A0"/>
him—to <hi>ſupreme love</hi> to him, as the fountain of all excellence and goodneſs—a reverential <hi>fear</hi> of him as being a great and holy, a juſt and powerful God; alſo, to lively <hi>gratitude,</hi> for ſuch aſtoniſhing diſplays of his love, wiſdom and benevolence, for which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhall feel our immenſe obligations to him—likewiſe to a humble <hi>reſignation</hi> to his government, and a quiet <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to his will; as he is a Being on whom we, and all creatures are abſolutely depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and to whom, it is our higheſt happineſs to be intirely and for ever devoted.—In a word, it will excite in us an ardent <hi>deſire</hi> for the ENJOYMENT of him, both <hi>here</hi> and <hi>hereafter,</hi> as the only ſupreme felicity—the only ſatisfying portion. And thus, as the reſult of all, we ſhall be ready to adopt the language of <hi>DAVID,</hi> as the true expreſſion of our hearts,
<q>Whom have I in heaven but THEE, and there is nothing on earth, which I deſire beſides THEE.</q>
I proceed to the</p>
            <p>IMPROVEMENT.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In the view of the preceding ſubject, we may well exclaim, what a MONSTER is an <hi>Atheiſt!</hi> is it poſſible, that a rational creature ſhould deny the <hi>being</hi> and the <hi>providence</hi> of GOD; when he has, all around him, ſuch a full blaze of evidence of <hi>both</hi>; from all the works he beholds—from his own exiſtence, and from every creature and thing he is daily converſant with?—
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027629_0041_0FD555421A683160"/>
Surely, ſuch creatures, if any ſuch there are, deſerve not the name of <hi>rational</hi>—with utmoſt propriety are they therefore, in ſcripture, ſtiled <hi>fools.</hi> For none, certainly but "the <hi>fool</hi> will ſay, there is no God."</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It muſt be an evidence of deep <hi>depravity</hi> in man—of amazing ſtupidity and hardneſs of heart, <hi>not to be affected</hi> with gratitude and love, at the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the <hi>wonderful works</hi> of GOD. Eſpecially his works of <hi>grace.</hi> And yet, alas! how common are the inſtances of this depravity! how many are there, who enjoy the goſpel, in which are diſplayed the brighteſt evidences of divine wiſdom—of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love and grace; and yet they treat it as an idle tale—although it reveals to them, the only poſſible way of ſalvation for them. Oh! how great muſt be the guilt—and how aggravated the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch ſinners, finally remaining in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition! The Barbarians of <hi>Africa</hi> will riſe up in judgment againſt them. For, if the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who have only the volume of <hi>creation</hi> to read, by which to diſcover the being and will of their Maker; if <hi>theſe</hi> will
<q>be found <hi>guilty</hi> before God, for not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying him as God,</q>
where ſhall the <hi>goſpel-ſinner</hi> appear; and what muſt be his guilt and puniſhment!</p>
            <p n="3">3d. We may infer from our ſubject, the <hi>peculiar</hi> obligations which <hi>we,</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>this</hi> ANCIENT TOWN are under to reflect, with adoring gratitude, upon thoſe "wonders of old," which the Almighty

wrought for our <hi>forefathers,</hi> of bleſſed memory— his tender care and goodneſs to them, through all their ſingular dangers, and diſtreſſes, both <hi>before— at,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> their landing in <hi>this place.</hi> Perhaps there never was a diſpenſation of providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any body of people under heaven (except the Iſraelitiſh nation) ſo full of wonders as <hi>this,</hi> towards our <hi>anceſtors.</hi> They are firſt perſecuted in their own land; by this, they are driven to take refuge in a neighbouring ſtate; but not able to continue there, they are at length, directed and encouraged to ſeek an aſylum in this, then howling, <hi>wilderneſs.</hi> And all this, to lay a foundation for thoſe ſacred and ineſtimable bleſſings, civil and religious, which <hi>we</hi> their children this day enjoy. What dangers, yea, what "deaths oft," did they undergo, that they might leave us in the quiet and peaceful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the rights of conſcience, and of that liberty wherewith the Lord of nature hath made us free. No hazards could diſcourage them—no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties were too great to endure—no obſtacles or enemies were powerful enough to damp the ardour of their reſolution, or cauſe them to give over the deſign. They began it with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and heaven, all along, ſmiled on the great undertaking.</p>
            <p>It is worthy of particular remembrance, that this country had been diſcovered <hi>a hundred and ten years</hi> before their arrival here, and before any effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:027629_0043_0FD6197F2D69AFC8"/>
ſettlements were made in it. Several attempts had, indeed, been formed with this view, but they were by perſons who appear to have been actuated merely from worldly motives, and mercenary views; and their deſigns were all blaſted by the hand of providence—They met with a ſeries of croſſes of one kind and another, till they gave over the attempt. Until at length, this pious people, forced by cruel oppreſſion, from their own land, are ſpirited to attempt a ſettlement in this country. "To this end," ſays a pious remarker, "how did the Lord bear them as on eagle's wings—He made the depths of the ſea a way for the ranſomed of the Lord to paſs over," and brings them with joy, to the place of their deſire. And having caſt out multitudes of the heathen before their arrival, he gives them favour in the eyes of the reſt, ſo that they dwell in peace, in the midſt of many power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nations, who could, otherwiſe, have ſwallowed them up for a great many years together. He builds them houſes to dwell in, and prepares them fields for planting—he greatly increaſes their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and multiplies their houſholds, ſo that
<q>the wilderneſs ſoon became a fruitful field, and the deſart rejoices and bloſſoms as the roſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We are now enjoying the fruit of their labors. And how ſhould our hearts glow with gratitude to heaven, when we reflect upon the amazing difference
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:027629_0044_0FD55548DA49E778"/>
between our circumſtances and theirs! while <hi>they</hi> were perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake, <hi>we</hi> enjoy the worſhip and ordinances of God without moleſtation or danger. While <hi>they</hi> were obliged to wander about, in a great meaſure friendleſs and deſtitute— <hi>we</hi> are ſurrounded with friends and have comfortable habitations. While <hi>they</hi> were often pinched with <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>want,</hi> WE have even a luxuriant affluence of all the comforts of life. In a word, while <hi>they</hi> were in perpetual fear from ſavage enemies, and often waked out of ſleep, by the noiſe and terror of them, <hi>we</hi> may reſt on our beds in ſafety, enjoy peace, and quietneſs, and have none to make us afraid.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. In reflecting on the foregoing ſubject, we may infer, that no length of time ſhould efface from our memory, or cauſe us to forget the noble <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> both <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> which actuated our FATHERS in their glorious and arduous undertaking.</p>
            <p>As to their <hi>civil</hi> principles, an ardent <hi>love of liberty</hi>— an unſhaken attachment to the <hi>rights of men,</hi> with a deſire to tranſmit them to their unborn race—were thoſe which governed them. And they were willing to hazard every thing dear to them, that they might ſecure theſe bleſſings for them and us.</p>
            <p>And with regard to their <hi>religious</hi> principles, <hi>theſe</hi> are well known by all, who have any tolerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with their hiſtory. It is known, with what ſacred zeal, and unwavering perſeverance they
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027629_0045_0FD61981CC6B17A8"/>
believed, profeſſed, taught and defended the glorious truths of God's word—the great, fundamental doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the goſpel. Such as the <hi>apoſtacy</hi> and total <hi>depravity</hi> of human nature by ſin. Man's utter <hi>ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> to deliver himſelf from that ſtate of guilt and ruin, in which he is involved by tranſgreſſion—or to ſatisfy the divine law—work out righteouſneſs, or make atonement for ſin.—The abſolute neceſſity of <hi>regeneration,</hi> by the ſupernatural agency of the Holy Spirit—the <hi>ſovereignty</hi> of divine grace in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinners—the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> DEITY of the Lord JESUS CHRIST—the neceſſity of <hi>faith</hi> in Chriſt, as the only condition of an intereſt in him, and in all the benefits of his purchaſe—the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt the only meritorious ground of our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God—<hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>good works</hi> as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, and the never-failing <hi>fruits</hi> and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a <hi>true faith—holineſs</hi> of heart and life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man can ſee the Lord"—and the final and unfruſtrable <hi>perſeverance</hi> of true Chriſtians in grace and holineſs, to eternal life, through the <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of God, and the all-prevalent <hi>interceſſion</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A perſon muſt be a great ſtranger to the character and hiſtory of our <hi>fathers,</hi> who does not know <hi>theſe</hi> were their avowed ſentiments and principles, as to the <hi>doctrines</hi> of religion. <hi>Theſe</hi> were truths, dearer to them than their eſtates—yea, than life itſelf. And
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:027629_0046_0FD6198365CB7210"/>
they are but the <hi>ſame</hi> doctrines which have been held and preached by the moſt famous PROTESTANT DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINES in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> ſince the REFORMATION from popery. <hi>Divines</hi> as eminent for learning and piety, perhaps, as ever adorned the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>And, in this connexion, I may obſerve farther, without impropriety—That it is not a little remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that through the ſingular goodneſs and watchful care of divine providence towards the <hi>children</hi> of our <hi>forefathers, theſe ſame doctrines</hi> have, invariably, from generation to generation, been preached in <hi>this town,</hi> the fear of our anceſtors, with becoming boldneſs, zeal and affection, by <hi>all my predeceſſors in office,</hi> who now "reſt from their labors, and their works follow them."—And if I may take the liberty, I will hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly add—that <hi>theſe</hi> great and infinitely important truths, I have <hi>endeavoured,</hi> according to my capacity, to preach and declare, with all plainneſs, to <hi>you</hi>— to your <hi>fathers</hi> and to your <hi>children.</hi> For the truth of this, I hope I have a witneſs in your own breaſts. —And as I am bound to "watch for your ſouls, as one that must give an account," ſo I am determined, by the grace of Chriſt enabling me, ſtill to declare them to you. And, as I hope to live and die in the belief and comfort of them, myſelf—as I am ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they have been a ſweet ſupport to many of <hi>your</hi> and <hi>my</hi> departed friends, in a dying hour, and their
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:027629_0047_0FD5554EA2CD0EC0"/>
               <hi>only</hi> ground of hope—ſo I am fully perſuaded they are the only foundation, on which <hi>we</hi> can leave the world in peace. I may therefore, under theſe views, with great propriety, adopt the words of the apoſtle— "Neceſſity is laid upon me, and woe unto me; if I preach not this goſpel."</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Our ſubject naturally reminds us of the peculiar obligations we are under to "remember" with higheſt praiſe and gratitude the <hi>works of grace,</hi> which God hath wrought—the wonderful work of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt—the application of it by the Holy Spirit, in the converſion of ſinners from age to age; bringing them out of the dark, miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wretched kingdom of Satan, into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord Jeſus—ſubduing the enmity of their minds, and bringing them to a cordial reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iation to God. Thankfully ſhould we "remember, likewiſe, all thoſe gracious ſeaſons of <hi>revival</hi> of <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> by the out-pouring of the ſpirit of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by poor ſinners are delivered from the cruel bondage of the Devil, and vindicated into the glorious liberty of the children of God." And while ſpeaking on this ſubject, I might juſtly be chargeable with crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ingratitude, ſhould I neglect to mention, with deep humility and thankfulneſs, the wonderful work of God's grace and power which we in <hi>this place</hi> have witneſſed the year paſt. <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Appendix.</note> We humbly hope
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:027629_0048_0FD6198533AE54D8"/>
and truſt, that through the infinite mercy of God, many have experienced that divine, renewing <hi>work of grace</hi> upon their hearts, which they will "remember" with grateful praiſes to all eternity. May their hope "<hi>purify</hi> them, even as Chriſt is pure." To conclude, let us ever retain a thankful "remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the works of the Lord, and the wonders" he has wrought both for our <hi>fathers</hi> of old, and for <hi>us</hi> their children, in later times—and conſider the amazing ingratitude we ſhall be guilty of, ſhould we, either forget, or not live anſwerable to our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Let us ſet a high value upon thoſe privileges, civil and ſacred, which we now enjoy, as we would avoid the guilt of the blackeſt ingratitude to Heaven— and of caſting a ſacrilegious contempt upon the memory and blood of our <hi>anceſtors.</hi> We are bound by the moſt ſacred ties of duty to GOD—of eſteem and gratitude to our <hi>fathers</hi>—and of affection and concern for our <hi>children,</hi> to maintain a religious and inviolable regard for thoſe invaluable bleſſings, which have been handed down to us, through ſuch a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of ſufferings, labour and danger.</p>
            <p>May the Lord God of our <hi>fathers</hi> ſtill delight to dwell with us, and to do us good as he did to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may the divine Spirit be poured out more and more upon us, for the revival of pure and primitive Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianity! may his loving kindneſs never depart from

us or from our children. And may we ſtrive to be "followers of them who through faith and patience are now inheriting the promiſes." And O! may we and ours, at laſt, with them, in a world of perfect love, ſee and adore, with wonder and delight, the myſteries of providence, and grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſhall then be opened up, to our everlaſting joy and ſatisfaction; and with them, and all the heavenly hoſts, may we join in anthems of praiſe and hallelujahs to the FATHER, to the SON and to the HOLY GHOST, one God over all, bleſſed for ever-more.—AMEN.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>AFTER the foregoing ſermon was prepared for the preſs, it was ſuggeſted, that perhaps, ſome more particular account of what is hinted at in the Improvement, relative to a <hi>revival of religion</hi> in this place, might be gratifying to <hi>ſome,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to thoſe who, living at a diſtance, may have heard ſomething of it, but from imperfect repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, may not have been able to form juſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it—and hoping it will not be offenſive to any; eſpecially ſince it coincides ſo naturally, with the preceeding text and ſubject—it is concluded to ſubjoin the following, by way of appendix; which is taken from a particular account of this matter, which the writer has recorded, in the <hi>records of this church:</hi> which is as follows—</p>
            <p>"<hi>Nov.</hi> 9<hi>th.</hi> 1793. After the example of my ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable and pious predeceſſor, the Rev. <hi>Mr. Leonard,</hi> (on an occaſion, in ſome reſpects, ſimilar) I think it may be for the glory of God, the honour of the Redeemer, the comfort of his children, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of poſterity, to mention here, and leave upon record, the wonderful diſplays of God's rich and ſovereign grace towards this people, in a remarkable <hi>revival of religion,</hi> through the bleſſed out-pouring of the Spirit of God, this year—which firſt began to appear, the latter part of <hi>Dec.</hi> and beginning of <hi>Jan.</hi> laſt. No uncommon diſpenſation of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—no public calamity, or any thing of that nature, had taken place, which might be aſſigned as an awakening cauſe of it. It ſeemed, apparently, to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027629_0051_0FD619880B0E98D0"/>
be by the ſtill, ſmall voice of the Spirit of God, the Author of all true religion—by his ſecret, but power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operation upon the minds of one and another; until, from ſmall beginnings, it became more and more extenſive; and at length, a general ſolemnity and ſerious concern ſeemed viſibly to prevail through the town. The minds and attention of the greater part of the people appeared to be, in a greater or leſs degree, arreſted on the ſubject of religion and the great concerns of another world. Beſides the ſtated worſhip on Lord's days, we had frequent lectures in public and in private, on week days; and religious meetings for conference and ſocial worſhip in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſes, ſeveral evenings in the week, in different parts of the town. Among which, it was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the <hi>young children,</hi> from ſeven or eight, to fifteen years old, voluntarily agreed to meet once or twice a-week under the patronage, and by the conſent of their parents and guardians; at which times they prayed, ſang, read and converſed upon the great things of another world; and behaved with great decency, order and unuſual ſolemnity; commonly to the number of 30 and 40—oftentimes more, even to 70 and 80—ſeveral times to upwards of 90—and yet, ſurpriſing it was to obſerve, with what ſilence, they behaved, in coming to, and going from, as well as at their meetings. Moſt certainly, for a conſiderable time—even for ſeveral months, there was a viſible and happy alteration among the youth and children— and there is reaſon to hope, ſome have been made partakers of a ſaying change.—Beſides theſe, great numbers, of different ages, in the town, have been ſeriouſly engaged and deeply impreſſed with the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely important concerns of their ſouls and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And we have abundant reaſon humbly to hope, that a goodly number have really been made the happy ſubjects of the infinitely rich, free and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:027629_0052_0FD6198AE33AEBC0"/>
grace of God—who have
<q>witneſſed a good confeſſion before men,</q>
and who hitherto, all have appeared to be of blameleſs life and to walk agreeably to their profeſſion—O that they may continue, and endure to the end! more than 50 have, within a few months, been added to our communion, and many more, it is expected, will join, who have expreſſed their deſires, and who entertain a hope of their being the ſubjects of real religion, at this time.</p>
            <p>It is alſo to be remarked, with gratitude and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that during this wonderful ſeaſon of divine power and goodneſs here, the work has been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably free from thoſe irregularities, diſorders, enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic reveries, and thoſe corrupt mixtures, which, in times paſt, have been the unhappy occaſion of great ſtumbling to many ſerious minds, and of bitter oppoſition from others, and which have brought great and indeliable reproach upon religion.—And although it is not to be expected, while the world ſtands, and while the church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in its mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtate, but that there will be every where, <hi>ſome,</hi> who diſregard religion wholly,
<q>caring for none of theſe things—</q>
               <hi>others</hi> who are enemies to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his kingdom, and will be oppoſed to the truths and cauſe of God—and <hi>others</hi> again, who profeſs to be friendly to religion, but have different conceptions of <hi>ſome things</hi> relating to it, from others; towards whom, we would be very far from feeling an uncharitable diſpoſition—yet, I ſay, we have reaſon to ſpeak of it with thankfulneſs, there hath been <hi>leſs viſible oppoſition</hi> to this work, than has been uſual, at ſuch times: which may probably (under a divine influence, and the reſtraining grace of God) be, in ſome meaſure, the effect of that Spirit of liberty, of toleration and free inquiry, more prevalent at this day, than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:027629_0053_0FD6198C983EF478"/>It is very pleaſant to behold many, who formerly led vicious, careleſs and ungodly lives, and who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to live without God in the world; nor had any thought or concern about their ſouls and an another life, now become ſerious and reformed, delighting themſelves in religion, and of a holy, heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment and converſation. And 'tis beautiful to ſee many who are quite <hi>young,</hi> publickly owning Chriſt before the world, and engaged in practical religion, devoting themſelves to the ſervice of God in the days of their youth—thus crying "<hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the Son of David." That paſſage has been truly veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied amongſt us,
<q>Out of the mouths of babes, and children, the Lord hath ordained praiſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is likewiſe a pleaſing conſideration to obſerve that fervent, Chriſtian <hi>love</hi> and <hi>unity,</hi> and that ſweet communion, which ſubſiſts among the profeſſed friends of CHRIST; who frequently meet together, and "ſpeak often one to another," of the great things of CHRIST's kingdom, and his glorious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and grace, to their mutual edification, comfort and quickening. And we have found unſpeakable benefit from ſuch private <hi>conferences</hi>; and have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, they have been remarkably owned of God, as a means of keeping alive a ſenſe of God, and a ſavour of religion and eternal things, in our own ſouls; agreeable to that word
<q>As iron ſharpeneth iron, ſo doth the countenance of a man his friend.</q>
We have often been, on theſe occaſions, conſtrained to believe and ſay, "Surely God is in this place—" and with the diſciples, "It is good for us to be here." And bleſſed be the name of God, that we <hi>ſtill</hi> have the gracious and evident tokens of the divine preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence among us, and the influences of his Holy Spirit; when it is now more than <hi>ten months,</hi> ſince the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening and attention began. And with regard to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:027629_0054_0FD55560245E93D0"/>
(if I may be allowed to ſpeak ſo perſonally) I am ſure I have the utmoſt reaſon to remark, with lively and humble gratitude, the goodneſs of God, to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy creature, in ſtrengthening, and ſupporting him (naturally of a very feeble conſtitution) under arduous labours, in preaching more abundantly—viſiting— converſing with perſons under ſpiritual trouble— conference-meetings, &amp;c. for ſo long a time together. It is to be aſcribed alone to the goodneſs and power of God, whoſe "ſtrength has been made perfect in weakneſs." And to him be all, all the praiſe and glory for ever; and may his name be magnified more and more—and his work be ſtill carried on here and throughout the land! And may theſe drops of mercy be a happy prelude of a more glorious and plentiful ſhower of divine grace, and may the world be filled with the glory of the Lord!—This record is here made, as a grateful memorial, to the honour of the bleſſed <hi>REDEEMER:</hi> and may the generations which ſhall come after us, ſee it and praiſe his name.— Let them "remember the works of the Lord; ſurely let them remember his wonders of old."</p>
