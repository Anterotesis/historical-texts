            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>My Text conſiders <hi>us,</hi> 1. in our <hi>Sins,</hi> and ſpeaks of <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Juſtice</hi> as a <hi>conſuming Fire:</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders us alſo, 2. under the <hi>Wing</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God's <hi>Grace,</hi> and it ſpeaks of the <hi>Mercies and Compaſſions of God,</hi> to his ſinful provoking Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>new every Morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are here <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> every Day to do enough to <hi>provoke</hi> the conſuming Anger of our God; and this gives the <hi>Glory</hi> to His Mercies, in all their <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Multitude,</hi> notwithſtanding our daily <hi>Forfeitures</hi> of them all, and <hi>Deſert</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Wrath.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> in my <hi>Context</hi> was in a manner, and in the very <hi>Letter</hi> conſumed; <hi>Judea, Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, and his <hi>Synagogues</hi> thro' the Land, were <hi>burnt with Fire;</hi> moſt of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants had been <hi>ſlain</hi> with the Sword, and the Reſidue, a ſmall <hi>Remnant,</hi> were led into a doleful <hi>Captivity,</hi> to conſume away there for <hi>ſeventy Years.</hi> This it is that the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> is here <hi>lamenting</hi> in the Name of the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Church; yet never the leſs, that there was
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004131_0004_1003D2F6898B5C00"/>a Remnant or <hi>eſcaping,</hi> he acknowledges to be of the <hi>Lord's Mercies,</hi> and of his <hi>unfailing Compaſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He writes for <hi>our Warning</hi> and learning, on whom the <hi>Ends</hi> of the World are come, and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully admoniſhes <hi>us</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Lord,</hi> "That when the Day of Mercy is <hi>paſt</hi> with Places and Perſons, they will be <hi>conſumed</hi> by the burning Wrath of God; His Mercies will be <hi>clean gone,</hi> and his Compaſſions <hi>fail for evermore.</hi> —This Day of Mercy might have been <hi>paſt with us</hi> long ſince, and that it is not <hi>ſo</hi> is becauſe <hi>God's Compaſſions fail not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many more and various are the <hi>Reflections</hi> which the <hi>Text</hi> affords us, but I will content my ſelf with theſe <hi>three</hi> moſt plain and eaſy <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Lord our God is of great <hi>Mercies and Compaſſions.</hi> 2. His Compaſſions <hi>fail not.</hi> 3. Hence it is that <hi>we are not conſumed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Lord our God is of great Mercies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions.</hi> Theſe my <hi>Text</hi> ſuppoſes, aſſerts and magnifies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercy</hi> in God is his Goodneſs and Grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and exerciſed toward <hi>ſinful Creatures. Compaſſion</hi> in God ſpeaks <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> to the Pity and <hi>Bowels</hi> of <hi>Human Nature</hi> toward Conſorts, Children, Relatives and Friends in Affliction. We know well what a <hi>Mother's</hi> Bowels are, and a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi> Pity, and a <hi>Friend's</hi> Sympathy; and by theſe it pleaſes God (in his great Condeſcention) to repreſent the working of his <hi>Mercy</hi> toward his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004131_0005_1003D2FAA95CAB38"/>People. Pſal. ciii. 13. <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his Children ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</hi> Jer. xxxi 20. <hi>I earneſtly remember him, my Bowels are troubled for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Compaſſion</hi> in Man cauſes a <hi>painful</hi> Commotion within him, being mix'd of <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> but the <hi>render Mercies</hi> of God are without the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our Pity.</p>
            <p>No wonder that the <hi>Scripture</hi> abounds in this moſt <hi>endearing</hi> Repreſentation of God to us; for if he will be a God to <hi>Sinners,</hi> He muſt be a God of Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>It ſpeaks <hi>all the Glories</hi> of the Name of God, proclaimed before <hi>Moſes, "merciful, gracious, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering and abundant in Goodneſs.</hi> Pſal lxxxvi. 15. <hi>But thou, O Lord, art a God full of Compaſſion and gracious, longſuffering and plenteous in Mercy.</hi> And again, Pſal. cxlv. 8. <hi>The Lord is gracious and full of Compaſſion, ſlow to Anger, and of great Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is no Expreſſion more <hi>moving</hi> than that, Iſai lxiii 15. <hi>The ſounding of thy Bowels, and of thy Mercy toward me:</hi> and that, Luke i. 78. <hi>The Bowels of the Mercy of our God.</hi> The Bowels of a God are more <hi>tender</hi> than thoſe of a Father or Mother: Iſai. xlix 15. <hi>Can a Woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have Compaſſion on the Son of her Womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would raiſe us to the laſt Pitch of Brotherly Love and Goodneſs, he bids us <hi>put on Bowels of Mercies;</hi> and when <hi>another</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004131_0006_1003D307C38AE028"/>Apoſtle is naming the Love of God to us, he as vehemently forbids <hi>our ſhutting up Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion</hi> from one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such</hi> are the <hi>Divine Compaſſions:</hi> And if you <hi>ask,</hi> "Whence then is it that we ſee ſo many <hi>Objects of Miſery</hi> round about us, and that the <hi>Children of God</hi> themſelves are ſo often the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of grievous Afflictions? the <hi>Anſwer</hi> is eaſy,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are of our <hi>Selves</hi> and our <hi>Sins;</hi> this is the <hi>Original</hi> and meritorious Cauſe of them: We may not charge <hi>God</hi> with them, but muſt take the Blame and Shame of them to our Selves. Lament. i. 18. <hi>The Lord is righteous, for we have rebelled againſt him.</hi> Jer. ii. 19. <hi>Haſt thou not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured this unto thy Self? thine own Wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy Backſlidings ſhall reprove thee: Know therefore and ſee that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my Fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God ſends <hi>ſore Afflictions</hi> on Sinners very often in <hi>great Mercy</hi> and in tender <hi>Pity:</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the Evil of their Sins, to bring them to Repentance, and ſo to prepare them for the Favours of his Providence and the Comforts of his Grace in this Life, and for his Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercies in that to come. Rev. iii. 19. <hi>Whom I love I rebuke and chaſten, be zealous therefore and repent.</hi> Heb. xii. 6. <hi>For whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, as a Father his Son in whom he delighteth.</hi> —A loving <hi>Parent</hi> corrects his Son from a real and ſtrong Affection, and from true <hi>Compaſſion.</hi> A Father can be very <hi>angry</hi> with a ſinning Child, but upon his Humiliation and Repentance he

               <hi>tenders</hi> him again. And ſo does our <hi>Heavenly Father:</hi> Jerem. xxxi. 18. <hi>I have ſurely heard E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim bemoaning himſelf thus, "Thou haſt chaſtiſed me,</hi> &amp;c: "Is he <hi>a dear Son, is he a pleaſant Child? for I do earneſtly remember him ſtill, I will ſurely have Mercy on him, faith the Lord.</hi> Souls in the deepeſt Humiliation of Repentance, ſhould be in the ſtrongeſt Exerciſe of Faith in the Divine Compaſſions. This is in a lively manner repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in my <hi>Context,</hi> Ver. 28—32. <hi>He ſitteth alone and keepeth Silence, he putteth his Mouth in the Duſt, he is filled with Reproach; for the Lord will not caſt off for ever, but tho' he cauſe Grief yet will be have Compaſſion, according to the Multitude of his Mercies; for he doth not willingly afflict or grieve the Children of Men.</hi>

I am now to go on, and ſay of theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Compaſſions</hi> and Mercies, that they <hi>fail not:</hi> No, they are <hi>new every Morning:</hi> they continue and abide, keep their Courſe and go their Round; returning on us as conſtantly as the <hi>Day</hi> and as the <hi>Sun</hi> do. Every Day brings <hi>new</hi> Mercies; and they are like the <hi>Rayes of Light</hi> for Number and for Kind, bright and conſpicuous, and in infinite endleſs Succeſſions. Or if you will take the Compariſon from the living Springs and Fountains of <hi>Water,</hi> which ſend forth their chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Streams day and night for our Supply and Refreſhment; <hi>God</hi> is this <hi>Fountain of living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; a Spring of Water, whoſe Waters fail not,</hi> Iſai. lviii. 11.</p>
            <p>We read of the Bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> that He is <hi>rich</hi> in in Mercy, <hi>plenteous</hi> in Mercy, <hi>abundant</hi> in Mercy,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004131_0008_1003D31B2574A368"/>and that it is <hi>Everlaſting:</hi> A Mercy that <hi>never fails</hi> muſt be <hi>all</hi> this, can be nothing leſs.</p>
            <p>As God is in <hi>Himſelf,</hi> ſuch muſt his <hi>Mercies</hi> be. If <hi>He</hi> be the immenſe infinite <hi>Being,</hi> eternal and unchangeable; how ſhould his Compaſſions <hi>fail?</hi> any more than Eternity and Infinity be exhauſted.— With what a <hi>Run</hi> of Repetition therefore, and of Pleaſure, does the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> teach us to ſing of a <hi>Mercy</hi> that never fails? Pſal. cxxxvi. "<hi>For his Mercy endureth for Ever! for his Mercy endureth for Ever!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Compaſſions of God may <hi>ceaſe</hi> indeed toward particular <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> and yet <hi>He</hi> remain the <hi>ſame</hi> Compaſſionate God: His <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will not always ſtrive</hi> with provoking Sinners; the Day of his Grace <hi>ends</hi> with many, and with ſome ſooner than with others: His Mercies <hi>ceaſe for ever</hi> as to <hi>impenitent</hi> Sinners, and are <hi>gone for evermore</hi> as to them that <hi>die</hi> ſo: But they can never fail <hi>at all</hi> toward the proper and only <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of them, or in that <hi>Courſe</hi> which the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wiſdom of God has ſettled for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and everlaſting Diſplay of them: The Immutability of God and the Promiſes of his Word make it impoſſible. Iſai. xxx. 18. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will the Lord</hi> wait <hi>that he may be gracious, and will be exalted in ſhewing Mercy, for the Lord is a God of Judgment, and bleſſed are all they that wait for him.</hi> As God's <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is like the great Mountains, high and conſpicuous, fix'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable; ſo his <hi>Compaſſions</hi> ſtand upon his <hi>Truth</hi> and Faithfulneſs: Iſai. liv. 10. <hi>The Mountains ſhall depart, and the Hills be removed; but my Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall not depart from thee, nor the Covenant of my
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004131_0009_1003D31F0FD35888"/>Peace be removed, faith the Lord that hath Mercy on thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have highly <hi>deſerved</hi> that the Compaſſions of God ſhould have been at <hi>an utter End,</hi> as to <hi>us,</hi> long ago; yet they have not <hi>failed</hi> even to <hi>us</hi> evil &amp; unthankful, unto this Day; no not in any or all of the <hi>Afflictions</hi> that have come upon us for our <hi>Sins:</hi> Ezra ix. 13. <hi>Thou Lord haſh puniſhed us leſs than our Iniquities have deſerved.</hi> Pſal. lxxviii. 38. <hi>But He being full of Compaſſion deſtroyed them not, yea many a time turned he his Anger away, and did not ſtir up all his Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come therefore to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">III. Hence it is that <hi>we are not conſumed;</hi> even of the <hi>Lord's Mercies,</hi> and becauſe <hi>they fail not:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us <hi>turn aſide</hi> and ſee this <hi>great Sight,</hi> this Wonder of Grace! like that which <hi>Moſes</hi> had in <hi>Horeb;</hi> he ſaw <hi>a Buſh on Fire, and it was not conſumed!</hi> My <hi>Text</hi> gives us the ſame Sight of <hi>God,</hi> as a <hi>conſuming Fire,</hi> and of <hi>our Selves</hi> as Chaff and <hi>Stubble</hi> before devouring Fire, and yet not <hi>conſumed</hi> thereby. As the <hi>Word</hi> of God, ſo a wicked <hi>World</hi> is full of theſe <hi>two</hi> things; the <hi>flaming Anger</hi> of God againſt Sin, and yet a Multitude of Sinners not <hi>conſumed</hi> thereby.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon and <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this is to be <hi>ſought,</hi> and can be only <hi>found</hi> in God Himſelf: It is of the <hi>Lord's Mercies</hi> and his unfailing Compaſſions. Not for <hi>our</hi> Repentance, or <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> be it <hi>known</hi> to us, but for His own <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> ſake. "<hi>Not unto us, O Lord!</hi> muſt we ſay, <hi>Not unto us! but to Thy Name give Glory; for thy Mercy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004131_0010_1003D323FB66F478"/>and for thy Truths ſake,</hi> Pſal. cxv. 1. As we muſt take our <hi>Pleas</hi> in Prayer from God <hi>Himſelf,</hi> his own <hi>Perfections</hi> Word and Works; ſo we muſt <hi>aſcribe</hi> to the Glory of his Name and <hi>Attributes</hi> in our Adorations and Thankſgivings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We behold God here in his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and in his <hi>Judgments</hi> a <hi>conſuming Fire;</hi> and Sinners the <hi>Chaff</hi> and Stubble, ready to be <hi>conſumed.</hi> Heb. xii. 29. <hi>For the Lord our God is a conſuming Fire.</hi> God is <hi>angry</hi> with the wicked every Day. His holy Anger <hi>burns</hi> againſt the provoking Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of his righteous Law, and if it falls upon them they are <hi>conſumed.</hi> We read of the <hi>Heat</hi> of his Anger, and of its <hi>ſmoaking</hi> againſt a Perſon or People. This is <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>felt</hi> in his <hi>Judgments,</hi> of one Kind or of another. Exod. xxxii. 10. <hi>Let me alone, that my Wrath may wax</hi> hot <hi>againſt them, that I may</hi> conſume <hi>them.</hi> Iſai. v. 24. <hi>As the Fire devoureth the Stubble, and the Flame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the Chaff; ſo is the Anger of the Lord kindled againſt his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God eaſily conſumes a wicked People by peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential <hi>Sickneſſes,</hi> by <hi>Famine</hi> or <hi>War;</hi> by <hi>Fires</hi> aſhore and by <hi>Storms</hi> at Sea. He needs not call for his more <hi>ſtrange</hi> Works of Terror, <hi>Earthquakes</hi> and <hi>Inundations.</hi> He burns down our <hi>Bodies</hi> as well as our <hi>Dwellings,</hi> when he pleaſes. The various <hi>Fevers</hi> that conſume us from our Dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are but ſo many putrid noxious <hi>Fires</hi> within us, which God kindles &amp; quenches as he pleaſes. Pſal. xxxix. 10, 11. <hi>Remove thy Stroke away from me, I am conſumed by the Blow of thy Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004131_0011_1003D32B2B8B6A48"/>
The <hi>Fire</hi> of God's <hi>Wrath</hi> is yet <hi>ſeven times hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Sinners; and the <hi>Flame</hi> of it drinks up their <hi>Spirits. Hell Torments</hi> are repreſented to us by a <hi>Worm</hi> that never <hi>dies,</hi> and by <hi>Fire unquenchable.</hi> This <hi>Tophet is ordained of old,</hi> from the Day wherein the <hi>Angels</hi> fell it was <hi>prepared;</hi> it is <hi>deep and large, the Pile thereof is Fire and much Wood; the Breath of the Lord, like a Stream of Brimſtone, doth kindle it.</hi> This <hi>Lake of Fire</hi> is the <hi>ſecond Death.</hi> Souls are <hi>tormented in this Flame,</hi> and never <hi>conſumed.</hi> This is Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to the uttermoſt, "<hi>the Vengeance of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fire:—Conſume them in Wrath, conſume them, that they may not be!</hi> But Oh! they can never ceaſe to be! the <hi>Smoke of their Torment ariſeth for ever and ever!</hi> and ſo continues their <hi>Weeping and Wailing and gnaſhing of Teeth</hi> unto Eternal Ages!—Let us tremble at the Thought of this <hi>devouring Fire,</hi> theſe <hi>everlaſting Burnings!</hi> God has mercifully <hi>warned us to flee from this Wrath to come,</hi> and to <hi>bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance.</hi> Wherefore let us turn again our Eyes, and ſee</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> GOD in his <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Compaſſions</hi> ſparing, preſerving and <hi>ſaving</hi> Sinners from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>conſumed</hi> by his Wrath. In the Riches of his Patience, Forbearance, and Long-ſuffering, he <hi>waiteth</hi> on them to be gracious: He <hi>reveals</hi> his ſaving Mercies to them, he <hi>offers</hi> it; ſhows 'em the <hi>Way</hi> of it, how it <hi>can</hi> be glorified to them, and then tenderly <hi>invites</hi> and <hi>beſeeches</hi> them to ſeek after it and accept of it. He calls on them by his <hi>Word,</hi> ſtrives with them by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſends all his Servants his <hi>Miniſters, riſing up early and ſending them; allures</hi> them by the Mercies and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> of his Providence, and <hi>awakens</hi> them by
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004131_0012_1003B59772193200"/>his <hi>Judgments:</hi> He calls on 'em to <hi>repent,</hi> gives them a <hi>Space</hi> for Repentance, threatens 'em in their <hi>Impenitence,</hi> and yet in his Compaſſions tries 'em again, with <hi>Line upon Line</hi> and <hi>Precept upon Precept.</hi> The Language of all this we have in Iſai. lxiii. 6, 7. <hi>For he ſaid, ſurely they are my People, Children that will not lie, ſo he was their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: In all their Affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Preſence ſaved them: In his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them; he hare them and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them all the Days of old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is of the <hi>Lord's Mercies</hi> that we are not conſumed by <hi>temporal</hi> Judgments, and cut off by the Blow of his Hand; and it is yet more of his <hi>Mercies</hi> that our <hi>Souls</hi> are not roaring under that <hi>Fire</hi> of his Wrath, which <hi>burns to the loweſt Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is of his <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> who <hi>has Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and hath Compaſſion becauſe he will have Compaſſion:</hi> Rom. ix. 15. And <hi>what if God willing to ſhew his Wrath and to make his Power known, endure with much Long-ſuffering the Veſſels of Wrath fitted for Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is of his <hi>Unchangeableneſs</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> as it follows on my <hi>Text, "Great is his Faithfulneſs!</hi> and as He tells us of Himſelf, Mal iii. 16. "<hi>I am the Lord, I change not; therefore the Sons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in ſhort, It is owing to the <hi>Sacrifice of Chriſt for Sin,</hi> that the <hi>Mercies</hi> of the Lord and his <hi>Compaſſions</hi> are ſo great and <hi>unfailing</hi> toward us, and <hi>new</hi> every Day. All the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004131_0013_1003D3335BADB568"/>come to us thro' our <hi>Lord Jeſus;</hi> and for His Sake it is that we are not <hi>conſumed.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Anger of God <hi>fell on Him,</hi> who was <hi>able</hi> to bear it; and bore it <hi>for us,</hi> and bears it away <hi>from</hi> us. He was made <hi>Sin</hi> for us, and bore the <hi>Weight</hi> of Divine Wrath in his holy <hi>Soul;</hi> made his Soul <hi>an Offering,</hi> to ſatisfy and appeaſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Juſtice of God; and it is the <hi>Water and Blood from his pierced Side</hi> that <hi>quenches</hi> the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wrath of God, which <hi>preys</hi> upon unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and impenitent Sinners for ever and ever. The <hi>Reprieve</hi> and Reſpite of our forfeited <hi>Lives</hi> from inſtant <hi>Death,</hi> and even the daily Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Dwellings</hi> from conſuming <hi>Flames,</hi> is from the <hi>ſprinkling</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> of this our ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Paſſover</hi> on our Houſes and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.

            <p>And now to lead You into ſome <hi>Application</hi> and ſuitable <hi>Improvement</hi> of the preſent Truth;</p>
            <p n="1">I. Let the great <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Compaſſions</hi> of our God <hi>endear his bleſſed Name to us,</hi> and command our thankful <hi>Love</hi> and joyful <hi>Praiſes.</hi> God is <hi>Love!</hi> how glorious an Object of Admiration and Adoration does He appear to us in this <hi>Idea!</hi> How great is his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> how great is his <hi>Beauty!</hi> So when the Lord was pleaſed to make all his <hi>Glory</hi> to paſs before <hi>Moſes,</hi> He proclaimed his <hi>Name, "The Lord God, gracious and merciful, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us deſire to be <hi>like</hi> the bleſſed God in <hi>this</hi> his Glory; to be <hi>merciful and compaſſionate to Thoſe that are in Miſery,</hi> in Want and <hi>Indigence,</hi> as God is to us. This is the <hi>Rule</hi> and Law that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has given us, Luke vi. 36. <hi>Be ye therefore merciful, a your Father is alſo merciful.</hi> In this let us <hi>be Followers of God as dear Children and walk in Love.</hi> The merciful God cannot bear unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in us.

"Did I not weep for him that was in Trouble?</hi> ſaid he; <hi>Was not my Soul grieved for the Poor? "If I withheld them from their Deſire, or cauſed the Eyes of the Widow to fail! if I have eaten my Morſel alone, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs hath not eaten thereof? if I have ſeen any periſh for want of Cloathing, or the Poor without Covering!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Chriſt</hi> commendeth his <hi>Love</hi> to us, in that while we were <hi>Enemies</hi> he died for us. In this <hi>David</hi> was his royal <hi>Type,</hi> Pſal. xxxv. 11, 12. <hi>Falſe Witneſſes did riſe up, they laid to my Charge things that I knew not; they rewarded me Evil for Good to the ſpoiling of my Soul; But as for me, when they were
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004131_0015_1003D339230D5BB0"/>ſick my Cloathing was Sackcloth,</hi> &amp;c. Such a <hi>Law</hi> well became the Mouth of <hi>Chriſt, "I ſay unto you, Love your Enemies.</hi> He has given the Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious <hi>Example,</hi> in his Compaſſions on <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Let us admire God in his <hi>Eternity and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs;</hi> becauſe his Compaſſions <hi>fail not,</hi> but are <hi>new every Morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Incommunicable</hi> Attributes of God give infinite Glory to his <hi>other</hi> Perfections. They are <hi>all</hi> eternal and immutable. Theſe higheſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Godhead</hi> exalt Him above all Bleſſing and Praiſe. It is <hi>High,</hi> and we cannot attain unto it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is <hi>everlaſting Conſolation</hi> to the People of God. They have the eternal Truth and Power of an Unchangeable God to truſt in. Read how the <hi>Prophet</hi> mildly rebukes their <hi>Fears,</hi> and tenderly reproaches the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of their Faith, when they were ready to <hi>ſtagger</hi> at the Promiſe in the Day of <hi>Trial</hi> and Affliction: Iſai. xl. 27,—31. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou, O Jacob, and ſpeakeſt O Iſrael, My Way is hid from the Lord, and my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is paſſed over from my God? Haſt thou not known, haſt thou not heard, that the Everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the Ends of the Earth, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, neither is weary? there is no ſearching of his Underſtanding. He giveth Power to the faint, and to them that have no Might be increaſeth Strength: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Youths ſhall faint and be weary, and the young Men ſhall utterly fail; but they that wait on the Lord ſhall renew their Strength; they ſhall mount up with Wings as Eagles; they ſhall run and not be weary, they ſhall walk and not faint.</hi>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004131_0016_1003B5A30190A280"/>
2. Let us ſee to it that <hi>we be intereſted in</hi> and <hi>are the Objects of</hi> the Divine Compaſſions. Elſe what ſignifies it to <hi>us</hi> that they <hi>can never fail</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>proper</hi> Objects of them. Unleſs we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of our Sins, and believe in Chriſt, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Him as our Lord and Saviour, and obey the Goſpel, we do not put our Selves in the Way of his ſure and everlaſting <hi>Mercies:</hi> Nay we are ſure to be at laſt <hi>conſumed</hi> by the Fire of God's Wrath.

            <p n="3">3. Let us learn to be <hi>conſtant and fixed</hi> in a merciful Spirit. This ſhall be ſome Feature and <hi>Image</hi> of the unchangeably good God, ſtampt on us.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. As God's Compaſſions <hi>fail not</hi> to us, ſo never let our Devotion, Gratitude and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>fail toward Him.</hi> True <hi>Charity,</hi> be it the Love of <hi>God</hi> or of our <hi>Nei'bour, never faileth:</hi> 1 Cor. xiii. 8.

It is the fulfilling of the Law, in a Courſe of univerſal delightful Obedience. It <hi>rejoiceth and worketh Righteouſneſs;</hi> rejoices in the Lord <hi>always,</hi> and lifts up the Heart and Feet in God's Ways.— Great indeed ſhould be our <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> in the Covenant of God, becauſe his <hi>Compaſſions</hi> and Covenant-Faithfulneſs toward us does <hi>not fail.</hi> As theſe are <hi>new</hi> to us every day, ſo they ſhould cauſe us to <hi>renew</hi> our Strength; to walk before him and be perfecting Holineſs in his Fear. Let it be our Care not to <hi>fail</hi> God's righteous Expectations from us. 1 Cor. xv. ult. <hi>Wherefore my beloved Brethren; be ye ſtedfaſt, immov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, always abounding in the Work of the Lord; for as much as ye know that your Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>

            <p n="4">IV. Is it of the Lord's Mercies <hi>that we are not conſumed?</hi> We learn</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The great Evil in Sin.</hi> It is a <hi>conſuming</hi> thing to us. It conſumes our <hi>Bodies,</hi> our <hi>Families,</hi> our worldly Subſtance and Comforts; and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes our <hi>Souls,</hi> their Powers, Pleaſures and eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Death</hi> bodily and ſpiritual is the <hi>Wages of Sin.</hi> It is a <hi>Conſumption</hi> on the Body while we <hi>live</hi> in it, by various Maladies and Pains, which bring on its conſuming away in the <hi>Grave</hi> from our Dwellings, Pſal. xlix. 14.

But <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and eternal Death conſumes the <hi>Soul.</hi> It is <hi>dead</hi> while it lives, and the <hi>ſecond Death</hi> has power over it. It is <hi>buried</hi> in Earth here, and in the bottomleſs <hi>Pit</hi> of Corruption for ever. It goes to the <hi>Generation</hi> of the miſerable, unclean and accurſed Spirits in Darkneſs, never to ſee Light.—Our Days here are <hi>conſumed</hi> in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and our Years in Trouble, by our <hi>Sins,</hi> thoſe unfruitful Works of Darkneſs; but how a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Eternity</hi> will conſume away, or a <hi>Soul</hi> in the Flames of Hell which conſume it not, no Mind can now conceive nor Words expreſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Anger</hi> of God is a <hi>dreadful</hi> thing, and He is <hi>terrible</hi> in his <hi>Juſtice</hi> to impenitent Sinners. We ſhould <hi>fear</hi> before the <hi>Holy One</hi> always, as they did at <hi>Horeb:</hi> When they ſaw the <hi>burning Mountain</hi> and heard the roaring <hi>Thunders,</hi> they ſaid '<hi>this great Fire will conſume us.</hi> Deut. v. 25. Even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſaid, "<hi>I exceedingly fear &amp; quake.</hi> Who knows the Power of God's <hi>Anger?</hi> infinitely beyond all our <hi>Fears</hi> is his Wrath. Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God ſhould be a <hi>Terror</hi> to the Wicked, for they are liable to be conſumed every Moment. "God judgeth the <hi>righteous,</hi> but he is angry with the <hi>wicked</hi> every Day: if he turn not he will <hi>whet</hi> his Sword, he hath <hi>bent</hi> his Bow and made it ready; he has <hi>prepared</hi> for him the Inſtruments of Death. "God is <hi>jealous</hi> and the Lord reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he reſerveth <hi>Wrath</hi> for his Enemies: He is ſlow to Anger and great in Power, and will not at all acquit the Wicked: the Hills <hi>melt</hi> and the Earth is <hi>burnt</hi> up at his Preſence: Who can ſtand before his Indignation? &amp; who can abide in the Fierceneſs of his Anger? Yet is the Lord <hi>good,</hi> a ſtrong Hold in the Day of Trouble, and he knoweth them that <hi>truſt</hi> in him,</p>

3. See what we owe to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of whoſe <hi>Merits</hi> and Righteouſneſs it is that we are <hi>not conſumed;</hi> or that the holy God can have Mercy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on us. The naked Eye of <hi>Nature</hi> ſees the abundant Mercies of God in a World of Sin, but it is only in the <hi>Glaſs</hi> of the Goſpel that it can make any true Obſervation thereof. No Idea of <hi>abſolute</hi> Goodneſs reaches the Caſe of the Divine <hi>Compaſſions</hi> toward us. The <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven therefore look <hi>down</hi> intently on the <hi>Mercy Seat,</hi> and admire the great <hi>Propitiation</hi> for Sin in the Death of Chriſt. We muſt look <hi>up,</hi> and lift up our Hearts with our Eyes to the <hi>Lamb ſlain</hi> in the Midſt of the Throne of God, and ſay— "<hi>God who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he loved us, who were by Nature Children of Wrath and dead in Sins, to ſhow the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his Kindneſs toward us thro Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> Eph. ii. 4, 7. Words cannot be put together, to reach this amazing Grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it of the Lord's <hi>Mercies</hi> that we are <hi>not conſumed?</hi> it loudly and earneſtly calls upon us to <hi>repent</hi> of our Sins, and ſhould be a powerful <hi>Conſtraint</hi> of Grace upon us. The ſparing <hi>Mercies</hi> and the conſuming <hi>Judgments</hi> of God, his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Wrath</hi> and his Bowels of <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> have one <hi>Voice</hi> to us, and ſhould have the ſame <hi>Effect</hi> on us.</p>
            <p>And I. May the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume</hi> us, but <hi>refine</hi> us; purge away our <hi>droſs</hi> and refine us as <hi>Silver.</hi> This is the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God meant and ſhown to his <hi>choſen</hi> People, the called by his Grace; and the Evangelical <hi>Prophes</hi> abounds in this Account of the Mind and Will

<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah i. 25, 26. xxvii. 9. xlviii. 10.</note>: "<hi>I will turn my Hand upon thee, and purely purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy Droſs, and take away all thy Tin: Zion ſhall be redeemed with Judgment and her Converts with Righteouſneſs; &amp; thou ſhalt be called the City of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the faithful City. "By this ſhall the Iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the Fruit to take away his Sin "For my Name ſake will I defer my Anger, and for my Praiſe will I refrain from thee, that I cut thee not off: Behold I have refined thee but not with Silver,</hi> "not in ſo vehement a Fire as Silver is refined, <hi>I have choſen thee in the Furnace of Affliction: For my own ſake, even for my own, will I do it</hi> O the <hi>dear</hi> Love and Mercy in ſuch <hi>ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified</hi> Afflictons! it is enough to make us <hi>zealous in repenting</hi> when God afflicts us.

            <p n="2">2.

            </p>
            <p>In the Day of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> thoſe Miniſters of Vengeance on the wicked City, haſtened <hi>Lot</hi> early in the Morning, ſaying, <hi>Ariſe, leſt thou be conſumed!</hi> and while he <hi>lingred</hi> they laid <hi>hold</hi> on his Hand, the Lord being <hi>merciful</hi> to him, and bro't him out and his <hi>Family</hi> with him, and bid them again <hi>eſcape to the Mountain, leſt they ſhould be conſumed.</hi>

So <hi>Mercy</hi> would always <hi>rejoice</hi> over us in the midſt of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and ſave us from the Flames of <hi>Hell,</hi> that <hi>Lake of Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> whereof the polluted <hi>Cities of the Plain</hi> were ſet forth for an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſuffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire,</hi> Jude <hi>v.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>O the <hi>Mercy</hi> to Sinners when the <hi>common</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or the <hi>ſingular</hi> Salvations of Providence, prove <hi>ſaving</hi> to them!
