         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</head>
            <p>WHEN I ſat down to collect the particulars of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing work, the uncommon ſucceſs of which ſtimulates me to a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which will be ready for my numerous readers in a ſhort time, I examined every character introduced with the equitable eye of juſtice. When I exhibited them to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of thoſe powerful members of ſociety, Genius and Friendſhip, I was led to think the colouring beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and the execution every way characteriſtically juſt. Since then it
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:017808_0003_0FA319CAC3C4E3B8"/>
has found its way to the public tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, where the former illuſtrious character will pay no attention to the magic eloquence of the latter.— I have been told my ſtrictures on Mr. Garrick are beneath the pen that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted the foregoing part of the work: to this it would be idle to pay any attention, while my aſſertions are founded in truth. — If thoſe elevated admirers of Mr. G. who will not think him any other than the paragon of perfection, while his great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ennobled the dramatic muſe, will take the trouble of ſcrutinizing his conduct, as Manager and Dramatic Reviewer, and leave huſband, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, friend, out of the queſtion, they will not think me diveſted of feeling, nor brand me as the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:017808_0004_0FA319CB85C4FD60"/>
of his renowned manes. Mr. Garrick's dramatic fame I bow down to with as much reverence, as the warmeſt idolater at his ſhrine; but deteſt with the majority of mankind, his parſimonious principles; nor will I think the gift of two guineas to the beſt paſtoral poet of this age, nor the bequeſt of a rotten building to his veteran brothers of the ſock and buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, monuments of benevolence, and of a ſoul of extraordinary feeling.— I looked for the beſt information in the delineation of every character, and the general voice told me I found it.</p>
            <p>I aſſure the candid reader, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of ſoul I have been ever a ſtranger to; and though I do not
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:017808_0005_0FA319CC458FC460"/>
expect to die worth a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, I am not hopeleſs that my grave will not be honoured with the tear of friendſhip, as warm and ſincerely flowing, as if I had died the firſt favourite of Plutus.</p>

He had as great a ſoreſight of future events as moſt ſpeculative men; could decypher a man of ſmall capital and great appearance, whom he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally called a cracker; ſhook hands with the firſt merchants on the Royal Exchange, and was ever foremoſt in all their cabinet councils. As he had
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017808_0014_0FA319D3057D1EF0"/>
a riſing family he was circumſpect even in trifles; ſtudied little elſe than how to acquire a proviſion to ſhield them from the winter of adverſity. Notwithſtanding all this ſagacity, he truſted as much to appearances, where riches centered, as his unthinking neighbours; and by the failure of that plunderer F—e, this laborious ſon of induſtry, and his darling family, were bereft of the honeſt harveſt of many toiling years. At the time of this national calamity, I was at his little villa at Clapham Common, with his wife and children, who mostly reſided there.</p>
               <p>When Rumour, the harbinger of theſe dreadful tidings arrived, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of miſery only could expreſs the horror that ran through the family; which was ſcarcely felt, before the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017808_0015_0FA319D3C3C8F2C8"/>
unfortunate wreck himſelf arrived with the confirmation.</p>
               <p>He entered the back part of his garden and retired to an arbour, where he and his little family uſed often to aſſemble—to hide the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his affliction.</p>
               <p>He did not remain long in this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, when his wife and children came to pour the balm of conſolation into his bleeding boſom. His eldeſt daughter, with ſurpriſing fortitude ſuppreſſed her anguiſh, while ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to chaſe from his tortured ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, the approaching ſpirit of deſpair.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017808_0016_0FA319D483AFAE08"/>
point of view as the ingenious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivalled Mrs. Wright's. My brother Billy's minatures are much admired likewiſe: I have now a very good likeneſs, neatly executed of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of —; Lady Notable ſhewed it to her, and ſhe admires it highly: She is a good creature,—I will make her a preſent of it; ſhe will be a friend to us, my dear Papa, and will recommend me.</q>

               <p>

of London, that I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out very early to attend the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of an officer belonging to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment in America; who died at his father's in Weſtminſter.</p>
               <p>My company conſiſted of ſome of his moſt affectionate companions, who were aſſembled to pay the laſt ſad tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their departed friend. This teſtimony of friendſhip to ſurvivors is a pleaſing momento of indubitable ſincerity, notwithſtanding what the children of diſappointment may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Their diſcourſe chiefly turned on the many virtues of the deceaſed: His convivial diſpoſition; amiable fidelity; and above all, the affection he bore his faithful nurſe; whoſe husband was one of the unfortunate ſoldiers that fell at the battle of Bunkers-Hill; his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her ſix-pence a-day out of his

She was dreſt in deep mourning, with her window open.— ſhe raiſed her ſwimming eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and as ſhe cloſed them the paſſing breeze bore from their heavy lids a tear—and drop't it on the coffin.</p>
               <p>During the momentary intervals from grief, ſhe reſted her eyes on the hearſe, till it was out of ſight; then ſat down in the window ſeat and wept bitterly.</p>
               <p>"This lovely woman's connection with Charles," continued he, "may not be ſo well known as it ſhould be; and as I had the happineſs of a cloſer

               <p>"This excellent young Lady is the daughter of a Baronet in the Weſt of England, who died ſome few months ago, leaving her, at her own diſpoſal a fortune of ten thouſand pounds. In a village near her reſidence Charles was brought up, under the inſpection of his grandfather, an officer on half pay, who retired to his rural aſylum after many hardſhips, and little elſe to ſolace old age, than a heart of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
               <p>"Charles was the favourite of this veteran; he infuſed in him the virtues of the ſoldier and the man. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the youth, obſerving the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful progreſs he was making, was reſolved, though dear his company was to him, to let him remain with his excellent preceptor, till he was every thing he could wiſh.</p>

The war-worn Hero was a conſtant viſitor at the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet's, always accompanied by his pupil.</p>
               <p>"Theodora and her maid uſed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to meet them in a pathway that led from her houſe to the village; and by that means had an opportunity of indulging herſelf with the converſation of her favourite Charles.</p>
               <p>"They generally let the old Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by go up the avenue, while they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through that part of the demeſne that led to the back part of the houſe.

               <p>THIS evening I was ſummoned to one of thoſe diſtinguiſhed houſes
<q>where 'prentic'd kings alarm the gaping ſtreet.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The company conſiſted of a few youths who had caught the theatrical influenza that rages with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and injures the tranquility of many parents in this populous city.</p>
               <p>By the time I arrived at the door, they were kicking up a duſt with the people of the houſe; one of them who perſonated Alexander the Great, was ſo elated with the ſublimity of his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that he broke a pier glaſs with his truncheon, as he ſwung his Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culean arm backwards.—The landlord inſiſted on immediate payment for

the accident; the hero, with all the majeſty of Macedonia's conqueror, told him all accidents in the green room were overlooked by the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and if he expected payment, he muſt wait till he took his ſeat in the chair Roſcius had juſt retired from— "Damn Rogers, and you," rejoined the landlord; "I will be paid for my property,—I'll lace you tighter than you were laced in that tinſel doublet you wore juſt now, if you don't make good the damage." Here a general engagement took place; the heroes took fire at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity offered their Garrick, and all was uproar in an inſtant:— the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady ran for a conſtable.— Alexander made his eſcape; and poor Hamlet, who had given the landlord a black eye, was ſecured. When the conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was ſhewn his prey, he griped him like a tiger by the collar, and
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:017808_0108_0FA3196D06EB1A58"/>
was hurrying him off to priſon, when he roared out, with becoming ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, — "Perdition catch thee, — I prithee take thy fingers from my throat,—I am Hamlet the Dane!" "I don't doubt it," ſays the conſtable, "I had much rather you were Chriſtian the Dane, you ſhould be ſpeedily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurated with a crown of Tyburn manufacture." — The poor Prince was taken to priſon, and the reſt of his comrades, after promiſing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large him the next morning, took their ſeat in me. —They were trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome paſſengers, and I was anxious to get rid of them, which ſoon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; for they ran from me like ſo many bedlamites, to get ſix penny-worth of Miſs Brown's <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Duenna, a Comic Opera.</note>pretty blue-eyd nun of St. Catharines.</p>

               <p>I THINK he had many virtues, and deſerved a better fate." "'Tis a merciful opinion, and will do thee more honour than a thouſand ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured reflections," ſays an elderly gentleman, to a young man, who had both taken a ſeat in me.</p>
               <p>"I will acknowledge the juſtice of his ſentence," continued the firſt; but I think the many eſſential ſervices he has done the public,—the ſtreaming tears of the Magdalen, the benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the captive and his wretched family, juſt freed from the dreary tomb of relentleſs oppreſſion,—ſhould extenuate the rigid beheſt of juſtice,— ſhould grant him the poor privilege of lingering out a miſerable exiſtence in

the obſcurity his ſorrowing ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.—From the gloomy confines of ſelf reproach, and never ceaſing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, to caſt a retroſpective look at his former elevated ſituation in life,— his boundleſs popularity!—admired genius and powerful influence! will be puniſhment enough Heaven knows! to a mind formed like his."</p>
               <p>By this time we arrived in Oxford-ſtreet. What a crowd!—it was as much as we could do to get along:— the melancholly proceſſion had not yet arrived.— "We will have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity," continued he, if we ſtop here, to hear the various opinions of the multitude aſſembled on this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn occaſion; they will ſpeak their minds freely,—'tis the privilege of Engliſhmen;—and what their honeſt natures cannot conceal."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:017808_0147_0FA3198A45159708"/>"Poor ſoul!" ſays a tattered wretch, he relieved me in my laſt ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-in." Thou art a grateful creature for the acknowledgement at this hour," ſays an old gentleman, giving her a ſhilling.—"He was a vile hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite," ſays a fine gentleman, riding by, who paid more attention to the one offence, than to the numberleſs good actions of the criminal.</p>
               <p>"Thou art a mercileſs monſter," ſays a clergyman, "and deſerve a worſe fate for thy cruel aſſertion." Hundreds wiſhed for an opportunity to appeaſe their rage, by executing a certain lord high in office in the criminal's ſtead.</p>
               <p>His cruel decree in the privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,—the weight of his thoughts with the moſt merciful of kings, who was preſſed by pity and clemency to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend their throne, but could not van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the voice of obduracy.</p>
               <p>

"Split my top-ſails, Jack," ſays a ſailor to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, I wiſh I had been in his place, the poor parſon ſhould be free from the ſharks this morning." "If he was a popiſh parſon and in my country," ſays the other, daſh me on the needles! he'd never ſwing in the ſheriff's pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture frame; no, no, they're too fond of their admirals of the Breſt fleet there.</p>
               <p>By this time the wretched criminal appeared, with general commiſeration around him;—the voice of pity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed to his ear the univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.—Captivity," ſays my young companion, "has robbed thee of thy lively countenance;—thy features con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the tyrant hand of affliction,—ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity has fled thy boſom; thy tears have formed a channel in thy cheeks;—and
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:017808_0149_0FA3198BC4C1FCB0"/>
now they flow abundant.—Merciful Heaven! to be five months ſhut from the cheerful habitation of friendſhip!— the happy embraces of connubial fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity!— and yet thy cup of miſery is not the bittereſt; parental anguiſh does not wring thy ſoul—thou haſt taken leave of no weeping children, none but an affectionate wife, and a few faithful friends—it is enough!"</p>
               <p>As there was a report prevailed that ſome means would be uſed to prevent his execution, my paſſengers were anxious to ſee the iſſue.—We drove as cloſe to Tyburn as the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude would ſuffer us.—A gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gave a guinea for a front ſeat in one of the galleries: it might have been applied to a nobler purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As the criminal kept the hind leaf of his hat very low upon his face, it was impoſſible to diſcover his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

at a diſtance; he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained long in this ſituation when a ſudden guſt of wind blew his hat off; — then at once, his fears of death were evident,— his diſordered features bluſhed for concealment, which were inſtantly hid. Shortly after he embraced his worthy friend Dr. *****, who attended him; ſpoke for a few minutes to the unhappy youth, his companion, and then his afflictions ceaſed in this world.</p>
               <p>We waited till he was delivered to his friends, which happened ſome minutes before his fellow ſufferer; which the ſpectators took particular notice of, together with the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner's manner of cutting him down; he put his left hand down his collar in ſuch a manner, that he ſeemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaging one thing from another; and with a knife in the other hand, he cut
