            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Publication of this ESSAY, to Quicken <hi>Early Piety,</hi> after ſo many that have gone before it, needs no Apology; for it is not Poſſible to make too many. The <hi>Subject</hi> is Copious; the <hi>Object</hi> is Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; the <hi>Occaſions</hi> are Infinite.</p>
            <p>The SERMON which is now laid before the Reader, has nothing <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> in the Compoſure of it. He has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed here only the Firſt, Rude, Untran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and ſo Unpoliſhed Notes of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> Written and Preached by One, who is pretty tolerably Employ'd at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and Frequent Preaching. But the <hi>Importance</hi> of it is <hi>Extraordinary;</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the leſs of <hi>Poliſhment,</hi> the more does

the Sovereign Grace of Heaven give Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to our <hi>Plain Diſcourſes.</hi> Before the <hi>Sermon</hi> is out, the Reader will ſee why &amp; whence it comes unto him; yea, ſurely he <hi>will Hear,</hi> when he finds, That <hi>One comes unto him from the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtead of going to <hi>Tullies Offices,</hi> I will go to <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s for a brief Recital of the Ornaments with which we would Fain ſee our Young People Beautified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>IT is then an <hi>Angelical Service</hi> which I am upon.

wherein the <hi>Chief of Sinners</hi> is now Engaged. If I keep cloſe to my <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and bring to you nothing but what is Propounded and Supported, from the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of God, which I ſhall Endeavour to do, you will hear nothing, but what will call for as much Regard, as if it were bro't by an <hi>Angel</hi> from Heaven. Sirs, What if you ſhould this Day ſee, what the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>John</hi> ſaw upon a <hi>Lords-Day</hi> of old; An <hi>Angel</hi> flying among you, with the <hi>Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel</hi> to Preach unto you; and ſaying with a Loud Voice; <q>O all People, and very Particularly O Young People, Fear God, and give Glory to Him!</q> Certainly, You would hear with much Attention, with much Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, with a moſt awful Reverence. Behold, A very Sinful Man, but coming in the Name of the moſt Glorious LORD, brings to you, the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel;</hi> He <hi>Runs</hi> to bring it, unto the <hi>Young People</hi> in the Neighbourhood. It is no other than what an <hi>Angel</hi> from Heaven, would be willing to bring among you; and it is as awfully to be Regarded!</p>
            <p>Our Prophet <hi>Zechariah,</hi> was favoured with an Apparition of an <hi>Angel</hi> unto him; and the <hi>Angel</hi> in this Exhibition, gave him
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001564_0006_0FB3AF4ED31D6308"/>
a Proſpect of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> going to be laid out, and rebuilt, under the Influences of the God, who ſets Bounds to our Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This <hi>Angel</hi> is met by another <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> who brings him an Order from God, immediately to <hi>Run unto that Young Man, and ſpeak unto him</hi> ſomething that it would be very Profitable and very Comfortable for him to be acquainted withal.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Imitation</hi> of that <hi>Good Angel;</hi> and who can be better imitated? — I will now <hi>Run</hi> and <hi>Speak</hi> unto thoſe <hi>Young</hi> Perſons whom I have now before me, ſome very Obſervable Things: And you will ſee anon, perhaps with ſome Surprize, my <hi>Text</hi> admirably ſupplying me, with all my Obſervations.</p>
            <p>There is firſt a <hi>General Doctrine,</hi> which I ſhall bring unto you; and make it a moſt agreeable <hi>Preliminary</hi> &amp; <hi>Introduction,</hi> unto the more Particular <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> that are to Enſue upon it. And this is,</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>
                  <hi>The DOCTRINE.</hi> There are things of no ſmall Importance, which the Great <hi>GOD</hi> orders to be ſpoken unto Young Perſons; yea, to be Earnestly ſpoken unto them.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001564_0007_0FB3AF500689E788"/>There is not a <hi>Young Man</hi> among us, but the Great GOD has given Order, <hi>Speak to this Young Man.</hi> Yea, My Child, The Great GOD <hi>Himſelf</hi> ſpeaks unto thee The <hi>Maxims of Piety</hi> are thoſe Important Things, which the Great GOD Orders to be ſpoken, unto all the Children of Men. The Maxims are addreſſed in thoſe very Terms; Pſal. XLIX. 1. <hi>Hear this All ye People, give ear All ye Inhabitants of the World.</hi> But they that are <hi>Children in Age,</hi> are very Particularly to look on themſelves, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Addreſs of ſuch Things. <hi>Young Perſons</hi> muſt not look on themſelves unconcerned in he <hi>Maxims of Piety;</hi> Thoſe Things are of as much Importance unto <hi>Young Perſons,</hi> as unto any in the World; The Voice of God which utters thoſe Things, is as much Directed unto <hi>Young Perſons</hi> as unto any in the World.</p>
               <p>We will at once Enquire; <hi>How tis that the Great</hi> GOD <hi>Speaks unto Young Perſons:</hi> and, <hi>What are the moſt Important Things that He would have to be Spoken unto them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Anſwer to theſe Complicated En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt. There are Important Things, which the Great GOD ſpeaks unto <hi>Young
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001564_0008_0FB3AF516511A3A8"/>
Perſons,</hi> in the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> the Light of <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> that which <hi>Enlightneth every Man that comes into the World.</hi> It is of all things, the moſt Evident; <hi>There is a Spirit in man, and the Inſpiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has given him an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> of much <hi>Duty</hi> which he owes to his Almighty Maker. The Rational Spirit of man, is apprized of, and furniſhed with, certain <hi>Principles,</hi> which are inſtamped thereon, by the <hi>God who forms the Spirit of man within him.</hi> The Inwrought, the Innate <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> in the <hi>Rational Spirit</hi> of man, diſpoſe him to acknowledge Things <hi>Good</hi> &amp; <hi>Evil,</hi> Things <hi>Right</hi> &amp; <hi>Wrong;</hi> as well as Things <hi>True</hi> &amp; <hi>Falſe.</hi> Tho' he may not always make the <hi>Actual Acknowledgment,</hi> yet if the <hi>Light</hi> be brought unto him, or things be ſet in their due <hi>Light</hi> before him, he is quickly Compell'd unto it. We read, Prov. XX. 27. <hi>The Spirit of man is the Candle of the Lord.</hi> Young People, The Great GOD has Lighted His <hi>Candle</hi> in your Souls. You Know, and you cannot but Own, That <hi>there is a GOD,</hi> unto whom you owe all poſſible Homage and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. You Know, and you cannot but Own, That you are baſe Wretches, if you

don't <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Obey,</hi> and <hi>Requite</hi> your <hi>Parents.</hi> You Know, and you cannot but Own, That in your Dealings with your Neighbours, you <hi>ought to do as you would be done unto.</hi> Theſe Three things are as Plain, as that Three and Three make Six. If you do but behold, the <hi>Works</hi> of God, in the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the World, theſe will Proclaim ſuch Things unto you; God ſpeaks unto you ſuch Things as theſe by all the <hi>Works of His Hands.</hi> The <hi>Dictates</hi> of the <hi>Conſcience</hi> within you, are awakened, are inferred, are confirmed, from all the <hi>Works</hi> of God about you. You may Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably Gather many Leſſons of Piety, from all the <hi>Works of God;</hi> yea, <hi>There is no Speech nor Language, where their Voice is not heard.</hi> Alas, if you <hi>Forget</hi> God, or if you <hi>Abuſe</hi> one another, you <hi>Rebel againſt the Light,</hi> with which the God that <hi>Made</hi> you, and <hi>Form'd</hi> you, has accommodated you. God ſpeaks unto you, and you ſtop your Ears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Voice, that ſhould make the Pillars of Heaven to tremble. You have a <hi>Conſcience</hi> which terribly Condemns you for your Wickedneſs. If you <hi>Go on</hi> ſtill in doing Wickedly, you may Rationally Conclude, that the Great God ſpeaks this
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001564_0010_0FB3AF578FD74858"/>
alſo unto you; <hi>Rebel, He that Made thee will not have Mercy on thee, &amp; He that Form'd thee, will ſhew thee no Favour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. There are Important Things which the Great GOD ſpeaks unto <hi>Young Perſons,</hi> in the <hi>Spectacles,</hi> which they have before them, in the Diſpenſations of His Providence. There are Two ſorts of <hi>Spectacles,</hi> wherewith Young Perſons are continually Entertained by the Providence of God. One thing daily to be ſeen by <hi>Young Perſons,</hi> is that; Prov XIII. 21. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil purſueth Sinners.</hi> Children, You ſee ſuch as are <hi>Wicked Overmuch, Dy before their Time.</hi> You ſee, Such as won't keep their <hi>Tongues from Evil,</hi> don't <hi>ſee Many Days,</hi> or <hi>much Good</hi> in their Days. You ſee Profane, Vitious, <hi>Debauched</hi> Children, ſoon Plung'd into woful Miſeries. You ſee <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndutiful</hi> Children Cut off by the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Vengeance of God. You ſee Heaven Diſcharging its Thunderbolts on the Heads of them that will <hi>Go on still in their Treſpaſſes.</hi> The Great God ſpeaks to you in what you ſee.

ſelves the Strange Puniſhments reſerved in outer Darkneſs, for the Workers of Iniquity!</hi> Another thing daily to be ſeen by <hi>Young Perſons,</hi> is that: Job XXXVI. 14. <hi>They Dy in Youth.</hi> Children, You ſee <hi>all Ages</hi> liable to the ſtroke of <hi>Death.</hi> You ſee <hi>Children Dy</hi> as well as <hi>Old Men;</hi> Ten times more Dy before Twenty than After Sixty. You ſee <hi>Children</hi> carried from the <hi>Cradle</hi> to the <hi>Sepulchre;</hi> and Graves in the Burying-place, that are ſhorter than the Youngeſt of you. You ſee <hi>Children Dy</hi> as well as they that are an <hi>Hundred years old; Infants</hi> Lock'd up in Coffins; and as they uſe to ſay, <hi>Skulls of all Sizes in Golgotha.</hi> You ſee, Some with whom the <hi>Sun goes down at Noon,</hi> and ſome with whom the <hi>Morning</hi> is turn'd into the <hi>Shadow of Death.</hi> The Great God ſpeaks to you, in what you ſee. The Lively Voice of God unto you in ſuch <hi>Spectacles,</hi> is; <hi>O don't vainly Promiſe a long Life unto your ſelves. O do not upon a vain Preſumption of a long Life, put off your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for Death, and your laying hold on Eternal Life!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly. There are Important Things, which the Great GOD ſpeaks unto <hi>Young Perſons,</hi> in His Glorious <hi>Goſpel;</hi> that <hi>Grace</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001564_0012_0FB3AF5A6A770C48"/>
of His, which does <hi>bring Salvation;</hi> that <hi>Voice of Him that ſpeaks from Heaven.</hi> Young Perſons have the <hi>Bible</hi> in their Hands, the Book of God, and of Life; the <hi>Scripture given by Inſpiration of God.</hi> It may be ſaid of our Children, as 2 Tim III. 15. <hi>From a Child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Parents will be inexcuſable, and more Uncompaſſionate unto their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring than <hi>Oſtriches</hi> and <hi>Sea-monſters,</hi> and muſt not be called, <hi>Chriſtian Parents,</hi> if they do not what they can, that their <hi>Children</hi> may have the <hi>Bible</hi> in their Hands, and in their Minds. Children, You have the Great GOD ſpeaking to you in the <hi>Bible.</hi> When ever you look into the <hi>Bible,</hi> it ſhould be with this <hi>Perſwaſion;</hi> you ſhould often look into the Bible on this <hi>Intention; I will hear what God will ſpeak unto me!</hi> The Voice of the Great God unto you in your <hi>Bible</hi> is that; Pſal. XXXIV. 11. <hi>Come ye Children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the Fear of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Bible</hi> is a <hi>Letter from Heaven</hi> as much unto <hi>you,</hi> as if your very Name, were in the Superſcription of it. And that you may be the more ſenſible of God ſpeaking unto you here,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001564_0013_0FB3AF5C0ED122F8"/>
you are here yet more diſtinguiſhingly call'd upon. So you are, Eccl XII. 1. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.</hi> So you are, Pſal. CXLVIII. 12, 13. <hi>Both young Men and Maidens, old Men &amp; Children. Let them Praiſe the Name of the Lord.</hi> So you are, in all the Scriptural Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Early Piety.</hi> But beſides this; When the Word of God is Opened and Applied in the <hi>Sermons</hi> of His Miniſters; <hi>young Perſons</hi> make a part of our Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. <hi>Young Perſons</hi> are to take their Portion in all the <hi>Sermons</hi> of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Miniſtry, wherein Wiſdom ſays unto them, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you, O Men, I Call, and my Voice is to the Sons of Men.</hi> Yea, the Prudent and Faithful <hi>Stewards</hi> in the Houſe of God, will ſometimes Carve out a <hi>Special Portion</hi> for the <hi>Young Perſons</hi> in their Auditory. The Servants of God will be careful to avoid that Character of the Fooliſh Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; Zach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> XI. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Which ſhall not ſeek the young one.</hi> Children, When <hi>Sermons</hi> are Preaching, you have the Great GOD ſpeaking to you in them. Inſtead of <hi>Sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>Sleeping,</hi> or any Irreverent Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age here, Oh, with what <hi>Reverence and Godly Fear</hi> ought you to behave your ſelves;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001564_0014_0FB3AF5D64F17560"/>
and think, <hi>How dreadful is this Place? Tis the Houſe of God, and the Gate of Heaven! Tis not a weak Man, but the Great GOD, who is now ſpeaking to me!</hi> It is the Great GOD, who tells you in our Sermons, That you need a <hi>Saviour;</hi> and that you will find the Lovely JESUS, a Mighty, a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and an Only Saviour. It is the Great GOD who tells you, That you muſt Walk in His <hi>Fear,</hi> and in all <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> before Him. It is the Great GOD, who tells you, That <hi>He will bring every Work into Judgment, and Reward every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His Work.</hi> You are Deaf to GOD, if you hear us not!</p>
               <p>There is an <hi>Improvement,</hi> which the Great GOD has Ordered me to make of theſe things. There is this thing to be ſpoken, yea, to be <hi>Earneſtly Spoken,</hi> unto the <hi>Young People</hi> in this Aſſembly of <hi>Zion: Oh! Take a due Notice of the Things, which the Great GOD Orders to be ſpoken to you;</hi> Children, Pay a due Reſpect unto thoſe things! Methinks, I overhear the Holy One ſaying to me, <hi>Run, Speak to theſe Young People.</hi> To <hi>Run,</hi> is the Motion of one in <hi>Earneſt.</hi> I muſt now be <hi>in Earnest</hi> with you. Children, That which I am <hi>Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001564_0015_0FB3AF6016C48D60"/>
to ſpeak unto you, is this; GOD has been ſpeaking to you; <hi>The Mighty</hi> GOD, <hi>even the</hi> LORD <hi>hath Spoken</hi> to you. Now, Oh! Mind what He ſpeaks; Let the <hi>Voice of God</hi> have a due, and a deep Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon you. What a Bleſſed Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was that between the Great GOD, and the Child <hi>Samuel!</hi> 1 Sam. III. 10. <hi>And the Lord came, &amp; ſtood &amp; called as at other times,</hi> Samuel, Samuel. <hi>Then</hi> Samuel <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Speak for thy Servant Heareth.</hi> O Young People, The Great GOD comes, &amp; ſtands, &amp; calls unto thee very many times over; <hi>Sinner, Sinner, Soul Periſhing in thy Sin, O Forſake thy Sin, and Embrace thy Saviour!</hi> Under the Admonitions of God, O Children, Be able to anſwer; <hi>Lord, I hear what thou ſpeakeſt; and I deſire to be thy Servant. The Commands, the Comforts, the Reproofs of thy Word, Lord, Thy Servant would hearken to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Thing which I have to demand of you, is; That you caſt no Scorn upon the <hi>Word of God;</hi> but that you Comply with the <hi>Voice of God</hi> ſpeaking to you in His Word. The Demand is, That you <hi>Mind,</hi> and that you <hi>Do</hi> thoſe things, which God ſhall ſpeak unto you; and be <hi>aſhamed</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001564_0016_0FB3AF61D317AA30"/>
of not having <hi>Reſpect unto all His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Child,</hi> He is thy <hi>Father,</hi> and He ſhould be, Oh! Let thy Choice make Him, <hi>the Guide of thy Youth.</hi> We read of ſome Young People, 1 Joh. II. 14. <hi>Ye are Strong, and the Word of God abideth in you.</hi> Oh! Give a due Reception to the <hi>Word of God. Lodge</hi> it in your Underſtandings, your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, your Affections. <hi>Hide</hi> it in your <hi>Hearts,</hi> with diſpoſitions to be thereby Preſerved and Reſcued from your <hi>Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To Enforce this <hi>Early Piety</hi> on our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I will <hi>Run,</hi> and <hi>Earneſtly Speak</hi> theſe two things unto them. Yea, you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſee, that the Great GOD has Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to ſpeak theſe things.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Thing is, <hi>That the Great</hi> GOD <hi>will deal with you, as you deal with His Word.</hi> Children, <hi>Love</hi> the Word of God, and God will Place His <hi>Love</hi> upon you. <hi>Treaſure</hi> up the Word of God, and God will make you His Peculiar <hi>Treaſure. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> the Word of God, and your Portion from God ſhall be <hi>Shame and Everlaſting Contempt.</hi> O that your <hi>Ears</hi> were open to this <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and that ſuch an <hi>Instruction</hi> as this from and for the Word of God were <hi>Sealed</hi> unto you. It ſpeaks thus;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001564_0017_0FB3AF62C95E6C18"/>
                  <hi>Them that Honour me, the GOD that ſpeaks in me will Honour; they who Deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly Eſteemed of the GOD who ſhines &amp; breathes in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember a Remarkable Paſſage, 2 Tim. I. 12, 14. <hi>He is able to keep, that which I have committed unto Him.</hi> And, <hi>That good thing which was committed unto thee, do thou keep.</hi> The Jews mention Two <hi>Depoſitums</hi> of God; The <hi>Lamp</hi> within us, or, the <hi>Soul;</hi> And the <hi>Lamp</hi> without us, or, the <hi>Law;</hi> and they introduce the Great GOD ſpeaking thus unto us; <hi>My Lamp which is my Law, is in thy Hand; and thy Lamp, which is thy Soul, is in Mine. If thou diligently keep My Lamp, I will keep thine; if thou put out, if thou tread on, My Lamp, I will deal ſo with thine.</hi> Our Apoſtle ſeems to have an Eye on both of theſe, <hi>Depoſita.</hi> GOD will <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> it, when His Word is Well-treated with Young People; will <hi>Revenge</hi> it, when His Word is ill-treated: <hi>Ye have done it unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second Thing is like unto it; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but a Continuation &amp; Amplification of it. It is, <hi>That the Great</hi> GOD <hi>will hear you, Speaking and Praying to Him, as you hear Him Speaking to you.</hi> Children, Be you
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001564_0018_0FB3AF64307EEEA8"/>
never ſo <hi>Prayerleſs</hi> now, there will come a Time, when you will pour out your Prayer unto the Almighty. In the <hi>Trouble</hi> that will at ſome Time come upon you, you will <hi>Viſit Him</hi> on your Knees, and <hi>Pour out a Prayer,</hi> when His <hi>Chastening</hi> ſhall be upon you, and drive you to it. Now, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed. <hi>The Lord God hath Spoken this, and who can but Propheſy it?</hi> The Word of God comes to you, with ſuch a Pathetical Warning as that wherewith <hi>Jotham</hi> once began his Parable; <hi>Hearken unto me, that God may hearken unto you!</hi> If you will hear the <hi>Counſels</hi> of God, God will hear your <hi>Prayers.</hi> It was a ſweet Word, Joh: XV. 7. <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye ſhall ask what ye will, and it ſhall be done unto you.</hi> When the Great GOD ſees, That you ſet your ſelves <hi>to Do,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever He ſhall <hi>Speak</hi> to you, and <hi>Ask</hi> of you, Lo, He ſays upon it; <hi>This is a dear Child; I will do for Him for above all that he can ask or think; yea, before he calls, I will anſwer, and whiles he is yet ſpeaking, I will hear.</hi> But I am to ſtep into Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> for the other part of my Prophecy; If God Speak, and you Diſregard what He Speaks, and if you <hi>turn away from Him that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001564_0019_0FB3AF65B0FA6420"/>
ſpeaks from Heaven,</hi> and if you <hi>Reject the Counſels of God;</hi> Such, even ſuch will be the <hi>Diſregard</hi> that your <hi>Prayer</hi> to Him ſhall meet withal. Can any thing be more <hi>Dreadful,</hi> but can any thing be more <hi>Equal,</hi> than that Indignation of Heaven Zech. VI. 13. <hi>Therefore it is come to paſs, that as He Cried, and they would not hear,; ſo they Cried, and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Oh! Tremble before the terrible Threatning of God; and forget not that Young People are Peculiarly Threatned in it; Prov. I. 24, 25 28. <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded; But ye have ſet at nought all my Counſel, and would none of my Reproof: Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me Early, but they ſhall not find me. Hear</hi> this, O all you Children of Unperſwadeableneſs, that <hi>will not Hear.</hi> You will One Day lift up the Cries of a Diſtreſſed Soul unto the Lord; When the <hi>Griefs of Death</hi> compaſs you, and the <hi>Pains of Hell</hi> get hold on you, with what Agony of Soul, will you then Cry unto the Lord; <hi>O Lord, I beſeech thee to deliver my Soul!</hi> But, O the Confuſion which you are providing and beſpeaking
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001564_0020_0FB3AF677B6D16C8"/>
for your ſelves! O the <hi>Wrath</hi> which you are <hi>heaping up!</hi> When God ſpeaks to you in His Wrath, what will it be but this? <hi>Wretch, Thou wouldeſt not hear me; I ſpake unto thee in thy Proſperity, and thou wouldſt not hear; Now, I know thee not, O worker of Iniquity!</hi> Children, Conſider theſe things, which at the Order of God, I have thus <hi>Run</hi> to ſpeak unto you.</p>
               <p>Having thus Employ'd and even with a <hi>Running Diſpatch</hi> Apply'd a <hi>General Doctrine;</hi> I will proceed unto certain more Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Inſtructions.</hi> Things, that God Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be ſpoken unto you. And they ſhall be only ſuch <hi>Inſtructions</hi> as the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and Intention of my <hi>Text</hi> ſhall give me a clear Commiſſion to offer unto you. My Text clearly ſays unto me, <hi>Run, Speak to the Young People ſuch things as theſe!</hi>

               <p>Firſt, A Thorough and an Early <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to God; This will be neceſſary.

               <p>I go on. You muſt betimes be the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of the Glorious JESUS. Nothing, Nothing muſt be ſo Precious to you, as the Glorious JESUS. The <hi>Angels</hi> of God

               <p>In fine; We read of a wondrous Thing befalling a Young Man; 2 King.

                  <hi>Young Perſons</hi> may be Admitted and Advanced unto an <hi>Intimate Communion with Heaven;</hi> Heaven may hold a moſt Gracious and Intimate <hi>Communion</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>He was a <hi>Young Man,</hi> who had <hi>Heaven</hi> Opened unto him; who had the <hi>Angels of Heaven</hi> made very ſenſible unto him; who had the Great <hi>GOD of Heaven</hi> favouring of him with marvellous Communications. A <hi>Young Man</hi> may Dy and go to <hi>Heaven;</hi> yea, a <hi>Young Man</hi> may go to <hi>Heaven</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>Dies;</hi> be well acquainted with the <hi>Heavenly World.</hi> Heaven is acceſſible for Young People as well as others. There are Young People, who are no ſtrangers to <hi>Communion</hi> with Heaven: Young People to whom the Great GOD Communicates Himſelf with moſt Entertaining, moſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing Condeſcenſions.</p>
               <p>The CASE which remains now to be inſiſted on, is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is Communion with Heaven; and in what methods may</hi> Young Perſons <hi>arrive to that Communion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001564_0030_0FB3AF7982AABD40"/>
                  <hi>Communion with God;</hi> It is a Thing much <hi>Talked</hi> of; leſs <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtood,</hi> much leſs <hi>Purſued,</hi> leaſt of all <hi>Attained.</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I would have you betimes take up Right <hi>Notions</hi> of this Bleſſedneſs, and Right <hi>Methods</hi> of attaining it.</p>
               <p>Briefly, <hi>Communion with God,</hi> lies in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> from God, and in <hi>Rendering</hi> to Him.</p>
               <p>Firſt. The Great GOD holds <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with Young Perſons, in what they <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> from Him. He holds <hi>Communion</hi> with them, in <hi>Communicating</hi> to them: You ſhall ſee this go on by Two Steps, unto a very <hi>Special Intimacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Young Perſons come to <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with God, in the <hi>Communications</hi> of His <hi>Holy Word</hi> unto them. When God <hi>makes known</hi> His Mind &amp; Will unto Young Perſons, then He has <hi>Communion</hi> with them. When He had <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>Moſes,</hi> it was in that; Exod. XXV. 22. <hi>I will Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with thee;</hi> or, Confer with thee. When God <hi>Speaks</hi> to you, Children, then He has <hi>Communion</hi> with you. Part of His <hi>Communion</hi> with you, is, His <hi>Revealing</hi> of Himſelf unto you, and His Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with what He would have you
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001564_0031_0FB3AF7CEEEF3688"/>
to <hi>Know</hi> and to <hi>Do,</hi> that ſo you may <hi>Glorify Him and Enjoy Him for ever.</hi> O Reader of the Sacred Oracles, and of what Opens them; O Hearer of the Diſcourſes which Explain and Apply the Sacred Oracles; O Mind Conſulting the Will of God, as Written in thy own Soul, and Proclamed by what He has done <hi>in Heaven and in Earth, in the Seas and in all deep Places;</hi> The Great GOD has <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with thee, in all the <hi>Light,</hi> which by theſe things He Conveys unto thee. And the more Full, the more Clear, the more Irradiating and Satisfactory the <hi>Light</hi> is, the more <hi>Communion</hi> the Great GOD has with thee in the Conveyance of it. But then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Children, You ſhall come yet nearer than ſo. <hi>Young Perſons</hi> are taken into <hi>Communion</hi> with God, by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications</hi> of His <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> unto them. The Communion that God has with them, is that; 2 Cor. XIII. 14. <hi>The communion of the Holy Spirit.</hi> In the impreſſions of the Holy Spirit on Young Perſons, God has <hi>Communion</hi> with them. Children, Sometimes the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, will make unto you, moſt grateful <hi>Diſcoveries.</hi> He
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001564_0032_0FB3AF7F8A52C2E0"/>
will <hi>Open</hi> your Eyes to <hi>behold the wondrous Things in His Law;</hi> He will Unfold unto you the <hi>Myſteries of His Goſpel;</hi> He will cauſe you to Diſcern the <hi>Things that are ſpiritually to be diſcerned.</hi> More than ſo; The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God will go on to Sanctify you; and Purify you, and impart a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace</hi> unto you, and <hi>Strengthen</hi> that <hi>Principle</hi> in you, and Revive the <hi>Image of God</hi> in your Souls, and make you more Conformable to the <hi>Image</hi> of His <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and Enkindle the <hi>Life of God</hi> in you, and Quicken you in <hi>Living unto God.</hi> This is not all; The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God will <hi>Excite</hi> you to the Things that are Well-pleaſing to Him; Will <hi>Incline</hi> you to the Things that Pleaſe Him; Will <hi>Inſpire</hi> you with <hi>Purpoſes</hi> of Well-doing, With Contrivances to Do Good; Will Animate you to <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> and put you upon Abounding in the <hi>Fruits of Righteouſneſs.</hi> In fine; The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, will bring Home the <hi>Love</hi> of God into your Hearts; Will aſſure you of His Everlaſting <hi>Love;</hi> Will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you with His Encouraging <hi>Promiſes;</hi> Will <hi>Seal</hi> you to the <hi>Day of Redemption;</hi> Will fill you with His <hi>Great Conſolations;</hi> Will aboliſh your <hi>Griefs,</hi> extiguiſh your
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001564_0033_0FB3AF80AD19F1B8"/>
                  <hi>Fears,</hi> enliven your <hi>Hopes,</hi> and cauſe you to <hi>Rejoyce with Joy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi> Now in all theſe things, the Great GOD has <hi>Communion</hi> with you. O Soul Panting after Communion with GOD, miſtake not the matter. Do not confine the Communion unto any one of theſe Fruitions. Child, Thy God has Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with thee, when He <hi>Awakens</hi> thee, when He <hi>Abaſes</hi> thee, when He brings <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritions</hi> upon thee, as well as when He Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes thee with His <hi>Conſolations which are not Small.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. Young Perſons hold <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with the Great GOD, in what they <hi>Render</hi> to Him. The <hi>Returns,</hi> which Young Perſons make unto God by His Aſſiſtence, theſe are their Communion with Him. Children, Your God calls for your <hi>Heart;</hi> He ſays; Prov. XXIII. 26. <hi>My Son, Give me thy Heart.</hi> You hold Communion with Him, when you give Him your <hi>Heart;</hi> when your <hi>Heart</hi> is filled with ſuitable Thoughts of Him; when you place the Deſire of your <hi>Heart,</hi> the Delight of your <hi>Heart,</hi> the Dependence of your <hi>Heart</hi> upon Him. To <hi>Pray</hi> unto God, is to <hi>Commons</hi> with Him; When
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001564_0034_0FB3AF825CEAD118"/>
Young Perſons Repair to the Great GOD with the Requeſt of their <hi>Heart,</hi> then they hold Communion with Him. If their <hi>Heart</hi> be in the Requeſt, then tis an <hi>Hearty,</hi> a <hi>Real,</hi> a <hi>Proper</hi> Communion. Young Perſons have Communion with the Great GOD, in every Acknowledgment they make of Him. They have Communion with Him in all their Ways, when they <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Him in all their Ways.</hi> Indeed, Young Perſons have <hi>Communion</hi> with God, in all their <hi>Obedience</hi> to Him. When God <hi>Requires</hi> and they <hi>Obey,</hi> there is a moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable Communion between Him and Them. In ſhort, To be <hi>Senſible</hi> of God, is to have <hi>Communion</hi> with Him. Young Perſons Converſe with God, when they <hi>Think of</hi> Him: when they <hi>Set the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them;</hi> when they are <hi>Senſible</hi> of Him Speaking to them, or Dealing with them.</p>
               <p>This is that <hi>Communion with Heaven</hi> whereto Young People may be admitted.</p>
               <p>And, in what Ways may they now Seek and Gain Admiſſion to it?</p>
               <p>Children; The Firſt Thing which I muſt mind you of, and Charge you to be ever mindful of, is this: Don't forget the <hi>Mercy-Seat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:001564_0035_0FB3AF85C27CE2F8"/>In the Bleſſed JESUS, thro' whom God becomes <hi>Propitious</hi> to us, you have the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> whereof <hi>that</hi> on the <hi>Ark</hi> of old, was a Figure. In Him you ſee GOD Sitting <hi>on the Throne of Grace!</hi> Remember then; <q>Without a Glorious JESUS, what Oh! What, would the Holy GOD be unto me? What, but a Conſuming <hi>Fire</hi> and Everlaſting <hi>Burnings!</hi> Ah, How could Sinful Stubble Draw near unto Him! It is my Glorious JESUS, who Reconciles me to God. Without ſuch a Reconciliation, certainly, He could have no <hi>Communion</hi> with me; none, but in Thunder and Lightning, to Deſtroy me among <hi>His Adverſaries!</hi> It is my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious JESUS, that makes all my <hi>Homage</hi> to God be what it is: All my <hi>Offerings,</hi> tis <hi>He</hi> that enables me to bring them all. Tis in <hi>His Name</hi> that I bring them all: Tis thro' <hi>Him</hi> that I have <hi>Acceſs unto the Father.</hi> Tis on <hi>His</hi> Account that they find Acceptance with God; We are <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in that Beloved One.</hi> O my Dear JESUS, To <hi>Thee</hi> am I beholden for all my <hi>Communion</hi> with God. <hi>How Dear, how Dear,</hi> ought this Glorious JESUS to be unto me!</q> Children, The more of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001564_0036_0FB3AF86A8B474B8"/>
CHRIST you have with you, the more you may Expect of <hi>Communion</hi> with GOD.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Tis in the <hi>Wayes</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of His own <hi>Appointment,</hi> that God will hold that <hi>Communion</hi> with Young Perſons, for which He has appointed them. There are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Ordinances of a more <hi>Publick Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration,</hi> wherein Young Perſons may have <hi>Communion</hi> with God; Such Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as are Celebrated in the <hi>Aſſemblies of Zion.</hi> The <hi>End</hi> why the All-wiſe God, has Inſtituted theſe things, is not meerly, that there may be the <hi>Work done;</hi> Tis not meerly to impoſe a <hi>Task</hi> upon us; No, They are <hi>Wayes</hi> and <hi>Means;</hi> and His <hi>End</hi> in them, is, That He may <hi>hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with His People in them. [See, Pſal. XXVII. 4. And, 2 Cor. III. 18.] Yea, and He has Engaged Himſelf to hold <hi>Communion</hi> with His People in them. He hath ſaid; Mat. XVIII. 20. <hi>Where Two or Three are Gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Lord, I ſhall adviſe our Children, with this <hi>Nurture &amp; Admonition of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:001564_0037_0FB3AF882AF9FBD0"/>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> You can't Reaſonably Expect ſuch <hi>Communion</hi> with God, in any other <hi>Wayes</hi> and <hi>Means,</hi> as you may in thoſe which Himſelf has <hi>Appointed.</hi> It is true; Such is the <hi>Compaſſion</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> that He has had Reſpect unto the <hi>Sincere Deſigns</hi> of ſome Good Men, when they uſed <hi>Indirect</hi> Wayes and Means for Communion with Him. He has regarded their <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and overlook'd their <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and Viſited their Souls, in the uſe of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and of <hi>Holidays,</hi> which yet He has not approved. But men have no ground for any ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, That God ſhould Own them, when they go to put upon Him <hi>their own</hi> Wayes and Means of <hi>Communion</hi> with Him; That God ſhould Own and Bleſs <hi>Humane Inventions;</hi> That God ſhould come to us in the <hi>Modes</hi> wherewith we go to Preſcribe unto the <hi>Holy One of Iſrael.</hi> The <hi>Second Commandment</hi> binds us up, to ſuch <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> with Him, as He Himſelf hath appointed. Now in that Commandment there is that awful Clauſe; Exod. XX. 5. <hi>I am a Jealous God.</hi> The <hi>Jealouſy</hi> of the Holy God will burn againſt your <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi> Your <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> of, I know not what, in the room

of the Divine <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> They will En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle the <hi>Jealouſy</hi> of the Holy God. They will Provoke the Holy One to ſay, <hi>Who has required theſe things at your Hands? They are Vain Oblations: They are an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to me; I cannot away with 'em!</hi> Children of GOD, and, O Children of NEW-ENGLAND, if you would have <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>God as your Father,</hi> and with the <hi>God of your Fathers,</hi> keep cloſe to the <hi>Ways</hi> &amp; <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>His Appointment.</hi> Have <hi>His Warrant</hi> for all you do in <hi>His Worſhip.</hi> Then will He <hi>Commune</hi> with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> You ſhould Prize and Uſe all Opportunities of coming to the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and count it a <hi>Lamentable</hi> Thing to be Baniſhed from the Opportunities to Bleſs God in His Congregations. Children, To make a <hi>Small Matter</hi> ſerve you, as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for your Abſence from the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> truly, this were a very <hi>Bad Symptom</hi> upon you. Oh!

XLII. 4.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001564_0039_0FB3AF8DD75ADDD8"/>
                  <hi>I had gone with the Multitude, I went with them to the Houſe of God.</hi> Oh! Let it be a Sorrowful thing unto you, when you can't <hi>Go with the Multitude unto the Houſe of God.</hi> Let it broach your <hi>Tears,</hi> to think; <hi>I am now Baniſhed from Communion with God!</hi> This Lamentation ſhould be accompanied with ſome Eſſay, to <hi>fetch Good out of Evil.</hi> Wherefore, when you are kept at Home, O Humble your ſelves before God at Home. Humbly <hi>Search and Try your Wayes;</hi> And Humbly Confeſs; <hi>Lord, I did not Prize and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe my Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for Communion with thee in thy Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, as I ſhould have done, when I had thoſe Opportunities. O Pardon me for the ſake of the Great Sacrifice.</hi> Then Rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate on what you have been in the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> formerly Entertained withal; and Reſolve, with the Help of God, that if ever you come to the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> again, it ſhall be more Holily, more Livelily, more Fruitfully than ever in your Lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Come to the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> always upon the <hi>true Intention;</hi> always intending and propounding of <hi>Communion</hi> with God. When you come to the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> let it not
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001564_0040_0FB3AF8EF679FBE0"/>
be from <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> for <hi>Credit,</hi> or any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Account. Be able to give the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Anſwer to that Queſtion; <hi>What went you out for?</hi> Let it be, <hi>For Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God.</hi> In coming up to the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> Children, Let the Cry of your Souls be that; Pſal. LXIII. 1, 2. <hi>O God, Thou art my God, Early will I ſeek thee; To ſee thy Power and thy Glory in the Sanctuary.</hi> Theſe, Theſe muſt be the Diſpoſitions of your Souls. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God, and I am now going to draw near unto Him. In Precious Interviews with God there is laid up the Life of my Soul; and I am going to thoſe Interviews. God is willing to hold Communion with me, at the Wells of Salvation; and I am going with Joy to draw water out of thoſe Wells of Salvation.</hi> Child, Go, and God be with thee.</p>
