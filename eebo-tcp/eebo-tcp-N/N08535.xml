            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>CANDID READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WERE it not apprehended by me a duty, thus to offer to thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious peruſal the following plain and experimental obſervations upon various ſubjects, thou hadſt not heard from me in this way.</p>
            <p>I have often, with many brethren and ſiſters in the truth, been deeply affected in viewing the great danger Chriſtian profeſſors are expoſed to through a prevailing indifference of mind. For when a lethargic ſtupefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath gained the aſcendancy, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in notion, and fruitleſs ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſatisfy a mind ſo depraved. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of heart, without which none can be truly religious, hath not been ſought after. Pleaſed with the ſhell or form only, ſuch have not been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they wanted the ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:010917_0003_0F8529CD1A16D540"/>When the ſubtil adverſary finds men in this kind of ſleep or ſtupefaction, it is then his opportunity for ſowing the tares amongſt the wheat: by ſuch means the field of the Chriſtian church became in proceſs of time covered therewith. That which came neareſt to my heart, and moſt earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my attention towards the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent undertaking (not without ardent deſires for the laſting advantage of Chriſtians of all denominations) was, that the deſcendants of a people, who a little above a century ago were very marvellouſly brought out of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from, all lifeleſs ſhadows, and empty forms of religion, to enjoy and be grounded in the bleſſed power and life thereof, might be preſerved truly ſenſible of the way and means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our worthy predeceſſors obtained a firm eſtabliſhment in the truth, as it is Chriſt Jeſus: for it is evident, where the means are neglected, the end can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:010917_0004_0F8529CDD5873718"/>That many of theſe deſcendants in this day of outward peace and plenty, inclining to falſe liberty and eaſe, do ſhun the croſs of Chriſt, which would crucify them to the world, is a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful truth, too obvious to be denied. In conſideration hereof, I found a concern to throw a few obſervations before them, as near as I could, ſuited to the preſent ſtate of things; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, in ſome degree, to offer to the view of the preſent and ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generations, by what means our worthy predeceſſors became ſuch a living honourable body of people; that the neceſſity may fully appear of the ſame bleſſed power operating upon their minds, in order to qualify all, that they may rightly ſucceed thoſe valiants in maintaining the cauſe of God.</p>
            <p>The objection which caſt ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in my way, may alſo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to ſome readers, viz. that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects treated of in this ſmall tract have
<pb facs="unknown:010917_0005_0F8529CECFBE0B68"/>
been divers times heretofore judiciouſly wrote upon by different authors. This is no more than may be ſaid of moſt other religious ſubjects as well as theſe. Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs hath ſeen meet to receive the ſame truths, by different inſtruments from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation; the Lord's ſervants ſpeaking the ſame thing, as with one mouth. Herein God's gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to human frailty is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and wonderful, by cauſing thoſe excellent truths, ſo eſſential to be received that man's ſoul may be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be frequently revived and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, ſeeing he is ſo liable to forget God, and his reaſonable duty to him.</p>
            <p>Having no deſire to enlarge, I ſhall only add my earneſt prayer to the God and Father of all ſure mercies, that this mite of ſimple experimental truths, which I have caſt into the treaſury, may meet the ſerious reader, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever denomination, with the divine bleſſing in it! If that graciouſly attend,
<pb facs="unknown:010917_0006_0F8529CF8C45EFF0"/>
though what is here offered may be juſtly accounted as the barley-loaves, the hungry ſoul may receive ſome ſtrength and refreſhment thereby.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I. Containing tender ADVICE, CAUTION and COUNSEL tO PARENTS and CHILDREN.</head>
               <p>FIRST to parents. Very much depends upon a right education of children. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore find it in my mind to make a few obſervations thereon, as it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to open my underſtanding; without whoſe aſſiſtance, and bleſſing upon our labours, they prove altogether fruitleſs.</p>
               <p>The children of Iſrael were ſtrictly enjoined to make the training up their children in the law of God their conſtant care; viz.
<q>Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord our God is one Lord; and thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might. And theſe words which I command thee this day,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:010917_0009_0F8529D34CE452D0"/>
ſhall be in thine heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. vi. 4, 5, 6, 7.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Exceeding great is the truſt repoſed in parents and heads of families. It certainly lies upon them an indiſpenſable duty, as much as they can, both by precept and example, to form the tender minds of their offspring to virtue, as ſaith the apoſtle,
<q>And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. vi. 4.</note>
                  </q>
And,
<q>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. xxii. 6.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Parents muſt firſt be well acquainted with the way of truth, and the nurture and admonition of the Lord themſelves, before they can train up their children therein. That which is likely to have the greateſt influence upon their tender minds, is a ſteady circumſpect example, in a ſelf-denying conduct before them; which will beget reverence, and honourable thoughts in children, and ſervants too, concerning thoſe whom Providence hath placed over them.</p>
               <p>Great care ſhould dwell upon the minds of parents, to make it fully evident to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that they are much more deſirous they ſhould poſſeſs an heavenly than an earthly inheritance; that they are more concerned their ſouls may be adorned with the graces of the Holy Spirit, than that their bodies ſhould appear finely decked with outward ornaments.</p>
               <p>Children will be very likely to value that which they ſee is preferred by their parents, whether it
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:010917_0010_0F8529D42CB54830"/>
be the things of the world, or religion. If this be really the caſe, which I think will be allowed by conſiderate perſons, O then! how much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon them for the promotion of truth and righteouſneſs on the earth, both in regard to the preſent time, and generations to come. This yet more fully appears by the Lord's teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  <q>And the Lord ſaid, Shall I hide from <hi>Abraham</hi> that thing which I do? ſeeing that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall ſurely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in him. For I know him, that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon <hi>Abraham</hi> that which he hath ſpoken of him.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xviii. 17, 18, 19.</note>
                  </q>
In chap. xvii. ver. 18. his godly concern appears earneſt, even for the child of the bond-woman; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>And <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid unto God, Oh! that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> might live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</q>
Which petition was anſwered.</p>
               <p>Conſtant and warm endeavours, with ſecret cries to God that his bleſſing may attend them, may prove effectual to the preſervation of children. This ſhould begin very early, even as ſoon as they are capable to diſtinguiſh what pleaſes, or what diſpleaſes their parents. A ſelf-willed perverſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may ſoon be diſcovered in children (more eſpecially in ſome) which is very earneſt to have its own way, before they can judge what is beſt for themſelves. This ſhould conſtantly be ſubjected to thoſe that are to judge for them. They ſhould never be ſuffered to prevail by an untoward fretful temper, not even when what they crave is ſuitable for them to receive, were they in a ſubmiſſive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010917_0011_0F8529D495136A90"/>
that they may clearly ſee (which they ſoon will) it is more to their benefit and comfort to yield an entire ſubjection to their providers, and that nothing is to be got by a fretful ſelf-willed temper. This ſhould be done by a conſtant ſteady hand, and it will make the work of parents abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly eaſier in the government of their children, and may prove a great eaſe to thoſe concerned with them, perhaps through the whole courſe of their lives; ſince by cruſhing their perverſeneſs in the firſt buddings, it may ſo die away, as never more to gain the pre-eminence. This would be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful bleſſing, and they would owe their watchful parents more for ſuppreſſing that, and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious buds in them, than for a large patrimony or outward inheritance. Indeed every thing of an evil nature ſhould be kept down in them by ſuch careful ready means. Oh! what a fine hopeful generation of youths ſhould we have, were parents in general to exerciſe this prudent care in all things! I verily believe, inſtead of ſober virtuous youth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſpeckled birds amongſt others, the rebellious, diſobedient, and froward would be ſo; and this would bring judgment over them.</p>
               <p>A conſcientious diſcharge of this great duty would bring an ample reward to ſuch parents, as have no greater joy than to ſee their children walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the truth: and if they ſhould prove unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, as it ſometimes hath happened, they will be clear of their childrens blood in God's ſight, which is a very great thing; ſo that though the rebellion and evil conduct of their offspring may be their ſorrow, it will not be their ſin.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes been much grieved, when I have ſeen youth in the way of being ruined by the very imprudent indulgence of their parents,

eſpecially mothers; making themſelves and others mere ſlaves to the perverſe humours of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; taking abundance of pains to extinguiſh the flame of their untoward tempers, by ſuch means as add fewel to the fire; inverting the order of nature, by becoming ſubject to thoſe who ſhould ſubmit to them, by anſwering their unreaſonable <hi>cravings;</hi> making themſelves more work (and that too of a very diſagreeable nature) to educate one, than, were they to follow the method before hinted, it would require to educate a number, and in the end not ſo well done neither. Parents, who are ſo very imprudent, have leſs reaſon to reflect upon their children for being ſelf-willed, and not ſubject to them when they grow up: ſeeing they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have cheriſhed, fed, and ſupported that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in them from their cradles; whereby, unleſs religion lays deep hold of them, and changes the ſtate of their minds, they are unfitted to be a comfort either to themſelves or others; not being formed for good ſervants, huſbands, wives, or members of ſociety.</p>
               <p>Alas! when I take a view of the world, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how it wallows in abundance of wickedneſs and corruption, which mankind poſſeſs in a kind of ſucceſſion from parents to children, like out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inheritances; I have no words ſufficient to ſet forth to the full ſo deplorable a caſe. How ſorrowful it is to obſerve even children, by the power of example, become as grown men in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and hardneſs of heart! Cuſtom and general practice hath, as it were, changed the nature of ſome groſs evils, ſo that there appears very little remorſe in the almoſt conſtant practice of them. Many children are brought up, like their parents, much ſtrangers to their duty both to God and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010917_0013_0F8529D61FCEF990"/>
man. This almoſt univerſal infection of evil, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of God, and of many or moſt relative duties, by a conſtantly wallowing in the pollutions of this world, are very alarming, and call loudly for a reformation, leſt the Lord break forth in judgment upon the nations, as the breach of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. It is indeed a painful taſk for godly parents, amidſt ſo general a depravity, to educate their children without receiving ſome tincture from this pollution, which runs down like a ſtrong torrent. The ſafeſt way is, with great ſtrictneſs to keep them out of ſuch company; though an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency may attend that in ſome outward reſpects, But oh! the ſouls are the moſt precious part of them, which parents, above all other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ought to be concerned to preſerve untainted with the defilements of this world.</p>
               <p>There is no better rule to proceed and act by in this important taſk, than the Spirit of truth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to lead us into all truth. If we mind this, we ſhall not indulge our children in any individual thing which that teſtifies againſt in ourſelves. We ſhall be far from pleading, that becauſe they are young, ſome greater liberties may be allowed them in dreſs or otherwiſe; but as they are a part of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the ſame divine law ſhould be a ſtanding rule for the whole.</p>
               <p>I have taken notice, that divers parents, who, as to their outward appearance, ſeem to have learned, in degree, the leſſon of humility and ſelf-denial, however as far as could be diſcovered by their dreſs and addreſs, yet ſeem to have no aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to their children's making a different appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; nay, ſome will even introduce them into it themſelves whilſt very young; by which it is plain
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010917_0014_0F8529D6D87DAB28"/>
they have a pride in ſeeing them ſo, and cannot help (notwithſtanding their outward ſhew) diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering great unſoundneſs, and that they themſelves are not what they would paſs for. I ſincerely wiſh that parents, who are apt to indulge wrong liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their children, by ſuffering them to deviate from that pure ſimplicity and ſelf-denial Truth led our anceſtors, and ſtill leads thoſe who follow it into, would conſider, in the firſt place, the injury their children ſuſtain thereby, by being placed in a difficult and dangerous ſituation with reſpect to temptations, which may be preſented to them by the children of the land, or of the world: for doubtleſs the more like them they appear, the more free and intimate will ſuch make themſelves with them, that they may be drawn out into undue liberties; whereas, did they make an appearance quite conſiſtent with their plain ſelf-denying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that ſort would be more backward to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt an acceſs to them.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt with me, but this has opened a way for many under our profeſſion to ruin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by going out in marriage; and their parents have been, by their imprudent indulgence, the original cauſe thereof. For ſuffering them to be ſo much like the world, and ſo little like what Truth leads into, they are put out of the way of the beſt connexions in marriage amongſt us, <hi>viz.</hi> the moſt religious; as ſuch dare not ſeek to, nor join with, thoſe who give way to undue liberties: I mean ſuch as Truth doth not allow us, as people who ought in all things to hold up a true ſtandard to the nations, to continue in. Here inconſiderate tender youth, through their aptneſs to crave the glittering gaiety of the world, and their much more imprudent parents indulging them therein,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010917_0015_0F8529DB528B67F0"/>
are, as it were, prepared for ruin, unleſs divine mercy interpoſe; and are alſo removed out of the way of the greateſt bleſſing that can be enjoyed in the things of this life; <hi>viz.</hi> a truly religious huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or wife.</p>
               <p>Some parents have been pierced through with much ſorrow by ſuch means, and have had great cauſe to repent when it was too late, and there hath been reaſon to fear that the blood of their children would be required at their hands. Oh! how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably have ſome leaned to unſuitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions for their children, when there hath been a large outward proſpect! It is to be feared divers parents have looked at little elſe. This hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appeared to have been the caſe, by the ſlight put upon the offers of thoſe, who have wanted nothing to recommend them but wealth; the want of which, in the eye of ſuch, has proved ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, that they ſeem to have been rejected on that account. This is very wrong, and ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have entrance amongſt any profeſſing the Chriſtian name;
<q>For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulneſs thereof.<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe hints are not intended to encourage any to aſpire after great things; but that all ſhould, with a ſingle eye, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſeek for divine counſel, both in making and accepting offers for marriage.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Some perhaps may think I am very cloſe and ſevere upon parents; that it is not always their fault when children take undue liberties; (which I have already granted) that they are frequently very ſelf-willed and ungovernable. This is indeed ſaying ſomething, when children become their own rulers by age, or otherwiſe, and have to cloath and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves; but I think it has little weight whilſt their parents provide for them, who have
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010917_0016_0F8529DC0A8E50F8"/>
not only power to adviſe and perſuade, but alſo to command and reſtrain. They certainly may and ought to be abſolute, in caſes where the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of truth is in danger of ſuffering.</p>
               <p>It is very obſervable, that <hi>Eli</hi> was greatly blamed, becauſe he, having power, did not reſtrain his wicked ſons; though it plainly appears he much diſapproved of their practices, and expoſtulated with them on that account, and laid before them the pernicious conſequences of their evil conduct. Oh! how very affecting it is, to conſider the fearful calamities which came upon that houſe; and alſo upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> probably in ſome meaſure on the ſame account.</p>
               <p>The neglect and imprudent indulgence of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the training up their children, is alſo a painful loſs to the ſociety, as the conſequence thereof tends greatly to obſtruct the progreſs of truth, by ſtanding in the way of ſerious enquirers as ſtumbling-blocks; when it is ſeen by ſuch, that the ſame undue liberties they are called out of, are indulged amongſt us, they are offended. Oh! that parents, children, and all who are unfaithful, and who eaſily ſuffer the important branches of our Chriſtian teſtimony to fall (as indeed they would all appear, if they were ſeen in a true light) would deeply conſider the mournful conſequence thereof, by retarding the progreſs of truth, and grievouſly eclipſing the beauty of <hi>Sion!</hi> Then I greatly hope a more lively zeal and holy ardour would prevail, and that the careleſs ſons and daughters thereof would ariſe, and ſhake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the duſt of the earth, putting on the beautiful garment of holineſs and truth, that ſhe might become more and more a praiſe in the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:010917_0017_0F8529DC2C9A7CD0"/>Having offered a few remarks concerning the important duty of parents, it now remains to do the ſame reſpecting the indiſpenſible duty of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>honour and obey their parents in the Lord,</hi> which is ſtrongly enjoined in the holy ſcriptures, and, in the nature of things, of laſting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible obligation.</p>
               <p>The command is,
<q>Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xx. 12.</note>
                  </q>
Read <hi>Matt.</hi> xv. 4. <hi>Mark</hi> vii. 10. <hi>Luke</hi> xviii. 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> vi. 2.3. In that which is conſiſtent with the law of God, no children can ſtand acquitted before the ſupreme Judge, for diſobeying or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring their parents. This Obedience and honour not only extend to the yielding to what they enjoin or direct, but alſo to the preſervation of a reverent awe, and honourable eſteem in the heart, ariſing from a bottom of love, which would on all juſt occaſions cheriſh and protect them. It is a ſin of a deep dye to diſregard and ſlight pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as appears by <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvii. 16.

               <p>On the other hand, very memorable was the kind and watchful Providence which attended ſuch as feared the Lord, and thoſe who loved,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010917_0018_0F8529DDAA4BD9B0"/>
honoured, and obeyed their parents; as <hi>Jacob, Joſeph, Ruth, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> alſo the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites.</hi> Read the account concerning them, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxv. Reſpecting ſuch as lived in the fear of the Lord, let me recommend the caſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. iii.</note> and the three children, who, becauſe of their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, were preſerved unhurt, when by their adverſaries expoſed to the greateſt torment and danger.</p>
               <p>It would far exceed the bounds of my intention to particularize all thoſe excellent patterns and examples we are favoured with the account of, which are wonderfully adapted to inſtruct, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and improve the youth, as well as others. There are alſo, for caution and warning, examples and very affecting inſtances of fearful judgments and dreadful calamities, which fell upon the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and gainſayers. May the tender minds of youth, by reading theſe things, (as recorded in the holy ſcriptures and other good books) be deeply impreſſed with proper ſentiments concerning good and evil, and the very different rewards of virtue and vice, both in this world, and in the world to come.</p>
               <p>It is a very commendable, as well as a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable thing, to be converſant in thoſe ſacred writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Remember what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of his beloved ſon <hi>Timothy, viz.</hi>
                  <q>From a child thou haſt known the holy ſcriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.

                  </q>
But let the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010917_0019_0F8529DE5F0C5570"/>
youth and all duly conſider, that the profiting by theſe ſacred writings entirely depends upon the holy living powerful faith of Chriſt, which worketh by love, purifying the heart; and whereby we come to ſee him who is inviſible, and conſequently to underſtand the precious myſteries of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as far as is proper and neceſſary for us to know them, which is all that is lawful for us to deſire. There are many other good and profitable books, but none in which is contained ſuch a ſtore of rich treaſure, and ſublime heavenly myſteries, wonderfully wrapped up, and entirely concealed from earthly wiſdom and carnal policy. For none can know the things of God without the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, as appears by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 10. to 15. and in many other places too tedious to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate.</p>
               <p>Great hath been the concern of the church in its largeſt collective body; as appears by frequent and very preſſing affectionate advice, caution, and counſel to the youth, to read the holy ſcriptures, and other profitable books, carefully to refrain from all ſuch which may have the leaſt tendency to alienate their minds from the holy fear of God, and a ſober virtuous courſe of life, or which are barely for amuſement, being unprofitable; whereas time is very precious, ſhort, and uncertain; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould be carefully improved to the ſoul's everlaſting advantage. Moreover, that the youth do yield ſtrict and careful obedience to the Divine Monitor within, to parents, and all thoſe who have the rule over them without, carefully to ſhun the vain unprofitable amuſements, as well as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt converſation of the world: earneſtly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing all, to avoid every thing in their dreſs and addreſs, which might have the leaſt tendency to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010917_0020_0F8529DF143B1F78"/>
render them ſuitable for an intercourſe, league, or amity with the children of the land; or of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved degenerate world, that wallows in pollution and great defilements, leſt they ſhould be drawn aſide, as <hi>Dinah</hi> was, <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xxxiv. 1.</note> by going out to ſee the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the land; and as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were, by their woeful intimacy with the daughters of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Midian.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Numb. xxv.</note> Read the whole chapter; not forgetting the dreadful fall of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wiſeſt king, who, by contracting intimacy with thoſe that were ſtrangers to God, and his holy covenant, came to have his heart drawn away from the living and true God, who had appeared to him in <hi>Gibeon;</hi> and ſo greatly debaſed himſelf, as to bow down to their paltry dumb idols. Time would fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulate one half of the mournful inſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the holy ſcriptures, and other authentick accounts, concerning the hurtful conſequences of God's people mixing and joining with the nations. It is their ſafety to be ſeparate, and to dwell alone.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Numb. xxiii. 9</note>
               </p>
               <p>Our youth have been alſo highly favoured with a living powerful miniſtry, which hath often reached the <hi>Witneſs of God in their hearts.</hi> What a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful favour is this! when we conſider that the greateſt part of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> almoſt ever ſince the apoſtles days, have deprived themſelves thereof, by ſubſtituting human wiſdom and learning in its place; ſo that the panting thirſty ſoul could meet with little from their miniſters, but the muddy nauſeous waters of <hi>Babylon</hi> to drink; neither could they direct to the paſtures of Chriſt's flock; but counſel was darkened by a multitude of words without knowledge, and the commandments of God made void by the precepts, inventions, and injunctions of men. What a bleſſed time is your
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010917_0021_0F8529E02250CE28"/>
lot caſt in, even when evangelical Light and Truth hath diſcovered itſelf in perfect purity! Oh! that our youth would conſider and deeply ponder in their hearts, that notwithſtanding the great and earneſt labours many ways beſtowed in godly love and zeal for the whole ſociety's preſervation in the way of truth and righteouſneſs, yet very ſorrowful and obvious hath been the declenſion in practice of many amongſt us. A mournful inundation of undue liberties has flowed in; many have made grievous advances in thoſe corrupt periſhing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and trifling amuſements, which our truly pious predeceſſors wholly denied, and turned their backs upon, and have left us large and lively teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, by way of warning and caution, carefully to avoid being entangled with ſuch yokes of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. All theſe things have prevailed for want of abiding in the fear of God, and duly conſidering that he is ever preſent, beholding all our words and actions, be they ever ſo much concealed from the view of mortals; yet he knows them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. When the mind is ſuffered to turn to his pure Witneſs in the heart, we find reproof, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and judgment, for giving way to wrong things: and as the youth abide in ſubjection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they will be afraid to tranſgreſs its pure law in the mind; which they will find agree exactly with the precepts and injunctions recorded in holy writ, reſpecting their duty to God, to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and all mankind.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why many, who ſee their duty, fail in the performance, is their departing from the perfect law of liberty, and of the Spirit of life in their minds. They may be informed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duty by outward means and law: but the ability is only to be ſound ariſing from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward law, agreeable to <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 3.
<q>For the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010917_0022_0F8529E0C4C89FE8"/>
law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the law of ſin and death.</q>
In obedience and humble ſubjection to this holy law, youth would enjoy that pure peace, heavenly ſerenity, and ſweet conſolation of ſoul, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpaſſeth all the treaſures and pleaſures of the earth; and would have a well-grounded hope of a happy eternity. It is the adverſary that leads to that obduracy and ſelf-willed rebellious ſtate of mind, to be obſerved in ſome of the youth, who, by their uncontroulable diſpoſitions, adminiſter great ſorrow and anxiety to their parents and friends, being puffed up with vain conceits in their unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced minds, that they are more capable of judging for themſelves, than thoſe of greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience are for them; by reaſon whereof too many, it is to be feared, have ruſhed on to the ruin of body and ſoul.</p>
               <p>Very great is the danger when the young and unexperienced are proud and opinionated. This naturally raiſes above inſtruction, putting them out of the way of being truly profitable, either to themſelves or others. Such, unleſs their hearts are mercifully turned by a ſupernatural power, are never likely to be fit for governing families, or to act as members in the church of God. Seeing, unleſs their unmortified wills and tempers are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to (however unreaſonable) they will break the peace of ſociety, and violate the wholeſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof, being like the unſubjected bulls of <hi>Baſhan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When any aſſume the outward form of religion, and take upon them to be active members, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a change of heart, they prove a painful burthen to living members; neither can ſuch make ſuitable help-mates as huſbands or wives; nor can they in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010917_0023_0F8529E1715FE098"/>
that ſtate rightly fill up the honourable ſtations of parents, maſters and miſtreſſes, friends, neighbours, or tradeſmen. I do therefore, in much affection, and deſire for the welfare of tender youth, caution and warn them carefully to avoid the company and converſation of ſuch, though under the ſame profeſſion; who diſregard their parents, and thoſe who have the rule over them; who ſlight or ſpeak contemptuouſly of their betters, ſuch as miniſters and elders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or of the Chriſtian advice fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently given forth by the yearly and other meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or of the wholeſome diſcipline eſtabliſhed amongſt us as a people in the wiſdom of truth: do not join ſuch in marriage, however great the outward proſpect may appear; for tender religious minds cannot be happy with ſuch in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection. And as the fear of the Lord is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of wiſdom, and that which makes and keeps the heart clean, learn it in tender age; by it you will be taught to remember your Creator in the days of your youth, and, agreeable to the injunction of our bleſſed Lord, to ſeek firſt the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all things neceſſary here will be added. Divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as it is regarded, will direct your ſteps in the courſe of this ſhort pilgrimage, in the choice of proper help-mates, and all other affairs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. The ſame watchful Providence will be over you in care, guidance, and protection, if you look to it, which attended thoſe who lived in his fear, as you may read in the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>It greatly behoves you to look diligently to the foot-ſteps of Chriſt's companions, who walked with him through many tribulations, having waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Be truly contented with that low,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010917_0024_0F8529E2277C5278"/>
humble, ſelf-denying way which you ſee they walked in; you can never mend it. If you ſeek more liberty than that allows of, it will only bring upon you darkneſs, pain, and vexation of ſpirit. Take notice of friends writings in early times, and for a conſiderable number of years, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully the power and love of God was with them and how marvellouſly they were protected amidſt the raging foaming waves of earthly powers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, to lay waſte the heritage. What encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging and excellent accounts had they to leave upon record for us, concerning the mighty powerful overſhadowing of the canopy of heavenly love and life in their religious aſſemblies, and of the glory of God ſhining forth amongſt them! This, through the mercy of God, is not departed; though there have been ſome removes thereof.</p>
               <p>Dearly beloved youth: Lay to heart, the great ſlackneſs of zeal which appears in too many; the dimneſs, flatneſs, and the painful gloomineſs, which ſpreads itſelf over our aſſemblies in this our day, hard to break through, many times depriving us of the heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord! It is not of Him we are in this condition, but it certainly is our own fault, becauſe wrong things are ſuffered to prevail. Oh! that our youth may be ſtirred up in a godly zeal to cry out fervently with the prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi>
                  <q>Where is the Lord God of <hi>Elijah?</hi>

And to be as vigilant as he in ardent endeavours to be endued with the ſame Spirit, to ſucceed thoſe honourable worthies who are removed from works to receive a bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Conſider the buſineſs of your day is to come up in a faithful ſucceſſion, maintaining the cauſe and teſtimony of God, left with you by
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010917_0025_0F8529E2DE4367F0"/>
your anceſtors, or thoſe who are removed as above. Stand faſt therefore in the liberty purchaſed for you by great ſufferings, and ſhedding of innocent blood; be afraid to trample thereon; which all certainly do, who turn away from the truth, as it was received, held forth, and maintained by them. May it be very precious in your eyes from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation, until time ſhall be no more! Thoſe who otherwiſe eſteem it, turning their backs thereupon, violating the bleſſed teſtimony thereof in its ſeveral branches, will (unleſs they repent) be wholly rejected and caſt off, as being unworthy of ſo great an honour, as that of holding forth a ſtandard of truth and righteouſneſs to the nations; and others will be called and choſen for that great and glorious work: yea, the Lord is able to raiſe up of thoſe who may be compared to the ſtones, and to make them <hi>Abraham</hi>'s children, by doing his works; while thoſe, who might have been the children of the kingdom, may by diſobedience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to exclude them.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II. Containing ſome brief Obſervations concerning the NATURE and NECESSITY of the NEW BIRTH.</head>
               <p>THE ſtanding doctrine preached by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> of the neceſſity of being born again, <hi>John</hi> iii. 3—8. and what is delivered by <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> concerning the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Chriſt with the Holy Ghoſt and fire,<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. iii. 10, 11, 12.</note> being the ſame in ſubſtance, which is alſo ſet forth by the prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> under the lively metaphors of a <hi>refiner's fire, a purifier of ſilver,</hi> and <hi>fuller's ſoap,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Mal. iii. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> with many other paſſages of like import in holy writ, although of the utmoſt conſequence to be rightly underſtood, weightily conſidered, and deeply pondered by all, is by the generality much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, and amazingly neglected. That which alone can lay a ſure foundation for happineſs, both in time and eternity, is hardly thought of by many with deſire, or even with any degree of ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; unleſs it be to ſhun and evade the force of that power, which thereby would ſeparate them from their beloved luſts and fleſhly gratifications. In order to effect this, many and exceedingly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd have been the conjectures and dreams of a great part of mankind; but all to ſhun the croſs; that corrupt ſelf, with all its ſeeming rich treaſure and adorning, might be ſaved. This ſelf, in many, has been more fond of a religious kind of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and treaſure, than thoſe of any other ſort; towards whom the ſubtile transformer hath not been wanting plentifully to furniſh all thoſe minds who have a religious turn. Antichriſt, as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">I. Penington.</note> author obſerves, can bring forth in his church a likeneſs or imitation of every thing that is to be found in <hi>Sion.</hi> O then! how greatly it behoves mankind to preſs after a certainty; ſince nothing can poſſibly center the ſoul in a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate, than a miſtake of this kind.</p>
               <p>But ſome are apt to doubt whether ſuch a thing as an infallible evidence of our adoption is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able here; though ſo fully aſſerted in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. This is not to be wondered at, with reſpect to thoſe who are in the natural, unrenewed ſtate; ſeeing the natural man, according to <hi>Paul</hi>'s doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<q>underſtandeth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither indeed can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 14.</note>
                  </q>
But I am perſuaded none, who have really experienced the new birth, remain doubtful or ſcrupulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this important truth. It ſeems to me altogether unreaſonable to ſuppoſe Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who knows the fallibility and great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his creature man, ſhould leave any, whoſe hearts are fully devoted to yield obedience to his will, in a ſtate liable to miſtake the ſame, or in any wiſe ignorant of his divine approbation, upon a careful diſcharge of their duty to him. This holy evidence in faithful ſouls is indeed the white ſtone, and in it a new name written, which none know ſave thoſe who receive it; being an aſſurance that their names are written in heaven: from whence ariſes a joy, which is unſpeakable and full of glory.</p>
               <p>A ſenſe of the wrath of God againſt evil, doth often make deep impreſſions upon the minds of many; ſo that they in painful remorſe are ready to cry out for mercy and forgiveneſs of their ſins.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010917_0028_0F8529E52B3036A0"/>
And ſeeing this ſenſibility upon the mind of man, that he hath diſpleaſed his Creator, neither doth nor can proceed from any thing in man, but the pure witneſs of God placed there; ſo it is quite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to conclude, that this divine Witneſs, upon our faithfully diſcharging the duty we owe to God, according to its diſcoveries, will impreſs our minds with a ſweet ſenſe of divine approbation, agreeable to <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 16.
<q>The Spirit itſelf beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God.</q>
With many other paſſages in holy writ of like import.</p>
               <p>When any are really diſpoſed to be religious, great care ſhould be taken in their firſt ſetting out. Many have been marred upon the wheel, for want of patience to endure proper tempering; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to be formed into veſſels, before they have paſſed through the neceſſary operation. This has been for want of thoroughly knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For every thing that appertains to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely will, and forwardneſs of deſire to chuſe and act for itſelf, muſt die upon the croſs, therefore there muſt be a remaining as a chaos without form and void, to endure all ſorts of ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, until the effective Word ſaith, <hi>Let there be light!</hi> making by his own power a perfect ſeparation between the light and darkneſs in the little world, (<hi>viz.</hi> man) as he did in the great world. Until this is really experienced, man is not in a condition to be placed upon the wheel, to be formed into a veſſel of honour. But there muſt be a time for drying, and enduring the furnace.</p>
               <p>Theſe wonderful operations, which I have, in an allegorical way, only juſt touched upon, muſt neceſſarily make very deep and laſting impreſſions upon all, who have been ſo happy as ſo far to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010917_0029_0F8529E5D96F1008"/>
experience the nature of that regeneration, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none can ſee the kingdom of God. When any are come thus far, there will be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make uſe of dreams and uncertain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures in forming a judgment concerning their adoption. That divine birth which is raiſed in them, naturally cries, Abba, Father! leaving them no room to doubt, when he is pleaſed to appear (which they are taught to wait in the patience for) of their having paſſed from death unto life; or being tranſlated from under the power of darkneſs into the kingdom of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; which conſiſteth in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The great danger of man's being deceived lies in the myſterious workings of Satan, who has a ſtrong hold in thoſe, who, upon their firſt awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the call of Chriſt, have not ſuffered his power ſo far to prevail, as to make them willing to part with all for his ſake. There is ſomething exceedingly reluctant in the ſtrong ſpirit and will of man, to the falling into nothingneſs of ſelf, and be wholly given up to be guided and upheld by another. This in part ariſes from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his frame, and nobility of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who finds himſelf in naturals capable of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting great things, and knows not, till his eyes are opened and enlightened from above, but that he is equally capable of comprehending what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to him concerning the world to come. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead therefore of wholly ceaſing from his own will, and relying altogether upon the guidance of the Holy Spirit, he is very apt to be active, and imagines God will be pleaſed with his diligence, in the performance of what he apprehends to be religious duties; ſuch as praying, ſinging, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010917_0030_0F8529E69A710330"/>
or eagerly ſeeking to join others in thoſe performances; often telling his experiences, and hearing thoſe of others. Whereas it would be abundantly more pleaſing to the Almighty, and profitable to himſelf, to lay his mouth in the duſt, ſilently to commune with his own heart, and be ſtill, until it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to ſend forth his light and his truth, that the poor helpleſs creature may move and act in a religious ſenſe, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding informed thereby: ſeeing every thing that is done in religion and worſhip, without the ſenſible guidance of the Holy Spirit, is will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and idolatry: for if the Spirit of Chriſt doth not move and actuate us in religious performances, we are liable to the influences of the ſpirit of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
               <p>Yet ſome perhaps, by way of excuſe for their not being influenced by the Spirit of Truth in their religion, are ready to call it enthuſiaſm and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in thoſe who aſſert the neceſſity thereof, ſeeming to imagine there is no ſuch thing in our time to be relied upon; yet they will readily own it was ſo in the apoſtles days. But they can give no good reaſon why the ſame divine power and efficacy ſhould forſake the true church; ſince man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have equal need thereof, and the nature of God's diſpenſation is now the ſame as it was then.</p>
               <p>Common prudence teacheth us to examine ſtrictly into the clearneſs and validity of our titles to earthly eſtates, that we may be fully ſatisfied we are not deceived or impoſed upon by falſe gloſſes and ſpecious pretences. Shall we be leſs ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about that which is of infinitely greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>viz.</hi> our title to an everlaſting inheritance? Man ſhould be very jealous over his own heart,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010917_0031_0F8529E77931E820"/>
which is apt to be partial towards itſelf, and, through the transformation of Satan, to ſooth and flatter him into an apprehenſion that he is in the way to everlaſting happineſs, when in reality it is quite otherwiſe. But, alas! his criterion to form a judgment of himſelf by may be the ſame as that of the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> who went up to the temple to pray, or rather to recapitulate his own ſuppoſed excellencies. He perhaps meaſures himſelf by himſelf, or by comparing his principles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in life with thoſe of others; whereas nothing ſhould be received as a ſtandard in this very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant caſe, but the ſtamp of divine approbation upon the heart; agreeable to <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 14, 15, 16,
<q>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſons of God. For ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having offered a few Hints by Way of Caution, in order that all into whoſe Hands this ſhall come may examine themſelves without Partiality, leſt they fall inadvertently into an irretrievable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake reſpecting the eternal Salvation of their own Souls, I ſhall now endeavour to ſet forth, from mine own Experience, a little of the Nature of that New Birth, without which none can ſee the Kingdom of God; conſequently are no true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church, which is his Kingdom, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called Heaven, and the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the holy Scriptures. It cannot therefore be ſuppoſed, that a Perſon wholly unregenerate can be properly qualified for the Performance of any
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010917_0032_0F8529E817E67820"/>
religious Duty, or even the leaſt Service in that kingdom, which he doth not ſo much <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>I have, by experience from my childhood, found two ſpirits or ſeeds ſtriving in me for maſtery or rule: I have diſcovered them to be irreconcileable enemies one to the other; and that I could not ſerve them both at the ſame time. I had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding given me, whereby I knew one of thoſe ſeeds was a meaſure of the All-powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible Source of Goodneſs; and the other, which had indeed in a manner leavened the whole lump, was of a wicked and diabolical nature. By means of this corrupt leaven, I had a ſtrong bias to evil of many kinds; nevertheleſs, I often found the good ſtriking at the evil, as an ax laid to the root thereof, agreeable to <hi>Matth.</hi> iii. 10. in order to deſtroy that which deprived the Heir of all things of his inheritance. I was long in a kind of ſuſpence, unreſolved which to join with; yet ſaw all depended upon my determination, and that I had full power of choice. On the one hand, when the awakening viſitations of God's Spirit were upon me, it appeared very dreadful to provoke an Omnipotent Being, of unmerited kindneſs and mercy, to caſt my ſoul into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting perdition. On the other hand, eſpecially when thoſe bleſſed impreſſions were ſomewhat worn off, it was next to death itſelf to yield up all my ſenſual gratifications, and to expoſe myſelf to the ſcorn and contempt of the world. However, in proceſs of time, the Lord in gracious condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion broke in upon my ſoul, by his judgments mixed with mercy, in ſuch a powerful manner, as that I was made willing to yield up thereunto, come life or death. For indeed I looked for
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010917_0033_0F8529E8D680D570"/>
nothing elſe at that time, but really expected my frail body would ſink down under the weight of that unſpeakable diſtreſs which was upon me, and that my ſinful ſoul muſt be centered in a ſtate of everlaſting miſery. Now the cry was with <hi>Saul,</hi> afterwards <hi>Paul,</hi> with trembling and aſtoniſhment, "Lord! what wilt thou have me to do?<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ix. 6.</note>" There was no holding back, or ſecret reſerve then, but whatever was called for was given up with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs: this being all I could then do. As to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming religious duties, I had them all to learn, though I had been trained up from my infancy in a ſtrict religious way by godly parents. But the very beſt outward helps, and the moſt conſiſtent ſet of religious principles, only profeſſed, cannot at all enrich the ſoul with heavenly grace.</p>
               <p>By carefully enquiring as above, I ſoon clearly perceived my buſineſs was to watch and pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; to commune with mine own heart, or the Witneſs of God therein, that I might receive freſh inſtruction and help as I had need. Self-denial, and taking up the croſs daily, was to be my conſtant employ; in the doing whereof I had much inward peace and comfort, and a well-grounded hope that I ſhould thereby find, in the Lord's time, the body of ſin ſo weakened, as that the yoke of Chriſt would become eaſy, and his burthen light.</p>
               <p>In order to a happy progreſs in the life of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the great thing is, by abiding in the Divine Light, to preſerve a clear and diſtinguiſhing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility between the fleſh and the Spirit. There is no doing this without great care and ſteady atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind upon the Divine Gift. If the eye goes from this, it is blinded by the darkneſs; then
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010917_0034_0F8529E9B6CE9808"/>
the man is liable to be miſled by a counterfeit light, and various reſemblances, which Satan will caſt in his way for guidance and inſtruction, perſuading him all is well and right. To be ſo miſled, and therein eſtabliſhed, is a truly deplorable ſtate; it being very unlikely ſuch ſhould ever be perſuaded to believe they are miſtaken, as they often deride whatever appears doubtful concerning their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and worſhip. This was evidently the caſe with a ſet of profeſſors of uncommon outward ſanctity and punctual exactneſs in the exteriors of their religion, in the time of our Saviour's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal appearance upon earth; notwithſtanding which, theſe very people appeared to be the moſt inveterate enemies he had amongſt mankind. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore frail mortals are liable to ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous miſtakes, how exceedingly circumſpect and watchful ought all to be! and what frequent and ſtrict ſcrutinies ought they to make into the ſtate of their own hearts! which can be known no otherwiſe by any, but as the Lord is pleaſed to ſend forth his heart-ſearching light. This is a high favour, which none receive but thoſe who are turned from the darkneſs, and are fervently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to put away all the works thereof. Very groſs is the deception of thoſe, who imagine the work of their converſion to be an inſtantaneous work. This can be nothing elſe but a deluſion of Satan, to ſettle people at reſt in a ſtate of ſelf-ſecurity as ſoon as he can. Oh! what a length of time it takes, to work out that rebellious, ſtiff-necked, backſliding nature, which was born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> before the new generation is raiſed up, that is fit to enter the promiſed land!</p>
               <p>From what is before hinted, it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the Good Seed, or Heavenly Principle,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010917_0035_0F8529EA6AF7F060"/>
ariſing into aſcendancy in us over the evil ſeed or principle, and leavening the three meaſures of meal into its own nature, is eſſentially a being born again, or with water and the Spirit, or being baptized with the Holy Ghoſt and fire; or man's enduring the operation of the refiner's fire, fuller's ſoap, and being purified as ſilver; all which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors ſignify to us, in a very inſtructive manner, the different operations of the Holy Spirit; which is to the willing ſoul ſometimes as water, to waſh and bathe in, and alſo to drink of freely; at other times as a refiner's fire, to purge away the filth and droſs, that man may be as pure gold, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive the image and ſuperſcription of the King of Heaven; that ſo, where-ever he goes, or whatever he doth, all who have their eyes opened may ſee whoſe ſubject he is.</p>
               <p>It is very obſervable, that the prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> when he had elegantly ſet forth the nature of the new birth, breaks out in the forth verſe of the third chapter on this wiſe:
<q>Then ſhall the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be pleaſant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years;</q>
which clearly implies man's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable ſtate with his Maker in any religious performances, until he hath previouſly known the cleanſing and refining operations before-mentioned. What then will become of thoſe who have intruded themſelves into religious ſervices, and amongſt his faithful followers, not having on the wedding-garment! who would paſs for his people, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find, by examining the ſtate of their minds reſpecting religion, that they have trod the path of regeneration, nor paſſed through the many and various pangs of the new birth.</p>
               <p>When man hath, through the powerful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of the Divine Principle, obtained victory
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010917_0036_0F8529EB17D4E808"/>
in a good degree over evil, his ſoul abounds with evidence and tokens of his happy attainments, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; to whom with the Father, through the influence of the Holy Spirit, praiſe, adoration, and thankſgiving, are offered up as incenſe with acceptance; he enjoys an abundant flow of heavenly love, to thoſe eſpecially of the ſame lineage, begotten of the ſame Everlaſting Father, agreeable to 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 14.
<q>We know that we have paſſed from death unto life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love the brethren.</q>
It is then become as his meat and drink to do the will of God; he looks with indifference upon worldly enjoyment, when compared with religion and the weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thereof; his body, ſoul, and outward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are offered up to the Great Giver; being given up to ſpend and to be ſpent for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, according to the degree of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings; careful that all he doth may tend to God's glory. Theſe particulars, and much more than I can ſet forth, are done from a mature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of a well-informed underſtanding and ſound judgment, which cannot fail of producing great peace and heavenly ſolace, whereby he is mightily encouraged to perſevere.</p>
               <p>Oh! that mankind would but come clearly to ſee the neceſſity of beginning in the Spirit, and walking therein, agreeable to the advice and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the primitive Chriſtians! then they would not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh. The ſpirit that luſteth to envy, and ſeeks vengeance, would be ſlain. Here outward wars and fightings would ceaſe of courſe; the cauſe being taken away, the effect would be no more. A ſelfiſh covetous ſpirit, which ſeeks undue advantage to the injury of others, would be purged out. Here we ſhould
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010917_0037_0F8529EBF4869C08"/>
have power to love our neighbours as ourſelves, and to do unto all as we ſhould be done unto, were we in their ſituation. All theſe, and many more good fruits, would ſpring up naturally from the new creation in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. But thoſe who have not the ground-work in themſelves, and lack the virtues of the Holy Spirit, which are ſet forth in the ſcriptures of truth, are blind, and cannot ſee that it is poſſible to attain thoſe exalted Chriſtian virtues now as it was in the apoſtles days; and therefore imaginations, dreams, and conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures abound amongſt outſide Chriſtians (who are numerous) concerning the way and means of obtaining that ſalvation which comes only by being born from above. Some ſay, Lo! here is Chriſt! Others ſay, Lo! he is there! but ſtill evade the croſs. If that did not ſtick in the way, they would ſurely embrace the right thing, as it is ſo fully ſet forth and deſcribed in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>The teſtimonies thereof have enforced, however, an aſſent to the truth of the doctrine of the new birth, both in Papiſts and Proteſtants. But alas! their apprehenſions concerning its nature are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly obſcure and carnal, making the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of infants with a little water (which they call baptiſm) eſſential thereunto; nay, the manner of their expreſſing themſelves on this ſubject, in the confeſſion of their faith to the world, ſeems in my apprehenſion to make that ceremony all, or the chief that is intended by being born from above; or that the operations of the Spirit for that end are infallibly connected to the operation of water. Papiſts ſay,
<q>We muſt believe that Jeſus Chriſt has inſtituted in his church ſeven ſacraments, or myſterious ſigns and inſtrumental cauſes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

               <p>From theſe evaſions it appears man hates death to ſelf, and had rather look any way than that which is likely to ſtrip him of all his beloved trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; though if he was not very blind and ignorant concerning his true intereſt, he would eaſily ſee that his ſuppoſed loſs would make way for his greateſt gain. However, this unhappy reluctance in man to the true way, has put him upon ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his invention, to find an eaſier way to the kingdom of felicity, of becoming heir of two kingdoms; of ſerving God and mammon, though we are aſſured that is impoſſible. Many would fain imagine, that man may be ſaved merely by
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010917_0039_0F8529ED6542F890"/>
the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs; which, if it were true, would be a mighty palatable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to a multitude of ſelf-lovers. Some, who do not fall in with this opinion, but believe they muſt repent, and that they ought to experience the evil purged out by the ſpirit of judgment and burning, do yet put off this great work, reſting with a kind of hope, that they ſhall be fitted for everlaſting happineſs thereby ſome time before they go hence; and build much upon the great mercy and long-ſuffering of the Almighty, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eagerly at the ſudden converſion of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the thief upon the croſs. Oh! how exceeding inconſiderate are ſuch delays! A ſaying of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> is worthy to be noted, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>God promiſes mercy to penitent ſinners, but he doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them, that they ſhall have ſo much time as to-morrow for their repentance!</q>
Others there be, who imagine converſion is effected in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; and in order that their deception may be effectual, the falſe prophet cauſes fire to come down as from heaven in their ſight; he that is prince in the airy region, raiſes vehement heats and agitations upon their paſſions. This they call the workings of the Spirit upon them for their converſion; immediately after which a kind of heaven is formed, wherein they take their reſt with a ſeeming ſecurity, erroneouſly ſuppoſing their calling and election are made ſure, and that they can never fall from ſaving grace, which they doubt not of having in their poſſeſſion. Oh! how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is ſuch a ſecurity!</p>
               <p>Much more might be written concerning the many falſe reſts and viſionary heavens which poor mortals, through the ſubtlety of Satan, and their own inattention, are deluded to repoſe themſelves
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010917_0040_0F8529EE1E149790"/>
in; which might all be happily prevented, were they to enter into the ſheepfold by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the door and way to the everlaſting kingdom, which is opened and prepared for the ſoul to travel in, by his inward appearance, as before noted. He will certainly count all thieves and robbers, who come into his church any other way.</p>
               <p>What abundance of robbery is found in thee O <hi>Chriſtendom!</hi> what ſtealing the name of Chriſt, and the experience of God's people formerly, to live upon, and alſo to feed one another with! Oh, what multitudes there are of unwholeſome barren paſtors, and poor, lean, ſtarved flocks, amongſt moſt or all ſocieties of Chriſtian profeſſors! Their poor low condition, as to religion, induces them to put forth their hands and ſteal. Can the God of juſtice and truth delight in robbery for burnt-offerings? No; ſuch ſacrifices are an abomination to him. His regenerate ones, though often tried with great poverty of ſpirit, dare not ſteal; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing will find acceptance with the Source of Infinite Goodneſs, but that which is of his own immediate begetting. He will ſmell a ſweet ſavour from that, although it be but a ſigh or a groan; which may be compared with the acceptable offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the poor under the law, of a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons; and with the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's two mites caſt into the treaſury, taken notice of by our Lord.* Thoſe poor humble dependant ones, who are made perfectly honeſt by the juſt and upright principle prevailing in them, and waiting the Lord's time, may be, and often are furniſhed with larger offerings, and do greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe with the increaſe of God.</p>
               <p>To conclude this head, I ſhall thus ſum up the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010917_0041_0F8529EEDF5364D8"/>
matter, <hi>viz.</hi> that man's great buſineſs, upon his firſt awakening out of the ſleep or ſtupefaction of ſin, is paſſively to yield himſelf into the hands of his faithful Creator, that he may be pleaſed to work in and upon him, to will and to do of his own good pleaſure. His ſoul muſt, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt care, endeavour to abide in that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables inceſſantly to pray,
<q>Thy kingdom come, and thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.</q>
This bent of heart, through the grace of God, is a ſufficient guard or defence againſt all the ſubtle attempts of Satan to beguile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and nothing elſe. The moſt crafty devices of the adverſary can never prevail to pluck ſuch an one out of the Almighty's hands; and by abiding therein, he is created anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, having ſpiritual ſenſes given, that he may continually exerciſe them in diſcerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil. His heart being made pure in a good degree by the ſprinkling of the moſt precious blood of Chriſt, his conſtant care is, through Divine aſſiſtance, to preſerve it ſo, that he may be pleaſed to tabernacle with him, on whom help is laid; who is made of God, to ſuch paſſive upright ſouls, their wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption. They receive from him thoſe qualifications, which enable them to co-work with the Spirit, and perfectly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the proper buſineſs of their day, both in the world as ſtrangers and pilgrims, and in the church of Chriſt, as living members thereof.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III. Relating to the NATURE of TRUE WORSHIP; with ſome Remarks upon the State of our Society, both as in early Times, and now.</head>
               <p>THE nature of acceptable worſhip is ſet forth by our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in a manner wonderfully adapted to the ſubject; <hi>viz.</hi> that it is to be performed in <hi>Spirit and in Truth.</hi>† The reaſon is given, "Becauſe God is a Spirit;" and therefore,
<q>they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth.*</q>
Not in the ceremonial, ſhadowy, and typical worſhip of the Jews; (tho' becauſe of weakneſs it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to them, until a better hope, and more excellent worſhip was brought in; whereby man has a nearer acceſs to the Divinity, and a better knowledge of himſelf: here ſuch a brightneſs of heavenly glory appears, as cauſeth all ſigns, figures, and types, to vaniſh away) but in the truth and real ſubſtance of all that was typified and pre-figured by the ceremonial law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of that law being fulfilled in thoſe who walk and worſhip in the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The ſoul muſt bow in perfect ſincerity, humble proſtration, and a deep inward ſenſe of its own frailty, want, and unworthineſs; being at the ſame time deeply impreſſed with a lively ſenſe of the Lord's adorable greatneſs and goodneſs; from which ſenſibility renewed upon the mind, by Him alone who is the ſole object of worſhip, thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and praiſes aſcend, for the multitude of his
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010917_0043_0F8529F0562E63F8"/>
mercies received, and reverent prayer, either men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or vocal (according as the mind feels itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced or directed by the Holy Anointing) for the continuance of his gracious preſervation in the way of righteouſneſs; agreeable to <hi>Eph.</hi> vi. 18.
<q>Praying always with all ſupplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance, and ſupplication for all ſaints.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is clearly to be underſtood, by what our Lord ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> before-mentioned, that acceptable worſhip is not to be confined to any particular place, mode, form, or ceremony whatſoever; which was a deception mankind had too generally fallen into, and greatly wanted to be drawn from, being then, as well as now, too apt to reſt ſatisfied with exterior performances; which altho' ſome of them once were to the Jews in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion diſpenſed, yet not even then ſubſtituted in the place of ſpiritual worſhip, nor at all accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without the bowing of the ſoul as above. But now our Lord ſhews the outward was to be laid aſide, and not to continue in his glorious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſpenſation any longer; a dangerous ſnare for man to pleaſe himſelf with and reſt in. But it could hardly be expected that ſo much, or ſo great a maſs of outward obſervations could be caſt off all at once; yet in the apoſtles days the church was wonderfully (for the time) brought out of them, as appears by thoſe few things laid upon the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>* But alas! the Chriſtian church (ſo called) inſtead of leaving all, and becoming purely ſpiritual, gradually decayed as to life and power, and increaſed in ceremonies and outward obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, until ſhe became as full of them as ever the Jewiſh church was. The ſhe got fall poſſeſſion

of the outward court, having nothing to enjoy but her own inventions, and to glory in <hi>Babylon,</hi> which ſhe had built inſtead of <hi>Sion,</hi> until her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhould be filled up, and her determined over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw was to take place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
                  <q>For we are the circumciſion which worſhip God in Spirit, and rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.*</q>
What circumciſion is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, appears from <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 28, 29 <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 11. That the generality of Chriſtian profeſſors, of every denomination, have lamentably deviated from this kind of worſhip, requires not much penetration to diſcover. And tho' the great Author of the Chriſtian religion hath ſo fully expreſſed his will and pleaſure in this moſt important point, yet many will not be ſatisfied without a kind of worſhip that the man's part can be active in; that hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it capable to amuſe the outward ſenſes: they would yet worſhip the Moſt High with human abilities, or the work of men's hands; and by an unjuſtifiable veneration, which ſome endeavour to keep up for old maſs houſes, and other places of worſhip, calling them churches, houſes of God, holy places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſeem to maintain a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine contrary to the teſtimony of that holy martyr <hi>Stephen;</hi>
                  <q>Howbeit the Moſt High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as ſaith the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet†;</q>

                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:010917_0045_0F8529F1D670F308"/>Moſt Proteſtants, tho' they have caſt off much of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſuperſtition, ſtill retain ſome outward ceremonies and obſervations very unſuitable to the ſpirituality of the goſpel diſpenſation, for which they have no divine authority, nor any colour of warrant, but what is patched up from the example of ſome in the primitive church; which being then juſt ariſing out of a load of ceremonies, could not be wholly weaned from every thing of that kind at once; and therefore ſeveral of theſe things were for a time condeſcended unto; it being, tho' a very glorious beginning, but the morning of the goſpel-day, and infancy of the Chriſtian church, ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully abounded with heavenly power, in order to make her way in the world. Yet, by the riſing higher and higher of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, who rules the everlaſting day of God's ſalvation, ſhe was to put on all her beautiful garments; to make herſelf quite ready for the bridegroom, and, by a gradual increaſe of clear diſcoveries, was to grow into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of wiſdom, and ripeneſs of judgment. Our Lord clearly intimates the great danger of tacking any thing of the <hi>old</hi> ceremonial diſpenſation to the <hi>new</hi> goſpel diſpenſation<note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. ix. 16.17</note>; ſhewing they would by no means agree, or ſafely ſubſiſt together. This the experience of many generations can fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Oh! what rents, ſchiſms, and tearing of the pure undefiled religion of Chriſt to pieces, have there been by means of retaining ſome patches of the old garment!</p>
               <p>Yet there hath been a godly travail, and an ardent labour preſerved, even through the darkeſt ages of ſuperſtition and idolatry, by the true church; tho' hidden from carnal eyes, as in a wilderneſs, that ſhe might caſt off this heavy eclipſing maſs of

outward obſervations: there were many riſings up, through the divine power, againſt it, eſpecially the groſſeſt part thereof; but the moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as to its conſiſtency with the unmixed purity of the goſpel, was about the middle of the laſt century. Then evangelical light and truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, without the blending of ceremonies and outward obſervations. When the Lord, by his over-ruling power, had erected this bleſſed ſtandard of ſimple truth, and pure righteouſneſs, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands flocked to it, and ſpoke the language, in a conſiderable degree, ſet forth by way of enquiry, <hi>Cant.</hi> vi. 10.
<q>Who is ſhe! that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the ſun, and terrible as an army with banners?</q>
Terrible indeed they were to the man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, and were mighty inſtruments in the Lord's hand to reveal him. A great annoyance they were to the merchants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thoſe who enriched themſelves by the ſuperſtitious wares thereof; which, through the witchcraft and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments of the great whore and her daughters, mankind were deluded to buy of them; tho' now the wicked craft is much more ſeen in all its tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, than it was at their firſt riſing.</p>
               <p>They endured a great fight of affliction; but through all, they with patient but undaunted firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs maintained their ground, and were made vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious through ſufferings, as the Captain of their ſalvation was. The everlaſting goſpel was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them in great demonſtration of the Spirit, and with power; in ſum and ſubſtance as it was to be preached after the apoſtaſy:
<q>Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worſhip him that made heaven and

               <p>This was indeed coming to the ſubſtance, after men had wearied themſelves with abundance of toil in vain, catching nothing, but vanity and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpirit. If any would receive this goſpel, thus preached according to the true intent and meaning thereof, there was no room to evade the croſs of Chriſt, which is the power of God to ſalvation. There is no liberty here to retain a few ceremonies for decency's ſake, and to invite the Papiſts over, as pretended by Proteſtants; but all are to embrace the ſubſtance, not daring any more to touch the beggarly elements, ſo much pro<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

The virgin daughter of <hi>Sion</hi> is well aſſured the bridegroom of her ſoul will never more appear to her in theſe uncertain polluted things, which have been, and yet will be, more and more terribly ſhaken, and paſs away as a ſcroll; that thoſe things which can never be ſhaken may remain, agreeable to <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 1.
<q>And I ſaw a new heaven, and a new earth; for the firſt heaven and the firſt earth were paſſed away; and there was no more ſea.</q> 
                  <hi>There was no more ſea;</hi> nothing unſtable, fluctuating, and uncertain; nothing of that element from which the beaſt ariſeth, and therefore no danger of a beaſt riſing thence any more. The 2d, 3d and 4th verſes of the ſame chapter wonderfully ſet forth the glory of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> coming down from above, the tabernacle of God being with men, and God's dwelling with them; of his wiping away all tears from their eyes; and that there ſhall be no more crying, ſorrow, and pain, becauſe the former things were paſſed away; <hi>viz.</hi> there was no more ſea; all is purged away which was the

cauſe of thoſe dreadful calamities and miſeries ſet forth in this Divine Revelation, by opening the ſeven ſeals, ſounding the ſeven trumpets, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſeven vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. The fifth verſe ſaith
<q>And he that ſat upon the throne ſaid, Behold, I will make all things new!</q>
Now there is nothing of the old garment, nor old wine left, to tear and break to pieces the new garment, and the new bottles. Oh! glorious goſpel times! May the Lord of hoſts haſten them more generally in the kingdoms of the earth!</p>
               <p>Having offered a few general obſervations upon the ſtate of things, it now remains to make ſome further remarks upon thoſe people ſo remarkably raiſed, as before hinted, in the laſt century, in this our native land: for their beginning and firſt progreſs was here, tho' many other lands were alſo ſharers in the brightneſs of truth's ariſing in them; and it may without vanity be ſaid, that through them a light hath extended, or at leaſt glanced, over a great part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> (ſo called) which hath diſcovered the hidden myſtery of the falſe church more clearly than heretofore, and given a great ſhake to the long-continued kingdom of antichriſt. They have been, through Divine Wiſdom, eſtabliſhed into a firm body, amongſt whom ſubſiſts the comely order of the goſpel, as an hedge, by divine appointment, for their ſafety and preſervation from the deſtroyer, and out of the polluting defilements of a greatly corrupted world. Notwithſtanding which, their preſervation doth, and always will, much depend upon their diligently ſeeking unto, and waiting ſingly and carefully for a daily renewing of ſtrength and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from above, whereby alone all things muſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010917_0049_0F8529F7DA571A60"/>
be directed and ordered for their ſafety and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</p>
               <p>It hath been often accounted by me a great favour and bleſſing, that my lot was caſt in a time when primitive Chriſtianity, in its power and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, was reſtored in the world; and that I was ſo happy as to have my birth and education amongſt the before-mentioned people: for tho' that did not make me a real and living member of their body, yet it happily put me more in the way of being ſo, than if my lot had fallen in ſome of the foregoing dark ages, and afforded me greater means of reſtoration, than if I had been educated amongſt ſuperſtitious bigots; for which favour, enjoyed by me and many others, there muſt be proportionable returns of thankfulneſs and obedience, or it will ſurely add to our condemnation: for where much is given, much will be required.</p>
               <p>Before I had quite arrived to man's eſtate, I was, through merciful goodneſs operating upon my ſoul, brought into a better knowledge of, and a nearer intimacy and fellowſhip with, theſe people in a ſpiritual ſenſe, than before, to my unutterable conſolation: for I found the glorious Lord was their king and law-giver, and that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed become to them a place of broad rivers and ſtreams; and that man's ſplendid inventions, ſuch as a galley with oars, and gallant ſhip, could not paſs amongſt them:
<q>For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law-giver, the Lord is our king, he will ſave us.<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. xxxiii. 21. Ver. 22.</note>
                  </q>
This was the bleſſed language ſounded within their borders. My ſpirit hath many times been reverently bowed, and awfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated before the Lord, in beholding the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010917_0050_0F8529F8B08C7B68"/>
beautiful ſituation, and ſafety of theſe his people; in an humble ſenſe whereof I have been ready to ſay,
<q>Happy art thou, O <hi>Iſrael!</hi> who is like unto thee, O people ſaved of the Lord! the ſhield of thy help, and who is the ſword of thy excellency! and thine enemies ſhall be found liars unto thee, and thou ſhalt tread upon their high places!</q>
               </p>
               <p>It may be objected that the foregoing contains high encomiums on a people, amongſt whom we cannot diſcover theſe excellencies, but have looked upon them as a mean contemptible body, who affect a kind of aukward ſingularity; and we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve many amongſt them as eager after the world, and who love it as well as any people whatever; and others, who take undue liberties, are as deeply involved in the pleaſures and gaieties of life, and as much ſtrangers to ſelf-denial, as people of other perſuaſions. And it is further to be noted, that when we go to their places of worſhip, and obſerve the manner of their ſitting in ſilence, a <hi>Laodicean</hi> lukewarmneſs is very apparent in many of them, by the eaſy, careleſs condition they ſeem to ſit in, at the ſame time they profeſs to be waiting in ſilence of body, and ſtillneſs of ſoul, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending of the Holy Ghoſt, that their ſpiritual ſtrength may be renewed. Surely, If this is not really ſo, it muſt be a mockery and deception of the moſt contemptible and provoking nature in the ſight of an All-ſeeing Eye.</p>
               <p>In order a little to open the ſtate of the caſe, and to anſwer the foregoing objections, I ſhall now make ſome obſervations upon the defection in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that is to be found amongſt us as a people, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of late years, which hath cauſed abundance of pain and heart-aching diſtreſs to the living body,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010917_0051_0F8529F96A510200"/>
who fervently travail that Chriſt may be formed in thoſe who have a natural birth-righ in the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, which at preſent ſeems to be all the title ſome have to be accounted of us. As to the foregoing part of the objection, this people have been indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately viewed in that light by carnal profeſſors from their firſt riſe, which diſcovers the fame undiſtinguiſhing blindneſs, as always hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the children of this world of ſeeing any beauty or comelineſs in the children of light. I have before noted, that I tho' educated in the ſame profeſſion) did not ſee the Lord was amongſt them, in ſuch a manner, until he was pleaſed to open mine eyes, agreeable to <hi>Matth.</hi> xvi. 16.17. where our Lord pronounces <hi>Peter</hi> bleſſed, in that the Father had revealed the Son to him. Chap. xiii. 16. he ſaid to his diſciples,
<q>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee; and your ears, for they hear.</q>
It is through the ſame bleſſing mine eyes are yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved open to ſee, that notwithſtanding the great declenſion in practice, which hath prevailed over many of us as a people, the glory is not departed from amongſt us: the King is known by the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right-hearted in his beauty, ſtill reigning. Princes do yet rule in the ſpirit of judgment given them of God. My faith is, at times, greatly ſtrengthened to believe it will never ceaſe to be ſo amongſt this people, but that they will be preſerved by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, through all generations, a living body; and that the principles of truth, as held by them, will yet ſpread far and wide in the kingdoms of the earth. This, I believe, was the bleſſed end for which they were firſt raiſed, and marvelouſly ſupported: this glorious work hath been in degree going on, tho' very much impeded by the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of many amongſt us, who, like the fooliſh
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010917_0052_0F8529FA3A72C8A8"/>
woman, are in ſome meaſure pulling down what the wiſe woman hath built up. Oh! that all who take upon them our holy profeſſion of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable truth, would deeply conſider the weight of that obligation which they take upon themſelves thereby! It is far, O very far! from being a light eaſy thing; as it may, in a proper ſenſe, be eſteemed an entering into the ſolemn covenant thoſe people are bound to by their God, of holding up a ſtandard of truth and righteouſneſs, altogether meet and ſuitable for the nations, with ſafety and well-grounded confidence to draw unto; ſo that none amongſt us need be aſhamed to call unto mankind thus; <hi>viz. Look upon Sion,</hi> the city of our ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! Oh! it is a lovely ſight to behold her walls and bulwarks all ſalvation, and her gates praiſe; when none of her ſtakes are broken down, nor any of her cords looſened; being indeed the Lord's habitation, as ſet forth <hi>Pſa.</hi> cxxxii. 13, 14, 15, 16.
<q>For the Lord hath choſen <hi>Sion:</hi> he hath deſired it for his habitation. He ſaith, This is my reſt for ever: here will I dwell, for I have deſired it. I will abundantly bleſs her proviſion: I will ſatisfy her poor with bread. I will alſo clothe her prieſts with ſalvation: and her ſaints ſhall ſhout aloud for joy.</q>

               <p>Many under our religious profeſſion diſregarding or lightly eſteeming this ſolemn covenant, and reſting in the profeſſion only, is the principal reaſon that we find divers under our name more inſenſible, harder to be reached unto and awakened by a living powerful miniſtry, than people of other religious perſuaſions. This may ſeem ſtrange to ſome, but I know it is lamentably true; having frequently felt it ſo in my goſpel labours. To me this doth not appear hard to account for, when it
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:010917_0053_0F8529FDF566BEF0"/>
is conſidered, that amongſt us there hath been diſpenſed greater abundance of ſpiritual favours, of various kinds, than amongſt any ſociety of people that I know of: which hath not proceeded from any partial regard in the Almighty towards us more than others, but the better to enable us to keep our covenant with him, in the diſcharge of that great work he hath called us to. Where any are ſo inconſiderate as to diſregard and neglect ſuch wonderful opportunities of laſting benefit and improvement, they become more hardened and impenitent than thoſe who have been more out of the way of receiving heavenly impreſſions. The portion of ſuch, unleſs they in time embrace the grace of repentance, is very diſmal to think of, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> xxix. 1.
<q>He that being often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</q>
And <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 7, 8.
<q>For the earth that drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth bleſſing from God: but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing: whoſe end is to be burned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Great indeed hath been the bounty of heaven to us as a people, both immediately, by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing influences and guidance of the Holy Spirit to all that would receive it, and alſo by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant flowing of a truly evangelical miniſtry, raiſed up and continued for the greateſt part of this laſt hundred years. But now the ſociety is much ſtript of a living ſkilful miniſtry; yet not, nor I hope ever will be, wholly deſtitute. This, through the divine bleſſing, hath been a great means of our being gathered into and preſerved a people! but many amongſt us have leaned and depended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon;
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010917_0054_0F8529FF5BAD01B8"/>
and therefore it may be, and I believe it is, conſiſtent with Divine Wiſdom, to try how the ſociety will ſtand without ſo much outward help in that way; tho' perhaps more may be afforded, in raiſing up a ſpirit for promoting found diſcipline and good order, which will prove a bleſſed means of its preſervation. And this muſt be proceeded in by the help and holy influences of the ſame Spirit, which furniſhes the beſt miniſtry. It looks as if the Lord was about to make his people ſtill more inward and ſpiritual, ſhewing them plainly, that goſpel-worſhip does not depend upon outward means.</p>
               <p>It is quite obvious that abundant preaching, praying, and ſinging, doth not bring a great part of mankind a whit nearer to heaven, nor more acquainted with God and themſelves, than they would be without it. So that it may be truly ſaid, and indeed lamented, that they ſpend their money for that which is not bread, and beſtow much labour without real profit to themſelves. With reſpect to us, the miniſtry approved hath abounded with heavenly bread, and refreſhing ſtreams of living water have flowed through the conduits and water-ſpouts to the plantation of God; and altho' many have not improved thereby, yet ſome have grown and flouriſhed. But the Lord of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard cannot be confined to any particular means for the help and preſervation of his church, tho' perhaps ſuch as he has made uſe of in time paſt; ſeeing he can make other means, unthought of by ſhort-ſighted mortals, as effectual. We may ſee he made uſe of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to fight his battles, wherein they ſeemed, in ſome ſort, to have been the cauſe and inſtruments of their <hi>own deliverance and preſervation:</hi> yet it was not always
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010917_0055_0F852A001659AE00"/>
ſo; for there are divers inſtances of his deſtroying his enemies, and working the deliverance of his people immediately by his own power. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more marvellous and aſtoniſhing, both to his people and their enemies, than the ordinary means uſually employed. Upon the whole, altho' it appears to me ſomething like a chaſtiſement, that ſo many worthy valiants have been removed, and few raiſed up in the miniſtry to ſucceed them with equal brightneſs, this may prove a trial, which, to diſcerning eyes, may fully diſtinguiſh between the profeſſor and the poſſeſſor in religion; yet I believe the true church will grow under this diſpenſation of God's dealing with his people. She will be more grounded and ſettled in that which is within the veil, <hi>viz.</hi> the holy ſanctuary and houſe of prayer. There is her place of ſafety, quite out of the reach of Satan's transformations.</p>
               <p>An holy, awful, ſilent waiting before God, is ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s abiding in their tent, where no divination nor enchantment can prevail againſt them. This is exceeding beautiful, reaching, and convincing to all, whoſe ſpiritual eyes are in degree opened, when they ſee the things, as ſet forth <hi>Numb.</hi> xxiv. 5, 6, 7.
<q>How goodly are thy tents, O <hi>Jacob!</hi> and thy tabernacles, O <hi>Iſrael!</hi> as the vallies are they ſpread forth, as gardens by the river-ſide, and as trees of lign-aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar-trees beſide the water. He ſhall pour the water out of his buckets, and his ſeed ſhall be in many waters.</q>
Oh! what wonderful encouragement have the Lord's choſen people, to abide faithful in that ſtation wherein he hath placed them, whether in ſilence or ſpeaking, doing or ſuffering, proſperity or adverſity. There is not the leaſt occaſion to be
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010917_0056_0F852A00D872AEA8"/>
aſhamed of ſilent worſhip, unleſs we are ſo naked, as to be void of a right ſenſe of what true worſhip is. Then indeed it is exceedingly contemptible, and cannot fail of rendering us more deſpicable in the eyes of mankind, than ſuch are who have a form, ornamented with man's curious invention and adorning. This muſt of neceſſity center all that are ſo unhappy in that ſtate, ſet forth by our Lord under the metaphor of,
<q>Salt that hath loſt its ſavour, which is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be caſt out, and trodden under the feet of men.</q>
Therefore all profeſſors of ſpiritual worſhip ſhould greatly fear being found in this dreadful ſtate, of the form truth leads into with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the life and power: if that is with them, it will raiſe them above contempt.</p>
               <p>In my travels for the promotion of truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ability received, which I have been engaged in through moſt parts of our ſociety, I have ſeen and painfully felt much of this ſorrowful idleneſs and inſenſibility, which has cauſed me many days and nights of morning with ſackcloth as it were underneath. I have ſeen that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from various cauſes, but principally from an over-anxiouſneſs in ſeeking after earthly things, lawful in themſelves, but direct idolatry when they have the chief place in the mind, and are made the principal treaſure thereof; which they certainly are, when moſt delighted in and thought upon. Then how can it be ſuppoſed that idolaters can worſhip the true and living God, any otherwiſe than in a mere form? With ſuch the ſeveral branches of our Chriſtian teſtimony are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe regarded than for outward decency's ſake, to keep up the form in the ſight of men. So there is a dead form, and an inſipid fruitleſs bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:010917_0057_0F852A01A76A9B50"/>
of our teſtimonies, which can never beget to God, tho' perhaps it may ſometimes beget into the form. But this brings no increaſe to the Lord's people, except of pain and diſtreſs. Viſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and immoral practices in particulars have often wounded us, and hurt the cauſe of truth; but not in ſuch a dangerous manner; becauſe, where ſound judgment and the Spirit of wholeſome diſcipline have been preſerved, theſe Things have been judged and caſt out of the Camp. But the greateſt wounds we have received have been in the houſe of our ſeeming friends, by their endeavours to maintain our principles (or at leaſt what they liked of them) worſhip, miniſtry, and diſcipline, all in that form only, which the faithful have been, and now are, livingly led into. Antichriſt has always made more havock by transforming himſelf, than by direct Violence and oppoſition. Let it be ever remembered what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<q>For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly; neither is that Circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh: but he is a Jew which is one inwardly; and circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter; whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. ii. 28, 29.</note>
                  </q>
None, I think, dare deny but it would be equally true, if the word <hi>Chriſtian</hi> was ſubſtituted in the room of the word <hi>Jew:</hi> if ſo, the form, appearance, and character may be attained without the heart-work. We read of ſome who had the form even of godlineſs, yet denied the power, tho' perhaps not in words; for to me it appears the moſt emphatical denial of it, to live and act in the form without it; as this may ſeem by practice, which ſpeaks louder than Words, to declare to mankind there is no need of the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:010917_0058_0F852A025868F278"/>
power, ſeeing they can do without it. Certain it is, thoſe who inordinately love this world, and the things of it, cannot have the Power of Godlineſs whilſt in that ſtate; as ſaith the apoſtle,
<q>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 John ii. 15.</note>

               <p>I do therefore earneſtly intreat all, into whoſe hands theſe remarks ſhall come, ſeriouſly to pauſe, and examine their own hearts without partiality, that they may ſee, before it be too late, what ſtate they are in. If by a narrow and ſtrict ſcrutiny they ſhould find that the religious ſtructure (which ſome of them have been many years in building) was not erected by the ordering and direction of Divine Wiſdom, it would be much more ſafe and prudent to have it all pulled down, ſo as that there may not be one ſtone left upon another, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundation of repentance from dead Works, and of living and powerful faith towards God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in a conſcience purified by his Blood.</p>
               <p>Theſe lines are principally intended by way of an alarm and warning to the careleſs, lukewarm and formal profeſſors. As for the ſincere, upright, humble ſeekers of and worſhippers of God, they will be eſtabliſhed upon the Rock of ages, which the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt, and reap the bleſſed Fruits of the painful travail of their ſouls before God; and in due time, if they faint not, their parched ground will become a pool, and their thirſty Lands ſprings of water: yea, through generations to come, they will enlarge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as a fountain of Gardens, wells of living water, and ſtreams from <hi>Lebanon.</hi> The beloved

                  </q>
Then will they ſay, "Let my beloved come into his Garden, and eat his pleaſant Fruits."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV. Containing Short Remarks upon the TRUE and the FALSE MINISTRY.</head>
               <p>THE prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> in a remarkable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner, ſets forth the nature of goſpel-miniſtry.
<q>And it ſhall come to paſs afterward, I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall propheſy.<note n="†" place="bottom">Joel ii. 28.</note>

<q>He that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth, ſpeaketh unto men, to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</q>
Indeed great part of this chapter is excellently employed in ſetting forth goſpel-miniſtry, and the Chriſtian liberty all have to exerciſe a right call thereunto. But let it be obſerved, the daughters were to be engaged therein, as well as the ſons, by goſpel law and rule; which was accordingly allowed and practiſed in the apoſtolic church. But where the learning and wiſdom of man hath been introduced in the place of goſpel-miniſtry, it has, directly contrary to Chriſtian liberty, wholly excluded women there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. What pride and arrogance muſt ſuch men have, who exclude all from the miniſtry but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for filthy lucre's ſake! aſſuming to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the name clergy, calling others laity; a diſtinction the true church and the holy ſcriptures

               </p>
               <p>Here is the precious comfortable language of truth indeed, and perfect goſpel liberty, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes none who have received a gift; that is, who are immediately called of God thereunto, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi>† <hi>Exod.</hi> xxviii. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxiii. 13. ſhews at large how <hi>Aaron</hi> was called, and, with his poſterity, ſeparated by the immediate appointment of God himſelf. The manner of their qualification, and how they ſhould conduct themſelves in the prieſt's office during that diſpenſation, are all recorded with that exact clearneſs and punctuality, always uſed by the Almighty towards his poor dependent creature man, when he is pleaſed to enjoin him the obſervance of any law or ordinance. Therefore no man ought to receive any thing as an ordinance of God, unleſs it appears indiſputably clear that he has commanded it; nor yet receive thoſe men who have engroſſed the miniſtry to themſelves, unleſs they appear to have better authority for their undertaking, than their being taught by human means at ſchools and colleges.</p>
               <p>But, alas! the powers of the earth enable many ſuch to take the fleece, whether they feed the flock or no: Having learned this trade, they appear as anxious how to make the moſt of it as any others. If any refuſe to receive them as the Lord's ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and conſcientiouſly forbear putting into their
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010917_0061_0F852A0493AA5510"/>
mouths, the uſual method has been to call to the magiſtrate, Help! help! and to prepare war againſt ſuch. But through the breaking forth and ariſing of the Light of Truth, they have it not in their power to make ſuch drudges of magiſtrates in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as heretofore. Neither do I think the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality are ſo much inclined to perſecution them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, eſpecially among Proteſtants, as in time paſt; but do really believe many or moſt of them abhor the ſevereſt part of it, and are men of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate principles. Their greateſt unhappineſs ſeems to be that of ſuffering intereſt to blind their eyes, and that it is ſo much for their outward advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to keep mankind from receiving the true Light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world,<note n="*" place="bottom">John i. 9.</note> leſt their craft ſhould be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by the ariſing thereof. So here the blind lead the blind,<note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. xiv. 15.</note> which expoſes both to the utmoſt hazard; yet ſuch leaders frequently deſpiſe and deride thoſe, who, from the conſtraining power and love of God, teſtify againſt their blindneſs; to whom the anſwer of our Lord to the learned Rabbies amongſt the Jews may not be unappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable:
<q>And ſome of the Phariſees which were with him heard theſe words, and ſaid unto him, Are we blind alſo? Jeſus ſaid unto them, If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no ſin: but now ye ſay we ſee; therefore your ſin remaineth.<note n="‡" place="bottom">John ix. 40.</note>

Hence the experience of many generations can teſtify, that after preaching became a gainful

But all that his miniſters were allowed to do, with reſpect to ſuch as would not receive them and their doctrine, was to ſhake off the duſt from their feet, as a teſtimony againſt them. Theſe had received the gift of the miniſtry from Chriſt; they had it without money and without Price,
<q>Freely ye have received, freely give.<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. x. 8.</note>
                  </q>
But mercenary preachers do not receive their Miniſtry freely; for they alledge, it is attended with great charge to be properly qualified for it; and therefore they muſt make an Intereſt of it again, or they ſhould be great loſers. The plain truth is, they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their miniſtry from Jeſus Chriſt; neither can they produce any evidence to prove that they have received a commiſſion from him for what they take upon them. Their uſing the Words of Chriſt and his apoſtles affords them no Authority from him; for the very worſt of men, yea the devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may do the ſame. Oh! what pity it is they ſhould pretend to be ſent of God, ambaſſadors of Chriſt, and the apoſtles ſucceſſors! when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are ſo manifeſtly unlike him and them; and have evidently the marks of the falſe prophets and hirelings we read of in the holy ſcriptures, as hath been fully proved againſt them by authors of good Account.</p>
               <p>Now let us take notice what <hi>Paul</hi> the great apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſaith upon this ſubject,
<q>Not that we are ſufficient of ourſelves to think any thing as of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:010917_0063_0F852A07578B7F10"/>
ourſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God: who alſo hath made us able miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not of the letter, but of the ſpirit: for the letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. iii. 5, 6.</note>
                  </q>
This plainly ſheweth, that miniſters in the goſpel-times were to convey the quickening Spirit of living and heavenly virtue to mankind; agreeable to <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19.
<q>Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in (or into) the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
Verſe 20.
<q>Lo, I am with you always to the end of the World.</q>
That this baptizing-teaching with the Holy Ghoſt was that practiſed in the primitive Church, appears by many paſſages in holy writ; particularly <hi>Acts</hi> x. 44.
<q>While <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake theſe words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the word.</q>
Chap. xi. ver. 15, 16. And (ſaid <hi>Peter</hi>) as I began to
<q>ſpeak, the Holy Ghoſt fell on them, as on us at the beginning. Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he ſaid, John indeed baptized with water; but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
And ſeeing the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation or God to man is the very ſame now as it was then, mankind as much involved in ſin, and eſtranged from God as they were then, and the Lord hath graciouſly promiſed to be with his miniſters always to the end of the world, no good reaſons can poſſibly be given, why the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful efficacious means are not now as eſſentially neceſſary for man's recovery, as at that time. There can be no ground for a denial of this truth, unleſs a conſciouſneſs in ſome that they have not the aſſiſtance of the Spirit in their miniſtry; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems for their intereſt, and for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:010917_0064_0F852A080C99F3C0"/>
of their credit, to perſuade mankind there is no ſuch thing to be attained now This, with many other inſtances which might be produced, plainly ſhews them to be no other than miniſters of the letter; and that, we read, only kills, when the quickening Spirit doth not accompany the preaching of it.</p>
               <p>Very judicious are the diſtinctions made by <hi>William Dell</hi> (in his Trial of Spirits both in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and hearers) between miniſters of the letter, and miniſters of the Spirit; he being himſelf a man of literature, and well acquainted with the nature of univerſity Education, as he was maſter of <hi>Gonville</hi> and <hi>Caius</hi> college in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> I ſhall juſt make a few quotations from him, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that tract, and his excellent treatiſe on bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the reader's ſerious peruſal.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And firſt, let me note an Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> but ſome will object here, If a man preach the word in the letter, even good, ſound, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox doctrine, no doubt but ſuch a man is to be heard, and he may do much good in the church, tho' he want Chriſt's Spirit: This (ſaith he) I have heard from very many who have thought they have ſaid ſomething. But to this I anſwer, That they who want Chriſt's Spirit, which is the Spirit of prophecy, tho' they preach the exact letter of the word, yet are falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and not to be heard by the ſheep." Again, "They that preach only the outward letter of the Word without the Spirit, make all things out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Church: whereas in the true king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt all things are inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and all the true religion of Chriſt is written in the ſoul and ſpirit of man by the Spirit of God; and the Believer is the only book in which
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:010917_0065_0F852A08B63E3718"/>
God himſelf writes his New Teſtament.</q>
He further ſaith,
<q>They that preach the outward letter without the Spirit, can, notwithſtanding that, both live themſelves in all the inward evils of corrupted nature, and allow others to do ſo too. Wherefore, to conclude (ſaith he) let us know that that church that hath the word, if it wants the Spirit, is antichriſt's church; and that miniſtry that uſeth the word, and wants the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is antichriſt's miniſtry; and that all works, duties, prayings, preachings, faſtings, thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without Chriſt's Spirit, are nothing but the very kingdom of antichriſt, and the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>deſolation.</hi>
                  </q>
Thus far <hi>Dell.</hi>— Oh! of what importance it is for mankind, of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination as to religion (as as well as others) deeply to ponder theſe weighty obſervations in their Hearts, eſpecially the laſt. Upon that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> x. 15. <hi>How ſhall they preach, except they be ſent? Dell</hi> farther obſerves thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>So that true preaching, comes from true ſending and this comes from the Grace of God.</q>
Not, ſay I, from the ſending of univerſities, biſhops, preſbyters, or any other man or ſet of men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or from man's intruding himſelf thereinto in his own will without a proper call; but from the conſtraining power of the everlaſting word of God laying a neceſſity, as expreſſed by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 16.
<q>For tho' I preach the Goſpel, I have nothing to glory of: for neceſſity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me if I preach not the goſpel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is of the utmoſt conſequence, towards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting truth and righteouſneſs upon the earth, that the miniſtry be preſerved according to its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal inſtitution, <hi>viz.</hi> under the immediate direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:010917_0066_0F852A09158A9A48"/>
of the Eternal Word of God, ſpeaking as the oracles of God. It is properly God's ſpeaking by his Inſtruments to the Children of men, ſuch things as he the ſearcher of hearts knows they ſtand in need of; at the ſame time opening the hearts of them to whom it belongs to receive the doctrine. Nothing but the unparallelled love and power of Chriſt can bring forth and ſupport ſuch a miniſtry. It is in the nature of things impoſſible that thoſe, ſo exerciſed therein, can have ſiniſter views of making temporal advantage to themſelves thereby. Wherever that appears, we may be aſſured the Lord hath not ſent them; and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profit the people at all.</p>
               <p>Man ſhould be ſo far from proceeding upon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt motives, for outward gain or advantage, in this important work, that even tho' good-will to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, flowing from the love of God ſhed abroad in the heart, in which ſtrong deſires may ariſe to do good, free from lucrative views of all kinds, and much beautiful goſpel-doctrine alſo may open very ſuitable, as the party may think, for the help and edification of his or her fellow-mortals, yet all this is not ſufficient to proceed upon, without the call and real gift in this ſo awful an undertaking; it being no more at the beſt than the natural conſequence of the operation of that pure love in the ſaints minds, even in ſuch as never had a call to the miniſtry: yet to ſome theſe bleſſed operations, influences, and openings, may be given, in order to prepare them for that Work which they ſhould wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently under, until the full time comes: this will be clearly ſeen, as the eye is ſingle. But there is great cauſe to believe ſome have launched out upon this Foundation only, in the Beginning of their publick appearances, whereby they have in a
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:010917_0067_0F852A0FF40E37B8"/>
ſorrowful manner brought darkneſs upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſometimes on others; having proved only miniſters of the letter, tho' perhaps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending much to have the impulſes of the Spirit. Theſe have been inſtruments of much anxiety and diſtreſs to the true church, who can favour nothing with delight, but that which comes from the power of the word of life.</p>
               <p>It may be difficult to bring true judgment over ſuch, in the preſent low ſtate of things; eſpecially when there has been a fair outſide, and nothing to blame in their morals. But it ſometimes hath fallen out, that there has been ſomething permitted to manifeſt the unſoundneſs of ſuch, and thereby to relieve the painful ſufferers under the blaſting wind of ſuch miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Inconſiderate weak perſons have intruded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into this great work; who not duly waiting for judgment to try the ſpirits, and what preſents to their minds, have been beguiled by transformations to go out in a falſe heat; and for want of the holy dread and fear upon their hearts, they have catched hold of the goſpel liberty again reſtored, (which muſt be preſerved open, leſt the Holy Spirit be quenched) <hi>viz.</hi> that all who are called to the work of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, whether male or female, may propheſy or preach one by one, that all may be edified.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 14.31.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It has been a painful ſuffering caſe to living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in ſome places, when they have ſeen that both the matter and manner of ſome could have no other tendency than to expoſe themſelves, and burden the religious ſociety, who ſuffered ſuch to aſſume an office for which they were no ways qualified. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the church hath power to order and regulate her own members; and doubtleſs ſhe may wholly
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:010917_0068_0F852A10AF035AC8"/>
refuſe and reject a miniſtry, which, upon trial, ſhe has in truth no unity with; and even ſubſtantial members in their private capacity, who have ſtood their ground well, and have large experience of the Lord's dealings, whether miniſters or others, ought, in reaſon and the nature of things, to have great weight with ſuch who have not yet made full proof of their miniſtry, nor given ſatisfaction to their friends in general, as well as to themſelves, and perhaps a few others of little judgment. Neither ought any to go abroad to exerciſe their miniſtry, until they know there is a general ſatisfaction at home therewith; not even to adjacent meetings. Some ſuch have been very poſitive and reſolute, hard to be convinced of their miſtakes, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious upon thoſe of deeper experience, but too much like that ſign of great depravity ſet forth by <hi>Iſa.</hi> iii. 5.
<q>The child ſhall behave himſelf proudly againſt the ancient, and the baſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the honourable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Great order and decency is to be preſerved in the church of God, eſpecially among the leading members, as way-marks to all. The reaſon and nature of the thing demands a proper regard and preference to age, gifts, growth, and experience; which will be always ſtrictly obſerved and paid by thoſe of right ſpirits. When it is otherwiſe, it is a ſure token of a falſe birth, and that pernicious ſelf is not ſlain. Where that predominates, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of mixing with their religious ſervices.</p>
               <p>That the hearers have a right to judge, appears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 29.
<q>Let the prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judge.</q>
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very preſuming for any to take upon them the ſole right of ſpeaking and judging too; or to impoſe that upon an auditory or church,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:010917_0069_0F852A1386092E68"/>
which they are not edified with, nor believe to proceed from the right ſpring; for the word preached doth not profit, unleſs it be mixed with faith in thoſe that hear it.</p>
               <p>I know no way to evade the force and weight of what is above obſerved, unleſs it be ſuppoſed the auditory in general are ſo void of ſpiritual underſtanding, as not to be capable of judging; which would diſcover great uncharitableneſs, and ſavour too much of arrogance. I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, if miniſtry doth not reach the Divine Witneſs in the hearts of the hearers, and cauſe them to aſſent thereunto in ſome meaſure, it will never profit them. The right miniſters have a witneſs to the truth of their miniſtry in the minds of even the rebellious; how much more ſo then in thoſe of the honeſt-hearted?</p>
               <p>The danger which there is reaſon to apprehend from the low, languid, unſkilful ſtate of many in our ſociety, hath induced me (and feeling my mind in degree warmed thereunto) to write the more cloſely concerning the nature and pernicious conſequence of a falſe miniſtry, being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the more formal and ſuperficial we as a people become, the more abundant danger there is of ſuch a miniſtry riſing, and finding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to grow and prevail; for the lifeleſs, formal profeſſors had rather have almoſt any kind of miniſtry than all ſilence. And on the other hand, a right miniſtry cannot have a free courſe, nor be exalted, where there is nothing but worldly ſpirits, clothed with a form of religion. But true miniſters muſt be like the holy prophet <hi>Ezekiel:</hi>
                  <q>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou ſhalt be dumb, and ſhalt not be to them a reprover; for they are
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:010917_0070_0F852A139D399140"/>
a rebellious houſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. iii. 26.</note>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Having made ſome Remarks upon the falſe, as well as the forward and unſkilful miniſtry, which, tho' plain and cloſe, I hope will adminiſter no hurt or diſcouragement to any truly concerned in this important work, they may (if duly obſerved) be leſſons of caution and inſtruction to thoſe for whom they are intended; and I hope alſo a ſtrength to the painfully exerciſed under the cauſes of uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs given by unſkilful intruders into the work, whether through weakneſs or wilfulneſs, that they may not be ſlack in their endeavours to regulate the ſame by plain-dealing, yet with true judgment, love, and tenderneſs; all juſtly applied where they ſeverally belong. Their taſk may ſometimes be heavy and diſcouraging, as it is hard to turn thoſe who have taken a wrong courſe, and imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves right, when it is really otherwiſe; for thoſe have been obſerved to be the moſt poſitive of any of their pretended ſight and ſenſe, yet let the weight of the ſenſe of truth, which is ſtrongeſt of all, be laid upon them from time to time, that the church may not ſuffer hurt and loſs by the omiſſion of its ſenſible members; which cannot fail of weakening and hindering the growth of ſuch members alſo in an individual capacity. I know it muſt be thoſe alive in the truth, of good underſtanding and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein (and no other) that are qualified to help and direct thoſe who have miſſed their way in a religious ſenſe; agreeable to <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 1.
<q>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering thyſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted;</q>
and not the captious, critical,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:010917_0071_0F852A147015AD58"/>
worldly-wiſe; for they have nothing to do to act in the church of Chriſt, until they are firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to and taught of the Lord themſelves.</p>
               <p>The main point, in my apprehenſion, is to be able to form a true judgment of the ſource or ſpring from whence miniſtry proceeds; and if found to be right in the ground, a great deal of tenderneſs is to be uſed, and much childiſh weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to be patiently borne with. For altho' ſome through fear, and a deep ſenſe of the weight of ſo important an undertaking, may (at firſt) ſpeak very ſtammeringly, and with conſiderable perturbation, yet the ſweet efficacy of the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening powerful Spirit, which is felt with them in their ſervice (by thoſe who are circumciſed in heart and ear) far exceeds the fineſt eloquence without it. Such ſhould be prudently encouraged, yet ſuffered to feel their own feet. There are but few children, however hopeful, that can bear much nurſing and applauſe. Oh! the great hurt which hath been done by the forward affectionate part in ſome, labouring to bring forth divers before the right time, and by puſhing on others too faſt, who in their beginning were lively and very hopeful, to their great hurt and loſs. Oh! then, what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and care ſhould be exerciſed, clearly to ſee in the true light what to lay hold of, and what to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage in this important reſpect.</p>
               <p>I now intend to conclude this head with ſome plain honeſt hints, which have ariſen from mine own experience and obſervation concerning the true miniſtry, as it hath been reſtored again through divine mercy for about this laſt hundred years, in greater ſimplicity and purity than has been known (as I apprehend) ſince the apoſtles days. This hath not been conducted with the inticing words
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:010917_0072_0F852A1529A5ED20"/>
of man's wiſdom, but in ſuch a demonſtration of the Spirit and Power of God, as hath (tho' much deſpiſed by the learned Rabbies) been a great bleſſing to this and other nations; many thouſands having been thereby turned to Chriſt their true and ſaving teacher, whom they embraced joyfully, as the alone beloved of their ſouls. A great number of Churches were gathered to ſit down as under the ſhadow of the wings of the prince of Peace. Great was the Lord their God in the midſt of them; their miniſters were clothed with ſalvation, and their feet ſhod with the preparation of the goſpel of peace. Many then ran to and fro, and the true knowledge of God was increaſed. The Lord gave the word, and many, both male and female, were the publiſhers of it. And through divine mercy it may yet be ſaid tho' the declenſion in practice is great in many) that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable body preſerved, to bear the ark of the teſtimony of the Lord their God as upon their ſhoulders, in the ſight of the people, with their feet as in the bottom of <hi>Jordan;</hi> and a living powerful miniſtry is yet continued, tho' far ſhort of the number formerly engaged in that work. For many have grown up amongſt us, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more ſuperficial and eaſy about poſſeſſing the ſubſtance of religion than their anceſtors were. Such have relied too much on the miniſtry, and have not profited in religion thereby. But they have greatly declined in practice, under abundant favours of this kind, the miniſtry becoming to many as a pleaſant ſong. They hear the words with pleaſure, but do them not; their heart going ſtill after their covetouſneſs of one kind or another. Therefore the Lord hath ſeen meet to ſtrip the ſociety very much in that reſpect; and alſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:010917_0073_0F852A15E6C37258"/>
many of thoſe who are true miniſters, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to lead the people, by example, into ſilence. O! bleſſed will all thoſe ſervants be, who are preſerved, diſcerningly and with true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to adminiſter proper food, and that in due ſeaſon, whether in ſilence or words, doing or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with and for Chriſt! Which doubtleſs all will, who look with a ſingle eye to God's honour above all things attending upon the gift received, which in its operations and requirings is ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. None that wait aright upon God will ever be confounded; that belongs to <hi>Babylon;</hi> but peace and infallible certainty is known through all the borders of <hi>Sion.</hi> Every one who knows <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a quiet habitation, is at no loſs to underſtand his proper allotment of ſervice therein, unleſs he falls into the conferring with fleſh and blood; then he comes to the confuſion and uncertainty, wherein he may fret and toil in vain. But in the holy awful ſtill waiting upon God in a ſanctified heart, which is the temple wherein Chriſt dwells, and our houſe of prayer, there Satan can never come to deceive us, or to endanger our ſafety.</p>

               <p>ON every glory there ſhall be a defence— That God intended to eſtabliſh an excellent government, order, and diſcipline in the church, under the goſpel diſpenſation, appears from divers paſſages of the prophets in the Old Teſtament, who ſaw into and wonderfully deſcribed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

ſtate; a few of which I ſhall inſtance. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xxxii. 1.
<q>Behold a king ſhall reign in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and princes ſhall rule in judgment.</q>
Chap. xxxiii. 5, 6.
<q>The Lord is exalted: for he dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on high, he hath filled <hi>Zion</hi> with judgment and righteouſneſs; and wiſdom and knowledge ſhall be the ſtability of thy times, and ſtrength of ſalvation.</q>
Chap. xxviii. 5, 6.
<q>In that day ſhall the Lord of hoſts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of his people: and for a ſpirit of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him that ſitteth in judgment, and for ſtrength to them that turn the battle to the gate.</q>
Our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 15, 16, 17, 18. clearly directs his followers how to proceed in the exerciſe of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and good order, both with reſpect to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, and to the church; he aſſured them, that whatſoever of this kind is done <hi>under divine direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon earth, ſhall be ratified and confirmed in heaven, Chap. xix. 28. he promiſes ſuch who have followed him in the regeneration, that they ſhall be exalted in his Kingdom, ſitting upon thrones to judge and govern his people. We find among the eminent gifts of the Spirit, <hi>Paul</hi> reckons <hi>helps in government,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 28. In chap. the 5th, he blames that church very highly for their neglect of practiſing ſound judgment in the way of diſcipline, ſhewing them the neceſſity of putting thoſe guilty of corrupt practices out of the community, leſt as a leaven they ſhould affect the whole lump. Verſ. 11. he points out how unſafe it was for the Lord's people to have any ſociety with the workers of iniquity. Verſ. 12, and 13. that it is the church's duty to judge thoſe that are within, <hi>viz.</hi> her own members, leaving the judging of thoſe that are
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:010917_0075_0F852A1760A6DF18"/>
without to God. In chap. the 6th, he blames them as ſharply for going to law one with another before the unjuſt, ſhewing that it would have been better they had ſuffered themſelves to have been defrauded, and that every matter of difference or controverſy ſhould be judged and determined by the church, in regard to its own members.</p>
               <p>A religious ſociety, gathered by God's power, who have received diverſities of gifts and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, are conſidered as a body properly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by their holy head (who is perfect in wiſdom) that it may well exiſt by pure laws, rules, and comely orders, both within and without; for the maintaining whereof every member hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per office and ſtation wherein it is to act, yet <hi>only by the guidance of the Holy Head,</hi> who is known ever to preſide over his humble dependent people, a preſent help in the needful time, ſupplying all their wants, as they wait his time.</p>
               <p>Pertinent to this is <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 15, 16.
<q>But ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chriſt, from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint ſupplieth, according to the effectual working in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of every part, maketh increaſe of the body, unto the edifying of itſelf in love.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. with great ſtrength of reaſon and perſpicuity, ſheweth the diverſities of gifts, differences of adminiſtrations and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all by the ſame Spirit, who worketh in all as he will; that notwithſtanding this variety, all, and of all ſorts, are baptized into one body, and made to drink into one Spirit; he ſays, verſ. 14. "For the body is not one member, but many;" and ſheweth they are all uſeful to and dependent
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:010917_0076_0F852A18248AB4B0"/>
upon one another, therefore none have a right to apprehend ſuch a ſelf-ſufficiency, as to be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of other members; nay, that thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body, which ſeem to be more feeble, are uſeful. The near union, harmony, and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of this glorious body, is ſet forth in verſe 26.
<q>And whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; or one member be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, all the members rejoice with it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For brevity's ſake, I forbear at preſent making more quotations on this ſubject. Theſe are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to demonſtrate fully the ſtrong obligation all baptized members are under, rightly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their places in the body, and to come up in a faithful diſcharge of their duty therein, as in the ſight of God, to whom they muſt be accountable. And it likewiſe appears that every member, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as ſuch by his or her voluntary conſent, is ſtrictly bound to keep and maintain the eſtabliſhed rules of that body; the breach of which not only renders him or her guilty in God's ſight, but alſo accountable to the body. It alſo behoves this body, immediately upon the tranſgreſſion of its rules and orders, to exert itſelf in dealing with tranſgreſſors, and to adminiſter ſound judgment, in order to reſtore them; or, on failure of ſucceſs in that, to diſown or refuſe to have unity with ſuch, and to let the world know they are not of their body; that the reputation thereof may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt thoſe which are without, as well as for its own peace and ſafety within; ſeeing by a neglect hereof, others may be infected by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt member, and his evil may ſpread in the body like a leproſy; but that which is the moſt affecting, the Lord may be provoked to withdraw from that body which neglects the exerciſe of true judgment
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:010917_0077_0F852A18DE31BC80"/>
againſt evil; as in the caſe of <hi>Achan, Joſhua</hi> vii. and alſo that of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin, Judges</hi> xix. and xx.</p>
               <p>It is too obvious to be denied, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, by loſing the power and life of religion, loſt the true ſpirit of diſcipline and good order in their churches. Inſtead of which, they have ſubſtituted rules, orders, and canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of their own invention, principally calculated to ſupport that power by which the clergy (ſo called) got their wealth, and by which they have procured them to be enforced where they judged neceſſary by human law. The preſent ſtate of church government appears to be truly deplorable, amongſt moſt of the divided parts of Chriſtian profeſſors that I know of; conſequently they are in a very corrupted ſtate, greatly lacking that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteouſneſs which was to fill <hi>Sion,</hi> and the wiſdom and knowledge which was predicted would be the ſtability of her times.</p>

                  <q>As amongſt thoſe that are ſure that God beholds what they do (ſays <hi>Tertullian</hi>) this is one of the higheſt preludiums and forerunners of the judgment to come, when the delinquent is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the communion,</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Athenagoras</hi> told the emperors, that no Chriſtian could be a bad man, unleſs he was an hypocrite; and <hi>Tertullian</hi> openly declares, that when men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the diſcipline of the goſpel, they ſo far ceaſe amongſt us to be accounted Chriſtians. <hi>Cave,</hi> page 95.</p>
               <p>When at any time invited to publick ſolemnities, as marriages and the like, the prudence of the church thought fit to lay reſtraints upon them, and to forbid them light and ludicrous actions, as leaping and dancing; but that they ſhould dine and ſup gravely and modeſtly, as becomes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for which he quotes a council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> 2d part, p. 73.</p>
               <p>They took notice of all offences againſt the Chriſtian law, any vice or immorality that was either publick in itſelf, or made known and made good to the church. For (ſays <hi>Cave</hi>) the holy and good Chriſtians of thoſe times were infinitely careful to keep the honour of their religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted, to ſtifle every ſin in its birth, and by bringing offenders to publick ſhame and penalty, to keep them from propagating the malignant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a bad example. For this reaſon they watched over one another, told them privately of their faults and failures, and when that would not do, brought them before the cognizance of the church. It is needleſs (ſays he) to reckon up par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

crimes, when none were ſpared. <hi>Cave</hi> 3d part, p. 406. Agreeable to the nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the church, which as it tranſacts only in ſpiritual matters, ſo it could inflict no other than ſpiritual cenſures and chaſtiſements, p. 408. The common and ſtanding penalty they made uſe of was excommunication, or ſuſpenſion from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the church; the cutting off and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out an offending perſon, an infected member, till by repentance and wholeſome diſcipline he was cured and reſtored; and then he was re-admitted into church ſociety, p. 410.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cave</hi> relates, upon the authority of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> that this manner of diſcipline was commonly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed amongſt the ancient Druids, who, when any of the people became irregular and diſorderly, they preſently ſuſpended them from their ſacrifices; and thoſe thus ſuſpended were accounted in the number of the moſt impious and execrable perſons: all men ſtood off from them, ſhunned their company and converſe as an infection and plague, p. 411.</p>
               <p>Penitents, before they were received into unity, made open confeſſion of their faults; this being accounted the very ſpring of repentance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they concluded it could not be real.

and therefore without this neither riches nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would procure any admiſſion into the church: a remarkable inſtance whereof was in the emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great, who, for his bloody and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ſlaughter of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> was by <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> biſhop of <hi>Milan</hi> ſuſpended, brought to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick confeſſion, and forced to undergo a ſevere courſe of penance for eight months together; at length, after he had paſſed through abundance of

ſorrow, with tears and great lamentation for his ſin, he was admitted into fellowſhip again, p. 418, 419. So wiſely (ſays <hi>Cave</hi>) did the prudence and piety of thoſe times deal with offenders, neither lettting the reins ſo looſe, as to patronize preſumption, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any to ſin; nor yet holding them ſo ſtrait, as to drive men into deſpair, p. 429.</p>
               <p>Very forward and active have profeſſors been, and ſtill are, in heaping up offerings, by perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they call religious duties, whilſt practical virtue has been ſhamefully neglected. Multitudes profeſſing faith in Chriſt, and accounted members of his church, are ſuffered to remain without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul or rebuke in various ſins and pollutions, to the great ſcandal of the Chriſtian name; ſo that it may be ſaid iniquity runs down amongſt them like a mighty ſtream or torrent, carrying all in a manner before it. What painful apprehenſions muſt fill the minds of thoughtful parents reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their offspring, when, morally ſpeaking, no other can be expected than that they will be carried away thereby to everlaſting deſtruction! Oh! that it were rightly conſidered by all Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that obedience is better than ſacrifices or offerings, and to hearken unto the voice of God, in putting away the evil of their doings from before his eyes, is better than the fat of rams. To what purpoſe is the multitude of their ſacrifices or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, whilſt the moſt weighty matters of the law of God are neglected? <hi>viz.</hi> judgment, mercy, and faith; even that faith which is productive of good works. Let them carefully ponder in their hearts what the Lord by his prophet hath declared, <hi>Amos</hi> v. 21, 22, 23, 24.
<q>I hate, I deſpiſe your feaſt-days, and I will not ſmell in your ſolemn aſſemblies. Tho' ye offer me burnt-offerings,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:010917_0081_0F852A1BD7965098"/>
and your meat-offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beaſts. Take thou away from me the noiſe of thy ſongs, for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. But let judgment run down as waters, and righteouſneſs as a mighty ſtream.</q>
Man is apt to begin at the wrong end, or where he ſhould finiſh; preſuming to perform worſhip and ſervice to his Maker before he is in a fit condition to be accepted; as a Being of infinite purity will not ſo much as look towards him in that ſenſe, whilſt he hath any fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, either in himſelf or others. For the Lord will be ſanctified in all them that come nigh him. He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity with any aſſent or approbation. The contrary of which would be implied, if man was ſuffered to preſent his offerings whilſt in a defiled ſtate. The ſame that I have here ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the acceptance or non-acceptance of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, is true, and will hold good, in regard to churches, and countries or nations. Oh, then! how greatly it behoves all who would ſtand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in God's ſight, to exert their utmoſt care and diligence in judging, condemning, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing evil of all kinds, firſt in themſelves, and then in every branch of the community, as far as lies in their power.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſhew, that when the Lord was pleaſed to reſtore Chriſtianity in its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive purity and power, which was in the laſt century, church-government, good order, and wholeſome diſcipline was alſo reſtored amongſt an humble, ſelf-denying people, who were, as God's people in all ages have been, much deſpiſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, and perſecuted. Yet, through all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh

rage of their adverſaries, the riſing up of the rulers of the earth againſt them, and the people imagining vain things concerning them, their bands were not broken, nor their cords caſt away. They ſaw holineſs was the Lord's delight, and promoted it with all diligence amongſt mankind in general, but more eſpecially amongſt themſelves. The Lord, who at firſt raiſed choſen inſtruments, and ſent them forth into the world, which was as a briary thorny wilderneſs, wonderfully bleſſed their ardent labours with increaſe, ſo that in a few years a large number of churches were planted (even amidſt all the rage and fury before-mentioned) and quietly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and eſtabliſhed under the teachings of his Spirit in their hearts. Hereby they grew up in wiſdom and ſtature, and in proceſs of time clearly ſaw, in the Divine Light, that they muſt form themſelves into an orderly body, to be governed under ſuch regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as would put them in the beſt capacity, as a religious ſociety, of glorifying God, and being the moſt uſeful to one another, as members of the ſame body; and that alſo, by being embodied and diſciplined as an army with banners, they might make a firm ſtand againſt every appearance of evil, with their united ſtrength, under the Captain of their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Divine wiſdom was wonderfully with thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies firſt ſent and engaged in this bleſſed work, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their ſteps with true judgment, as well as opening the minds of a numerous people, of various growths, to receive the manner and form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and order, which thoſe of the cleareſt ſight diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, in the Light of Truth, to be beſt adapted to promote the glory of God, and the preſervation of his church and people. Yet there were ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers (as in the primitive times) even of their own
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:010917_0083_0F852A1D5F75F098"/>
body or ſociety; men of perverſe ſpirits, who trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the church for a time with litigious jangling, and corrupt diſputations. But the Lord, who knows how to put a ſtop to the rage and cunning devices of the enemies of his church, brought a blaſt upon them, which hath expoſed the names of the leaders, and will continue to expoſe them through ages and generations to come. Thus the faithful were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to carry on this great work, deſigned for the defence and preſervation of God's people, in defiance of all thoſe <hi>Sanballats, Tobiahs,</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhems,</hi> which were permitted to riſe up againſt them and their godly undertaking.</p>
               <p>Great wiſdom may be diſcerned by thoſe eyes only which the Lord hath opened, in his thus rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and placing his people, that they might ſtand in ſuch a ſituation as to be really true help-mates in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord and holy head; the ſtrong bearing and helping the infirmities of the weak, ſupporting one another in that which is good, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down all of a contrary nature to it, in every rank and ſtation; none daring to be above admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, but rather eſteeming it a mark of love and ſincere regard, that others extend care over them; agreeable to 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 12, 13, 14.
<q>And we beſeech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you; and to eſteem them very highly in love for their work's ſake: and be at peace among yourſelves. Now we exhort you, brethren warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, ſupport the weak, be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient toward all men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What an inexpreſſible favour it is to be even one of the leaſt members of this body, or branch of the heavenly Father's family, where ſo great help and

edification may be received from thoſe of greater growth and maturity than themſelves. On the other hand, what high ſatisfaction it affords the fathers and mothers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to ſee the children and weaklings of the flock of teachable diſpoſitions, and carefully endeavouring to walk according to the truth. Some are made of God as ſaviours upon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and as watchmen upon her walls, anointed and appointed by the Holy Ghoſt, to watch over the flock of Chriſt, as thoſe that muſt give an account, whoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſervices may juſtly entitle them to the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that copious elegant language, wherewith <hi>Job</hi> ſets forth what he had done in the time of his proſperity, <hi>Job</hi> xxix. 13, 14, 15, 16.
<q>The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me; and I cauſed the widow's heart to ſing for joy. I put on righteouſneſs, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. I was a father to the poor: and the cauſe which I knew not I ſearched out.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Elders ruling thus in the church are indeed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double honour, whether they labour in the word and doctrine or not; being ſuch as, agreeable to <hi>Peter</hi>'s advice, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 2, 3, 4.
<q>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof, not by conſtraint, but willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being enſamples to the flock. And when the chief ſhepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is of the utmoſt conſequence, that the members, who conſtitute the church of Chriſt, be thoroughly acquainted with the true ſpring of motion and action therein, leſt any ſhould preſumptuouſly conceive
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010917_0085_0F852A1ED59285A0"/>
or imagine, that ſeeing church government carries much the appearance of outward oeconomy and civil proceedings, human abilities, natural and acquired, are ſufficient to manage the ſame. If any fall into ſuch a dangerous error, it muſt be for want of duly conſidering the nature of the work to be engaged in; it being no other than what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the ſpiritual kingdom of Chriſt, and the promotion thereof on earth: which kingdom man by nature cannot ſee nor underſtand.<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. iii. 3.</note> And it is written, "the world by wiſdom knew not God.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. i. 21.</note>" Therefore they cannot know his kingdom, nor how to act properly therein, under the Supreme Head, whom they know not.</p>
               <p>To be capable of acting rightly in the diſcipline of the church, man muſt be born of the Spirit, or from above, and receive a qualification from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt for that work. Such are the only qualified perſons for maintaining good order in the churches, whether young, old, or middle-aged, male or female, and ſhould be regarded as thoſe who are ſet over others in the Lord. Theſe are ſeen and eſteemed highly in love for their work's ſake, by the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the church, tho' they may be of a low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; yet, being alive in the truth, they can ſavour the things that be of God, conveyed to them through theſe favoured inſtruments; and alſo reject the things which be of men, when intruded into God's work; becauſe the innocent life raiſed up in them is burthened and grieved therewith.</p>
               <p>Nothing can more afflict the ſouls of ſuch, than the darkening counſel by a multitude of words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge. We may ſee none were properly qualified to judge and govern outward <hi>Iſrael,</hi> unleſs gifted of God for that purpoſe. We find they were
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:010917_0086_0F852A1F95ACD400"/>
to have God for their king; and thoſe whom he raiſed up by his immediate power, to be their judges under him, (herein a perfect pattern of the chriſtian church) until they impiouſly rejected a government, than which none could be attended with more eaſe, ſecurity, and comfort, that they might be like other nations, that is, to be more left to their own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and policy, and to be leſs dependent upon God. Whilſt they looked to the Lord for judgment, aid, and protection, ſee how wonderfully he provided for them, <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and in the wilderneſs. To the help of whom the Lord alſo raiſed a large number of inferior judges, upon whom he put his Spirit, as an eſſential qualification.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>It would be needleſs to be very particular, in ſhewing how the Lord was pleaſed to raiſe many, and to put his Spirit upon them, under the bleſſed influence and ſtrength whereof they wrought won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the reformation, deliverance, and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people: as <hi>Joſhua, Othniel, Deborah,</hi> and <hi>Barak, Gideon, Jephthah, Samuel, David, Solomon, Nehemiah,</hi> &amp;c. and when the people per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of God was upon them, they joined ſuch with alacrity in God's work, out of faithful ſubjection to that of God in and upon them, and not to them as men.</p>

               <p>Pertinent hereunto is the ardent concern raiſed in <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s mind for the welfare of God's people and city; the deep anguiſh of his ſoul (though in the midſt of worldly affluence;) his earneſt and humble prayer to God; the manner of addreſſing king <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> upon that mournful occaſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſolate ſtate of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and his whole proceeding in that godly undertaking of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the walls of that city, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Much might be wrote to ſhew the great analogy hereof with the maintaining of the hedge, or wall of diſcipline and good order in the Chriſtian church, as a defence from dangerous enemies; but I hope, as the Light of Truth has mercifully ariſen, and people's minds are conſiderably illuminated thereby, there is not ſo much neceſſity (eſpecially amongſt us) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them in general what is truth in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as to remind them of their duty, that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice may keep pace with knowledge; for which end ſhort hints may in a good degree anſwer.</p>
               <p>I might alſo draw much more from the precious doctrine and experience of God's people, recorded in holy writ, concurring to eſtabliſh the truth of what I have advanced concerning the outward order, government, and beautiful diſcipline of the church, which is the kingdom of Chriſt, wherein the ſanctified of God are as ſubordinate kings and prieſts; which is thus expreſſed, <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 21, 22.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> calls this dominion the ſaints are to poſſeſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> iii. 10. "Principalities and powers in heavenly places." Oh! long hath this wicked horn had the rule and government where the ſaints ſhould! ſo that there hath been little or nothing of the nature of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent government which is found in the kingdom of Chriſt. There hath been no true viſion from the prophets, the law hath periſhed from the prieſts, and counſel from the ancients, <hi>Ezek.</hi> vii. 26. and the glorious kingdom of the Meſſiah has for many ages been as it were baniſhed from the earth, or at leaſt hid from mankind in general, as in a wilderneſs, whereinto the true church fled, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. 6. But the Lord hath been pleaſed in a good degree to reſtore again the excellent order of his houſe amongſt a deſpiſed people; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom I ſhall now endeavour to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, by way of ſhort hints, of what mine eyes have ſeen, mine ears heard, what I have taſted and handled of the good word of life in their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; more particularly as I am now upon that ſubject, thoſe, according to their degrees of ſubordination (as the wiſdom from above hath placed them) called meetings for diſcipline, or church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and government: which meetings I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with diligence, as I thought it my indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty, for about thirty years of my time: near the firſt ten whereof I was for the moſt part an highly pleaſed and comforted ſpectator of the ſweet harmony and comely order of God's houſe,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:010917_0089_0F852A24B6908180"/>
the love, ſympathy, and care extended in each branch thereof one towards another; in ſilent ſeeking the aſſiſtance of the Holy Head, that the body might edify itſelf in love, and the King of ſaints be known to rule all that was within us. For when we become members of Chriſt's body, we ceaſe to conſider ourſelves as individuals only, but alſo as members deeply intereſted in the welfare of the body. Here is an united labour and travail, being all in one common intereſt.</p>
               <p>I have often beheld the awful Majeſty of the Divine Power amongſt theſe people, and could ſay in humble admiration, at leaſt in my heart,

There has been no lack of any good thing in the camp of God. The glorious Lord hath been indeed as places of broad rivers and ſtreams, where can no galley with oars, neither ſhall gallant ſhip paſs thereby. For the Lord was our judge, the Lord was our law-giver, the Lord was our king, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxxiii. 21, 22. and therefore all the ſplendid art and invention of man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, was to be wholly laid aſide, as <hi>Saul</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was by <hi>David,</hi> being concerned to go as he did, in the name (<hi>viz.</hi> the power and dread) of the moſt High. When I did thus ſtand ſtill, looking upon <hi>Sion,</hi> viewing her beauty and excellency, I have ſeen great things done by mean inſtruments going forth againſt their enemies in the name of the Lord only; which hath cauſed my ſoul to be knit unto them, and I loved them as mine own ſoul. This ſight and ſenſe of things made me exceeding awful in my mind, afraid to ſpeak and act, unleſs I found a well-grounded aſſurance that the Lord
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:010917_0090_0F852A25A322B0A0"/>
required it of me; by feeling the weight of his divine power upon my ſpirit, opening my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and guiding my judgment, that I might clearly know what when, and how to ſpeak in the awful preſence of God, and before the princes of his people, whoſe words I obſerved, were as goads, and as nails faſtened by the maſter of our aſſemblies, which are given from one ſhepherd.</p>
               <p>Very pertinent to what I am now upon is <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> v. 1, 2, 3. and what indeed ought to take deep impreſſion on all thoſe concerned, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of fools: for they conſider not that they do evil. Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: for God is in heaven, and thou art upon earth, therefore let thy words be few. For a dream cometh through a multitude of buſineſs, and a fool's voice is known by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of words.</q>
It is plain from what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted, and much more in holy writ, that all the power and wiſdom of man, till it be ſubjected, ſanctified, and properly influenced by a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural principle, is wholly excluded from and ſhut out of the church of God. Although thoſe abilities are adequate to, and ſufficient for, the things of a man. <hi>viz.</hi> the concerns of this life; (for, as ſaith our Lord, the children of this world are wiſer in their generation than the children of light) yet the things of God no man can know, conſequently cannot rightly act in them, but by his Spirit. This alſo in part appears from what <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> xxxii, 7, 8, 9.
<q>I ſaid, Days ſhould ſpeak, and multitude of years ſhould teach wiſdom. But there is a ſpirit in man: and the

inſpiration of the Almighty giveth them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Great men are not always wiſe: neither do the aged underſtand judgment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Very great hath been, and ſtill is, the loſs of man, for want of deeply underſtanding this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant point. Giving a latitude to human abilities in religion, and the concerns thereof, hath opened the door wide for antichriſt to become almoſt an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal monarch. It is that by which he hath got great footing amongſt all the diviſions of Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors; ours in a ſorrowful manner with reſpect to individuals, as well as others; yet a living body are preſerved. Theſe, through the divine bleſſing, prevent his taking poſſeſſion of the church, as he has done of others. The eyes and cry of theſe are to the Lord, whom they know to be their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency; and that unleſs he ordain ſalvation as walls and bulwarks to keep our city, in vain are all human endeavours.</p>
               <p>When I have conſidered the low, indifferent, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid ſtate of thoſe under our name in many places, both in this and other nations, chiefly occaſioned by an inordinate love of the world, and the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, my ſoul hath been deeply humbled in awful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration before him; when I have beheld his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condeſcenſion, in ſtill ſhining forth upon us, as from between the cherubims of his glory, waiting to be gracious, by turning again the captivity of many of his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſeeking to rebuild her waſte places, and thereby to revive her ancient beauty. He is pleaſed to continue unto us ſome judges as at the firſt, and counſellors as at the beginning, <hi>tho' but few in number</hi> when compared to the bulk.

               <p>Oh! how ſorrowful it is, in this and other nations, for the Lord's meſſengers to view the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of unfaithfulneſs in large numbers, in moſt branches of our Chriſtian teſtimony! much whereof hath been greatly owing to the laxneſs of diſcipline. Thoſe who ſhould have been, above all other conſiderations, waiting for freſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ability from God to build his houſe, have been moſt of all endeavouring to build themſelves and poſterity uncertain houſes in earthly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances; living at eaſe in their cieled houſes, whilſt the ark of the teſtimony of God hath been expoſed.</p>
               <p>Dreadful will the account be ſuch will have to render, who have hid their Lord's money in the earth, having wrapped it in a napkin, <hi>viz.</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent form of religion. The Lord hath opened eyes that ſee them through their fig-leaf covering in moſt or all the ranks of his people; though it is much to be feared they have cloſed their own eyes, except towards the world. In <hi>that</hi> they may be clear ſighted, it being their kingdom. Some of theſe may preſume from their long profeſſion, wherein perhaps they have taken care (as far as
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:010917_0093_0F852A2E5FFCE760"/>
appears to man's eye) to preſerve a reputation free from ſpots or blemiſhes; and they alſo having a pretty large ſtock of wealth, in the getting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they may have not only dried up the tenderneſs of religion in themſelves, but alſo have laid a foundation for the ruin of their children, or thoſe that ſucceed them in their poſſeſſions; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, ſome ſuch may take upon them to be active members in the meetings where they belong. Very lamentable indeed are the ſtates of meetings, managed by ſuch unſanctified ſpirits. The king of <hi>Sion</hi> is baniſhed from their councils; and the precious ſons and daughters thereof are but as ſuffering witneſſes for God, clothed as in ſackcloth; and the ſeed of God, which ſhould have dominion in all our meetings, is depreſſed. I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely wiſh there were no cauſe for theſe cloſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks; a caution of this kind may be neceſſary. This ſpirit getting in amongſt us, in any part of the body or ſociety, cannot fail of laying waſte; therefore let all conſider what ſpirit rules in them. Where ſuch a ſpirit prevails, it is not the wiſe woman building the houſe, but the fooliſh woman pulling it down with her own hand.</p>
               <p>It is a mournful truth, that among the many thouſands of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there are but few, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, who really ſtand quite upright, as pillars in God's houſe, who cannot be at all warped by fear, intereſt, favour, or affection, but look beyond all ſingly at truth and righteouſneſs. Oh! what mean cringing, ſtooping, and temporizing, is to be found in ſome! It is my ſon, daughter, near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or friend, that I am loth to offend, leſt I ſhould ſuffer in my intereſt or reputation, or ſhall gain his or her ill will. This ſpirit will never dwell on high, but muſt have its portion amongſt
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:010917_0094_0F852A30CCC66A90"/>
the fearful and the unbelieving; and unleſs ſuch repent, they will be ranked with thoſe that deny Chriſt before men. They may read their portion, <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 9. True zeal and ſound judgment is often rejected by this ſort, whether it comes from individuals, or meetings; nay even by ſome, when it is the mature reſult of the largeſt body under the direction of the beſt wiſdom, if they do not find it agree with their unſanctified underſtandings; which would be ſtrange if it ſhould, as it comes from the ſpirit of Truth.</p>
               <p>It may be further obſerved, that thoſe whoſe principal view is only maintaining the form or outward character in religion, feel very little or no pain on account of the diſorderly practices of their fellow-members, and therefore they can eaſily daub with untempered morter, and ſmooth all over, crying peace, before judgment has laid hold of the tranſgreſſing part, and all this done under the ſpecious pretence of charity and Chriſtian tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yet when any in godly zeal are conſtrained to ſhew the pernicious conſequence of healing the wounds of the daughter of <hi>Sion</hi> deceitfully, ſome ſuch ſoon diſcover they are too much ſtrangers to true charity, by their oppoſition to ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thoſe exerciſed therein, that the wounds might be ſearched to the bottom. Here ſomething of a perſecuting ſpirit appears, and the bitter leaven of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> is diſcovered, ſtriking at the life of religion. But, agreeable to the uſual craft of antichriſt, they muſt call a godly concern and labour by a contrary name, or they could not ſmite at it with any colour of reaſon. Such honeſt labourers have ſometimes been repreſented as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, too hot in their zeal, diſturbers of the church's peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When there is a peace in the church with wrong things, it is much better
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:010917_0095_0F852A30E989BA60"/>
broke than kept. I take it that it was in this ſenſe our Lord ſaid:
<q>I came not to ſend peace on earth, but a ſword.<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. x. 34.</note>
                  </q>
It was a woeful peace to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they became ſo reconciled to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the land, as to ſuffer them to dwell therein, contrary to the expreſs command of God!</p>
               <p>When the upright in heart cannot for <hi>Sion</hi>'s ſake hold their peace, their ſpirits being truly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened to ſearch <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is very dangerous for any to obſtruct, oppoſe, or even to diſcourage them in ſuch a godly undertaking. The voice of their Almighty Helper is,
<q>Touch not mine anointed;</q>
for he will certainly vindicate his own cauſe in their hands, and will recompence any injury done to it, or them, as if done to himſelf; ſo that all had need to know well what they do, and what ſpirit bears rule within them.</p>
               <p>Some I have obſerved very blind, fruitleſs, and unſkilful, who are not quite upon the ſame bottom as thoſe above-mentioned, but who differ from them in the cauſe of their unfruitful ſituation, which ariſes chiefly from a groſs deception in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and for want of abiding in that wherein they could try the ſpirit that preſents things to their minds. Theſe have been moved and kindled by a falſe fire, and a zeal not duly tempered with that knowledge which comes from God. This proves a ſore wounding to the cauſe of truth, where it hath prevailed; very hard to judge down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is commonly very wiſe and right in its own eyes. In concluding this head, I am free to expreſs an ardent prayer, which hath filled mine heart at times for a conſiderable number of years, that the Lord may be graciouſly pleaſed greatly to increaſe the number of thoſe amongſt us, who are made willing to leave all, and to follow the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:010917_0096_0F852A3199129C10"/>
gentle leadings of his Spirit, whitherſoever he is pleaſed to lead them; who prefer the welfare, peace, and proſperity of the city of God to their chiefeſt joy; that truth and righteouſneſs may be ſo exalted in every part of the body, as to make all the ſinners in <hi>Sion</hi> afraid indeed: for they cannot ſtand in judgment when the Lord ariſes in majeſty among his ſaints, nor in the congregations of the righteous; that ſo for very ſhame there might be a caſting their idols of ſilver, and their idols of gold, to the moles and to the bats. <hi>Iſa.</hi> ii. 20.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of what is before ſignified, is doubtleſs, and hath been, the fervent travail of many brethren and ſiſters, who are deeply affected with the preſent lethargy which prevails, yet are in the midſt thereof comforted in obſerving great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of a concern, in moſt places, for ſtirring up and provoking one another to love and to good works; particularly in promoting diſcipline: which if it proſpers (as I believe it will) truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs will prevail thereby, and <hi>Sion</hi> will enlarge her borders, her cords will be lengthened, and her ſtakes ſtrengthened, and ſhe will yet break forth on the right hand and on the left; her ſeed will inherit places which are now deſolate. Therefore let the true travailers for her proſperity be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; for I believe ſome of them will come to ſee the fruits of their painful travail, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. May all ſuch keep their habitations in a feeling ſenſe of the Holy Head, whether in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering or rejoicing, proſperity or adverſity! For, as ſaith the apoſtle,
<q>If we ſuffer with Chriſt, we ſhall reign with him, or be glorified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</q>
