            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A SERMON, On occaſion of the Execution of four Criminals.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>DEUTERONOMY, XIX c. 13 v.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thine Eye ſhall not pity him, but thou ſhall put away the guilt of innocent blood from</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that it may go well with thee.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is well known to this great Aſſembly, wherefore it is that theſe poor priſoners have been brought under a ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, this day to be executed upon them, namely, their having murderouſly ſhed innocent blood. The paſſage now read, I apprehend, therefore, is a fit theme to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon, upon this ſolemn and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015872_0004_0F9AD979C7BA64C0"/>
occaſion. And I the rather fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, that ſo, if the bleſſing of God may go along with what may be offered from it, the minds of theſe unhappy perſons may be deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of the heinouſneſs of the crime which has thrown them into the hands of juſtice, and expoſed them to the fatal ſtroke of it, yea, and that having the heinouſneſs of it ſet before us, we may be all filled with an utter deteſtation at, and abhorrence of it, avoid it, and all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to it.</p>
            <p>The firſt man that died out of this apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate world, was drove out of it by the hand of violence. You know the inſtance I refer to, Cain's imbruing his hands in the innocent blood of his brother. Of the old world in the days of Noah, it is ſaid, that <hi>the earth was filled with violence:</hi> Violence of this kind, among other inſtances. Nor have there been wanting inſtances in every age of this kind, until now. It is a crime that is peculiarly ſoul and black in the eſteem of God, and at which he expreſſes his angry reſentments in his word. This appears in ſome meaſure from the chapter before us, and from the words I at firſt read, as well as in abundance of other paſſages in ſacred writ.</p>
            <p>Now it is plain from my text that <hi>ſhedding innocent blood</hi> contracts guilt. It is plain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015872_0005_0F9AD97A88147B40"/>
that it is the will of God, that this <hi>guilt</hi> ſhould be <hi>put away.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We may ſee the ſpecial reaſon why God would have it put away, expreſſed in the latter part of the verſe. <hi>"That it may go well with thee."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour with all convenient bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to ſpeak to theſe ſeveral heads, in doing which, I ſhall be led to take notice of the true import of what is expreſſed in the firſt clauſe of the verſe, <hi>"thine eye ſhalt not pity him,"</hi> him that is guilty of innocent blood.</p>
            <p>The whole will be followed with ſome application ſuitable to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then, ſhedding innocent blood contracts guilt.</p>
            <p>This is the language of the inſpired paſſage we are upon. <hi>"Thou ſhalt put away the guilt of innocent blood."</hi> Now guilt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily refers to ſome law authoritatively enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is broken or violated. For <hi>where there is no law there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> and conſequently no guilt contracted. But that there is a law violated in the preſent caſe, is plain beyond all diſpute. Among the laws or commandments given at Mount Sinai, this is one—<hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> And that this is a law that was not peculiar to Iſrael of old, but a ſtanding law in God's moral kingdom, is evident from this, that our bleſſed Saviour
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015872_0006_0F9AD97BC96FB9C8"/>
has adopted it into his own inſtitution. Says he to the young ruler, with whom at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time he entered into a conference, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no murder,</hi> Matt. xix, 18. I would obſerve here, that there are ſome occaſions that may happen in which taking away the lives of others may not be conſidered as violations of this commandment we have mentioned. Thus a perſon may kill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by what is called chance or accident, without the leaſt evil intention or ſo much as a thought of ſuch a thing. Now it is plain from what is ſaid in the chapter in which is our text, that he who thus accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kills another is without guilt even in the ſight of God. Verſe 4, 5, <hi>Whoſo killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom he hated not in time paſt, as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a ſtroke with the ax to cut the tree, and the head ſlippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour that be die, he ſhall live,</hi> as is plainly expreſſed in the former part of the fourth verſe.</p>
            <p>So again, it may be ſaid; if a man is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, and is thereby brought into danger of his life, it is juſt that he ſhould ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his defence; and if in neceſſary ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he kills his antagoniſt, he is not chargeable with murder in the eye of God's
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015872_0007_0F9AD97C0F04BDE8"/>
law; he only that is ſlain has done the wrong, and his blood muſt be upon his own head. However, I would obſerve, that a perſon of a ſober, good mind, will have ſuch a regard for the life of his moſt inveterate enemy, that he will be diſpoſed to ſuffer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great wrongs, rather than proceed to ſuch an extremity in ſelf-defence, as to take away his life.</p>
            <p>Again. If war is lawful, eſpecially a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive one, it cannot then be ſaid, that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are ſlain in it, that thoſe that ſlay them are chargeable with ſhedding innocent blood. The aggreſſors in a war are only chargeable with all the fatal conſequences of it.</p>
            <p>Once more, I would ſay, that when cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals and malefactors are put to death, as is this day to be the caſe, with theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py perſons before us, by the ſword of public juſtice, there is no violation of the law of God, forbidding murder. I go upon the ſuppoſition, that the crimes ſuch are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with, are deſerving of death. And no one ſurely will call it in queſtion, whether the <hi>ſhedding innocent blood</hi> is not thus deſerving. Having obſerved theſe things, I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and ſay, that the law of God, forbiding the taking away the lives of others, intends that they ſhall not be taken away without a juſt and neceſſary cauſe. This rule extends
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015872_0008_0F9AD97CB26BC6A0"/>
to perſons of all ranks and conditions, to the meaneſt ſlave, as well as to the perſon of high degree: For both the one and the other equally partake of the human nature, and are therefore equally valuable, and have an equal right to the continuation of life, ſo long as the Lord of life ſees fit.</p>
            <p>The queſtion now is, when is it that this crime of murder is committed? I anſwer, when from a ſettled principle of hatred, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or revenge, perſons take away the lives of others. Such are in the fulleſt and moſt abſolute ſenſe, murderers, both in the eye of God and of civil ſociety. Or, if the killing another is not from a ſettled principle of hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, malice or revenge, but owing to a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tranſport of rage or fury, this, alſo is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even allowing that it is not ſo in ſuch a groſs ſenſe, as when it is done with premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and malice afore-thought. As men ought not to indulge to wrath, bitterneſs and fury, ſo if they are by theſe corrupt, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant paſſions led to ſhed the blood of any of their fellow creatures, they may not expect that this will avail as any juſt excuſe, either before God or man. "It is (ſays an author) evidently unfit that life ſhould be continually expoſed to hazard from the turbulent, ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned wrath of man. This would be to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject quiet and peaceable members of ſociety to the greateſt hardſhips, by conſtructively
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015872_0009_0F9AD97D713D8B88"/>
giving encouragement to angry men to vent their fury upon them." Wrath and fury may not be indulged upon the principles of reaſon or the Bible. And in vain muſt it be to plead one crime in excuſe for another, eſpecially, ſuch an heinous one, as that we are ſpeaking of, ſhedding the blood of others.</p>
            <p>Now this, as I have ſaid, contracts guilt, and guilt of the deepeſt and blackeſt dye. God has forbidden it with the higheſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. His expreſs law is violated, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the laws of civil ſociety. And ſuch therefore, ſtand guilty both before God and man; at once and abſolutely before God, whoſe knowledge is infallible: And before man, ſometimes immediately after the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the fact, but, however, after a legal proceſs.</p>
            <p>But without any further enlargement, I go on to obſerve in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place: It is the will of God, that this guilt ſhould be put away.</p>
            <p>How is it to be put away? I anſwer, by inflicting the penalty of the law upon the breakers of it. And this penalty, it is plain, by the appointment of God himſelf, is nothing leſs than the deſtruction of their temporal lives. That is, a ſtanding, perpetual law of God, publiſhed to the new world from <hi>Noah.</hi> Geneſis ix. 5, 6. <hi>At the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man. Whoſo ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015872_0010_0F9AD97E4512DBD0"/>
ſhed,"</hi> ſhall be ſo by the magiſtrate, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is appointed or authoriſed to be the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of blood "Before the flood (as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) God took the puniſhment of murder into his own hands, as in the caſe of <hi>Cain,</hi> but ſince, he committed this judgment to men; to maſters of families firſt, and afterwards to the heads of countries." There is no language in which the intention of God as to thoſe that are guilty of ſhedding blood, can be more plain and expreſs than this, as in the paſſage now mentioned, as well as in many others. Accordingly, we have it, <hi>Numbers</hi> xxxv. 30. <hi>Whoſo killeth any perſon, the murderer ſhall be put to death;</hi> it follows, <hi>"Ye ſhall take no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death;"</hi> or as in the margin, faulty to die, <hi>"but he ſhall ſurely be put to death."</hi> We have the like appointment of the holy God in the caſe, <hi>Proverbs</hi> xxviii. 17, <hi>A man that doth violence to the blood of any perſon, ſhall flee to the pit, let no man ſtay him."</hi> This is the ſtanding, unrepealable law of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven. And conſonant hereto, this is the ſtanding law of all civil ſocieties. But not to dwell upon this:</p>
            <p>Now this penalty annexed to the divine law reſpecting ſhedding innocent blood, requiring blood for blood, ſhews it to be a very heinous crime; a crime of the firſt magnitude. And that it is ſo, appears from a variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,

which I may but briefly hint at: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which, I would juſt obſerve, that <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> who never were acquainted with the revelation of God, nor of his mind in this caſe, have looked upon murder as a ſhocking and heinous crime, expoſing the perpetrators of it to ſome ſignal vengeance of the deity. We have an example of this in the caſe of the apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> When he landed at the iſland <hi>Melita,</hi> after his ſhipwreck, it happened that a <hi>viper</hi> faſtened upon his hand, a venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beaſt, whoſe bite is certain and ſudden death, it is ſaid, the barbarians thus remarked upon it, <hi>No doubt this man is a murderer, whom though he hath eſcaped the dangers of the ſea, yet vengeance ſuffereth not to live,</hi> Acts xxviii, 4. "And, as one obſerves, ſhould murderers eſcape the vengeance of man, they ſcarce ever after enjoy themſelves, or take comfort in life; their hearts miſgive them; their thoughts trouble them; their guilty fears perpetually haunt them; and ſometimes for the ſake of peace within, they have been as it were, forced to reveal their own wickedneſs, chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die by the hands of juſtice, than to drag on life under the uneaſy ſenſations of a continually ſelf-condemned conſcience."</p>
            <p>Having obſerved this, I go on to ſay that God having made this crime abſolutely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable with death, ſpeaks it to be a hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crime indeed. And it is ſo, in the firſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015872_0012_0F9AD97FDC31BE30"/>
place, in reſpect of the great injuſtice done to him whoſe blood is ſhed. Indeed there is no inſtance of injuſtice equal to this. Men may by lawleſs violence be turned out of the poſſeſſion of their goods and properties, they may be many ways injured in their names and in their bodies too; but all this is no ways equal to what it is to be deprived of life; for this is the foundation of all other enjoyments, and when this is deſtroyed all others fail of courſe. And then, many inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that men meet with may be repaired; their properties may be reſtored, their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters vindicated, &amp;c. but when life is tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away, there is no ſuch thing as reſtoring this, it is irrecoverably gone. It is therefore the moſt aggravated inſtance of injuſtice that can be done to a man. Beſides all which, the ſpiritual and everlaſting happineſs of the man, may be very nearly concerned, which ſhows the high and aggravated injuſtice of it. What muſt be the caſe of a wicked man, who is ſuddenly deprived of life by the hand of violence? While life remained he had a ſpace for repentance, an opportunity to make his peace with God, was in a capacity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining pardon, and ſecuring his everlaſting happineſs; but in being drove out of the world, all opportunity and capacity herefor, wholly ceaſes. And it is to be feared, that many, who have fell ſuch ſacrifices, have
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015872_0013_0F9AD983344A3330"/>
at once gone to miſery. So that, in this caſe, the immortal ſoul is in a ſenſe deſtroyed, as well as the body. What inſtance of injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice can there any ways be, equal to that, which proves the occaſion of a man's loſing his ſoul forever, which is more worth than the whole world, as is evident, among other inſtances, from the ineſtimable price that was paid for its redemption, even the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood of God's only begotten, and dearly beloved ſon, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I might alſo obſerve upon the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of it, from the conſideration of the loſs that is ſuſtained, by thoſe nearly related or connected, and by the ſociety to which ſuch belong. But paſſing over this, I go on to ſay, in the next place. That murder is a moſt heinous and aggravated ſin, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great impiety of it towards God.</p>
            <p>He is the author of men's lives, and it is his ſole prerogative to diſpoſe of them. His wiſdom as well as goodneſs is concerned in continuing men in the enjoyment of their lives. It is, we may be ſure, to anſwer ſome valuable and important ends, in his general plan of government; and as he clearly ſeen into all the relations, dependencies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections of things, ſo he perfectly knows how to accompliſh theſe ends, let the characters of men, in the moral and religious ſenſe, be as they will, good or bad. By violently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015872_0014_0F9AD98472CF08C8"/>
the life of a man, <hi>God is</hi> (as one expreſſes it) <hi>virtually robbed of a creature whom his hands have formed, yea, of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and ſubject from whom he might have received, a revenue of honour and ſervice.</hi> So that it is impiouſly to break in upon the wiſe plan that God has laid. And then, alſo, it is to be conſidered, that man is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt work of God, in this lower world; he was at firſt made after the image of God, and notwithſtanding his apoſtacy, does, in ſome reſpects, ſtill bear this image; accordingly, when God expreſſly declares, after the flood, that murder is a capital crime, to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with death, as in the paſſage I mentioned before, this reaſon is aſſigned <hi>for in the image of God made he man.</hi> Upon which one thus notes: <hi>Such remains of God's image are ſtill upon fallen man, as that he who unjuſtly kills a man, defaceth the image of God, and doth diſhonour to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more. The heinouſneſs of this crime, appears alſo in this, that it excludes the perpetrators of it from the kingdom of Heaven, and expoſes them to eternal death. Says the apoſtle, 1 John, iii, 15. <hi>No murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath eternal life.</hi> He is far from having that principle in him which leads to eternal life. How can this be when he is under the influence of ſuch diabolical principles as have been mentioned, wrath, hatred, malice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015872_0015_0F9AD9850536F218"/>
&amp;c. principles that will operate in ſuch a dreadful manner as to put him upon embruing his hands in the blood of a fellow creature. <hi>Murderers,</hi> are expreſſly ſaid by our Saviour, to <hi>be of their father the Devil, who</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>was a murderer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> John viii, 44. <hi>He is</hi> (ſays one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it) <hi>an enemy to life, becauſe God is the God of life, and life is the happineſs of man. He was man's tempter to that ſin, which brought death into the world, and ſo he was in effect the murderer of all mankind.</hi> And as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has no lot or portion in Heaven, where is the enjoyment of eternal life, ſo neither ſhall have any of his children, but ſhall be puniſhed with eternal death. Accordingly, the apoſtle John, among other heinous tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, mentions MURDERERS, <hi>who ſhall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> Rev. xxi. 8. But this, I would juſt ſay, that the apoſtle ſpeaks with reſpect to ſuch, goes upon the ſuppoſition, that they are not brought to true repentance: For, it may be obſerved here, that as black a crime as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, it may be repented of, and in virtue of the great atonement by Jeſus Chriſt, be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by God. This is ſufficiently expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the apoſtle to the Hebrews, Chap. xii. 24. <hi>Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling, which ſpeaketh
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015872_0016_0F9AD985B05F0E80"/>
better things than the blood of</hi> Abel. Tho blood of <hi>Abel</hi> cried for vengeance: But the blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the lamb ſlain, cries for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And being <hi>ſprinkled</hi> therewith, as the phraſe here is, murderers may obtain pardon from the hands of God. But unleſs this is the caſe, the dreadful threatening we juſt mentioned, will be executed upon them. I ſhall only add here that paſſage in Rev. xxii. 15, which refers to thoſe that are finally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent. <hi>But without,</hi> i.e. the heavenly city, mentioned verſe preceding, <hi>are dogs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, and whoremongers and MURDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all now that has been ſaid, does it not appear, what a heinous crime murder is? Its being puniſhable with death, by the expreſs appointment of the God of Heaven, as well as by the laws of civil ſociety, ſpeaks it to be ſo. It is only in this way, that <hi>the guilt of innocent blood can be put away,</hi> as the language is in my text. Nor may any, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great offence to God, interpoſe to prevent it, or ward off the ſtroke of civil juſtice. <hi>Thine eye ſhall not pity him,</hi> ſays the text. Does this mean, that we ſhould be hard hearted towards ſuch who have committed this crime? That we ſhould ſet aſide even common humanity? Shut up our bowels of compaſſion towards them? Be rancorous, bitter and wrathful in our diſpoſitions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015872_0017_0F9AD986882F2378"/>
them? No, it does not mean this—Thoſe that are in diſtreſs are objects of pity; and ingenuous minds will have the feelings of humanity towards them. While they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the crime, will pity and compaſſionate the diſtreſſed criminal. And the religion of the compaſſionate Jeſus, will powerfully lead to this. And this humane, chriſtian principle, will put them upon every kind office towards them, to pray earneſtly for them, and uſe all their beſt endeavours, that ſo their ſouls may he ſaved from death, and that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a part in the everlaſting ſalvation of the heavenly world, which through the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of God and of the goſpel, they are capable of. But when it is ſaid in my text, <hi>thine eye ſhall not pity him,</hi> it intends, that thou ſhalt not <hi>ſo</hi> pity him, as to prevent juſtice tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place upon him. That judges and jurors upon ſufficient evidence of their guilt, ſhould, agreable to the ſolemn obligation lying upon them to be faithful, declare them guilty, and pronounce upon them the ſentence which the law of God and man has provided in the caſe, and, that all who are properly authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereto, ſee that it be put into execution. All this is conſiſtent with the moſt tender emotions of heart towards poor criminals, and the moſt fervent wiſhes and prayers for their everlaſting happineſs. The moſt tender compaſſionate feelings muſt never ſupercede
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015872_0018_0F9AD98736CE9BF0"/>
the expreſs, peremptory orders of the God of Heaven.</p>
            <p>I paſs on now to the laſt head propoſed, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>To conſider the ſpecial reaſon, why God would have <hi>the guilt of innocent blood put away—That it may go well with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It intimates, that if the guilt of blood is not put away, it will be very diſpleaſing to God, and expoſe the land to diſtreſſing judgments. It would ſpeak a general approbation and conſent to ſo heinous a wickedneſs, and ſo the guilt would lie, not only on the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate actors and their accomplices, but on the public, and nothing then could be expected, but God's teſtifying his anger in moſt awful ways. We may ſee at large in <hi>Deuter.</hi> xxi. what particular care was taken to put away the guilt of innocent blood, even when <hi>he</hi> that ſhed it, was not found out. After the devoted heifer was ſlain, their hands were to be waſhed over it, denoting their innocence, to which the Pſalmiſt no doubt refers, xxvi. 6. <hi>I will waſh mine hands in innocency.</hi> And then the people of Iſrael are brought in as addreſſing the divine majeſty, verſe 8. <hi>Be merciful, O Lord unto thy people Iſrael, whom thou haſt redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Iſrael's charge. And the blood ſhall be forgiven them.</hi> Should not this guilt be put away in the manner that has been ſaid, the whole land would be defiled. So we read
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015872_0019_0F9AD9880185FBF0"/>
               <hi>Numbers</hi> xxxv. 33. <hi>For blood it defileth the land, and the land it cannot be cleanſed of the blood that is ſhed therein,</hi> or as the marginal reading is, there can be no expiation for the land, <hi>but by the blood of him that ſhed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If,</hi> as one notes upon it, <hi>ſuch eſcape puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from men, they that ſuffer them to eſcape will have a great deal to anſwer for, and God will not, however, ſuffer them to eſcape his righteous judgment. If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe to the judges, to the country, or to the avenger of blood to atone for his crime, it muſt utterly be contemned,"</hi> that ſo God may not be provoked utterly to deſtroy that land, but that it <hi>may go well with it,</hi> that it may be under his ſpecial care and bleſſing.</p>
            <p>I have now finiſhed the ſeveral heads I at firſt mentioned, as offering themſelves from the text. And upon ſo extraordinary an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, I apprehend, as I hinted in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that it would be ſuitable to offer that which might ſerve to give people a full view of the crime of murder, the exceeding hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of it, and the fatal conſequences of it, and, as I ſaid, to impreſs the minds of theſe poor priſoners with a deep and pungent ſenſe of the crime, for which they are this day to ſuffer the penalty annexed to the law of God and man.</p>
            <p>To theſe poor priſoners. I would now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſpeak—And as this is the <hi>laſt</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015872_0020_0F9AD988C94D0AE0"/>
you will ever hear, I hope you will carefully attend to what may be now ſpoken to you, by one who has had much to do with you ſince your confinement, and hopes he has a true deſire for your immortal intereſts.</p>
            <p>I would, in the firſt place, ſpeak to <hi>Buch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anan, Brooks</hi> and <hi>Roſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you have attended to what has been ſaid in this diſcourſe, you muſt be led to ſee, that your arraignment, condemnation and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may not be attributed to the malignant paſſions of hatred, malevolence, bitterneſs and wrath. You muſt needs be ſenſible that at the court, all was fairneſs, candor and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, both as to judges and jurors, and every advantage to vindicate your innocency, had you been innocent:—Had this appeared, it would have been matter of ſatisfaction to the court, the numerous aſſembly, and to the whole community: But you were found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and received ſentence accordingly; not in rage and fury, but with chriſtian tenderneſs and compaſſion. And why was the fatal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced? I anſwer, becauſe juſtice abſolutely required it, and the law of God in the caſe could not be diſpenſed with, nor the law of civil ſociety, without becoming par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of your guilt, and drawing down the judgments of heaven upon the land. I truſt you view matters in this light, and that you juſtify both God and man in your condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015872_0021_0F9AD9897947F4A8"/>
Indeed, I have found you freely doing ſo, and that you have had no diſpoſition to hide or cover your guilt. The monitor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, charged you with it, and you have been free in your confeſſion. And I truſt you have been ſo, not only to man, but to the omniſcient God, your righteous judge, before whom you will this very day appear, before the ſhadows of the evening are ſtretched over us. Such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to God, enters into the nature of true repentance, a grace you muſt be poſſeſſed of, as you would be found of your judge in peace. If you are poſſeſſed of true repentance, you ſee yourſelves as you are, ſee your vileneſs, pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and guiltineſs, and how juſtly God might caſt you off forever. But you ſee him at the ſame time, ſeated upon a throne of mercy, ready to receive repenting, returning ſinners, to pardon and ſave them; not for their ſakes, but for his own name ſake, and for the ſake of his ſon Jeſus, who once hung bleeding for ſinners on the ignominious tree, and whoſe blood is of infinite value, ſufficient to cleanſe away all your guilt and pollution, even the guilt of that ſcarlet and crimſon iniquity, for which you are this day to ſuffer an ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death. You will ſee in all its black colours (I hope you have done ſo before this your laſt day) the ſin of ſhedding innocent blood. The deed of that fatal night, when you might ſay, as in <hi>Proverbs</hi> i, 11, <hi>Come let us lay wait for
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015872_0022_0F9AD98A6018EF28"/>
blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe:</hi> This I truſt you reflect upon with grief and ſhame, with the utmoſt deteſtation and abhorrence. O the diſhonour done to God! the cruelty and injuſtice to a fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, one who had never in the leaſt injured you! Indeed, if <hi>he</hi> whoſe blood you imbrued your hands in, was a good man, you were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the inſtruments of ſending him to heaven a little before the time, though no thanks to you, for you meant not ſo. But if he was a wicked man,(a ſuppoſition I would very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly make) what was the caſe of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul, when you hurried him out of the world, without his having the opportunity to lift up one cry to the God of heaven for mercy? You muſt not look upon it as a ſevere reproach, when I ſay, that it was a moſt ſhocking, cruel murder, and, taken in all its circumſtances, ſuch an inſtance as has never happened in this land from the firſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and indeed it is ſcarcely to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled in all hiſtory.</p>
            <p>What a wide difference has there been put between you and Mr. <hi>Spooner?</hi> Without the leaſt thought or warning he was diſpatched out of the world, to appear at once before the bar of the omnipotent judge: But ſeveral weeks were allotted for you after trial, and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpace ſtill granted, ſeveral weeks more, upon application made to our chief magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015872_0023_0F9AD98AF1500DD0"/>
that ſo you might have all the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities and advantages poſſible, for making your peace with God, ſecuring a part in the glorious redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, and be prepared for this ſolemn day, and for a happy appearance before your great judge. You have ſurely no cauſe to complain, for the want of the moſt kind, humane, chriſtian treatment, from firſt to laſt. And I truſt you have a grateful ſenſe of it.</p>
            <p>Much pains, you are ſenſible, have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with you in public and in private: Moſt wholeſome inſtructions and counſels have been adminiſtered to you, and prayers have been continually going up before God on your behalf. And if all this has been bleſſed to your ſpiritual, ſaving good, the evidences of this, will be a rich and ample amends to all that have in ſuch ways miniſtered to you. And although I would not by any means, in this your laſt ſtage, ſay any thing to you by way of flattery, yet it has been a ſatisfaction, that you have all along been ready to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and deſirous of the prayers of God's people for you. This we have been ready to look upon as a token for good. We hope you have been in earneſt in ſeeking after God, that you have been brought to true godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to make your flight to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and committed your ſouls into his hands; that you have made your peace
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015872_0024_0F9AD98DF45FA378"/>
with God, and that death which is juſt before you, does not wear a gloomy aſpect, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ignominy attending it,—that you have a ſolid hope of going this day to be with God and Chriſt in Heaven, to be happy there to all eternity. If you are at peace with God, all your guilt, even the horrid guilt of ſheding innocent blood, will be no bar in the way of your attaining to this ſuperior bleſſedneſs. If God is yours, and Chriſt is yours, then attending angels will hover around the ignominious tree, to receive your departing ſpirits, and take them upon their wings, and bear them away ſafely to the regions of joy, bliſs and felicity above. Then what a bleſſed day will this be to you, better to you than the day of your birth! That introduced you into a world of ſin and ſorrow, but this will introduce you into a world of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute purity and eternal reſt. I do not mean to decide upon your caſe, but only to expreſs my hopes.</p>
            <p>You are now about to quit the world, to bid adieu to all things and objects under the ſun. You will have a few moments left, after this exerciſe is over. My laſt advice to you is, to caſt yourſelves down at the feet of God's mercy, imploring the ſpecial aids and influences of his holy ſpirit, whereby you may be led to examine yourſelves, whether you do indeed repent after a godly ſort; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you repent of ſin, and of the heinous ſin
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015872_0025_0F9AD98EC518D328"/>
for which you are to ſuffer death, not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe of what it has brought you to this day, but becauſe of the inherent vileneſs, baſeneſs and odiouſneſs of it, as being a high indignity to the God of glory, and the moſt wretched ingratitude, to him your great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, who has manifeſted ſuch wonderous love to you, as to give his own dearly beloved ſon to redeem you, to ſave you from ſin and wrath, and to purchaſe eternal life: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you hate ſin for its own ſake; whether you find a diſpoſition in you, if you had liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to obey, ſerve and glorify God; whether you ſee that after all you are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, have no merit of your own, and have therefore a firm truſt in the blood of the all-ſufficient ſaviour for pardon and acceptance with the holy God? Be impartial in theſe matters now you are juſt a going. And beg of God to ſearch and try you and diſcover to you your true ſtate, that he would ſhine in upon your ſouls, and give you joy and peace in believing. And that the bleſſed Jeſus, that compaſſionate lover of ſouls, would receive you to himſelf. Let that be your dying pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, each one for himſelf, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit,</hi> and may that bleſſed being ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>I would now ſpeak a few words to you, Mrs. <hi>Spooner.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. Spooner through great bodily indiſpoſition was not able to attend the public exerciſe that day; but it was thought proper to inſert, in this publication, that which would have been ſpoken to her had ſhe been preſent.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:015872_0026_0F9AD98F946C6C90"/>
               <hi>When we conſider your ſex; the reſpectable figure that in times paſt you made in life; your connexions, and your many agreable qualities, it is with a pungent grief that we behold you a priſoner of death, preſently to be led forth to execution. Surely you muſt feel your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It would have been very ſatisfactory had you been free and ingenuous in acknowledging your guilt, and the juſtice of your ſentence. But though you have not been diſpoſed to do this to man, I hope you have done ſo upon your bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knees to the omniſcient God, who cannot be deceived. You are indeed looked upon by man, as guilty, yea, as the author and procurer of the bloody deed, but for whom it had never been perpetrated. The evidence in the caſe was too glaring to lead any one to a different ſentiment. It is painful to me to ſay this, but I muſt be faithful to you in this matter, though this is not the firſt time by many. I ſay thus, to the intent that you may be led, now at the laſt, if you have never been ſo, to penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al grief and ſorrow, before that holy, righteous God, at whoſe dread tribunal you muſt this day appear. I am loth to dwell upon ſome very ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating circumſtances of that tragical affair, ſuch as the near relation (the moſt ſo of any in life) of him whoſe blood was ſhed; the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanizing a number of dear and innocent chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the involving ſo many in the ſame guilt,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015872_0027_0F9AD990317EC6C0"/>
and ſome of them, as we ſee before us, in the ſame condemnation; the diſtreſs and anguiſh brought on near friends, relatives, &amp;c. But without dwelling upon theſe matters, I would hope that under a deep ſenſe of your guilt, you have been earneſtly applying to God for pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy and grace: That from a ſenſe of your unworthineſs before him; of your ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, your loſt, periſhing condition as a ſinner, that you have been earneſtly ſeeking the face and favour of God; that you have ſeen that there is a glorious and effectual remedy provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for you, the precious blood of Chriſt, and have fled to it, and have ſome comfortable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that God has received you to pardon and favour. Is it thus with you</hi> poor dying woman! <hi>Then the death before you, though ſhameful, will yet be ſafe and joyful. And you ſhall aſcend this day to be with God in glory. But do not deceive yourſelf now at the laſt; look well to yourſelf, and cry to God that he would ſearch and try you. Call upon him even to the laſt, lie at his feet, beſeeching him that his tender mercy and compaſſion may be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you; that he would not leave you to periſh forever, but give you a name and a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the redeemed and ſaved in his eternal kingdom. This is what we all earneſtly wiſh and pray for on your behalf, and truſt we ſhall continue to do ſo till your ſoul ſhall take its flight into the eternal world.</hi> And ſo we bid you a ſolemn and final farewell!</p>

I muſt beg your patience a few moments more, while I ſpeak a word to this great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
            <p>My Brethren! You doubtleſs find the workings of humanity towards theſe poor priſoners, though you do not <hi>ſo</hi> pity them as to prevent the putting away the guilt of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood from our Iſrael. But as they are in a deplorable condition, in this reſpect they are objects of pity and compaſſion. Let this expreſs itſelf by lifting up your fervent cries to Heaven for them, the few moments that remain to them, that though deſtruction muſt happen to their fleſh, yet that their ſouls may be received to everlaſting ſalvation. And pity and pray for their afflicted diſtreſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whether parents, brethren, and ſiſters, and others that are near to them by the bonds of nature. Let them never be upbraided and reproached with the untimely, ignominious death of theſe poor priſoners. This would be cruel and brutal. And peculiarly would it be ſo to the orphan children of Mr. <hi>Spooner.</hi> No blame belongs to them. They could not prevent the murder of their father, nor the ignominious death of their Mother. May they never be made to ſuffer, for what has happened to their parents. May they find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God and man—experience the truth of that word, <hi>Pſalm</hi> xxvii, 10, <hi>When my father and my mother forſake me, then the</hi>

Lord <hi>will take me up.</hi> I would now further ſay—That one end of public juſtice being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted upon theſe criminals, is to the intent that they may be a warning to others, that they commit not the like heinous wickedneſs, and expoſe themſelves to the like capital pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. No doubt you ſhudder at the thoughts of ſhedding innocent blood. In times paſt, it is likely theſe poor dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did ſo. But they forſook God, and God forſook them, and they were left to perpetrate the heinous crime for which they muſt now die. And may not you alſo be thus left, if you in like manner forſake him? Alas! how <hi>many are there</hi> who do ſo? And were it not for the reſtraints of divine grace, what foul crimes would you be left to, puniſhable with temporal death, not to mention that eternal death and deſtruction which awaits all that go on hardened and impenitent? It is God that has made you to differ from theſe criminals. Bleſs God for his reſtraints and be upon your watch and guard, that ſo you <hi>may be kept</hi> from falling. The beſt <hi>ſecurity</hi> againſt this is to become <hi>truly</hi> pious and religious, to walk with God and to live near to God: This is the great buſineſs and end of life; if <hi>any</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect this, death, which all are ſubject to, whenever it comes, or in whatſoever form, will tranſmit their miſerable ſouls to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal regions, where they ſhall endure the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015872_0030_0F9AD99277AA2EE0"/>
ſecond death, which is eternal, and which is far more terrible than the firſt, however painful and ſhameful.</p>
            <p>May the awful ſpectacles now before us, ſerve to awaken us to a ſenſe of the great evil of ſin, and how provoking it is to the pure and righteous God, and put us upon an earneſt flight to Chriſt, that we may be delivered from guilt and condemnation, and at laſt brought to the fruition of eternal life in Heaven. And now may we be all kept from falling, and preſerved by God's mighty power, through faith unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>May God look down in tender compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon theſe poor priſoners, and admit them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon their departure, to be with the bleſſed Jeſus in the paradiſe above. For this we ſhall again ſupplicate God's glorious majeſty.—</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>WHAT is propoſed by the author of the preceding ſermon, in this Appendix, is to give a ſummary account of the priſoners, after their commitment, and eſpecially after trial and ſentence.</p>
            <p>What immediately follows has a reſpect to <hi>Buchanan, Brooks</hi> and <hi>Roſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they were firſt committed, ſuch was the horror of their conſciences, that, as one of them afterwards expreſſed it, <hi>the priſon was a mere hell to them.</hi> Notwithſtanding which they were reſolved to lie at God's feet, to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon him for mercy, encouraging a hope of obtaining it through the merits of Jeſus.—They gave themſelves to prayer—they deſired the prayers of others, and were eager to embrace all opportunities for religious counſels and inſtructions.</p>
            <p>After trial and ſentence, they juſtified God and man in their condemnation. They were ſenſible, as they often ſaid, that <hi>it would be juſt in God to caſt them off, and make them eternally miſerable in hell.</hi> So ſenſible were they of their ill-deſerts, that with an apparent ſincerity they would ſay, that <hi>ſhould God put a blank into their hands, they could freely ſign it, leaving it wholly to his pleaſure, as to their abſolution or damnation.</hi> They ſpent all their time, even
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015872_0032_0F9AD993FB304C48"/>
till late at night, in reading the Bible and many valuable books that were put into their hands, in praying and ſinging pſalms and hymns. They became mighty in the ſcriptures, and were wont to make very pertinent obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon many paſſages that were mentioned to them. They were perſons of good, natural capacity: <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Roſs</hi> in all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation diſcovered a conſiderable extent of it: And <hi>Brooks</hi> had a good ſhare of it. It was ſurprizing, eſpecially at times, to hear them converſe upon the ſubject of real religion. They were wont to ſpeak in a moſt feeling manner of the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus—of their entire, hearty truſt to the merit of his blood—of the vileneſs and odiouſneſs of ſin, of the diſhonour thereby done to God, the baſe ingratitude of it towards him, and of the contempt thereby caſt upon the blood and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the bleſſed Jeſus: The diſhonour done to God by ſin, was the burden of the ſong with them, not what they ſuffered or were about to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>They would ſometimes ſpeak in a moſt moving manner of the love of God, and of the love of Chriſt, and of the manisfeſtations thereof to their ſouls. The papers which they left are full of expreſſions of this kind. They appeared to have an entire benevolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men—very thankful for all kindneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and they received many; heartily diſpoſed to forgive all who had any ways injured them.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:015872_0033_0F9AD994BB7C60D8"/>
There were all the external evidences of true penitence in them that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. A ſabbath or two before their expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed execution, <hi>Roſs</hi> was publickly baptiſed. He appeared to underſtand well, the nature and deſign of the ordinance, and attended upon it with great ſeriouſneſs and ſolemnity: He found it a good day, having had tokens of God's gracious preſence with him, as he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified afterwards. They expected to have been executed on the 4th of June, the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. When I brought them the tidings of a reprieve for four weeks, they told me it was contrary to their expectations, truſted that they were in a ſtate of readineſs to leave the world; but expreſſed great thankfulneſs to God and man for this further ſpace, and ſet apart the 4th of June entirely for religious exerciſes; employing it in reading, and in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and ſocial prayer, taking no bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment till the cloſe of the day. As I had much opportunity, even almoſt daily to know their ſtate, ſo I have reaſon to think that they improved the time further granted them, in the very beſt manner. When young perſons, as was common, viſited them, they would deal out the moſt ſerious, ſolemn, affectionate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and warnings to them: They were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of frequent opportunities of this kind, that they might do ſome little good before they left the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:015872_0034_0F9AD995A0C3E0E0"/>
A few days before their execution, being minded that the time drew near, and being aſked, whether it did not give them peculiar anxiety; they replied, <hi>None at all,</hi> for that <hi>they truſted it would be well with them,</hi> or to that effect. I viſited them early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that day, found them calm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. One of them obſerved, as near as I can remember, that <hi>the ſun would no more ariſe upon them here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but truſted before night they ſhould be in glory!</hi> In the ſame compoſed frame, they went to the place of execution, attended by a number of miniſters. When they mounted the ſcaffold, <hi>Roſs</hi> made an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible and very affectionate prayer, the others went to their private devotions, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them till they were turned off. <hi>Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> in particular, upon the ſtage appeared with a pleaſant aſpect, anſwering to that repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dr. <hi>Watts, 'ſmiling and pleaſed in death.'</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very heavy thunder ſtorm came on juſt before they were turned off, which ſeemed to add to the ſolemnity of the ſcene.</p>
            <p>As to Mrs. <hi>Spooner,</hi> ſhe profeſſed that her match with her huſband was not agreable to her. Domeſtic diſſentions ſoon took place, and went on from ſtep to ſtep, till ſhe conceived an utter averſion to him; at length ſhe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated his deſtruction; laid ſeveral plans, and never gave over till the fatal act was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Her guilt in this matter appeared in
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015872_0035_0F9AD9962F786F70"/>
moſt flagrant colours upon her trial as well as ſince, from the ſolemn declaration of the poor men whom ſhe employed in the bloody deed, and to whom ſhe promiſed a large reward, which reward they immediately received.</p>
            <p>I ſoon viſited her after her commitment. She was not very free to converſe upon the ſubject. And indeed it was difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe freely upon it till after her trial. After this, opportunity was given in the fulleſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. She did not blame judges or jurors or the Attorney-General, but often declared that the witneſſes wronged her. She declared, that <hi>though ſhe had planned the matter, yet, that ſhe never thought it would be executed; that ſhe relented when ſhe found they were in earneſt.</hi> She doubtleſs could have given her huſband notice of what was deſigned, and ſo have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, but ſhe did not; nor did ſhe make diſcovery of it as ſoon as poſſible, but ſent the next morning to a neighbour's to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, when at the ſame time ſhe knew he was in the well. She could not be brought to acknowledge her guilt or the juſtneſs of her ſentence till very late in the day, as ſhall be mentioned. It ſeems ſhe went upon this miſtaken principle that ſhe was not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate actor. She was a perſon of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fortitude of mind; did not for the moſt part appear to be affected with many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015872_0036_0F9AD99952CEC608"/>
in her caſe which were wont deeply to affect others. She would indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſay, that ſhe felt more than ſhe did or could expreſs. Seldom a day paſſed but I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited her, for which ſhe expreſſed great grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. I was wont to converſe with her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the main point, and to endeavour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her mind with a ſenſe of her guilt, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obſerve upon her the ſymptoms of true penitence. Appearances of this were from time to time diſcouraging.</p>
            <p>Her behaviour to all was very polite and complaiſant. From the frequent opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I had with her, I was led to conceive of her, as a perſon naturally of a kind, obliging, generous diſpoſition: But ſhe was unhappy, as above mentioned, in her firſt ſetting out in the world, and ſo left to a fatal capital crime.</p>
            <p>It appeared to many that carefully obſerved her, for many weeks before her execution, that ſhe was in a ſtate of pregnancy. She accordingly petitioned authority for a reſpite. A jury of matrons was appointed to examine her. They did not bring in in her favour; ſhe petitioned again but it was not granted; accordingly execution was ordered; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the tidings with great calmneſs. At her own deſire, that the public might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ſhe was opened the evening after exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and a perfect' male <hi>ſoetus</hi> of the growth of five months or near it, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015872_0037_0F9AD99A942695A8"/>
of the operators, was taken from her. Having undergone a ſecond examination a few days before her execution, and being thereby greatly diſordered, ſhe was not able to attend the ſermon that day.</p>
            <p>Soon after it, I went to the goal with a number of my brethren; ſhe appeared very calm, humble and penitent, profeſſed her faith in the great ſaviour and dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; upon its being propoſed to her, ſhe readily conſented to be baptized; ſhe was ſo immediately, as but a few moments remained before ſhe muſt go forth. The ſcene was very ſolemn and affecting; ſhe was not at all daunted when the ſheriff preſented her with and-put on the fatal cord; ſhe told him ſhe eſteemed it as much as though he had put on a necklace of gold or diamonds. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went forth, I accompanied her in a carriage to the place of execution; ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared undiſmayed and unaffrighted at the various ſtriking ſcenes that opened from one ſtage to another. At length we came in ſight of the gallows, I aſked her if the ſight of it did not ſtrike her? She anſwered not at all any more than any other object. Her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional politeneſs ſtill remained, and ſhe diſcovered it to numbers that were near her. She preſently mounted the ſcaffold, and while the ſheriff was fixing her, ſhe told him, with a ſerene countenance, <hi>that it was the happieſt
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015872_0038_0F9AD99B828F0398"/>
day ſhe ever ſaw, for ſhe doubted not it would be well with her.</hi> She acknowledged <hi>that ſhe juſtly died; that ſhe hoped to ſee her chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian friends ſhe left behind her, in Heaven, but that none of them might go there in the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious manner that ſhe did.</hi> It was a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principle with her, that confeſſion of her faults was proper only to be made to her maker, not to men; ſhe often declared, <hi>that ſhe was not neglectful of this and found ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in ſo doing;</hi> but at the laſt caſt, ſhe did this at leaſt implicitly to the ſheriff, as juſt related. I would be far from preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to decide upon her future ſtate or that of the reſt of them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add a ſhort extract from the ſermon I delivered to my people the Lord's day following; <hi>"We know what are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite compaſſions of God, and that the blood of Jeſus is of infinite value, cleanſing from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. We may by no means limit the holy one of Iſrael. We read of the ſervant that came in at the eleventh hour, who received the ſame wages as thoſe who had borne the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and heat of the day: We know what was done by our Saviour, to the penitent thief upon the croſs, juſt before he expired. This ſhows us what divine power and grace can do and may do. But ſecret things belong to God, and we ought to leave them with him.</hi>
