            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>I HAVE the honor to inform Congreſs, that I arrived here yeſterday about twelve o'clock, on my return from Hartford. Some hours previous to my arrival Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Arnold went from his quarters, which were this place, and, as it was ſuppoſed, over the river to the garriſon at Weſt Point, whither I proceeded myſelf, in order to viſit the poſt. I found General Arnold had not been there during the day, and on my return to his quarters he was ſtill abſent. In the mean time, a packet had arrived from Lieut. Colonel Jameſon, announcing the capture of a John Anderſon, who was endeavouring to go to New-York with ſeveral intereſting and important papers, all in the hand writing of General Arnold. This was alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a letter from the priſoner, avowing himſelf to be Major John André, Adjutant General to the Britiſh army, relating the manner of his capture, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew that he did not come under the deſcription of a <hi>ſpy.</hi> From theſe ſeveral circumſtances, and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the General ſeemed to be thrown into ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of agitation, on receiving a letter a little time before he went from his quarters, I was led to conclude imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately that he had heard of Major André's captivity, and that he would, if poſſible, eſcape to the enemy, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly took ſuch meaſures as appeared the moſt probable to apprehend him. But he had embarked in a barge and proceeded down the river, under a flag, to the Vulture

ſhip of war, which lay at ſome miles below Stoney and Verplank's Points. He wrote me a letter after he got on board. Major André is not arrived yet, but I hope he is ſecure, and that he will be here to-day. I have been and am taking precautions, which I truſt will prove effectual to prevent the important conſequences which this conduct, on the part of General Arnold, was intended to produce. I do not know the party that took Major André, but it is ſaid that it conſiſted only of a few militia, who acted in ſuch a manner upon the occaſion, as does them the higheſt honor, and proves them to be men of great virtue. As ſoon as I know their names, I ſhall take pleaſure in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to Congreſs.</p>

Your Excellency may conceive my ſenſation on this occaſion and will imagine how much more I muſt have been affected, by a refuſal to reconduct me back the next night as I had been brought. Thus become a priſoner I had to concert my eſcape.</hi> I quitted my uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>and was paſſed another way in the night without the American poſts to neutral ground, and informed I was beyond all armed parties and left to preſs for New-York.

               <p>YOUR Excellency is doubtleſs already appriſed of the manner in which I was taken, and poſſibly of the ſerious light in which my conduct is conſidered, and the rigorous determination that is impending.</p>
               <p>Under theſe circumſtances, I have obtained General Waſhington's permiſſion to ſend you this letter; the object of which is, to remove from your breaſt any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that I could imagine I was bound by your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's orders to expoſe myſelf to what has happened. The events of coming within an enemy's poſts, and of changing my dreſs, which led me to my preſent ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were contrary to my own intentions, as they were to your orders; and the circuitous route, which I took to return, was impoſed (perhaps unavoidably) without alternative upon me.</p>
               <p>I am perfectly tranquil in mind, and prepared for any fate, to which an honeſt zeal for my King's ſervice may have devoted me.</p>
               <p>In addreſſing myſelf to your Excellency on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the force of all my obligations to you, and of the attachment and gratitude I bear you, recurs to me. With all the warmth of my heart, I give you thanks for your Excellency's profuſe kindneſs to me; and I ſend you the moſt earneſt wiſhes for your welfare, which a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, affectionate, and reſpectful attendant can frame.</p>
               <p>I have a mother and three ſiſters, to whom the value of my commiſſion would be an object, as the loſs of Grenada has much affected their income. It is needleſs to be more explicit on this ſubject; I am perſuaded of your Excellency's goodneſs.</p>

               <p>IN anſwer to your Excellency's letter of the 26th inſtant, which I had the honour to receive, I am to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that Major André was taken under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as would have juſtified the moſt ſummary proceedings againſt him. I determined, however, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his caſe to the examination and deciſion of a Board of General Officers, who have reported, on his free and voluntary confeſſion and letters,—"That he came on ſhore from the Vulture ſloop of war in the night of the twenty-firſt of September inſtant," &amp;c. &amp;c. as in the report of the Board of General Officers.</p>
               <p>From theſe proceedings it is evident Major André was employed in the execution of meaſures very foreign to the objects of flags of truce, and ſuch as they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant to authoriſe or countenance in the moſt diſtant degree; and this gentleman confeſſed, with the greateſt candor, in the courſe of his examination, "That it was impoſſible for him to ſuppoſe he came on ſhore, under the ſanction of a flag."</p>

               <p>PERSUADED that you are inclined rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote than prevent the civilities and acts of humanity, which the rules of war permit between civilized nations, I find no difficulty in repreſenting to you, that ſeveral letters and meſſages ſent from hence have been diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are unanſwered, and the flags of truce that carried them, detained. As I ever have treated all flags of truce with civility and reſpect, I have a right to hope, that you will order my complaint to be immediately redreſſed.</p>
               <p>Major André, who viſited an officer commanding in a diſtrict at his own deſire, and acted in every circumſtance agreeable to his direction, I find is detained a priſoner; my friendſhip for him leads me to fear he may ſuffer ſome inconvenience for want of neceſſaries; I wiſh to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſend him a few, and ſhall take it as a favour if you will be pleaſed to permit his ſervant to deliver them.

               <p>A NOTE I have from General Greene, leaves me in doubt if his memory had ſerved him, to relate to you with exactneſs the ſubſtance of the converſation that had paſſed between him and myſelf, on the ſubject of Major Andrè. In an affair of ſo much conſequence to my friend, to the two armies, and humanity, I would leave no poſſibility of a miſunderſtanding, and therefore take the liberty to put in writing the ſubſtance of what I ſaid to General Greene.</p>
               <p>I offered to prove, by the evidence of Colonel Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the officers of the Vulture, that Major André went on ſhore at General Arnold's deſire, in a boat ſent for him with a flag of truce; that he not only came aſhore with the knowledge and under the protection of the General who commanded in the diſtrict, but that he took no ſtep while on ſhore but by direction of General Arnold, as will appear by the incloſed letter from him to your Excellency.</p>
               <p>Under theſe circumſtances I could not, and hoped you would not, conſider Major André as a ſpy, for any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper phraſe in his letter to you.</p>
               <p>The facts he relates correſpond with the evidence I offer; but he admits a concluſion that does not follow. The change of cloaths and name was ordered by General Arnold, under whoſe direction he neceſſarily was, while within his command. As General Greene and I did not agree in opinion, I wiſhed, that diſintereſted gentlemen of knowledge of the law of war and nations, might be aſked their opinion on the ſubject; and mentioned Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Knyphauſen, and General Rochambault.</p>
               <p>I related that a Captain Robinſon had been delivered to Sir Henry Clinton as a ſpy, and undoubtedly was ſuch; but that it being ſignified to him that you were deſirous
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017043_0019_0FA25CF01B36CFE8"/>
that this man ſhould be exchanged, he had ordered him to be exchanged.</p>
               <p>I wiſhed that an intercourſe of ſuch civilities, as the rules of war admit of, might take off many of its horrors. I admitted that Major André had a great ſhare of Sir Henry Clinton's eſteem, and that he would be infinitely obliged by his liberation; and that if he was permitted to return with me, I would engage to have any perſon you would be pleaſed to name ſet at liberty.</p>
               <p>I added, that Sir Henry Clinton had never put to death any perſon for a breach of the rules of war, though he had, and now has, many in his power. Under the preſent circumſtances, much good may ariſe from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, much ill from the want of it. If that could give any weight, I beg leave to add, that your favourable treatment of Major André, will be a favour I ſhould ever be intent to return to any you hold dear.</p>
               <p>My memory does not retain with the exactneſs I could wiſh, the words of the letter which General Greene ſhewed me from Major Andrè to your Excellency. For Sir Henry Clinton's ſatisfaction, I beg you will order a copy of it to be ſent to me at New-York.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE polite attention ſhewn by your Excellency and the Gentlemen of your family to Mrs. Arnold, when in diſtreſs, demand my grateful acknowledgment and thanks, which I beg leave to preſent.</p>
               <p>From your Excellency's letter to Sir Henry Clinton, I find a Board of General Officers have given it as their opinion, that Major André comes under the deſcription of a ſpy: My good opinion of the candor and juſtice of thoſe Gentlemen leads me to believe, that if they had been made fully acquainted with every circumſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Major André, that they would by no means have conſidered him in the light of a ſpy, or even of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. In juſtice to him, I think it my duty to declare, that he came from on board the Vulture at my particular requeſt, by a flag ſent on purpoſe for him by Joſhua Smith, Eſq. who had permiſſion to go to Dobbs's ferry to carry letters, and for other purpoſes not mentioned,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017043_0020_0FA25CF024C78ED0"/>
and to return. This was done as a blind to the ſpy boats: Mr. Smith at the ſame time had my private directions to go on board the Vulture, and bring on ſhore Col. Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Mr. John Anderſon, which was the name I had requeſted Major André to aſſume: At the ſame time I deſired Mr. Smith to inform him, that he ſhould have my protection, and a ſafe paſſport to return in the ſame boat, as ſoon as our buſineſs was compleated. As ſeveral acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents intervened to prevent his being ſent on board, I gave him my paſſport to return by land. Major Andrè came on ſhore in his uniform (without diſguiſe) which with much reluctance, at my particular and preſſing inſtance, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for another coat. I furniſhed him with a horſe and ſaddle, and pointed out the route by which he was to return. And as commanding officer in the department, I had an undoubted right to tranſact all theſe matters; which, if wrong, Major André ought by no means to ſuffer for them.</p>
               <p>But if, after this juſt and candid repreſentation of Major André's caſe, the Board of General Officers adhere to their former opinion, I ſhall ſuppoſe it dictated by paſſion and reſentment; and if that Gentleman ſhould ſuffer the ſeverity of their ſentence, I ſhall think myſelf bound by every tie of duty and honour, to retaliate on ſuch unhappy perſons of your army, as may fall within my power, that the reſpect due to flags, and to the law of nations, may be better underſtood and obſerved.</p>
               <p>I have further to obſerve, that forty of the principal inhabitants of South-Carolina have juſtly forfeited their lives, which have hitherto been ſpared by the clemency of His Excellency Sir Henry Clinton, who cannot in juſtice extend his mercy to them any longer, if Major André ſuffers; which in all probability will open a ſcene of blood at which humanity will revolt.</p>
               <p>Suffer me to intreat your Excellency, for your own and the honour of humanity, and the love you have of juſtice, that you ſuffer not an unjuſt ſentence to touch the life of Major André.</p>
               <p>But if this warning ſhould be diſregarded, and he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, I call heaven and earth to witneſs, that your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency will be juſtly anſwerable for the torrent of blood that may be ſpilt in conſequence.</p>

                  <signed>I have the honour to be, with due reſpect, your Excellency's Moſt obedient and very humble ſervant, <hi>B. ARNOLD.</hi>

               <p>BUOY'D above the terror of death, by the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of a life devoted to honourable purſuits, and ſtained with no action that can give me remorſe, I truſt that the requeſt I make to your Excellency at this ſerious period, and which is to ſoften my laſt moments, will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>Sympathy towards a ſoldier will ſurely induce your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and a military tribunal to adopt the mode of my death to the feelings of a man of honour.</p>
               <p>Let me hope, Sir, that if ought in my character im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes you with eſteem towards me, if ought in my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes marks me as the victim of policy and not of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, I ſhall experience the operation of theſe feelings in your breaſt, by being informed that I am not to die on a gibbet.</p>
