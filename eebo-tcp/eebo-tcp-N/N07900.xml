            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Juſtice and Policy of Taxing the American Colonies in Great-Britain, conſidered.</head>
            <p>WHETHER the Commons of England made up a part of the Saxon Witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Mote, hath been a ſubject of great diſpute; and altho' this point has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been fully determined, yet it ſeems to be agreed by the authority of two learned writers,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Spellman and Maddox.</note> that they were always called to attend it, whenever the <hi>exigencies</hi> of the ſtate made a tax <hi>neceſſary;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, to make known their circumſtances, and to ſuggeſt to that aſſembly ſome mode of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was likely to be the leaſt burthenſome to them. This juſt and laudable practice prevailed 'til the time of William the Conqueror, when that prince erected a new court or parliament, of which the commons were no part, and changed the Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial tenure of the Saxons into the Feudal, and annexed certain rents or ſervices to all his grants, from which, together with fines and forfeitures, the crown was abundantly ſupplied; it therefore ſeldom happened that any were taxed in this court; but when it did, they were tallaged to one tenth part of their eſtate only, and none but villeins were ever liable to be taxed at will.</p>
            <p>This method of tallaging thoſe who were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it, continued but for a few reigns after the conqueſt, and then a regular parliament was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed, which conſiſted of the Superior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Barons, Citizens and Burgeſſes, who it is ſaid,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Ld. Coke.</note> at firſt ſat together: But when they had
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010076_0003_0F7C93CB803924E8"/>
formed themſelves into diſtinct houſes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the people laid claim to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and equitable right of taxing themſelves and conſtituents, and have ever ſince, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt propriety and juſtice, enjoyed it.</p>
            <p>From this ſlight view of the mode of impoſing taxes for public benefit, ſo long practiſed in Great-Britain, (in the courſe of which there has been no other interruption, than that occaſioned by the conqueſt) it is clearly to be inferred, that the right of preſcribing the meaſure and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of raiſing all taxes is a conſtitutional one, which was enjoyed by the anceſtors of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts; and the preſent inhabitants of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as early as they have any knowledge of them from hiſtory, and has been handed down to them under the influence of reaſon and juſtice, through a courſe of ſeveral hundred years.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more conſiſtent with the rights and liberties of a free people, than whenever the good of the community requires a part of the private property of Individuals, that they ſhould be allowed to give it in ſuch manner and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as their ſituation and circumſtances can beſt afford; indeed they cannot be free without it: for if any ſublunary power in being, can deprive them of part of their eſtate without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the ſame power may take away the whole; and if it appears to them to be a meaſure of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, proſcribe 'em into the bargain.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of the Colonies upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent (other than thoſe acquired in the late war) have always thought, and I believe ever will think, all the conſtitutional rights and liberties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010076_0004_0F7C93CC65EECCD8"/>
in Great-Britain, at the time they departed from it, their Birth-Right, and that they brought them over with them to America; among which, that of being taxed only by their own conſent, is one of the moſt eſſential.</p>
            <p>It is certainly very natural, that thoſe who tranſport themſelves from one country to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould as well carry with them the Laws and Policy, as the Cuſtoms and Manners of the country from whence they came. But it hath been ſaid from the authority of a very learned Judge,<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Holt. Smith's caſe.</note> that the Colonies are conquered coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and that therefore the law is what the King pleaſes: but however learned and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the perſon might be who gave that opinion, I ſhall not heſitate to declare that I think the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was not well conſidered, and that it was founded on no Law whatever. Puffendorff, in ſpeaking of the different forms of government, takes occaſion of mentioning two methods of treating the inhabitants of conquered countries: one is, when the victor removes 'em to his own country, or gives them the ſame privileges with his former ſubjects; the other is, when they are left to enjoy their antient ſeats, but entirely loſe the ſovereignty of the country. In this laſt caſe, he ſays, they are ſubject to the conqueror; but is the circumſtance of any of the Colonies, other than thoſe already excepted, ſimilar to either of theſe caſes? They ſurely are not. The antient inhabitants of the Colonies have neither been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Great-Britain, or left in poſſeſſion of their lands; nor did they ever ſubmit to, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010076_0005_0F7C93CD1AA6B160"/>
themſelves ſubject to any foreign power upon earth, but have long ſince abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the country, and retired into remote parts of America, where they are governed by their own laws and their own magiſtrates. It therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid with the leaſt propriety, that the laws which theſe Savages alone, had they ſtaid in the country, would have been liable to, as a van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed people, are applicable to the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Colonies, who themſelves, are the conquerors. The earth, the air and trees, are by no means the object of any human laws whatſoever, otherwiſe than as they bear reſpect to the concernments of men. It muſt then be the conquered people, who are ſubject to the laws of the conqueror, and not the country.—The Coloniſts ſeem to ſtand on the ſame footing with thoſe who leave their own country, and ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a new one which was not inhabited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: If they do, and I think it muſt appear ſo to any man who will give himſelf the trouble of conſidering this ſubject, then there is the opinion of the ſame learned Judge<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Holt. Blankard's caſe.</note> in favour of what I have advanced; which is that, the Coloniſts have brought over with them every conſtitutional right, liberty and privilege; and if being taxed only by their own conſent is one of them, they cannot, with the leaſt degree of juſtice, be taxed by the Britiſh parliament, in which they are not repreſented, no perſon in that aſſembly being au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to ſignify their conſent: Few perſons there, are acquainted with their circumſtance, and perhaps none know what mode of taxation would be leaſt burthenſome to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:010076_0006_0F7C93D129AE3638"/>
It hath indeed pleaſed ſome of the honourable members of that auguſt aſſembly to ſay, that the Colonies are virtually repreſented in parliament; but this is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> doctrine which only tends to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Coloniſts a ſhadow of that <hi>ſubſtance</hi> which they muſt ever be ſlaves without. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſurely be conſiſtent with Britiſh liberty, that any ſet of men ſhould repreſent another, detached from them in ſituation and intereſt, without the privity and conſent of the repreſented. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a repreſentative is founded on choice, and is intended for the benefit of the conſtituents: A repreſentative is to act in every reſpect as the perſons who appointed him to that office would do, were they themſelves preſent: And hath the members of the Houſe of Commons, or any of them, been choſe by the Coloniſts to repreſent them? Hath their conduct in reſpect to the Stamp Duty been conſiſtent with the intereſts of the Coloniſts? or hath that conduct been ſuch as the the Coloniſts would have adopted, had they been preſent in parliament? No ſurely: So far from it, there are very few members of that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, who have ever been heard of in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. The Stamp Duty is inconſiſtent with their intereſts, and the mode of impoſing it, deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of their moſt eſſential rights and liberties. It is very fortunate for the preſent members of parliament, that for all that can be done in the Colonies, they have an eſtate for life in their office; for I believe I may venture to ſay, that no Coloniſt in his ſenſes, would ever deſire to be again repreſented by the ſame people.</p>
            <p>To prove that the Coloniſts are within the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010076_0007_0F7C93D20B52D1A8"/>
meaning of the doctrine of virtual repreſentation, they have been compared to the inhabitants of ſeveral corporate towns in England, to the Eaſt-India company, the body of London merchants, to the proprietors of the public funds, to women and children, and in ſhort, to all thoſe who do not vote for the electing of members of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who are all ſaid to be virtually repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: On the juſtice and truth of this compariſon intirely depends the deciſion of this queſtion. It may therefore be neceſſary to obſerve, that by the antient Engliſh conſtitution, none were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually repreſented in parliament, other than Shires, the Cinque-Ports, Cities, and Antient Boroughs, and the elections for them were made by freeholders, and thoſe who held by free bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage tenure; all villeins, copyholders, tenants in antient demeſne, and tenants of lords, were excluded from electing or being elected: but at lateſt, in King John's time, a practice obtained of making free boroughs by charter, by which means they became intitled to ſend members to parliament, and it continued till the reign of King Charles the Second, when the Houſe of Commons voted the elections made by virtue of that King's charters void, and ſo put a ſtop to the practice. From hence it is evident that the right that thoſe derive from their particular ſpecies of property, peculiar franchiſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitancy in particular places, is not an excluſive one, becauſe it either depends on that which may, through the bounty of the crown, be extended, at leaſt to its American ſubjects, or on a certain ſpecies of property that may be bought and ſold,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010076_0008_0F7C93D2402E66E8"/>
and which the Coloniſts are capable of poſſeſſing in any part of the King's dominions. If the right of being actually repreſented in parliament, is conſtitutionally annexed to freehold eſtate, the American freeholders can with no more juſtice be deprived of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than they may of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds. And the power of diſpoſſeſſing them of either, cannot, from the nature of the Britiſh conſtitution, (which is formed on the foundation of ſecuring to every individual his right, liberty and property) be lodged with any other perſons in being, than themſelves: The acknowledging them to have a right of being taxed only by their own conſent, is yielding them that from which they never can derive the leaſt advantage, while ever that of actually chooſing their own repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, is withheld from them.</p>
            <p>The notion of virtual repreſentation, may, for all I know, be conſiſtent enough, while it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to Great-Britain only; its inhabitants inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately reſide together; the intereſt and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thoſe who do not vote for repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, are the ſame with thoſe that do; and are equally well known to, and underſtood by ſuch repreſentatives. It cannot then be imagined, that the virtually repreſented in Great Britain, can ever be ſubject to any impoſition, that will not be extended to, and equally affecting to the electors of members of parliament: And tho' certain corporate towns, the Eaſt-India company, the body of London merchants, proprietors of public funds, the monied intereſt, and women, are not reſpectively as ſuch, actually repreſented in parliament; yet many of the members of them (women excepted) are intitled to vote for repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010076_0009_0F7C93D2FB03C5D8"/>
and if they were not, the influence they, and particularly women (through whoſe means votes are often obtain'd) muſt neceſſarily have, from their intimate acquaintance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the electors, is ſuch as muſt render the choice in a great meaſure agreeable to them. But hath the Colonies any of theſe advantages? They certainly have not: They live above a thouſand leagues from Great-Britain; their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and circumſtance are not ſimilar to thoſe of the Britiſh inhabitants; nor have they been well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered or underſtood by the Britiſh parliament. The Coloniſts have ſuffered many impoſitions, as may be ſeen by the ſeveral acts of trade which have been borne by them alone, and which no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe affected the electors of members of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than as they were obliged to receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ariſing from them. The Coloniſts cannot have the leaſt influence either with the electors or elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are almoſt unknown to either of them, unleſs as mere vehicles of trade; in which light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have been long known and conſidered.</p>
            <p>If thoſe who have been for bringing the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies within the meaning of virtual repreſentation, by comparing them to certain corporate towns and perſons in England, had been pleaſed to mention why thoſe places and people are virtually repreſented in parliament, they muſt at the ſame time have proved that there is no ſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Colonies; for all theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lay, and body of men reſide in, ſome county or other of Great-Britain; and tho' nine tenths of the inhabitants of any county ſhould not be intitled to vote at an election, yet are they a part of that county, and as ſuch, may be virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

repreſented by thoſe who have been elected to repreſent the whole county: But here the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually repreſented know their repreſentatives, and may, indiſcriminately with the freeholders, at any time, inſtruct them what part to act in caſes of importance: But I ſhould be glad to be informed, in what county in England the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies are ſituated? If in no one at all; who are their particular virtual repreſentatives? To ſay that they are repreſented by the whole body of the Houſe of Commons, will be to leave them without that advantage of giving their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives occaſional inſtructions, which the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually repreſented in England have; for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined, that the conduct of the Houſe of Commons can ever be ſubject to the direction of the Coloniſts. The ſame reaſon then why certain perſons in England (who have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from voting at elections, merely for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency) may be virtually repreſented in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth not hold good in reſpect of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; I therefore conclude that they cannot be repreſented in the ſame manner: But if it ſhould be ſtill inſiſted upon, that they are, I would then humbly propoſe, that the Colonies be divided into five hundred and fifty-eight diſtricts, and that each of them be numbered; that for the future, all writs of election in England, ſhall direct the voters to chuſe a perſon to ſit and vote in parliament as real repreſentative of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, city, or borough, for which ſuch writ ſhall be iſſued; and as virtual repreſentative of the five hundred and fifty-eighth part of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſuch a number; and that each diſtrict be made acquainted with its particular virtual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative.

By this means the Coloniſts will know, to whom they are to direct their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and will ſo far be upon a footing with the virtually repreſented in Great-Britain. That the notion of the Coloniſts being virtually repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in parliament, is of late date, is evident from the numberleſs acts of oppreſſion and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny that have been practiſed upon them by officers of the crown commiſſioned in England, and ſent over to America, which have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly made known, and complained of in England; and whenever it hath happened that they were conveyed to the Royal Ear in Council, it hath conſtantly been thro' the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Board of Trade: But in no one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that I know of, did ever the Britiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament repreſent to the crown any grievances felt only in the Colonies, or make application to the Sovereign for a redreſs of them, and as a grand inqueſt for the whole kingdom, (had they thought themſelves the repreſentatives of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies) they would never have negligently paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over a duty which was indiſpenſibly incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon them. And that the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth take cognizance of ſuch ſubjects, when they happen in Great-Britain, is undeniably true; and would it not be want of humanity, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they have always conſidered themſelves as the repreſentatives of the Colonies, and yet have ever neglected to render them an eſſential ſervice, to which all thoſe they repreſent, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably intitled. To the inhabitants of the Colonies I have been ſpeaking of, the crown has been graciouſly pleaſed to grant reſpectively the means of exerciſing their conſtitutional rights,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010076_0012_0F7C93D58B3B1B58"/>
I have now before me a Charter given by King Charles the Second to the province of Carolina, and obſerve, one of the principal objects of this Charter, was to encourage the ſettlement of that colony, in which few reſided at the time it was granted; nor was it then likely that many would leave their native country, wherein they enjoyed every right and liberty an excellent conſtitution could afford, and come over to the deſarts of America, unleſs by ſome means or other, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of thoſe rights and liberties in Carolina, could be ſecured to them and their poſterity: One of theſe was, to be taxed only by their own conſent, ſignified in parliament by repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives actually choſen by themſelves; and as the remote ſituation of Carolina from Great-Britain, rendered it impoſible for thoſe who ſhould inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit that province, to run over to England when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a new parliament was to be ſummoned.—King Charles thought proper to grant, that an aſſembly ſhould be called and eſtabliſhed by the proprietors, and that the freemen of Carolina, ſhould conſent, by themſelves, or deputies in that aſſembly, to all laws whatſoever, that might reſpect the public ſtate of the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or territory, or of any diſtinct or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar county. And had the crown conſidered the Coloniſts as being virtually repreſented in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch a grant would have been extreamly abſurd; for no ſet of people can be repreſented at one time in two diſtinct and independent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, which may counteract each other: This might be to make the repreſented grant and refuſe in one inſtant the ſame thing, which is impoſſible, from the nature of the human
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010076_0013_0F7C93D617414AF8"/>
mind. That it is a matter intirely new in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, further appears, from the conſtant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated applications that have been made by the Crown in the courſe of the laſt war, to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in the Colonies, for ſupplies; which, if the Britiſh parliament could have given, might as eaſily have been aſked for in England; and in all probability, would have been much more liberally granted; but the parliament had not then imagined themſelves the repreſentatives of the Coloniſts; if they had, would they not have interpoſed and aſſerted their right of taxing their conſtituents? more eſpecially, as the poverty of the Coloniſts often obliged them to grant much leſs than the Crown required, and the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then became proportionably heavier in Great-Britain, as it was lighter in America; would they not have acquainted the King that they were the Colony repreſentatives, and that the Coloniſts might be much more copiouſly taxed in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than it was likely they wou'd chooſe to be, if their conſent was to be aſked in their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial aſſemblies? Without doubt they would; but the truth is, the notion of their being virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repreſented, had not then an exiſtence, but hath been ſince introduced, to cover the ſhackles which have been prepared for the Coloniſts in their preſent ſtate of inability, by thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly attentive to themſelves, forget that the Coloniſts are their fellow-ſubjects; that they were born free, and are intitled to every Britiſh conſtitutional right and liberty, as well as themſelves; or that to do them injuſtice, is as criminal, as to deal unjuſtly with thoſe they really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. To impoſe a Tax on the Colonies, in the Britiſh parliament, appears to me, to be a meaſure almoſt as impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic, as it is inconſiſtent with the rights of the Coloniſts;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010076_0014_0F7C93D6B6D8C580"/>
for as they are unalterably of opinion, that ſuch an impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no leſs arbitrary than oppreſſive, it will by degrees alienate their affections from the Mother Country; the ſeeds of diſcontent will be ſowed in the Colonies, and children will be taught to hate the name of thoſe who have enſlaved their country; the principles of diſaffection will increaſe with their years, and the ſpirit of rebellion grow formidable with their numbers; and in the courſe of a century or two, it will coſt Great-Britain more to keep them in their ſtate of ſubjection, than all the profits ariſing from them, will pay: And if it did not, the ſtory of Julius Caeſar, is enough to ſhew that there is danger in a ſtanding army abroad.</p>
            <p>The Stamp Duty is itſelf a burthen too great for the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Colonies to bear, conſidering the many reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have been put upon their trade, which are at preſent rigorouſly enforced throughout America: It will occaſion a diſcontinuance of induſtry, and muſt in the end, reduce them to a ſtate of beggary; they will no longer be able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the manufactures of the Mother Country, or furniſh her with materials for making new ones. Great Britain then loſes a trade, from which ſhe hath derived her greateſt opulence and dignity, and this too by inſiſting on a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure deſtructive of the peace and happineſs of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of as loyal ſubjects as any the King has. Can this be conſiſtent with the wiſdom and humanity of a Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I think it cannot. The act impoſing a Stamp Duty, will ſurely be repealed, as ſoon its conſequences are well conſidered. I am perſuaded, the more cloſely united the Mother Country and the Colonies are, the happier it will be for both; but ſuch an union will never take effect, but upon a foundation of equality: They muſt be upon ſuch a footing, as that each may advance the other's intereſt, while he labours for his own. A very ſenſible and elegant writer<note n="(a)" place="bottom">CATO's Letters.</note> in ſpeaking of Colonies, hath obſerved that, <q>It is not to be hoped, in the corrupt ſtate of human nature, that any naton will be ſubject to another, any longer than it finds its own account in it, and cannot help itſelf. Every man's firſt thought will be for himſelf and his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; and he will not be long to ſeek for arguments to juſtify his being ſo, when he knows how to attain what he propoſes. Men will think it hard to work, toil, and run hazards, for the advantage of others, any longer than they find their own intereſt in it; and eſpecially for thoſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010076_0015_0F7C93D9F244ED50"/>
who uſe them ill: All nature points out that courſe. No creature ſucks the teats of their dams, longer than they can draw milk from thence, or can provide themſelves with better food; nor will any country continue their ſubjection to another, only becauſe their great grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were acquainted. This is the courſe of human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and all wiſe ſtates will always have it before their eyes. They will well conſider, therefore, how to preſerve the advantages ariſing from Colonies, and avoid the evil. And I conceive that there can be but two ways in nature to hinder them from throwing off their dependence; one to keep it out of their power, and the other out of their will. The firſt muſt be by force, and the latter by uſing them well, and keeping them employed in ſuch produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and making ſuch manufactures as will ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and families comfortably, and procure them wealth too; or at leaſt, not prejudice their Mother Country.—Force can never be uſed effectually to anſwer the end, without deſtroying the Colonies themſelves. Liberty and Encouragement are neceſſary to carry people thither; and violence will hinder both, &amp;c.</q>—I do not pretend to be politician enough to point out the methods that will moſt effectually ſecure the dependency of the Colonies; but I am as much convinced, that juſt and equitable ones may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and purſued, as I am, that force and oppreſſion will one day or other, produce a contrary effect. It would be no injuſtice that the Colonies ſhould bear a proportionable part of the heavy expence that hath been incurred in the courſe of the late war; and I am perſuaded, that no man of ſenſe in the Colonies would oppſe it; but they ſhould be allowed to conſent to it, according to their conſtitutional right, in their own provincial aſſemblies, where they are really repreſented: And in eſtimating ſuch proportion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, their number, circumſtance, and the reſtrictions on their trade, ſhould be conſidered: But if the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will inſiſt on taxing the Coloniſts, as their virtual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, then are they ſtripped of that conſtitutional right on which their liberty and property depends, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the moſt abject ſtate of ſlavery: A ſituation, in which, it is very unnatural to think, a Mother can take pleaſure in viewing her Children.</p>
