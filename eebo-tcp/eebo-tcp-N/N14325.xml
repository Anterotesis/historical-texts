         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A TESTIMONY from our Monthly Meeting at Wainfleet, in the County of Lincoln, concerning our deceaſed Friend WILLIAM RECKITT.</head>
                  <p>THIS our worthy friend was born in the year 1706, within the compaſs of Gainſborough month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, of parents profeſſing truth, who died when he was young. His friends put him apprentice to a weaver belonging to the ſame monthly meeting, with whom we believe he ſerved his time faithfully, and then came to live near Partney Mills, within the compaſs of our monthly meeting. After ſome time, about the year 1742, it pleaſed the Lord to call him into the work of the miniſtry: his appearance from the firſt was in the life and wiſdom of Truth, which nearly united him to his friends. Soon after he removed to Wainfleet particular meeting; and ſome time after he viſited friends in
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:018146_0004_0FA56106388C8448"/>
the Weſt of England, and Wales, &amp;c, and at different times many other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; alſo Ireland once with our friend Samuel Stott. He was twice in America: the firſt time he ſet forward in the year 1756, and, it being in the time of war, was taken priſoner into France, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined about ſix months, which he bore with Chriſtian fortitude (as ſome of us have heard him ſay) and got well home to his family in the beginning of the year 1757, where he ſlaid about four weeks, and then again ſet forward for his intended viſit. He afterward found a weighty concern to viſit his friends in ſome part of America again; all which viſits, by ſundry accounts received, were much to friends ſatisfaction, as well as his own: and indeed it may be truly ſaid, he was deep in the miniſtry, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in prayer, his teſtimony found, and edifying, which rendered him very near, and valuable to many. He was grave in converſation, yet innocently cheerful amongſt his friends; an affectionate huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and a tender parent. We think it needleſs to enlarge concerning him, as he was well known to many friends; only we may, with ſincerity of heart, ſay, his removal is much regretted in general. In
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:018146_0005_0FA561071F120290"/>
the latter end of 1768, he had drawings in his mind to viſit London, and parts adjacent; in which he told ſome of his near friends, he thought it might be the laſt time.</p>
                  <p>He returned home in the firſt month, in the year 1769, but poorly in health, and continued ſo; but moſtly attended his own meeting, where he had ſeveral weighty teſtimonies (which had more than uſual influence over the hearers, leaving laſting impreſſions on their minds) as well as at times in private converſation, wherein he ſignified he was willing to leave all theſe tranſitory and fading en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, whenever it might pleaſe the Lord to call him from works to rewards.</p>
                  <p>His illneſs was very ſhort; he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a fit of the ague the day before his departure, and next morning, about four o'clock, exchanged this life, we make no doubt, for a better, the ſixth of the fourth month 1769, and was buried the 9th of the ſame in friends burying ground at Wainfleet, after a ſolemn meeting, where a living teſtimony was borne to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>OUR late worthy friend WILLIAM RECKITT, whoſe journal follows, was one whom the Lord was pleaſed to prepare for his ſervice; and having in a good degree experienced the work of righteouſneſs to be peace, he was engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under the influence of divine love, to call to others to come, taſte, and ſee that the Lord is good.</p>
                  <p>His life and converſation were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and conſiſtent with his profeſſion, and, in the exerciſe of his miniſtry, he was attended with that love which ſeeks the good of all.</p>
                  <p>As the following journal commences only with his voyage to America, a ſhort account of him, of the work of truth on his mind, and of his ſervices before he embarked for America, ſeems not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:018146_0008_0FA561092A24D950"/>He was born at Lea, near Gainſborough, in Lincolnſhire, about the year 1706, of parents profeſſing truth; his mother died when he was young, and his father being through infirmities rendered incapable of ſupporting his children, he was bound by friends at nine years of age, until he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at twenty-one, as an apprentice to a weaver; which proved a laborious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, his maſter being in low circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. In the courſe of his ſervice his maſter let him out to harveſt work, in which employment his induſtry gained him the confidence of the farmer that employed him, who thought it unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to look alter him, ſaying, <q>William was a faithful ſervant;</q> as he was to his maſter to the end of his apprenticeſhip. During which time he was reached by a divine viſitation, through the miniſtry of a friend on a religious viſit, whole teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (as he has been heard to relate) clearly anſwered the witneſs of truth in his own heart, and fully confirmed him, that the principles of friends were conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Holy Scriptures; and he then thought there would be none ſo void of underſtanding, as not to be convinced by the ſame powerful declaration of the true Chriſtian faith. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>es thereof, he experienced pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from the many temptations, which unguarded youth are expoſed to. About the eighteenth year of his age, the death of an only ſiſter, a virtuous young woman, who had been particularly kind to him, nearly affected him; and an only brother, by giving way to the vanities of the world, was drawn aſide, and left the ſociety. Theſe events impreſſed his mind with deep ſorrow and humiliation; but feeling the preſerving hand of divine goodneſs manifeſted for his ſupport, he was engaged to live near thereto, by which he was mercifully preſerved.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the expiration of his appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip, he removed into the compaſs of Wainfleet monthly meeting in Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where he followed the buſineſs of a weaver, and increaſed in the eſteem of of his friends; being a man who labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in reality what he profeſſed. In the year 1731, he entered into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſtate with Ellin Maw, a ſober and virtuous young woman, who was an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate wife to him, and tender mother to their children: he ſurvived her, ſhe

dying during his abſence on his ſecond viſit to America.</p>
                  <p>About the thirty-ſixth year of his age, he firſt appeared in the miniſtry to the ſatisfaction of friends, and laboured di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently in his own and ſome neighbouring meetings for the advancement of truth; and after ſome time, in company with Robert Kinſley, he viſited the churches in Eſſex; and about the latter end of 1745, in company with the ſame friend, alſo viſited the city of London; and his ſervice in this viſit is ſtill remembered by ſome with brotherly regard and affection.</p>

concerning this our deceaſed friend; but to ſhew the reader, that ſuch as believe in, and live near to, the divine principle of truth in their own hearts, convey an evidence to the minds of thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them: for he being taken in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by a privateer (England being then at war with France) and carried into Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laix, was there detained in a painful ſtate of captivity, yet was preſerved in great quietneſs and reſignation, to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome of the French inhabitants; one of whom, in a letter to a perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in London, mentioned his innoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive lamb-like behaviour, in terms of great reſpect, and when he was removed to Carhaix, recommended him to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of account, a member of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Brittany, who likewiſe teſtified his regard to him. The kindneſs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from theſe perſons moderated his captivity, though he had many exerciſes there, which often brought him very low; yet, he found ſupport and preſervation, as he acknowledged in his letters, in one of which, after having noted how he had been helped, and expreſſing his care for his future preſervation, he ſays: <q>My fears have all been concerning myſelf, for ſurely I never ſaw more of my own weakneſs, it hath indeed been a ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>HAVING parted with ſeveral friends who accompanied me to Graveſend, the fifteenth of the tenth month 1756, I went on board the ſhip Lydia, Joſeph Riddell maſter. We had three paſſengers beſides myſelf, who ſeemed to be very ſober men, and carried themſelves very loving to me, as likewiſe did all our common men; though I often reproved them for ſwearing, and their
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018146_0014_0FA561123602D3F8"/>
bad language to one another. The 20th we came into the Downs, but the wind not being fair, we lay there till the 22d, when the wind coming more favourable, we weighed anchor.</p>
                  <p>It may not be amiſs to mention the great exerciſe and weight that reſted upon my ſpirit while we lay here, I then not ſeeing the cauſe of it. When I looked forward, I could ſee little further than the Land's End, and I cried in my mind that we might be carried, or driven to Ireland; for then I thought I ſhould get ſafe to my journey's end: but not ſeeing it would be ſo then, I only deſired we might put into Plymouth, which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the captain, and he told me, he thought he would. But the wind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair, and a ſtrong gale, he was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the beſt of it. We outſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two ſhips which came from the Downs with us, one a privateer called the St. Olive, from London; the other a Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaman. The 24th, about ten in the morning, we came abreaſt of Plymouth, with a very fine wind. In the evening, as I ſat in the cabin, ſomething opened in my mind concerning my own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which I thought ſomewhat ſtrange; but ſoon ſaw a cauſe for it. For about eight o'clock next morning,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018146_0015_0FA56112F519AC78"/>
the mate came down and told his maſter, there was a French ſnow juſt aſtern of us, which, to our ſorrow, was too true, for ſhe was then within reach of us with her guns. I thought it was a great neglect of our maſter, and the ſailors, that they did not keep a ſtrict look-out; for they acknowledged, if they had but had a few hours more, they ſhould not have been taken. But then it was too late, they could not get their ſails all properly bent, as they would have done, if due precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been taken. The ſhot coming over us, I was afraid for our men.</p>
                  <p>During the little time we were chaſed, the chief care our captain ſeemed to take, was to ſave what he had, ſo he kept pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much in the cabin, till his men called very earneſtly for him to come upon deck. Then he ordered them to ſtrike, and in a little time the Frenchmen came and board<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed us with great fury. I was in the cabin, and ſtood ſtill, ſome of them looking at me very ſour and fierce, but like ſo many hungry animals, they fell to hunting and ſearching for what they could find, till they durſt not ſtay much longer. One of them coming to me, in a fawning manner, ſaid, Sir, I deſire you would give me your money, and watch, and I will give you them again. I told him I
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018146_0016_0FA56113E6881708"/>
had not much, and did not chuſe to part with it. But he growing very earneſt to have it, I turned myſelf about, and took three guineas out of my purſe, two of which I carried on ſhore, and gave him the remainder. He looked at it, and ſeemed not ſatisfied; but the officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in haſte to get us all into the boat, I was had upon deck. When I looked at the ſea, I thought it ſeemed as though I ſhould not eſcape with my life; therefore reſolved to ſtay on board our veſſel, if I might, and went down again into the cabin; but in a little time was fetched out, and commanded to get into the boat. The fear of death was then taken away, and I was reſolved to do the beſt I could to get in. One of our ſailors handed me a rope, but it was ſo ſhort, I was forced to let go, not knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould fall into the ſea, or boat; for the ſea ran very high, and two of our men were loſt during the ſhort time I had been below. They were getting into the boat when I was ſeized with fear, and I ſaw it was not groundleſs; for had I then proceeded to get in, I ſhould in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability have been drowned. For as ſoon as I had turned my back to go down into the cabin, the gunwale of the ſhip took the boat ſide, and had like to have ſunk

her, and the two poor men were caſt out, the loſs of whom ſorrowfully affected my mind; and the imminent danger I had been in, with a ſenſe of the Lord's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy in preſerving me at that time, brought me very low, in humble thankfulneſs for ſo great a deliverance, looking upon it as a mark of his tender care and fatherly regard for ſo poor a creature as I am.</p>
                  <p>When we came up to the French ſhip, our men aſſiſted me in getting on board, and led me through a crowd of ſuch creatures, as I thought were more like brutes than men; but they offered me no violence. When I came into the cabin, I was placed behind a large cheſt of arms, which was their table; where I ſat for ſeveral hours, very ſtill, and laboured to get to ſuch a right and true compoſure of mind, that I might be enabled to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, with patience, what was then befallen me.</p>
                  <p>The hurry about the booty being pretty much over, towards night they came to ſettle in the cabin; and ſeeing me take little notice of what they either ſaid or did, they looked earneſtly at me, and aſked our captain who I was. He told <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018146_0018_0FA561152DDA3090"/>
many fine ſpeeches, and told me, I was welcome to any thing they had, and would have me call for what I wanted. When meat came to table, they invited me to eat; but I told them I was not for eating, my appetite being quite gone. When they thought it was time for us to go to bed, I was had down into the hold, which was ſo cloſe, and the hammocks hung ſo near to one another, I was forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to creep on my hands and knees, till I came to that I was to lodge in. The young man that conducted me was one of the officers, and I unſterſtood he put me in his own hammock. As he was making it fit, I thought he ſeemed to do it with a very good will; but the place being ſtrait, and I lying in all my clothes, made it hard work for me to get in. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he ſtaid and helped me what he could, till I was ſettled in my new lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A few hours after I had plenty of company. As they crept under me they lifted me up, and when they were all plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their reſpective lodgings, I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome lay upon the boards under me. However, the cloſeneſs of the place, and the diſagreeable ſmell, with a fear which then ſeized my mind, that theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would do me ſome miſchief, had like to have quite overſet me, ſo that I
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018146_0019_0FA561160C367AE8"/>
was nigh fainting away, and ready to query, whether I ſhould live till morning. In this great ſtrait the Lord appeared for my help. I ſenſibly felt ſtrength admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, and it aroſe in my mind, that thoſe I was afraid of would not hurt me. I believed it was the truth, and in a little time, being much wearied, I fell into a ſound ſleep till morning. When I came upon deck, our poor men came to me, and complained of their hard lodgings, and what was worſe, the thoughts of a cloſe impriſonment when they ſhould come on ſhore. It made me ſorrowful to hear their complaints, for they had heard the priſoners fared very poorly. I ſpake as comfortably as I could, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to live in the fear of the Lord. This day we came up with a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel bound for Plymouth, taken from the French by one of our ſhips of war. The French ſoon brought her too, boarded her, and brought all the men to us but one. The two officers were had into the cabin where we were. The captain being a man of very ſtrong paſſions, to be taken priſoner was almoſt more than he could bear: When they were ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e down, I ſaw he was almoſt overcome with grief, which I a little wondered at. After ſome time I went and ſat by him, and ſaid I would
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018146_0020_0FA56116AA1BD8A0"/>
not have him too much caſt down; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſappointment happened to all men, and this was what ſuch men as he might reaſonably expect. He ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as I remember, but ſoon went out, and after a while came again with a Frenchman along with him, who could ſpeak Engliſh, and pretended great friendſhip to me, and requeſted that I would go along with him and the captain into a private place, for he was deſirous to have ſome diſcourſe with me. It did not ſeem to ſuit my inclination, but through their much importuning me, I went. When we were ſettled, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman told me, he had been attended with misfortunes even from his childhood, and thought he had been in a fair way of making his fortune, but he had met with this diſappointment, which was like to be a great loſs to him. He then began to talk about religion, and expreſſed a great deſire in his heart to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ve in the fear of the Lord. He ſpoke highly of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies uſed amongſt them, mentioning bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with water, and bread and wine, which they call the ſacrament. I told him we were not in the practice of uſing them, believing ſuch ceremonies not to be eſſential to ſalvation. He ſaid I was a ſtrange man, but finding myſelf not at
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018146_0021_0FA5611773B551E8"/>
all diſpoſed to have any farther diſcourſe at that time, I deſired to withdraw.</p>
                  <p>I was much favoured with ſtillneſs, and a ſweet compoſure of mind, which to my great comfort, I found did ſtrengthen and fortify me againſt the aſſaults of the enemy, which I met with both inwardly and outwardly. When I looked at my preſent ſituation, and what was likely to be the conſequence, fearing I might be a ſtumbling-block in the way of many, and bring diſhonour to Truth, I was much caſt down, and did often cry, <q>Lord, if I had been worthy, thou wouldſt have preſerved me out of the hands of ſuch unreaſonable men.</q> But the good Shepherd of Iſrael did caſt his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of love over me and ſtilled my cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that I was in a good degree made willing to ſubmit to what he ſhould ſee meet to ſuffer to come upon me. Whilſt I was here, ſervent and ſtrong deſires were in my heart for thoſe I had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, in many places, that they might be preſerved in the fear of the Lord. As to outward food, I eat very little ſeveral days. Many ſaid, I ſhould be ſick, and often intreated me to eat; but I did not eat much, till I found I could take it both with freedom of mind, and a good appetite, which had been quite gone.

The Frehchmen, as I frequently walked upon deck amongſt them, were become milder, and never offered to do me any harm, except one at the firſt, and he was prevented from hurting me. I alſo ſat, and walked often upon quarter deck, the officers all looking on me with a pleaſant countenance, except the captain, who, I ſuppoſe, took offence at my not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them when they went to prayers, which was twice a day,</p>
                  <p>One evening, as we were ſitting in the cabin, a young Frenchman aſked the man of war's captain before mentioned (pointing at me) concerning our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. He told him, we were a ſtrange people; we both diſowned baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper. The Frenchman looked at me with diſdain, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeak much in behalf of both, laying great ſtreſs, eſpecially upon the latter; for he ſeemed a very zealous young man far their way. Then both joining, they came to a concluſion, that thoſe who were not in the practice of them, could not be ſaved. Their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was in Latin, and though I am not a Latin ſcholar, I underſtood ſo much, that I gathered the purport of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.

the people called Quakers to that man. He aſked in what? I told him, I underſtood he had been telling him we diſowned baptiſm, and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. He ſaid, he underſtood by me, that we did not own the ſacraments. I told him, there was no ſuch word made uſe of in ſcripture, that I knew of; but baptiſm and the ſupper were, and we owned and believed both to be eſſential to ſalvation. My mind was then opened concerning baptiſm, in the ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of ſcripture, which ſtrengthen and confirm it, that the baptiſm, which is ſaving, muſt needs be ſpiritual; and if ſo, then no need of water: for the apoſtle ſaith, <q>One Lord, one faith, one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</q> Eph. iv. 5. and that themſelves owned water to be but an outward and viſible ſign of an inward and ſpiritual grace. I was led on, till I came to that laſt ſupper or paſſover, which our Lord did partake of with his diſciples; and told them what our Lord then ſaid to his diſciples, was, <q>As often as ye do this, do it in remembrance of me, to ſhew forth my death until I come.</q> This was no commandment to perpetuate that outward ſupper, or paſſover; that being a Jewiſh ordinance, which he then had nigh finiſhed, when he nailed the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018146_0024_0FA5611E730A2D68"/>
of ordinances to his croſs. But I told them, they might ſee in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of John, what he ſaid concerning his coming, where he faith, <q>Behold I ſtand at the door, and knock; and if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and ſup with him, and he with me.</q> Rev. iii. 20. It is this ſupper and coming we own, and in our meaſure partake of; for this was the communion of the ſaints. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral texts of ſcripture opening in my mind to confirm that baptiſm and ſupper, which are ſaving, to be ſpiritual; and as bodily exerciſe profiteth little, ſo that which is only outward and elementary, could not profit the ſoul. They heard me very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and did not make any objections. Being pretty eaſy, I left them to have their diſcourſe to themſelves, that the officer might have opportunity to inform the man what I had ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Now our confinement at ſea was nigh over, but as we came nigh in with the ſhore, we were chaſed by an Engliſh man of war, who came faſt up with us, and gave our men great expectations of being releaſed; and indeed the Frenchmen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no other than to be taken. Every man prepared himſelf for removing, and was in great fear; but we were ſo near

the rocks, the man of war durſt follow us no farther, only gave us one ſhot, which came over us, and then ſheered off. The great expectation our men were in of being retaken being diſappointed, made them more ſorrowful than before; but it did not much affect me, for I was now more reconciled in my mind, to bear with patience what the Lord ſhould ſee meet to try me with. I had ſtrongly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired before not to go to France, but in a few hours we came into a ſmall harbour, with a fort at the entrance, and in it one ſhip of war. We did not land till next morning. This night I met with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was very unpleaſant to me, for the captain going on ſhore, and the men thinking all ſecure, when night came on, moſt of them went to reſt; but the man of war's captain, and ſome of his men, as it afterwards appeared, had conſulted about cutting the veſſel out of the harbour. We had more liberty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this night than we had before. The two man of war's men, our captain, and myſelf, were ordered to lie in the cabin. Riddel had lain in it before, but now he was to lie in the captain's hammock, being a favourite, and I in his bed; but he not accepting of it, I got in. This I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived gave great offence, therefore, to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018146_0026_0FA561208F343258"/>
prevent further trouble, I ſoon quitted it, and ſat me down by the man of war's captain, who had got to writing</p>
                  <p>I had by this time contracted ſuch an intimacy with him, that I could make bold to ſee what he was writing, without giving him any offence; and when I came to ſee what he was writing, and found it was only to ſpend time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it gave me ſome uneaſineſs, for it then began to be late. I did not ſuddenly ſay any thing to him, but took notice of his motions and looks, and ſaw his countenance was very much diſcompoſed. All began now to be very ſtill. None were up in the cabin but him and myſelf, and the young French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man before-mentioned, who kept guard, and he had no weapon in his hand. I aſked the captain if he was not for bed. He ſaid, he could not go to bed. I then told him, I would not have him think of making any attempts to take the veſſel out of the harbour. He ſaid, he ſhould make no difficulty of it, if he had any body to ſtand by him. I ſignified, I thought it could not be done without much blood-ſhedding, if at all; and I ſhould be very ſorry to ſee any thing of that kind, though my liberty was as dear to me as any of theirs. He ſaid, I need not be afraid; no body would hurt me.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018146_0027_0FA561212EA711C8"/>
I told him, that was more than he knew; for as I had been with them all the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they would think I had a hand in the plot, and ſo I might loſe my life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly.</p>
                  <p>I laid before him all the difficulties I was capable of, as that of lying under the fort, and their man of war a little diſtance off, with a very rocky harbour to get out of; all which ſeemed to have but little effect on him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o I thought it was beſt to conſult my own ſafety; for if there was a ſkirmiſh, I ſhould, if I ſtaid there, be in the midſt of it. So I went down to my old lodgings; but could find no reſt for my body, my mind being very unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. I therefore crept out again, all being ſtill in the ſhip, and but few upon deck. I went into the cabin, where I found them as I left them; but having a little more courage than before, I told the captain I was reſolved to hinder any diſturbance, if I could; adding he ſurely was not in his right ſenſes to think of any ſuch thing, as his men, I ſuppoſed, knew nothing of it. He ſaid I was miſtaken, for he had told one or two of them in the evening, and they would acquaint all the reſt, and he could have them all up in a few minutes.</p>

I was in a great ſtrait how to act, but thought it would be beſt to endeavour to keep peace if I could, having ſaid as much as was neceſſary. I therefore ſat me down cloſe by him, with an intent to lay hold of him if he offered to take up a weapon, which was very nigh at hand. Great ſtrugglings were in his mind, as he himſelf afterwards confeſſed. He often was juſt upon the point; but the Lord, in his great mercy, did interpoſe, and my mind began to be calm and ſtill, and all fear was taken away. I then looking at him, ſaw his countenance became more compoſed and ſolid. I aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him if he would not go to bed. He threw down his pen, and ſaid he would. The young Frenchman ſat by all this time, but perceived nothing of their deſign.</p>
                  <p>The night was pretty far ſpent, and the men, who had walked the deck a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, thinking nothing would be done, went down to their beds; and when I had ſeen the maſter ſettled in his, I lay me down upon a bulk head of the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018146_0029_0FA56122AD7CE9A8"/>
ſhip, which was ſo narrow, I could only lie upon my ſide: there being nothing better in the cabin that I could find. But my mind being eaſy, after the pain it had been in, I fell aſleep. It was a very cold night, and the partition of our cabin was but canvaſs. When I awaked I was ſtiff, but I did not take cold. The Lord was pleaſed to preſerve me, though I often ſaid in my mind, I did not think myſelf worthy, and more eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſuffered this great exerciſe to come upon me; which, I ſeveral times was made ſenſible, would have been a light matter with him to have hindered, if he had ſeen meet. I often cried to him in the ſecret of my heart, that if there was any iniquity lodging in me, he would be pleaſed to take it away; and if this my going was not conſiſtent with his will, that he would be pleaſed to ſhew me how, and wherein I had miſſed my way; that I might not bring a reproach upon the Truth, and a trouble and exerciſe upon his people. It was not long we had to ſtay amongſt this ſort of company, for by that time the ſun was up, the captain, with ſeveral more ſuch as himſelf, came aboard; alſo two of their friars in their odd ſort of dreſs; I ſuppoſe to ſee what they could get in the ſcramble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="unknown:018146_0030_0FA561236C021918"/>When breakfaſt was over, as ſeveral of us were to be ſearched before they took their leave of us, thoſe appointed to do that buſineſs ſtaid in the cabin. The captain and ſeveral others went out, and I amongſt the reſt, but was ſoon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in again, for they ſearched me one of the firſt. When I came in, they told me, they wanted my money. I ſaid not much to them, but thought if they had it they ſhould take it from me; ſo they began to ſearch me, and took what they could find (which was but one guinea in money) and all other things they found about me of any value; but my wearing clothes they gave me again. When they had ſearched me as long as they thought fit, they let me go, but they were not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for they had got it into their minds that I had a conſiderable ſum of money, and a gold watch; therefore I was no ſooner gone out, but they ordered me in again, and I was ſearched in every part where they thought any money could be concealed. I was ſo grieved with them, I could not hold my peace, but ſaid, they pretended to be gentlemen, and men of honour, but now they did not appear to be ſuch; for it was good works which made men truly honourable; and as to what they could do to me, I ſaid, I was
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018146_0031_0FA56124982E5690"/>
not afraid of. Indeed, all fear was taken away from me: I did not ſeem afraid of my life, but whether I did well in telling them ſo, I afterwards queried; for I thought that courage was only given me for my own ſupport, and not to laviſh away at that rate. However, I came off pretty well, for they let me put on and carry away as many clothes as ſerved to keep me warm.</p>
                  <p>We were on board eleven days, and then were landed near a town called Roſcone. When we came to it, many people were gathered to ſee us, amongſt whom was a mixture of black coats: two of them came to me, and one tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of my ſleeve, aſked me, as I ſuppoſed, what religion I was of, and whether I could ſpeak Latin. I told them, as I was a priſoner, they had no buſineſs with me, and i did not incline to have any diſcourſe with them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired they would not aſk me any more queſtions. They turned off, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He is for no controverſy. If I had been aſked an honeſt queſtion concerning the hope that is in me, I believe I ſhould have had an anſwer according to Truth; but pearls ought not to be caſt before ſwine.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I had got quit of the two
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018146_0032_0FA561251C26E8C0"/>
prieſts, there came a man to me, who ſeemed to be of ſome conſiderable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the world, and ſaid, he was ſorry to ſee me there; but it was the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of war He wiſhed me ſafe in England again. He went to one of his acquaintance who lived in the town, and after ſome diſcourſe, he came and invited me and Riddel, with the other two, to his houſe, and ſet before us ſuch as they had, and deſired us to eat and drink. There was alſo a woman in the houſe, much concerned about our having to walk to Morlaix that night, which was twelve miles, and ſent to hire horſes, but none were to be had. She therefore gave ſtrict charge to the ſoldiers that conducted us, to hire horſes at the next place, and ſhe would pay the charge. I wiſh many may follow her example in being kind to ſtrangers; for what ſhe did I thought was of great ſervice to me. The ſoldiers hired horſes for four of us when we came to the next town, which was four miles. This town was pretty large, and there were many ſpectators. That they might have a full view of us, the ſoldiers had us into a convenient place, and ſtood round us at a little diſtance. The people gathered ſo thick, they could ſcarce ſtand one by another; and in this poſture they
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018146_0033_0FA56129DD00BA78"/>
kept us about half an hour. Then they had us to an inn, where we were put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a large chamber, and meat and drink were ſet before us. But before we were well ſat down, ſeveral men and women of the upper rank came in; the rabble ſtayed moſtly below.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt we were at meat, ſome of them turned up my coat laps, and examined what my clothes were made of as well as they could, and commended them for being good. They ſeemed not to take ſo much notice of any as they did of me; often pointing at me, ſaying, I was a miniſter, a prieſt. Several gay women ſat behind the table, where they had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to look at me as much as they pleaſed. They were very light and airy, which I ſhewed ſome diſlike to, and told them I had heard the French uſed good manners, and knew how to behave well; but it could not be ſaid ſo of them, for it was not good manners to come into our room without leave, and when they were in, not to behave ſoberly and well. I ſoon perceived I had an interpreter, for ſome among them underſtood Engliſh, and informed the reſt; upon which they left the room, and it was ſoon pretty clear. After them came in ſeveral young men, who both looked and behaved well.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018146_0034_0FA5612B5719ECD8"/>
I had nothing in my mind againſt being free, and looking pleaſantly on them; for this, when ſeaſonable, hath a good effect.</p>
                  <p>The next place we came to of any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was Morlaix; it was night when we got in, and we were obliged to ſtand and ſit in the ſtreet, till they got orders from the commiſſary what to do with us. I thought the time very long, more on account of our poor men than myſelf; for they had walked till they ſweated, and ſome of them were ill. To ſit in the ſtreet an hour or more, in a cold night, I thought was almoſt enough to give them their death. When orders came, they were to take us to priſon; but a merchant, one Forney, who was agent of the prizes, met us in the ſtreet, and took Riddel, the two man of war's men, and myſelf, to a tavern, where we had what we pleaſed to call for, but not at the cheapeſt rate. Our landlord was an Iriſhman, and I perceived had a very good opinion of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>After we had ſupped, and he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelf what I was, he entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with a diſh of as unfavoury diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about religion as I thought I had ever heard, and what made it more irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, he held it very long. He brou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a book, out of which he ſaid he taught his children, and as he read, ſome of our people were ſo weak as to commend it, which made him more eager. I do not remember that I either anſwered any of his queſtions, or made any objections to what he ſaid; but when he told me, he intended to bring ſome of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to ſee me, meaning the prieſts, for he ſaid they would like to have ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with me; I told him he need not bring any there upon my account, for I did not want any of their company: ſo that was put an end to, for they never came to me while I ſtaid in Morlaix. Whilſt I was here, the young man came to ſee me, who took care of me the firſt night I lodged aboard the privateer, and ſaluted me in a very friendly manner. This young man took more notice of me than any other all the time I was aboard, and when they were ſtripping and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, he ſtamped upon the deck, and ſhewed great reſentment, as Riddel told me, and knowing he had not wronged me, could cheerfully come to ſee me; but the others, who had, did not care to ſee me, and though I often met them in the ſtreet, they endeavoured to ſhun me, and would not look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018146_0036_0FA5612DF6D9D308"/>
thing to have a conſcience void of offence both towards God and men.</p>
                  <p>We were brought before one of their chief officers, called the commiſſary, to have our names entered, and ſuch as could not find bail, muſt go to priſon. This man and his wiſe took great offence at my hat being in its place, as likewiſe did the commiſſary at Roſcone, who was an old man, and ill of the gout, upon his bed. But ſeveral capital people of the town being preſent, he was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, becauſe I did not give them that honour which was none of their due. When I had given in my name, I ſoon quitted the room This commiſſary was a young man, and ſeveral were in the room with him I had not aſked any body to be bail for me, for I was eaſy, and the thoughts of the priſon did not terrify me, though we had heard a very diſmal account of it; however Forney, whom I mentioned before, after he had called Riddel aſide, and aſked him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ventured to be bail for me. I ſtaid a little while in the room after our people were withdrawn, and looked at the great man as he ſat in his chair, and thought his countenance was ſomewhat milder, and he ſpake pretty kindly to me when we parted. It was ſaid, he was
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018146_0037_0FA5612EE81250E8"/>
very bitter againſt all the Engliſh, and had uttered many harſh expreſſions againſt them; but his glaſs was then almoſt run, for he lived but a little while after this.</p>
                  <p>Forney, who had paſſed his word for me, being agent, had my papers and letters, which I found he did not chuſe to part with, except my certificate and letter of credit, and another paper or two, which he did not think worth while to keep. I perceived he was a ſelfiſh man, for after he underſtood my little money that I ſhould want was not to come through his hands, he came to me, and with an unpleaſant tone told me, he would not ſtand bound for me any longer. I ſaid, I did not intend to give him any offence in employing another to do my buſineſs: viz. Charles Sermanſon, a merchant, who was of great ſervice to me afterwards, when I came to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him. When he heard Forney would not be bound for me any longer, he ſaid, he would be bound for me, as freely as he would for his own brother. So I was ſtill kept out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Whilſt we were here we were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined at the admiralty office, where they aſked many queſtions, and I thought, it I had been enough aware of them, I
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018146_0038_0FA5612F6A052038"/>
ſhould have come better off than I did. Before they had us into the room where we were examined, they had ſomething of the form of an oath, I told them I could not take it, being againſt our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. After ſome diſcourſe about it, they, not being willing to let me paſs without examining, had me into their room, and aſked me my name and place of abode, whether I was married, and what children; to which I anſwered. They aſked what preparations were mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in England for war? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, as I did not concern myſelf about ſuch things, I ſhould ſay nothing about them. He aſked other queſtions about the manner of our being taken, and what was taken from me, and about our ſhip and cargo. Then after a pretty long pauſe, he ſaid, now I have ſome cloſe queſtions to aſk you, but you muſt, not be angry. I was ſilent, not knowing how I ſhould come off. He then aſked me, whether I was a miniſter? I ſaid, I did not chuſe to be put under that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, He ſaid, what then? I told him, my buſineſs, when at home, was to look after and ſeed cattle, and ſuch in our country were called graziers. He aſked me what I was going to do in Pennſylvania? I ſaid, to viſit my friends.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018146_0039_0FA561302FF3D930"/>
Whether I knew any body there? I ſaid I was acquainted with but a few. Whether I was ſent by the Quakers? I told him, I was not; though I had their approbation therein. He then aſked me, whether or no the Quakers would fight if they were attack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d by an enemy? I ſaid, it was not my buſineſs then to tell him whether they would or not; it was enough for me to anſwer for myſelf. Then ſaid he, If you were ſmitten on one cheek, would not you turn the other? Or, if they took away your coat, would not you give them your cloke alſo? I ſaid, it was ſo in Scripture, but I had not freedom at that time to anſwer thoſe queſtions. He aſked me no more queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at that time, that I remember.</p>
                  <p>About this time I ſuffered much in my ſpirit; the reaſon is beſt known to the Lord. I was heavy and ſorrowful in my mind both night and day for ſome time, and much afraid, left I ſhould bring diſhonour to Truth by my unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, or ſome ſlip or other that I had made or mig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t make, for want of care and watchfulneſs, in that ſtrange land, ſeparated from my brethren, and depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all outward help and comfort. But this to me was a profitable ſeaſon, for I found the fear of the Lord, which was then in my heart, did preſerve me
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018146_0040_0FA561310EF51A00"/>
from evil, and falling into temptation. Though ſuch company as I had was very unpleaſant to me, and I thought myſelf unfit for converſation; yet, when by honeſt inquirers, I was aſked queſtions concerning our faith and principles, I was helped, in the openings of Truth, to give them an anſwer concerning the hope that was in me: ſcriptures freely opening, and all things brought to my remembrance, ſufficient to put to ſilence, and ſtop the mouths of gainſayers.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I ſtaid in Morlaix, Charles Sermanſon (before mentioned) who often invited me to his houſe, one evening, as we were in diſcourſe, aſked me, why I went abroad in ſuch troubleſome times? I told him, I believed it to be my duty; for nothing elſe would have induced me to leave all that were near to me in this world, as wife and children, but a ſenſe of duty to God, and obedience to what I believed he required of me; for as to outward gain or advantage, I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that in my view, for ſuch as have freely received, muſt freely give.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſetting forth the nature, call, and qualification of the true miniſtry, I ſaw it had ſome reach upon him and his wife, who ſat by, and deſired that he would interpret to her what I ſaid. When ſhe under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tood I had left a wife and children
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018146_0041_0FA56131C8CFBCC0"/>
behind me, ſhe ſaid that could not be conſiſtent with the will of God. I ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, ſhe did not conſider Chriſt faith, <q>He that loveth father or mother, wife or children, houſes or lands, more than me, is not worthy of me.</q> I took the liberty to reprove her huſband, for taking the great and ſacred name in vain, which I ſuppoſe made ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his countenance. She then aſked him what I ſaid. When he told her, ſhe ſaid, I had done well, for that was his great weakneſs, and ſhe hoped he would take notice of it. I ſaid, by turning our minds to the light of Chriſt in our hearts, which reproveth for ſin, as we came to yield obedience to it, we ſhould be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to overcome our weakneſſes. She ſaid I was a ſaint, and had overcome the temptations of the world. I ſaid, what I am, it is by Grace. I have nothing to boaſt of, and by Grace I am ſaved out of many temptations of the world; yet was a man of like paſſions, and liable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weakneſſes, as they were; and was no longer ſafe than whilſt I kept upon my watch. My mind was opened to point out to them the way of ſalvation, ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being brought to confirm the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, work, and operation of the Grace of God, upon the hearts of the children
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018146_0042_0FA5613283C3CE60"/>
of men; with the ſaving help there is in it, as it is yielded obedience unto. It was a ſeaſonable opportunity. Finding freedom, I let him ſee the certificate I had from my friends. When he had read it, he ſaid, he liked it very well. I told him ſomething of the good order we had amongſt us, which he ſeemed to approve well of; but ſaid, he could but admire that I ſhould take ſo much pains, without any view of outward advantage. I told him, what I had ſaid was the truth. He ſaid, he did believe it was. But, ſaid he, our prieſts would not go acroſs that room without being paid.</p>
                  <p>Perceiving that what had already paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed had ſome good effect, for the man was very loving, and his underſtanding meaſurably opened, to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true and falſe miniſters, I took my leave for that time, and went to my quarters, which were at a tavern, where I was for ſeveral days, and had much company of divers ſorts. As I appeared to them ſomewhat ſingular, they wanted to know what I was, and ſuch as could ſpeak Engliſh would aſk me queſtions; and as I found freedom I anſwered them.

I had to open ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral paſſages of Scripture, which ſet forth the peaceable government of Chriſt, who came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them; and that it was not the lamb's nature to tear and devour, but the wolf's. This opportunity was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, the people were very ſtill and attentive. He that aſked me this queſtion had often been with me, and had aſked many queſtions, but was now ſilent, and ſeemed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>After ſome time. I was, with ſome others who were priſoners at large, ordered into the country about thirty miles, to a town called Carh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ix. Charles Sermanſon ſupplied me with what money I wanted,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018146_0044_0FA561349DEAA160"/>
and alſo recommended me to a friend of his there, one John Grace, a counſellor at law, who, during my ſtay, ſhewed ſeveral tokens of his regard and hearty friendſhip, after he and I came to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; though I may ſay with ſafety, I never ſought his, nor any other's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by any indirect means, or in a way Truth did not admit of. When I went to his houſe, it was in the evening, and he taking the letter with his hat off, made a bow, but I not returning it as he expected, he with an earned look, and ſomewhat of an unpleaſant tone, ſaid, I might go to the tavern, and he would come to me in the morning. He did ſo, and told me, as I had been recommended to his care by his good friend Charles Sermanſon, he would do the beſt he could in providing me a private lodging; and any other ſervice he could do me, which lay in his power, ſhould not be wanting. I told him, I was obliged to him, and was glad to find him, and ſome others of his countrymen, ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as to be kind to ſtrangers; and as I as a ſtranger, and alſo a priſoner, I ſhould be glad of his aſſiſtance. He ſaid, he was glad he had the opportunity of aſſiſting his fellow-creatures, for he looked upon it to be no more than his
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:018146_0045_0FA56134AF7D1EA8"/>
duty. Then we walked into the town, where he provided me a chamber, and I had every thing found me that was neceſſary. My new landlord took great notice of my behaviour, and, I ſuppoſe, at firſt did not know how to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards me, that I might not be offended; for being poor, he was glad of a little money. He could ſpeak no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and I but little French, ſo we could have no converſation; but he told one of the Engliſhmen, who ſpoke French, that I did him good, though he could not underſtand me. He was a peruke-maker by trade, and when he had left work in the evenings, he and his wife would come and ſit with me a conſiderable time in ſilence; which was not diſagreeable to me: for ſometimes, I believe, we were favoured with good, when we ſat in ſilence. His wife was a religious woman, and of a ſolid ſober behaviour, ſo far as I ever ſaw. I ſtaid in their houſe three months, and then took lodgings in another place; three young men in like circumſtances with my ſelf, deſiring very much to be with me, and they not having room for us all, I left them. As the young men behaved well, their company was agreeable; two of them being friends ſons, though they did
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018146_0046_0FA56135C3152388"/>
not in many things take up the croſs as they ought to have done, yet their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to me was ſuch, as gained my love and affection. One of them ſoon after died in the French priſon, being, when taken, upon his paſſage to Rhode-Iſland, where his parents lived, at whoſe houſe I afterwards was, and found them very ſorrowful, for they had loſt three of their ſons, two at ſea, and one in priſon. As theſe things affected and made ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon my mind, I made a few remarks.</p>
                  <p>John Grace, the counſellor, after a little while, became very loving, and had me often to his houſe, it not being far from my lodgings, and I found myſelf very free to converſe with him, and told him in freedom at one time, if he had any thing in his mind to aſk concerning our ſociety or principles, I would have him be quite free, for I ſhould be willing to anſwer honeſtly according to the beſt of my underſtanding. He ſaid, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood we did not baptiſe with water. I told him, the apoſtle Paul ſaith, <q>There is one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm;</q> and water, how or by whomſoever adminiſtered, is only ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to put away the filth of the fleſh, but not able to warn away the ſin of the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018146_0047_0FA5613657381398"/>
ſoul. The ſame apoſtle ſaid,<q>He was not ſent to baptiſe, (he there muſt be underſtood with water) but to preach the goſpel, which is the power that baptiſeth into the one Spirit.</q> He further ſaith concerning himſelf, that he was not aw hit behind the chiefeſt of the apoſtles; yet he thanks God, he had baptiſed no more than the few he recites, which he would not have done, if bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with water had been the one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm eſſential to ſalvation. He ſaid, he thought there our ought to be ſomething done to children by the miniſter, to initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them into the church. I ſaid, as to our not being in the practiſe of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling children with water, or ſigning them with the ſign of the croſs, as it was not ſcriptural, we could not be juſtly blamed for being in the diſuſe of it. He then ſaid, if he at firſt had put on the prieſt's gown, inſtead of that he then wore, he ſhould have thought it his buſineſs to have ſearched more into the Scriptures. I told him, I took him to be a man of that underſtanding, as very well to know, it ought to be every one's buſineſs to ſearch into the things that belong to their own peace. He ſaid it was true, but they had men who were learned, whom they paid, and he looked upon theſe to be his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018146_0048_0FA5613A312F6E40"/>
and as for him, he was but a hearer and if they deceived him, it would be the worſe for themſelves; they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God. I ſaid, it was true, they could not; but as the ſalvation of the ſoul is a thing of ſo great moment, we ſhould not have our dependence upon others, and as to teachers, we might know them by their fruits; for, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt's own words, <q>men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thiſtles.</q> He further ſaith to his miniſters, <q>freely you have received, freely give.</q> As to thoſe of polluted lips. I thought they could not profit the people at all. He ſaid, there was no Scripture that forbad marrying, and he thought their prieſts wrong in that; for they did not keep themſelves chaſte, but deluded and deceived many poor young women. I ſaid, it was great pity any ſhould be deprived of the benefit of the Scriptures, for all ought to have liberty to try all things, that they may hold faſt that which is good; for it is dangerous pinning their faith upon other men's ſleeves: <q>if the blind lead the blind, they will both fall into the ditch.</q> He then ſaid, he ſhould be glad to read ſome of our authors, which I gave him
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018146_0049_0FA5613BD212BD50"/>
ſome expectations of ſending, if I lived to return home.</p>
                  <p>Some time after this, he ſent for me to dine with him, when I expected he would have had ſome prieſts with him, but he had not; though he told me he had invited one of their clergymen to dine with him, and acquainted him I was to be there, but he deſired to be excuſed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ledging, he thought I ſhould be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his company. I ſaid I ſhould not, if he was a religious ſober man. I was not had before the commiſſary or chief magiſtrate, at my firſt coming here, with the reſt of the priſoners, but this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor gave in my name, and when they went to receive the government's allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I went, not having enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me without. But hearing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary had uttered ſome very bitter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions againſt the Quakers, and me in particular, for not putting off my hat, as he had obſerved, when I met him in the ſtreet, I had an inclination to pay him a viſit, which I acquainted a young man with, who could interpret for me. We found the commiſſary in the ſtreet. The young man told him, I was come to ſee him, or pay him a viſit. He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſtly at me, after a pauſe, took us into a room, and before I could ſay
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:018146_0050_0FA5613C45D368C8"/>
any thing to him, aſked me, why I did not put off my hat? I told him, unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering our heads was what we did when we prayed and addreſſed the Almighty; but to do it to our fellow-creatures was againſt our conſciences.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer, though ſhort, I perceived ſatisfied him, for his haughty countenance fell, and he then ſpake mildly, and ſaid, he had heard we did not baptiſe our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. I ſaid, we did not uſe water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. What do you then, ſaid he, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of water? I ſaid, the one baptiſm, which we believe to be ſaving and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to ſalvation, is ſpiritual, that of fire and the Holy Ghoſt; and as to little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they are heirs of the kingdom of heaven without water, or the help of any mortal man. I told him, I had heard he ſaid ſomething againſt me, but I came in good will to pay him a friendly viſit, for I had a mind to ſpeak with him myſelf. He then took me by the hand, ſaying, he would not do me any hurt, but all the ſervice that lay in his power. I took my leave of him with thankfulneſs; that truth had thus far prevailed, and the young man was well ſatisfied; for he was ſomewhat in fear before we went, having heard what the commiſſary had ſaid concerning me. Ever after, when I
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:018146_0051_0FA5613CF0864590"/>
met with him, he looked pleaſantly, and I believe never any more took offence at my hat.</p>
                  <p>Charles Sermanſon, whilſt I was here, wrote me ſeveral kind letters; and mine, which I wrote to England, he took care to ſend to his correſpondent in London; by whom alſo my letters from home were ſafely conveyed to me, which made my confinement much the eaſier. as I could often hear from my wife and family, and they from me. After I had been confined about five months, I was releaſed; my paſſport coming to hand, I ſhewed it to John Grace, and he went with me to the commiſſary, who readily ſigned it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his gladneſs that I had got my liberty, and was going to my family, He alſo gave leave to ſeveral of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low priſoners, who were deſirous to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me to Morlaix. The 23d of the 4th month I took my leave of the counſellor and his family, with divers others, both French and Engliſh, who came to ſee me in a very affectionate manner. When I came to Morlaix, I found a Dutch veſſel bound to Oſtend. Charles Sermanſon agreed with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to ſet me upon the Engliſh coaſt, if the wind would permit, which happened well the 28th of the 4th month 1757.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="unknown:018146_0052_0FA5613DA90B9950"/>When I came to London, I found ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral friends very glad to ſee me, having had a near ſympathy with me in my exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; and I ſaw the Lord had been my helper and deliverer, in that he had been pleaſed to bring me ſafe to my native and; and not only ſo, but I found friends as nearly united to me as ever; which was a great comfort. For I had been afraid, left they ſhould ſtand at a diſtance from me; but magnified be the Great Name for evermore, I found all well in that reſpect, and likewiſe when I came to my own habitation, which was en the 11th of the 5th month 1757.</p>
                  <p>I ſoon ſet out again for the yearly meeting in London, which began the 28th of the 5th month this year. My brother Maw, and two other friends, accompanied me. It was believed I was intending to proceed again to America; but I could ſay little to it when aſked, till the yearly meeting was over, and friends moſtly gone out of town. I was then made ſenſible, it was my duty again to make preparation to ſet forward; a ſhip being near ready to fail for Philadelphia. I then acquainted friends with it, who left me to my liberty, expreſſed their unity with it, and made all things as eaſy for me as they could. For which my
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:018146_0053_0FA5613E797F1208"/>
ſpirit was bowed in thankfulneſs, to the great, good, and wiſe Diſpoſer of all things, who can diſpoſe the minds of his people as he ſeeth meet; and who ever will, I believe, make way for all that put their truſt in him, that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings may be in all things duly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. I took my leave of my wife and family in a ſolemn manner, not knowing I ſhould ſee them again in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability. I alſo ſettled my outward affairs in ſuch order as I thought might be for the beſt.</p>
                  <p>The 19th of the 6th month 1757, I left London, ſeveral friends accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to Graveſend. The veſſel being juſt ready to ſail, I took leave of friends, and followed her in a ſmall veſſel as far as the Nore, two of my kind friends ſtill accompanying me, viz. John Sherwin and Thomas Wagſtaffe. I went on board the ſhip, and they returned to London. We arrived in the Downs the 21ſt, and waited for a convoy, it being a time when much ſhipping were taken by the French. The people were not willing to go without men of war.</p>
                  <p>I went on more while here, and found a ſmall family of very ſenſible friends, of which I was glad. The 23d we weighed anchor, being in all about ſixty ſail.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018146_0054_0FA5613FA7460FD8"/>
We loſt ſight of land the 8th of the 7th month, had a good paſſage, and in weeks from London we got ſafe to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia. Here I found ſeveral friends from Europe in the ſervice of Truth. We were truly glad to ſee each other, and had comfortable meetings together: bleſſed be the name of the Lord! I have great cauſe to be truly thankful, and in humble reverence, to praiſe his great and everlaſting name, for many deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances both by ſea and land. I may in truth ſay, his name hath been to me a ſtrong tower, and thither I have run and found ſafety. For though he ſuffers his to be tried, as in the furnace of affliction, he will not leave nor forſake them; but his arm hath been made bare for their deliverance, and he hath granted them the petition of their ſouls. Glory and honour be given to him, and that for evermore! I ſtaid in and about Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia till the yearly meeting was over.</p>
                  <p>The 5th of the 9th month 1757, I went in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o New Jerſey, John Pemberton accompanying me. We had a meeting at Haddonfield; thence to Cheſter, and had a meeting there alſo, both to good ſatisfaction We lodged at Edmund Holinhead's and on firſt day were at Eveſham meeting, which was attended
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:018146_0055_0FA5614105E59908"/>
with the ſeaſoning virtue and power of Truth. We went that night to Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and attended the monthly meeting on ſecond day, which I thought was to general ſatisfaction. I lodged at John Smith's, a ſubſtantial friend, and a very ſerviceable man in the ſociety. Here John Pemberton left me.</p>
                  <p>I went next day to Ancocas, it being the fourth of the tenth month, and third of the week. We had a meeting there, which was hard in the beginning, and dull; but that ſpirit of earthly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which had too much prevailed, was teſtified againſt, and truth, I think, did in a good degree ſpring up over all: praiſed be the great name for ever! The fourth of the week, accompanied by another friend, had two meetings at Mount Holly, both to pretty good ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: we lodged at Joſiah Foſter's. Fifth day we had a meeting at a ſchool-houſe, which was large, and though it held long, the people were very quiet: we lodged at William Smith's. Sixth day we had a meeting at Old Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field; firſt day at Mansfield. It was a large meeting, but the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hankering much after words, the ſpring of life, that had run through me, being in a great meaſure ſtopt, a cloud
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:018146_0056_0FA561417387BA08"/>
came and covered my tabernacle. I ſaw it was ſafeſt to ſtand ſtill. We lodged at Peter Harvey's, a kind and ſteady friend.</p>
                  <p>Next day, the ſecond of the week, and tenth of the month, we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a ſchool-houſe in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which was ſmall, but in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſatisfactory: we lodged at William Smith's: had a meeting at Upper Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field on third day; at Freehold on fourth; Croſwick's on fifth; Bordentown on ſixth; and Trenton on firſt day: we lodged here at William Morris's. From thence to Stony Brook, and had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſecond day of the week, and 17th of the month. We lodged at James Clark's. In this place they had been hurt, and ſcattered in their minds; as alſo in ſeveral other places, where there had been a ſtriving, and a dividing ſpirit got in. From thence we went to Robins's meeting on third day, which was not ſo ſatisfactory as could have been deſired; ſome being reſtleſs, the meeting holding long.</p>
                  <p>We went from thence to Squan, and had a meeting there on fifth day amongſt a company of poor dark people Then to Shrewſbury the twenty-ſecond of the tenth month, where was a meeting for miniſters and elders. The meeting on
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018146_0057_0FA56142691522B8"/>
firſt day was very large, and, conſidering the great numbers of people of all ranks, was quiet. Second day it was a good ſolid meeting, Truth prevailing over all: praiſes be given to the Great Name for ever. The Son of Righteouſneſs did ariſe with healing in his wings, and my ſoul was delivered, as out of the pit; for I had been ready to deſpair, and thought I ſhould have been overcome by the enemy. Great horror and darkneſs was over my underſtanding for a time; but the Lord did ſend his light, and his truth, and cauſed it to ſhine upon my tabernacle; and I had to declare of his mercy and goodneſs towards the children of men, and to invite them to come and ſee for themſelves, what great things the Lord will do for them that truſt in him. This great meeting ended well, and I was truly thankful to the great Maſter of our aſſemblies. We lodged at Joſeph Wardel's, a worthy friend.</p>
                  <p>On third day we came back to Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks, and lodged at Thomas Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's. Next day to widow Andrews's, where my companion was taken ill. Here I left him, after ſtaying one night, and went to Haddonfield with Iſaac An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, and lodged at his houſe one night, and ſo to Philadelphia, where I ſtaid till
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:018146_0058_0FA56143492E6EF0"/>
their quarterly meeting. We had ſeveral comfortable opportunities together. John Hunt and Chriſtopher Wilſon from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland were here, and had good ſervice. I ſtaid about Philadelphia, attending meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as they came in courſe, both for worſhip and diſcipline, until the fifteenth of the eleventh month, when I ſet out towards the ſouthern provinces, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Lightfoot accompanying me. We went to Cheſter, and were at their youth's quarterly meeting, which was a time to be remembered by many of us.</p>
                  <p>We viſited the meetings through Cheſter county, till we came to Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and were at the monthly meeting, John Hunt alſo being there. It was a ſuffering time to me, I being ſenſible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were worſhipping only in the outward court, whoſe dwelling was in the form without the power, ſuch cauſe ſuffering to the true ſeed. I ſtaid meeting with them on firſt day, and was led to ſpeak cloſely to ſeveral ſtates, and left them pretty eaſy in my own mind. I lodged at John Churchman's, and had a meeting at Weſt-Nottingham on third day; at Little Britain on fourth day, here ſeveral Preſbyterians came in, with their prieſt, who took down in writing what I ſaid; though I perceived not that he was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:018146_0059_0FA56143EB892C10"/>
till I had nigh done ſpeaking. When I ſat down, moſt of them went out, but he ſtaid; and, after a ſhort ſpace, I had to ſay, <q>The time ſhall come, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God (or they that are dead in forms;) and they that hear and obey ſhall live; and that Chriſt is the reſurrection, and the life, and he that liveth and believeth in him, though he is dead, yet ſhall he live.</q> I did not enlarge much upon it; but the meeting broke up in a good degree of life, and the prieſt went off with his company. Friends thought there was no danger of any ill coming of it, but I was afraid, left Truth ſhould ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>I rode that evening after meeting to William Downing's, who had a large family, with whom we had a good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Thence we came to Sadſbury, where I had a meeting, and in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of truth, had cloſely to ſpeak to the ſtates of many. From thence I went to Lampiter, where I had two mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ings; and ſo to Lancaſter, and had a meeting with the few friends that lived there. We lodged at Iſaac Whitelock's; and after having a meeting at James Wright's, we croſſed the river Suſquehannah, and went to York, where a few friends dwelt,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:018146_0060_0FA56144A4B310B8"/>
and had a meeting among them. We quartered at Nathan Huſſey's.</p>
                  <p>Our next meeting was at Newberry; it was ſilent, but to my ſatisfaction. We paſſed through Warrington, but had no meetings it being the youth's quarterly meeting, at Huntington, where we had an edifying time together. We had alſo meetings at Moynallan, John Evans's, Pipe-Creek, Buſh-Creek, and Monoque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. Then croſſing Potomack, we came into Virginia, to Fairfax; where we had a meeting on the ſecond day of the week, and twelfth of the twelfth month. It was a good meeting, Truth having the dominion: magnified be the great name of Iſrael's God, and that for evermore! We lodged at Mary Janey's, a diſcreet orderly woman, who had ſeveral ſober well-inclined children. From hence we went to Gooſe Creek, and had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on third day: it was well. On fourth day we had a meeting at David Pole's, ſeveral friends accompanying us. I had a travail in ſpirit, that Truth might not loſe ground; finding a ſpirit of eaſe had greatly prevailed in many of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Truth, to the ſorrow of the honeſt hearted. We left David Pole's houſe on fifth day, and rode over the Blue Ridge, or Blue Mountains, where
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018146_0061_0FA561452D12ECD8"/>
the Indians had done much miſchief, by burning houſes, killing, deſtroying, and carrying many people away captives; but friends had not hitherto been hurt: yet ſeveral had left their plantations, and fled back again over the Blue Mountains, where the lands had been rightly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed of the Indians.</p>
                  <p>Things ſeemed dreadful, and ſeveral hearts ready to fail. We proceeded on our journey, and came within ſix miles of Wincheſter, where the Engliſh had a fort. On ſixth day we had a meeting at Hopewell, which was an open time. I found my mind much engaged for the poor ſuffering people, but had to tell them, their greateſt enemies were thoſe of their own houſes. The meeting end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well. We lodged at Joſeph Lupton's, an ancient friend, who with his wife were very loving to us. The Indians had killed and carried away ſeveral within a few miles of their habitation; yet they did not ſeem much afraid; for they ſaid, they did not ſo much as pull in their ſneek-ſtring of the door when they went to bed, and had neither lock nor bar. We had a meeting at Crooked-run on firſt day, the eighteenth of the twelfth month. It was a good meeting, the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:018146_0062_0FA56145ECD4C2C8"/>
Lord favouring with his living preſence. Glory be to his great Name for ever!</p>
                  <p>On ſecond day we ſet forward through the woods, and over the hills and rocks, croſſing ſeveral large creeks. We came in the evening to a man's houſe, called Moſes Mackoy, and had a meeting there next day. They were an unſettled peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet aſſented to Truth; but were not fully convinced in their minds, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſufficiency of it, having an eye to outward ſhadows: I left them in good will. On fourth day we rode about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles to Smith's Creek, where we had a meeting on fifth day, at the houſe of William Caroll. It was ſilent, though they had ſent notice ſeveral miles, and many came. I told them, though I had nothing to communicate by way of preaching, or declaration, yet I found freedom to have another opportunity at a proper time and place: which I had next day at the houſe of John Mills, about ten miles off, ſomewhat on our way. The meeting was to good ſatisfaction. The Indians had killed and taken away people within two or three miles of this place, not many weeks before; but the Lord preſerved us in our journey Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and praiſe be to him, and that for ever!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="unknown:018146_0063_0FA56146AA7AE0C0"/>Seventh day we ſet out towards the ſouth parts, and lodged that night at the foot of the Blue Mountains, at a friendly man's houſe, having two friends to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us. Next day, being the firſt of the week, we croſſed the mountains, and towards evening came to Douglaſs's, and had a meeting with the family. The twenty-ſeventh, and third of the week, we had a meeting at Camp Creek. It was a pretty open meeting, though the ſenſe of good is almoſt loſt amongſt them in that place, and their ſtates much to be lamented. We lodged at Charles Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's. Next day we rode fifteen miles, and lodged at Francis Clark's, and had a meeting at Fork Creek. Many people came, and ſat with great attention, and the meeting was ſolid.</p>
                  <p>From thence we went to Jenito, where we had a meeting, and many people came, but it being ſilent, they ſeemed diſſatisfied. As I had nothing to ſay, I was glad I could be made willing to be what the Lord ſaw meet to allot me. We lodged at Jane Watkins's, a widow woman, She received us kindly, and had ſeveral loving and well-inclined chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. We had a meeting at Cedar Creek on ſeventh day, the thirty-firſt of the twelfth month 1757. It was a ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:018146_0064_0FA56147A461A110"/>
and good meeting. Truth had the dominion, praiſes be to the great Giver of every good and perfect gift!—I lodged at William Stanley's.</p>
                  <p>From thence we went to Caroline, where the meeting was on firſt day, the firſt of the firſt month 1758. It was a large and good meeting. The ſtates of the people were ſo ſpoken to, that through the Lord's goodneſs and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, I hope may tend to his honour, and to the help of his poor creatures. We lodged at Morner Chigles's, and alſo at John Chigles's, one night. Next meeting we were at the Swamp. It ſeemed to me, as I travelled along through theſe parts, true religion was much want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among many of the profeſſors of it. I lodged at William Johnſon's. The next meeting was at the Black Creek. It was a good time to me, and hope alſo to ſome others: praiſes be to the great Name! I lodged at an old man's houſe that night. On the ſeventh of the week, and ſeventh of the month, the meeting was at White Oak Swamp, being month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, and then rode to Curls, and lodged at John Pleaſant's, a very kind friend. We were at their meeting on firſt day. The third of the week, and tenth of the month, had a meeting at Wion

Oak, fourteen miles from Curls, which was ſatisfactory. We lodged at John Crew's, and on fourth day came back to John Pleaſant's. On fifth day we rode to Robert Langley's nigh Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and on ſixth day had a meeting at the houſe of a friend called Butter.</p>
                  <p>It was an acceptable time to ſome.</p>
                  <p>After meeting we went to Robert Langley's, where we were kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. On firſt day we were at Pattiſon's meeting, which was a low time with me; yet truth in ſome good degree did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. On ſecond day we came to Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh, and lodged at John Honeycut's, and had a meeting at Burleigh on third day, which was to ſome acceptable. We lodged at Wike Honeycut's, and were at the monthly meeting at Surry-black Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where we had good ſervice for Truth. They being in the mixture, ſuffered peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of other ſocieties to ſit with them in their meetings of buſineſs. I was griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and could not be eaſy till I had deſired them to withdraw, that did not make profeſſion with us, both from the men's, and women's meeting. I had to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the oneneſs is and ſimplicity Truth led into, and to keep their meetings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or diſcipline, in that wiſdom, power, and authority that they were at firſt ſet up in;
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018146_0066_0FA5614C58B925B8"/>
that they might not join with the world's ſpirit, but keep themſelves ſeparate, and in the wiſdom and power of God, keep the authority, and bear rule over thoſe that were got into the mixture, and were for having thoſe that did not profeſs with us to ſit with them, when they tranſacted the affairs of the church. For ſome that profeſſed Truth had encouraged this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which tended to weaken the hands of the honeſt-hearted, they not having found that liberty and freedom to ſpeak ſo cloſely to their brethren, as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Joſeph could not uſe that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and unboſom himſelf to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in ſuch a manner as the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, till the Egyptians were gone out. I was glad I was there, for Truth had the dominion in the end. We lodged at Anſelm Baly's. I viſited all the little handfuls ſcattered up and down in theſe parts, and often had ſervice in families. I met with Samuel Spavold, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was much engaged in the ſervice of Truth. His labour of love in the work of the goſpel was indeed great in this part of the world; thoſe of other ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being much reached by his miniſtry. We were truly glad to ſee each other; for as iron ſharpeneth iron, ſo doth a man the countenance of his friend. We
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:018146_0067_0FA5614E325FC080"/>
had ſeveral comfortable and confirming ſeaſons together, eſpecially at the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting held at Black Creek for that part of Virginia; many friends from divers places being there. I was glad to ſee them, but what made us more glad, and brought us nearer to one another, was, becauſe the Lord favoured us with his preſence, and filled our hearts with his pure love.</p>
                  <p>Having nigh viſited all the meetings in this province, was taking my leave of many of them in time, ſo far as I could ſee them. Taking a few meetings in my way, in company with Samuel Spavold, I proceeded towards North Carolina, but left him to viſit ſome meetings he had not been at. I went to Pinywoods, nigh Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimon's River, in North Carolina; and had a meeting at Pinywoods the ninth of the ſecond month. It was large, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the overſhadowings of divine goodneſs. To me it was an edifying ſtrengthening time, as I truſt it was to many more. We took up our quarters at Thomas Newby's: the next day we had a meeting at Wells, which was the ſixth of the week. On ſeventh day we were at the Old Neck; and on firſt day at Little River. This meeting was very large, there being a conſiderable body of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:018146_0068_0FA5614F39C42D70"/>
friends in this part; and people of other ſocieties attend friends meetings when there are ſtrangers, I was helped through thoſe large aſſemblies far beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. I thought myſelf ſo unfit, weak, and unworthy, that I was almoſt caſt down in my mind before I came there; but praiſes and thankſgivings to him that helped me, I left them rejoicing in a ſenſe of the Lord's goodneſs and mercy to my ſoul. I lodged two nights at Thomas Nicholſon's, who moſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured me with his company whilſt I was amongſt them. Here my companion Thomas Lightfoot left me, and returned to Philadelphia. The laſt meeting I was at here, was appointed or Samuel Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vold. At Pinywoods we had a ſolid op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity together, many minds being truly bowed to the root of life in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and finding myſelf clear, may truly ſay, I parted with a remnant in pure love, and the unity of the one ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>I then ſet forward towards a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs country, where the inhabitants were very thin two young men accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me Our firſt meeting after we left Perquimons, was at John Coupeland's. There were but few friends, but people of other ſocieties came in, who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:018146_0069_0FA5614FDBFF7330"/>
amongſt whom was an officer in the army. He came to our quarters in the morning, and rode about ſix miles on the road towards the meeting, then turned off, and ſaid he would go and fetch his wife. He alſo brought with him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of young people, who were learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dance at his houſe, which I did not know till the meeting was over, and then he came and told me, he had invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to come to the meeting, and alſo their maſter, but he would not come. I ſaid, it was ſo far well, but it was a pity he ſhould encourage ſuch vanity, as to keep a dancing-ſchool at his houſe. He excuſed it, ſaying, the man owed him money, and he knew not how otherways to get it, but by letting him teach his family. I ſignified, he had better loſe it, than have his family taught that which would be unprofitable to them; for there was a woe pronounced againſt ſuch as did chant to the ſound of the viol, and invented to themſelves inſtruments of muſick, like David. He ſaid, it was the truth that they had heard ſpoken to-day, but acknowledged they did not walk an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to it. I ſaid, it was their own fault; for if they would take heed to the teachings of Truth in themſelves it would lead them into all truth, and conſequently
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:018146_0070_0FA56150CB34F908"/>
out of all error, and every bye-path and way that lead to deſtruction</p>
                  <p>After we had refreſhed ourſelves, we paſſed his houſe, and he ſeeing us, came and invited us in, ſaying, he had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for us, and ſhould be glad of our company, and we ſhould have a room to ourſelves I acknowledged his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but as time would not permit, we muſt proceed on our journey. We took our leave of him, and I thought he was ſo reached, as to be meaſureably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the ſufficiency of the bleſſed Truth; though his appearance, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his mind being lofty, he was not willing to ſubmit to the low appearance of it.</p>
                  <p>Our next meeting was at Thomas Knox's, a man lately convinced: it was in a good degree ſatisfactory. We had very difficult roads, through great ſwamps and acroſs many creeks, all through the woods: and in many places but little path to be ſeen. We came to Fort-River, where there is a meeting ſettled, of ſuch as had been lately convinced. Many came to meeting, which was held at Henry Horn's. Some of them were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled in their minds, not being founded upon the ſure rock; but ſuch as ſeek ſhall find, and they that dig deep enough
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:018146_0071_0FA5615134A8C238"/>
will come to the ſure foundation, that the righteous have built upon in all ages of the world. Henry Horn and been a teacher among the Baptiſts. He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a ſteady well-diſpoſed man, and had a few words in meetings. After I left his houſe, I had a meeting at Joſeph Pitman's, who, with ſeveral others, was under convincement. It was an edifying ſeaſon, many being ſenſibly touched with the love of Truth. I ſtaid with them one night, and then went to a ſmall meeting nigh a place called Nues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was two days journey, a very difficult road to find, and none of our companions had been there before.</p>
                  <p>After this meeting, we went to Core Sound, an inlet of the ſea. We had ninety miles to ride, and were altogether unacquainted with the way, having rivers, and many ſwamps to croſs. The two young men were ſtill my companions, Joſhua Fletcher, and Francis Nixon, who were very ſerviceable to me through this almoſt uninhabited part of the world. We got to Henry Stanton's in the night, who took us in, and entertained us very kindly. When we had ſtaid two days, had a meeting, and reſted ouſelves, we ſet forward towards the next meeting among friends, which was o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e hundred
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:018146_0072_0FA56151EBCF1A68"/>
and fifty miles. But in our way we had two meetings among people of other ſocieties. I had ſtill no guide but the young men, who knew no more of the way than myſelf. But ſuch as are uſed to the woods can find the way through them much better than ſuch as are not.</p>
                  <p>The firſt meeting we had after we left Core-Sound, was at Permeanus Hauton's, who gave us an invitation to his houſe, and ſent to give notice to his neighbours, though ſome lived ſeveral miles diſtant. We got to his houſe about the time the meeting was appointed, where we found ſeats placed, and every thing in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient order for a meeting, as I thought I had ſeldom ſeen. His rooms being little, he had placed ſeats in his court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and under the windows, that I believe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l could ſit and hear without the leaſt troubling one another; and indeed I thought his labour and good inclination were bleſſed, for a ſolid time it was, and I found openneſs to declare the Truth amongſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would that all our friends, upon the like occaſion, would take this man for their example, in being diligent to invite their neighbours, and to make room and accommodate them in the beſt manner they are capable of. It
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:018146_0073_0FA56152B636D090"/>
certainly hath a good favour, and is often attended with a bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>A ſteady friend, who had been a member among the Preſbyterians, told me, that the care and pains that ſome friends took to invite him, and ſome others, was one moving cauſe towards his convincement. He ſaid, he once told a young man, who had frequently invited him to our meetings when ſtrangers came, that as he, nor any of his friends came to their meetings, he thought he would go no more. The young man anſwered very calmly, ſaying. We muſt not come to you, but we want you to come to us. "This," ſaid he, <q>with the diligence friends had uſed without view of outward gain, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my mind, that I concluded, it muſt be the love of God in their hearts, that induced them to call and invite us to come to them.</q> This I mention more particularly, becauſe I have ſeen ſome that profeſs truth (to my grief) very deficient in this reſpect. We had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfortable opportunity in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this man and his family, and ſome others, that ſtaid all night.</p>
                  <p>Next morning I, with the two young men, and one more, who had a mind to go a day or two along with us through the wilderneſs, ſet forward, well refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:018146_0074_0FA5615374B583D8"/>
both in body and mind; hard things being made eaſy, and rough and untrod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den paths being made ſmooth to my mind. We had a meeting alſo at George Cowper's, whoſe wife was educated among friends. We ſtaid one night at Wilmington, the capital town in North Carolina; but it being their general court time, and the privateers having brought in prizes, the people's minds were in great commotions, ſo that I could find no room nor freedom to have a meeting, though ſeveral called Quakers lived there, but held no meeting, except when ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers came.</p>
                  <p>We croſſed a branch of Cape-Fear River, and landed upon a great ſwamp, which was very rotten, and dangerous, by reaſon of the overflowing of the river; but the two young men, and a negro, whom we hired to help us, carrying boards from one place to another for the horſes to tread upon, in time, and with much difficulty, we got well over. We then came again into the woods, where little path was to be ſeen; it likewiſe being rainy dark weather, we could not tell which way to go, but rode many miles, hoping we might be ſteering right; and juſt at the cloſe of the evening, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was quite dark, we came to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

houſe, the ſight of which was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, being weary, and very wet. When we called, the man ſaid he kept an ordinary, which we found to be true. However, we were contented with ſuch as we found, and thankful we fared ſo well. We were in our direct road for the place we intended, which was Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's-Creek, where we got next day, the ſixth of the week, and tenth of the third month. Here was a ſmall gathering of friends. We ſtaid their firſt day meeting over, and then went to Dan's-Creek, where we found another gathering of ſuch as call themſelves friends, but had been much hurt, and ſcattered in their minds from the true ſhepherd, by an enemy that had ſown tares.</p>
                  <p>Here I parted with my two good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who had travelled with me more than five hundred miles. Being nearly united together, we parted in true love. This I mention, becauſe the Lord loves a cheerful giver, and thoſe did, I thought, what they did, with great freedom and cheerfulneſs, not begrudging a little time, nor a little outward ſubſtance, for the ſake of the good cauſe of Truth. Thoſe will not loſe their reward, for it is helping forward the work, as that of opening a door, and kindling a fire, is doing part
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:018146_0076_0FA561550593CBA0"/>
of the buſineſs of the maſter's houſe; and he doth look upon it as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if it is but that of handing a cup of cold water, as it is done in a right ſpirit, it will have his bleſſed approbation and reward. I had another companion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially, I thought, provided here for me.</p>
                  <p>William Ferril, a public friend, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard of my being in the country, had got himſelf ready againſt I came, and had freedom in the truth to travel with me, till I ſhould fall in with another ſuitable companion; which made my travels through thoſe lonely places much the eaſier. When we left his houſe, we ſet our faces towards South-Carolina, having but one meeting of friends to take in the way, which was ſettled upon a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called Pee-Dee, about an hundred miles from the ſaid friend's houſe. This we accompliſhed in about two days. In the night we lodged in the woods. The few friends were truly glad to ſee us, they being ſeldom viſited. We had comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and refreſhing ſeaſons together, the Lord owning and favouring with his good preſence, ſtrengthened not only the inward, but the outward man alſo. Here I was ſenſibly affected with ſuch a ſeal and evidence of peace in my own mind,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018146_0077_0FA5615662FBA870"/>
that I was fully purſuaded, I was in the way of my duty: it made me go on again very cheerfully. No one can tell how good the Lord is, but ſuch as have taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſeen his marvellous ways of working, and how he can ſpread a table for thoſe, that in faithful obedience give up to his requiring, in a very wilderneſs; for he neither lets them want for inward, nor outward food. There is now, as well as formerly, a little remnant, that, with my ſoul, can ſet their ſeals to the truth of this; and can ſay unto him, We have lacked nothing, Lord!</p>
                  <p>Francis Clark, with whom we had quartered, bore us company one day and night in the woods. We thought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, we travelled near ſixty miles in a day; for when we had to lodge in the woods, we roſe early, and lay down late. Our friend Clark returned home, leaving us to ſhift for ourſelves; but my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, having ſome knowledge of the way, ſteered, I believe, a pretty ſtraight courſe. When night came, we pitched our tent in a valley, where there was ſome graſs, and a little brook of water. So when we had eaten ſuch as our bags af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, and given our horſes provender, and taken care of them, with what little we had, we lay ourſelves down, and ſlept
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:018146_0078_0FA5615674645A80"/>
very ſound and comfortably, being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with riding.</p>
                  <p>Next morning we were ſtirring by the time it was well light, and ſoon being ready, mounted our horſes; and it was well we did ſo, for there came ſuch a rain that day, that it raiſed the creeks and rivers ſo high, that if we had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap> late in the night, and coming to a houſe, deſired we might have lodgings; but the maſter of it told us, we could not. We aſked him, how far it was to another houſe, He ſaid, it was but a mile, but there was a deep creek in the way, and he would not go with us, if we would give him a great deal of money. I then very earneſtly deſired, that he would let us ſtay in his houſe all night, and we would pay him for his trouble, and for what we had; for we had rode almoſt all the day in the rain, and it was a very cold rainy night. He told us, he would not let us ſtay there, and ſo left us ſtanding without his gate. But a young man ſtanding by, ſeeing and hearing what had paſſed, took pity on us, and ſaid, though it was dangerous croſſing the waters, he would take his horſe, and go with us which he did, and we got w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

to the place the man had told us of. After refreſhing ourſelves with ſuch as the houſe afforded, we took up our lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in a very cold room, ſuch as I had never lain in before. But, bad as it was, I was glad and thankful we had not to lie out all night in the rain. I reſted well, and in the morning was well both in body and mind.</p>
                  <p>The fourth of the week we got to the Wateree, where ſeveral friends from Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had been ſettled about ſix or ſeven years. We had a meeting with them, and then, with S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                        <desc>•••••</desc>
                     </gap> Milhouſe and my companion, I ſet out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>owards Charles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. This took us moſt of three days, it being one hundred and thirty miles. When we came there, we found but few ſteady friends, yet we had ſome good opportunities togeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r; ſeveral of the town's people alſo coming in. I truſt our viſit was of ſervice, and tended to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſtrengthening the two or three that dwell in that remote part of the world. However, I thought I ſhould not be eaſy without paying them a viſit, though I had to ride ſo far on purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>When I felt myſelf clear, I returned with my friends to the Wateree, and was with them at their firſt day meeting, and meeting for buſineſs. We had good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:018146_0080_0FA56157F7B5A478"/>
likewiſe in their ſeveral fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which I thought would not eaſily be forgotten. Then taking our leave of them in goſpel-love, in which we had paid them that viſit, we returned to Pee-Dee, Samuel Milhouſe ſtill accompanying us. The friends there, though their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the world were but low, treated us very kindly. Their love to truth, and diligence in attending meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are worthy of notice; for they had nigh one hundred miles to go to the monthly meeting they belonged to, and I was informed very ſeldom miſſed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it.</p>
                  <p>Here my companion and I parted, he returning home, and I, with Francis Clark, went towards Cane-Creek. His company was ſo agreeable, that time did not ſeem long. When night came, we took up our lodgings in the woods, and got next day to a place called Deep-River, there being ſeveral families newly ſettled there, but they had not yet built a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe. We had a meeting at a friend's houſe, and then proceeded to Cane-Creek, where there is a large body of friends gathered thither in a few years from the ſeveral provinces. They told me they had not been ſettled there above ten years, but had found occaſion to build
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:018146_0081_0FA5615BB13248B8"/>
five meeting-houſes, and then wanted one or two more. I had good and ſeaſonable opportunities among them, being freely opened in the love of the goſpel, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth.</p>
                  <p>When I found myſelf eaſy to leave them, having had divers meetings, at Eno, and ſeveral other places, which, for brevity ſake, I forbear to mention; I with Jeremiah Pickitt then ſet out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Virginia, having nigh two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles to travel, and had but one meeting in the way. We got to Robert Langley's on firſt day evening, where I ſtaid to reſt and refreſh myſelf, after ſo long and tedious a journey. I then paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Curls, and travelled through Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, having viſited moſt of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings before, and came into Maryland. I was at their yearly meeting held at Weſt-River. It was very large, and in the ſeveral ſittings thereof overſhadowed with the wing of divine power, which tended to nouriſh the good part, and to the gathering and ſettling the minds of many upon the ſure foundation, and kept down that ſpirit which would divide in Jacob, and ſcatter in Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>We parted on fourth day in great love, ſome of us being nearly united in ſpirit. For though many, by balking their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

againſt that antichriſtian yoke of tithes, and trading in negroes, have cauſed the way of Truth to be evil ſpoken of; yet I was ſenſible that the regard of heaven was towards them, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful hand was ſtill ſtretched out, even towards the unfaithful, and backſliders, that they might be gathered. I had a travel and exerciſe upon my ſpirit for the cauſe of Truth, and that the great bleſſed and everlaſting Name, which I with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more make a profeſſion of, might not be diſhonoured: the faithful are indeed as ſtakes in Sion, but they are but as one of a family, or two of a tribe.</p>
                  <p>I then took the meetings in my way to Pennſylvania, as Elk-Ridge, Patapſco, and Patapſco-Foreſt, Little-Falls, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and ſo to Deer-Creek, where our worthy friends John Churchman and his wife met me. We croſſed the river Suſquehannah into Pennſylvania, and ſo to their houſe. Having had many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious meetings in this journey, and well cleared myſelf of thoſe provinces, I was eaſy in my ſpirit, and much comforted in the Lord, that he had been pleaſed thus far to help me through. I tarried one night at John Churchman's; and next day, being the ſeventh of the week, was at New-Garden monthly meeting; on
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:018146_0083_0FA5615DED8A0520"/>
firſt day at London-Grove, where there is a large gathering of friends. It was a good opportunity, truth favouring us, we were comforted together in the Lord. On the ſecond day, the twenty-ninth of the fifth month, I got to Philadelphia, having in this journey travelled upwards of two thouſand eight hundred miles.</p>
                  <p>After my return from the ſouthern provinces, I ſtaid ſome weeks viſiting meetings, and ſome friends families, in and about Philadelphia; and was alſo in the Jerſeys viſiting ſeveral meetings, and attended their quarterly meeting at Salem, which held three days for worſhip and diſcipline. It was an edifying time, things being conducted in a degree of the pure wiſdom, and the overſhadowing of divine power was witneſſed by many. Then, having duly waited for the moving and putting forth of the good Shepherd, who ſaid, <q>I put forth my ſheep, and go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them,</q> I thought I felt a draft, and not only ſo, but likewiſe true liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to viſit New-England, which I had not done before. If I had, I ſhould have proceeded, in order to ſhorten my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for it was againſt mine own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtay ſo long in and about one place. Therefore I ſet out the twenty-ſixth
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:018146_0084_0FA5615EAA665EC0"/>
of the ſeventh month, Iſaac Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf accompanying me.</p>
                  <p>My firſt ſtep was to Wright's Town, where was held a general meeting for the county of Bucks. Then we croſſed Delaware into New-Jerſey, and took meetings in our way to New-York, then to Fluſhing upon Long-Iſland, and were at their monthly meeting. Then croſſing the Bay went to their quarterly meeting at Purchaſe. After this, we took ſeveral meetings, as they fell in our way towards Rhode-iſland. I then had Robert Willis for my companion, (a friend from the Jerſeys,) who had drawings in his mind that way. Many people came to our meetings in thoſe parts, which are not cloſely joined in outward fellowſhip with us; yet are under the operation of the good hand, and in degree convinced of our principles. This, I thought, made our meetings more lively, and the ſpring of the goſpel to flow more plentifully, to the watering the thirſty ground.</p>
                  <p>When we had viſited the meetings hereabouts, and taken our leave of friends, we travelled through Connecticut govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having but one or two meetings in the way. The Preſbyterians, who formerly in thoſe parts were very rigid and bitter againſt friends, are now become
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:018146_0085_0FA5615F682DD3E0"/>
more loving, and treated us very kindly. I had great drawings of the Father's love towards them, believing his ſecret hand was at work to bring them from the barren mountains of their lifeleſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to ſerve the living God in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life. We came to Leiceſter, where there is a little handful that go under our name. We had a meeting with them on firſt day, the twentieth of the eighth month. We were refreſhed together, being ſtrengthened in the God of our ſalvation. Then we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Bolton, about thirty miles from thence, where we met with Samuel Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vold, in his return towards Pennſylvania, he having viſited moſt of the meetings in New-England. We had a good ſeaſon together. Then ſaluting one another in that unity and fellowſhip which brethren and fellow-labourers ought to dwell in, we parted; and my companion and I went to Uxbridge, and had a meeting. Then to Mendam, where we tarried all night at Moſes Aldrige's, and had a meeting next day; ſo on to Wainſockit, where we had a meeting. The weather being very hot, many people were nigh fainting; but praiſes be to the great Name, the meeting concluded well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="unknown:018146_0086_0FA5616057950878"/>On firſt day we were at Providence yearly meeting, which is only for worſhip. It was very large, and tended to the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and ſtaying people's minds on Chriſt, the chief corner ſtone, and rock of ages; for Truth had the dominion, and the Lord's power was felt. We had our outward entertainment at Stephen Hopkins's, then Governor of Rhode-Iſland. He and his wife treated us with hearty kindneſs. We had meetings at Cranſton, Warwick, and Eaſt-Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, then upon Conanicut-Iſland. We then croſſed the river, and came to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and attended both their meetings on firſt day, which were large; a great number reſiding thereabouts, who go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our name. But, with ſorrow of heart may it be ſaid, in the time of eaſe and plenty, many have taken their flight.</p>
                  <p>We left Newport on third day, and had a meeting at Portſmouth, in which we had good ſervice for Truth. Then croſſing the Bay, had a meeting at Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town upon the main, in which we were favoured with the openings of Truth, and left them in peace. I took notice of a negro man, who was with us at ſeveral meetings, and by his own induſtry, with the help of ſome friends, had purchaſed his freedom, that he might attend meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:018146_0087_0FA561630900D328"/>
having, for ſome time, been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the bleſſed Truth, which he much prized, and told me, as he had been obedient to the operation of it, which worketh by love, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf engaged in his mind to exhort his fellow-creatures to come to the good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in themſelves; that they, by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience, might know a being ſaved by it; or to that effect. This I could not gainſay, nor diſcourage; but deſired him to be faithful to the manifeſtation of Truth in his own heart, and the meaſure of Grace he had received. We parted in love and good will, being brethren of one Father.</p>
                  <p>Our next meeting was at Little Cranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, after which I parte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> with ſeveral friends, in the unity of the one Spirit, which had brought us into nearneſs and fellowſhip with each other; they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their places of abode, and I with my companion, and a young man who accompanied us ſeveral weeks, ſtill kept forward. I was enabled to labour through theſe parts beyond all outward expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for though the meetings were large, by reaſon of great comings in of other people, I found that gracious promiſe fulfilled; <q>As the day is, ſo ſhall thy ſtrength be.</q> We were at Accoakeſet.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:018146_0088_0FA56165C0C5CCB8"/>
New-Town, and Dartmouth or Aponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet, and had a meeting at each place. The laſt meeting, I thought, did not conſiſt of leſs than eight hundred people. We had at Cuſhnett, Rocheſter, Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and Freetown, many living and good opportunities to declare Truth in the free extendings of Goſpel-love; alſo at Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, on a firſt day, had a ſatisfactory op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Whilſt we were viſiting thoſe places, we took up our quarters at Paul Oſbourn's, who often accompanied us from one meeting to another, his heart being free and open towards his friends, and to ſerve Truth.</p>
                  <p>Having well cleared ourſelves, we went tow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rds the yearly meetings at Boſton, Lynn, and Salem, the twenty-ſecond of the ninth month. They began at Boſton. I do not remember I had ſeen ſo much ſtillneſs and gravity in ſo great an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as I obſerved there. It conſiſted of people of different perſuaſions. We have great cauſe to bow, in humble thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to the God of all our mercies, that he hath been pleaſed to make way for his people, to enjoy their religious meetings without the leaſt moleſtation, in this and many other places, where our worthy friends formerly ſuffered ſore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, by long impriſonment, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:018146_0089_0FA56167FA553E28"/>
whippings, ſpoiling of goods, and ſome of them laid down their lives for the teſtimony of a good conſcience: and though our God be a gracious, merciful, and long-ſuffering God, yet he will take vengeance on all the workers of iniquity, and the day of his wrath will break forth like a conſuming fire, in a time when it is not looked for. As he ſaid, ſo he will do; "For," ſaid he, <q>I am a jealous God, viſiting the ſins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and ſhewing mercy unto thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</q> So it is plain the Lord is equal in all his ways: for, concerning thoſe that are the offspring of that hard-hearted, wicked, and perverſe generation, that perſecuted and ſhed the blood of the innocent ſervants of the Lord, if they do but turn to him with their whole hearts, ſo as to love him, and keep his commandments, they will ſurely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>d mercy: but, if they continue in a ſtate of rebellion, and hardneſs of heart, and ſin againſt his light and good ſpirit in their hearts, as did their fore-fathers, he will viſit them with his judgments for their iniquities; and for the ſins which they and their fore-fathers have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:018146_0090_0FA5616869A54140"/>
he will pour forth the cup of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation without mixture.</p>
                  <p>After thoſe yearly meetings, we, with ſeveral friends, went towards the yearly meeting at Dover, and Cachecy, taking ſeveral meetings in the way, as at Ipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, where no friends lived; but we got leave to have a meeting in their court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. It was diſturbed by a man ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, when I was in teſtimony who ſaid, that I ſtruck at the foundation of their principles. He was a very hot man, and held the doctrine of abſolute predeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination. I told him, Truth ſtruck at the unſound foundation; but, as he was in heat and anger, not fit to diſpute about religious matters, he ſat down, and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſharply reproved him for his rude behaviour, ſhe being grieved that the meeting ſhould be diſturbed; for it was in a good frame. Several of the people, I believe, were aſhamed of his conduct. After a little ſilence, a friend ſtood up, and had a good opportunity. Then I had to clear myſelf of what was upon my mind, and the people being ſtill and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, the meeting concluded well. The man who had oppoſed me ſhrunk away, and I ſaw him no more, though I looked for him, and in coolneſs thought to have had a little further diſcourſe with
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:018146_0091_0FA561693B80DD48"/>
him. That night we went to Newberry, where we had a meeting, much to my comfort and ſatisfaction. We had meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings alſo at Ameſbury, Hampton, and Dover. Friends had been ſorely wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſcattered in their minds hereaway, by an unſtable ſpirit. Thoſe yearly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings were large, and I hope tended to the honour of Truth. We went next to Barwick, and had ſeveral meetings there; travelled through the woods to Caſco, where we had an opportunity with friends, and ſuch as attend their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>We croſſed the Bay to Small Point, and in our return had a meeting upon a neck of land called Meryconeague. The meeting at Small Point was the northermoſt ſettlement of friends upon the continent. We returned by Boſton, having ſeveral meetings in our way; and from thence to Pembroke, Sandwich, Yarmouth upon Cape Cod, Suckaneſſit, Wood's Hole, and thence took paſſage to Nantucket. We ſtaid upon that iſland about a week, viſiting friends in their families, and had ſeveral public meetings with them. It was an exerciſing time to me, finding the true ſeed, or life of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſuffering much, by reaſon of ſtrife and diviſions. I left them ſorrowfully,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:018146_0092_0FA56169E88B3A08"/>
becauſe I thought the root of bitterneſs was not removed, though I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in ſeveral meetings among them with the ſhedding abroad of divine favour, which ſtrengthened me in the diſcharge of my duty; and indeed there is a living remnant ſtill among them, which I cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably hoped would be preſerved in the innocency and ſimplicity of the un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Truth. Several Indians were there, natives of the iſland. I had a deſire to have a meeting among them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with it, which they freely conſented to; and at the time appointed their prieſt was waiting for us, with his meeting-houſe doors open, and ſaid, he would have me go up into the place where he uſed to preach. I told him, I choſe to fit below with my friends. I had a living open time among them, to ſet forth the neceſſity there was for them to turn their minds to the grace of God in their own hearts, a meaſure whereof they, as well as others, had received, according to the apoſtle's doctrine; which, if they gave good heed unto, and yielded obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, according to the manifeſtation thereof, would bring ſalvation. The meeting ended in prayer and praiſes to Almighty God for his great mercy and loving-kindneſs to mankind, in ſending
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:018146_0093_0FA5616AB5555200"/>
his Son to be a light to enlighten the Gentiles, and for his ſalvation to the ends of the earth. Solidity appeared in their countenances, and they behaved with ſobriety, very becoming the occaſion of our aſſembling together. I ſhould be glad there was more of it to be ſeen. among thoſe that profeſs Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>We parted with them in the love of the Goſpel, which I felt in my heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. The wind coming fair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we took our leave of friends, and went on board a veſſel, a friend named William Huſſey being maſter. In the evening of the ſame day we landed upon an iſland called Marthas Vineyard. We quartered at a man's houſe that called himſelf by our name, and I thought he had ſome zeal for Truth, and the promotion of it; for after he underſtood we had a deſire to have a meeting, he haſtened and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his neighbours, and a ſolid good time we had together.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, being favoured with a fair wind, we croſſed the Sound to Dartmouth, and landed nigh the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, where we met with ſeveral friends, who had attended the quarterly meeting. The meeting ended that day, we had a confirming ſweet opportunity together, in waiting upon the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:018146_0094_0FA5616B692416D8"/>
we parted with them, and thoſe that came from Nantucket. Next day we got to Freetown and in the evening had a good opportunity at the houſe of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Barker with the friends that lived thereabouts. To this meeting came the negro man I mentioned before. He told me he had been viſiting; ſome of his own colour, and was returning to Newport, where he lived; but in his way he ſaid, he thought he muſt go by Abraham Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's, though out of his way, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we were come from Nantucket. When he ſaw us, he ſeemed to be almoſt overcome with joy, and was of ſervice to us; for we wanted to ſend ſomebody over the Bay, either that night, or early next morning, to appoint a meeting for us at Portſmouth upon the iſland; and none readier and more willing than poor Caeſar; for he was ſtirring ſo ſoon in the morning, that he gave full notice up and down the iſland. So we had a large ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering collected in due time, though the time to give notice in was ſo ſhort, and ſeaſonable advice was handed forth. From thence we went to Newport with our friend Thomas Richardſon, with whom we had lodged when there before, and were at their monthly meeting; we ſtaid with them alſo on firſt day. Our
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:018146_0095_0FA5616C386A3708"/>
meetings were richly favoured with the free extendings of divine power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſo that I was truly thankful I had been helped to get through the various difficult paths I had to tread in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable part of the world.</p>
                  <p>On ſecond day we left Newport, and croſſed the river to Conannicut Iſland, where a meeting was appointed for us; wherein we were well refreſhed together, and the concluſion was in prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for each other's growth, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and eſtabliſhment in the bleſſed Truth. We here parted with ſome friends of Rhode-Iſland, under a ſenſe of divine favour, and in the uniting love of the Goſpel, which had cauſed us to be near one unto another. Then croſſing the river upon the main land, we had meetings at Kingwood, Peries, Richmond, and Hopkinton, and ſo paſſed through Naraganſet, till we came to Weſterby Lower, the laſt meeting in thoſe parts we had to viſit. We took our leave of thoſe friends that accompanied us in great good will; then travelled through the lower part of Connecticut government, croſſing many rivers, and the weather extreme cold. It was hard for me to bear; but praiſes be to the great Name, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:018146_0096_0FA5616D1EF504B0"/>
in health, and my natural ſtrength did not at all fail.</p>
                  <p>When we had travelled hard about three days, we came again among friends; and on ſixth day had a meeting at Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marance. It was to me a good time; for the bread that refreſheth the hungry ſoul was broken. We then croſſed over to Long-Iſland, and were at the meeting at Fluſhing on firſt day, the twentieth of the eleventh month. On third day we had a meeting at Cow-neck; on fourth day at Weſtbury. Lukewarmneſs and indifference had much prevailed in many places among the profeſſors of Truth. I had often to bear my teſtimony for the bleſſed Truth againſt earthly-mindedneſs, and all the deceitful and falſe coverings of the fleſh, which had been the cauſe of it. I returned back to Fluſhing, in order to be at their quarterly meeting, which began on ſeventh day for miniſters and elders. It was attended with a degree of divine favour, to the comforting of our ſouls. Thoſe meetings were meaſurably bleſſed with the preſence of the great and good Maſter of our aſſemblies, and his voice was heard by ſome, to ſpeak as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man ſpake; and we had to conclude in humble ſupplication to him for his help, and the continuation of his mercy, in
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:018146_0097_0FA5616EAB121F80"/>
viſiting and turning the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to himſelf. I then viſited the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the iſland, which I had not yet been at, and had meetings at Rockway, and again at Weſtbury monthly meeting, where I was cloſely exerciſed on Truth's account; but was helped to clear myſelf of what lay upon my mind, and came away eaſy.</p>
                  <p>I then went to Bethphage, and had meetings alſo at Sickatauge and Oyſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay, where there had been a large meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but now much declined; yet we had a large meeting, accompanied with Divine Power, to my great comfort. On firſt day I was at Jericho. The meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiſted of ſeveral hundreds of people, who heard the Truth declared with great attention, the power of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over all, to the praiſe of Iſrael's God. Paſſing through New-York, I ſtaid their meeting; then croſſed over by way of Staten-Iſland, to Rahway in Eaſt-Jerſey, where I had a meeting with friends, and ſome others, that came in, to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and comfort of ſeveral, myſelf in particular; being therein ſtrengthened and encouraged to go forward in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſervice I might be engaged in. We lodged at Joſeph Shotwell's, and on ſixth day had a meeting at Plainfield. It was
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:018146_0098_0FA56070EC330488"/>
but ſmall, by reaſon of ſhort notice, yet favoured with the overſhadowings of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour; for which our ſouls were inwardly bowed to the Father of all our mercies.</p>
                  <p>I rode to Whitpiny on ſeventh day to the quarterly meeting, which began on firſt day. It was a good ſatisfactory time with us. I ſtaid there on ſecond day, and was at the preparative meeting, which was ſatisfactory, divers things being opened and delivered in the pure wiſdom concerning the things of God, and the good order eſtabliſhed in his church. I had ſome good ſeaſonable opportunities in ſome friends families; and on third day had a meeting at Rahway appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thoſe of other ſocieties; which was to good ſatisfaction. On fourth day we went to the Great Meadows, where we had a meeting with the friends there, amongſt whom is a living remnant. We were made to rejoice together, in a true ſenſe of the ſhedding abroad of Divine Love in our hearts. On fifth day I went to Kingwood monthly meeting. I had ſome ſervice there for Truth, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to the good order of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in each branch of our Chriſtian diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; which I obſerved to be much wanting among them. On ſixth day I
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:018146_0099_0FA56071DB72C390"/>
had a meeting at Amwell, at the houſe of Gerſhom Motts. It was an open time, Truth in a good degree prevailing. On firſt day had a meeting at Croſwick's; a cloſe ſearching t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e it was, many ſtates being opened in the love of the Goſpel. On ſecond day I was at a meeting at Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, in which I was largely opened in the free extendings of divine favour. On third day, the nineteenth of the twelfth month, I had a meeting at Upper-Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. I was led to the ſtates of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a cloſe manner, and the meeting ended well. On fourth day I had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Old-Springfield. It was an edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and good meeting, Truth having the dominion, to the praiſe of Iſrael's God. On fifth day I went to Little Egg-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and had a meeting there next day, in which I was enabled to clear myſelf in a good degree, and came away eaſy.</p>
                  <p>We croſſed the river in the evening to Great Egg-Harbour. The weather being very cold, and having much ice, our journey was attended with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; but we got well over the river, though in the night, to Great Egg-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and lodged at Robert Smith's, an ancient friend, who, with his wife, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained us very kindly. We had a meeting there on ſeventh day, held at a
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:018146_0100_0FA560726B4911E8"/>
friend's houſe, by reaſon of the extreme cold ſeaſon. We had a ſolemn comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time together, and after meeting rode to the other meeting, along the Bay ſhore, towards Cape-May, which was on firſt day, the twenty-fourth of the twelfth month 1758. It was a cloſe exerciſing time with me. The froſt was ſo ſharp, we could not croſs the Bay to Cape-May, but were obliged to ride round to a bridge, where we croſſed the river; which was about forty miles out of the way, and being ſtrangers to the road, we met with much difficulty through the woods, and there was no beaten path to be ſeen for ſome miles. I ſaw that the friend, who pretended to be our guide, was going wrong, and told him, if we took that courſe, it would lead us much out of the way; for I was very uneaſy, Upon which he took out his compaſs, and finding it ſo, altered his courſe to that which I thought lay towards the road. I then found my mind quite eaſy, and ſaid, I thought we ſhould ſoon find it, which ſo happened. I ſaid not much to the friends, but was thankful to the Lord, to find he was pleaſed to draw my mind towards the way we wanted to go.</p>
                  <p>Night coming on, with much rain, we lodged at a tavern, and next morning got
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:018146_0101_0FA56075C6732750"/>
to William Townſend's, where we had two meetings to pretty good ſatisfaction. On ſeventh day we rode about forty miles to John Reeves at Greenwich, were at the meeting on firſt day, the thirty-firſt of the twelfth month, and had good ſervice for Truth. In that place there is a promiſing appearance, among the youth, of the proſperity of Truth. Second day, the firſt of the firſt month, we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Alloway's Creek, which was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with good; I being helped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my own expectation. On third day I had a meeting at the head of Alloway's Creek, where I was led to ſeveral ſtates in a cloſe manner, and came away much refreſhed in the Lord: praiſes be to his great Name for evermore! I had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Salem on fourth day, there being a marriage, and the new wine was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth, which made ſeveral rejoice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſeme of divine favour communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto our ſouls. On fifth day I had a meeting at Pile's Grove. It was large, ſeveral of other ſocieties being there, I was opened in the free extendings of Goſpel love to their ſouls. It was a good time to many, magnified be the God of our ſalvation! On ſixth day I had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Woodbury, which was a ſolid good time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="unknown:018146_0102_0FA56077215BB028"/>The ſixth of the firſt month I went to Haddonfield, and lodged at the widow Eaſtaugh's, where I was very kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained. On firſt day I went to Eveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham meeting, where I had been before, and had ſervice for Truth in the love of the Goſpel. Haddonfield monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being on ſecond day, I ſtaid there, and had an exerciſe on my mind for the honour, promotion, and proſperity of the bleſſed Truth, and that all might act in the wiſdom, power, and life, and might know ſelf kept down by the power. I rejoiced I was at this meeting, Truth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, and the Lord's power being over all. I was made thankful in my heart to the great Author from whence all our bleſſings flow.</p>
                  <p>I want to Philadelphia on third day, but finding my mind drawn towards the Eaſtern ſhore of Maryland, I ſet out again on fifth day, the eleventh of the firſt month, and reached Wilmington that night. I lodged at William Shipley's, when at Wilmington, and having ſeen his wife Elizabeth, when in Old England, in the ſervice of Truth, the remembrance of which had often been revived upon my mind, as believing her to be a mother in Iſrael, and a ſanctified veſſel fitted for the maſter's uſe, I could not but rejoice to ſee
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:018146_0103_0FA56078584ADB58"/>
her again, and find her alive in the Truth, now in her declining years. Our next meeting was at the head of Saſſafraſs. It was a hard time with me the fore part of the meeting; yet I came away well ſatisfied, Truth favouring towards the concluſion, to the honour and praiſe of Iſrael's God. After meeting I went home with Joſhua Vanſant's, where I lodged.</p>
                  <p>The next meeting was at Cecil. I was was exceeding poor and low, and deeply exerciſed in my mind, but was helped over all, and beyond all thought and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pection of my own; for I think, I may ſay in ſincerity, I had no truſt nor confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſave in the Lord alone, who hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath been my rock, and my ſtrong tower, my ſure helper in every needful time. May I, with all mine, put our truſt in him, hath often been the earneſt prayer and ſupplication of my ſoul. I had a meeting at Queen Ann's, which ended well, the Lord's power being felt among us, to our comfort. I lodged at — Furner's, where we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the family, and ſeveral others who came in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I hope it might tend in ſome degree to ſtir up the careleſs, and warn the unfaithful. The twenty-firſt of the firſt month I had a meeting at Tuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahoa.
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:018146_0104_0FA5607868A66EE0"/>
It was ſmall, but attended with good, the Lord favouring us with his preſence, according to his gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>On firſt day I croſſed Choptank-River over to Marſhy Creek, and was at their meeting. I was much comforted, and had peace in the diſcharge of what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be my duty; though I travelled in great fear, and much weakneſs at times. I was at Choptank meeting on ſecond day, which was ſilent; yet I came away eaſy, with ſweetneſs upon my mind, having been ſtrenthened in my ſilent wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I had a meeting on third day at the Third-Haven, where I was ſenſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſtates of thoſe that were not willing to take up the croſs to their corrupt wills and inclinations; and had to bear teſtimony againſt unfaithfulneſs, diſobedience, truth-breakers, and ſuch as brought diſhonour upon the Truth, and our holy profeſſion. I felt the love of the Goſpel flow freely, even towards the backſliders; and in it warning them, I came away ſweetly comforted in my ſpirit. Fourth day I went to the Bay ſide, where we had a meeting on fifth day, with a few lukewarm profeſſors. I had to exhort them to more diligence in keeping up their meetings, and waiting therein, that
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:018146_0105_0FA5607934A38660"/>
they might know the renewing of ſtrength in the Lord, and be enabled to worſhip him (as he is a Spirit) in Spirit and in Truth. On ſeventh day I was at the quarterly meeting of miniſters and elders at Third Haven, where I had ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for Truth. On firſt day I was again at Tuckahoa meeting, Truth favouring, in the love of the Goſpel, many divine truths were opened to the edification and comfort of our ſouls; and ended in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupplication and prayer to Almighty God for his help, ſtrength, and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the way of truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. On third day I was at Third-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, at the quarterly meeting, where ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral friends had good ſervice for the Truth, in the love of which we were comforted together in the Lord, and helped to bear teſtimony againſt thoſe things which are crept in by reaſon of unfaithfulneſs among the profeſſors of Truth. On fourth day, the thirty-firſt of the firſt month, I, with ſeveral friends, went towards Lewis-Town. On ſixth day had a meeting at Cold-Spring, where is a poor company of indifferent luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm profeſſors. On ſeventh day I had a meeting at Motherkiln, which was pretty large, and attended with the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:018146_0106_0FA5607A2B83BD70"/>
ſhedding abroad of divine love to the people.</p>
                  <p>I was at Little-Creek on firſt day, where we were comforted together in the Lord. Here is a promiſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect among the young people of the proſperity of Truth. I was at Duck-Creek meeting on ſecond day, which was ſmall, yet a living open time to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral. Thence I paſſed to George's Creek, where I had a meeting; and ſo to Wilmington, where I met with Samuel Spavold, who embarked for England on fifth day, the eighth of the ſecond month 1759. I ſtaid the monthly meeting, which was that day, in which I was large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened to the ſtates of ſeveral, things being much out of order, by reaſon of a difference which had happened among them. I came away I thought clear, and eaſy in my mind. On ſeventh day, the tenth of the ſecond month, I was at Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord quarterly meeting for miniſters and elders, which was ſolid, and much good advice was handed forth. On firſt day I was at Kennet, and had large openings to the people, in the free extendings of the line of Truth's way. On ſecond day was again at Concord quarterly meeting for worſhip and diſcipline, in which Truth's teſtimony went forth againſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:018146_0107_0FA5607AABD4A460"/>
gainſayers, and libertine ſpirits. I had a word of comfort and conſolation alſo to the weak feeble mourners in Zion. Things cloſed well, and we parted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in the Lord. On third day I was at a meeting at Providence, held for young people chiefly; it was to good ſatisfaction, and ended well. On fourth day, the fourteenth of the ſecond month, I had a meeting at Birmingham. I felt the Lord was with us, helping and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way by his own power; praiſes be to his great Name for ever!</p>
                  <p>After meeting, we croſſed the river called Brandywine, and went to my kind friend William Harvey's, where I was kindly entertained. On fifth day, the fifteenth of the ſecond month, I had a meeting at Center, in New caſtle county. I was glad and thankful in my mind, to feel myſelf fully given up to what the good hand was pleaſed to give forth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſpeak, or be ſilent. On ſixth day I had a meeting at Hockeſſon, which was pretty large, and in degree favoured; yet could not ſay I rejoiced, for in that place I felt the ſeed ſuffered, as well as in many other places, where my lot hath been caſt of late; eſpecially among the elders, and thoſe that ſhould be the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rank in religion. I could not help
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:018146_0108_0FA5607B818125A8"/>
mourning in ſecret, at times, under a ſenſe of the relapſed ſtate of the church of Chriſt in many places. How depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the innocency and ſimplicity, and decking herſelf with her own ornaments of ſelf-righteouſneſs, and alſo ſtained and ſpotted with the world, and the filth of the fleſh! On ſeventh day I was at the meeting for miniſters and elders, held at London Grove for that quarter, and alſo at their meeting on firſt day, which was bleſſed with the company of him that dwelt in the buſh; for his ſacred fire was kindled in our hearts, with living deſires, that the mount of Eſau might be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. On ſecond day (after a ſolemn hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſeaſon together, in true ſpiritual worſhip, which ended with thankfulneſs and living praiſes to Almighty God) the affairs of the church were carried on, and tranſacted in brotherly love, and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion towards one another. We had alſo a comfortable and confirming time together on third day, at our farewell meeting, which being a freſh ſeal of the Father's love, and continued regard for his church and people, in uniting and making us to rejoice together in him, it will remain, I hope, upon many minds, with gratitude to the great Giver of every good gift.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="unknown:018146_0109_0FA5607CDD618BA0"/>Whilſt I was here I lodged one night at John Smith's, an ancient friend, who had kept his place well in the Truth, and alſo at Joſhua Puſey's, a good ſolid friend, who had a hopeful offspring. Hence I went to Weſt-Caln, and lodged at George Singular's, and was at the meeting on fourth day, the twenty-firſt of the ſecond month. It was an exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time with me, yet I could not ſay but I thought Truth had the dominion. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meeting I croſſed Brandywine, and went to Eaſt-Caln, and was at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on fifth day, the twenty-ſecond of the ſecond month, which proved an helpful edifying ſeaſon to many. I went after meeting to Downing's Town, and had an evening meeting at a friend's houſe, which was thought by ſome to good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. On ſixth day I had a meeting at Nantmil, after which I felt eaſy in my ſpirit, notwithſtanding I had cloſe and hard labour. On ſeventh day I had a meeting at Pikeland, which was a water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, for the Lord hath a living ſeed in that place, which in his own time he will raiſe up to the praiſe of his own great Name!</p>
                  <p>On firſt day I was at Uwchlan meeting. It was large, and attended with a good degree of divine favour, which made it
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:018146_0110_0FA5607CED59D148"/>
ſatisfactory to many, though not ſo open to me as at ſome other times. Our next was at the Foreſt, or Robinſon's. I was much exerciſed to recommend to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward waiting, which by many profeſſors is much neglected. Our next meeting was at Exeter. On fifth day we had a meeting at Reading, and afterward went to Maiden-Creek. At Reading our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was in the town-houſe, or court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where ſeveral ſoldiers came, and many of the town's people, who behaved very ſoberly; the good power of Truth coming over all, and prevailing, many minds were humbled and brought low. It was a good time, eſpecially to ſome of the ſoldiers, who were reached by the inviſible power of Truth. The meeting ended in praiſes and thankfulneſs to the Almighty, for his unſpeakable favours; who is over all, worthy for evermore!</p>
                  <p>After meeting we went to Maiden-Creek, where we had a meeting on ſixth day. It was large, and to tolerable good ſatisfaction. We lodged at Moſes Star's. On firſt day we had a meeting at the Great Swamp. It was a living ſatisfactory time to ſeveral; and, in general, an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſeaſon. I dined, after meeting, at Morris Morris's, the huſband of the worthy Suſanna Morris, and then rode
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:018146_0111_0FA5607DB1FE0CC8"/>
to Plumſtead, where we had a meeting on ſecond day, the fifth of the third month. The good power of Truth was alſo felt among us in this meeting, to the edification and comfort of our ſouls. On third day I was at Buckingham monthly meeting, in which I was favoured with the pure life and freſh ſpring of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which ran freely in the love of it.</p>
                  <p>Here is a large body of people in this province of Pennſylvania, the elders of which are too much in the outward court, which is only trodden by the Gentiles, or ſuch as are in the ſpirit of the world; yet a young and riſing generation is here, as well as in ſeveral other places where my lot hath been caſt, ſince I came into this land, whom the Lord hath viſited by his power and good Spirit in their hearts, which, as they take good heed in yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience to, and bring all things into the obedience of Chriſt, will crucify all their inordinate deſires, evil thoughts, and imaginations, and enable them to bring forth the fruits of the Spirit, which are love, joy, peace, gentleneſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, long-ſuffering, and goodneſs: againſt theſe there is no law. I have often tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed for them ſince I have been among them, leſt the labours of love, which have long been beſtowed on thee, Oh

America! thou favoured of the Lord! leſt they ſhould be beſtowed on thee in vain; and thou, inſtead of bringing forth fruits to the praiſe of the great Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhould bring forth wild grapes, fruits of the fleſh, ſuch as he can in no wiſe take delight in; and inſtead of a bleſſing, draw down a curſe, and provoke him to take away the hedge of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and thou be trodden down and laid waſte by the devourer; and for thy ingratitude, diſobedience, and unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, even command his clouds not to rain upon thee any more.

He hath ſo viſited thee, in mercy ſparing, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy return, that if thou return not with thy whole heart, his anger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation certainly will break forth againſt thee, and ſo as not to be quenched; no, though thou mayſt make many prayers, and ſpread forth thine hands, he will not hear nor regard; inaſmuch as thou haſt hated inſtruction, and did not chooſe the fear of the Lord, but haſt ſet at nought all his counſel, and would not take heed

He will alſo laugh at thy calamity, and even mock when thy fear cometh; when thy deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is unavoidable, and thy deſtruction as ſwift as the whirlwind. I humbly beg this may never be thy doom; but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the days of his mercy, and thy tranquillity, may be lengthened out, let Truth take place, that equity, juſtice, and true judgment, may run down in the ſtreets of thine heart like a mighty ſtream: then ſhall thy peace be as a river, or as the waves of the ſea, that never can be dried up.</p>
                  <p>I was at Wright's Town on fourth day. It was an exerciſing and low time with me, but I truſt Truth did not ſuffer on my account. On fifth day I was at Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>d. It was a living and precious time with us in the meeting, Truth's power prevailing to the dividing the word aright. The ſenſe of which is cauſe of true thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the humble-hearted. I had a meeting at the Falls on ſixth day, to ſolid ſatisfaction; and afterwards rode to Briſtol, and had a meeting on ſeventh day, the 10th of the third month. I was glad Truth in ſome good degree had the dominion. I ſtaid the meeting on firſt day, the eleventh of the third month.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:018146_0114_0FA560822B85C4F8"/>
This was a good time to us; the Lord's power was over all, to the praiſe of his own great Name!</p>
                  <p>On ſecond day I had a meeting at Abington, in which I was favoured with the openings of Truth, in the ſpring of the Goſpel, to the exhorting all to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, even the rebellious, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers; that they might come to know ſalvation to their ſouls through Chriſt. My next meeting was at Horſham, which was large; in which Truth favouring, it was made a precious time to many, as I then felt. On fourth day I had a meeting at Gwynedd or North-Wales, where there is a pretty large body of friends; the fight of whom, in many places, and the ſenſe of divine favour ſtill extended towards them, was cauſe of hun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

I made my home, whilſt there, with the widow Rachel Pemberton and her ſon John, worthy friends; ſhe a mother in Iſrael, and a great care-taker of the poor ſervants who have been ſent, not only in opening the door, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling the fire, but in miniſtring every thing that ſhe thought might be a help

and ſervice to them in their journey; for which, I am fully perſuaded in my mind, ſhe, with many others, will not loſe their reward. <q>Inaſmuch as ye did it unto one of thoſe little ones</q> (ſaith our dear Lord) <q>that believe in my Name, ye did it unto me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thirty-firſt of the third month I left Philadelphia again, in order to viſit a few meetings in Cheſter county which I had not yet been at. On firſt day I was at Providence meeting, which was a good and ſatisfactory opportunity, the ſtate of things much opened, and our minds in a good degree humbled, under a lively ſenſe of divine favour. I was at Concord on ſecond day. John Churchman alſo being there, was very helpful to ſettle the minds of ſome, who had gone into jangling about ſome things which had happened among them. This being their monthly meeting, we left them to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a pretty quiet frame of mind, and things ended well. After meeting I rode towards Haverford, and on third day was at Haverford meeting, which was well. On fourth day I was at Darby meeting. It was an exerciſing time to me, things being much out of order, ſome differing in their judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was, and what was not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:018146_0116_0FA560851F9FC788"/>
with our religious principles in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to military ſervice, in which ſeveral who go under our name, had been med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling and concerning themſelves. This brought great exerciſe and trouble on the faithful. A grievous refractory libertine ſpirit I ſaw appeared; yet it was in a good degree kept down, and Truth, in ſome good meaſure, had the dominion.</p>
                  <p>On fifth day, the fifth of the fourth month, I was at Springfield. It was a large good ſeaſonable opportunity to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. On ſixth day I was at Newtown meeting; in which Truth's way was largely opened, and livingly ſet forth in the power of it, to the humbling, and ſolid ſatisfaction of many: a day to be remembered by the ſenſible. After meeting I went to George Miller's, where I had been before; a very kind friend. On firſt day I was at Middletown meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It was a large gathering, and Truth had the dominion over all; though many dry profeſſors were liſtening and longing after words, which ſometimes hath cauſed the living ſtream to be withheld for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet the great goodneſs and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of a merciful God is wonderful, in that he is pleaſed to cauſe the living ſtream of the goſpel miniſtry to iſſue and break forth in a wonderful manner, to

the refreſhing of his own heritage. The glory and honour, with living praiſes, be given to him, and that for evermore!</p>
                  <p>I had an evening meeting at the ſchool-houſe; it alſo was an opportunity of good to our ſouls, which were refreſhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Lord. Iſaac Greenleaf of Philadelphia being with me, on ſecond day, we were at Goſhen meeting, which was attended with good; Truth in ſome good degree favouring. We lodged at Aaron Aſhbridge's, and on third day had a meeting at Bradford. We were much hindered in our way by the waters being much out, and a friend was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being carried away, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. We got to meeting, though friends had been gathered an hour, or more. It proved a good ſeaſon; the Lord had companion on us, and cauſed his Goſpel rain to deſcend on the thirſty ground, to the refreſhing of that which was of his own right hand planting, and alſo to the placing judgment upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous part, and all the fruits thereof. I came away thankful in my ſpirit to the Lord, for his great goodneſs to his poor people; becauſe I ſaw his mercy and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-kindneſs endure for ever.</p>
                  <p>On fourth day we had a meeting at the Great Valley, in which I perceived

the extendings of good was offered, even to the gainſayers and rebellious: a mercy unſpeakable! After meeting we went to a friend's houſe, with whom Margaret Ellis abides, and were at Radnor meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on fifth day, the twelfth of the fourth month; in which, though I was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much weakneſs, I thought I had ſome ſervice for Truth. On ſixth day I had a meeting at Merrion, which was not an unprofitable ſeaſon, I truſt, to ſeveral. I returned that day to Philadelphia, and on ſeventh day, with John Pemberton, I rode to Plymouth, and was at that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. On firſt and ſecond day at New-Providence. On third day returned again to Philadelphia, with ſome degree of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and attended their week-day meeting, there being a marriage. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral did rejoice under a renewed ſenſe of the ancient power and loving kindneſs of our heavenly Father's tender regard, in that he was pleaſed to cauſe his love and life-giving preſence to be felt amongſt us, to the refreſhing the ſincere and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hearted.

Whilſt I waited here, ſuppoſing my ſervice to be moſtly over upon the continent, having paid a general viſit, I unexpectedly, and pretty ſuddenly, felt a ſtrong draught towards Barbadoes, or the Weſt-India Iſlands. I acquainted friends therewith, and made ſome eſſay for a paſſage, yet ſaw not my way quite clear; but in waiting felt my way open towards the Jerſeys, and on the twelfth of the fifth month I, with John Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton, went to Mount-Holly, and was at the two-weeks meeting on firſt day: and on ſecond day at More's-Town, where a meeting was appointed for two friends, who were on their way towards Salem yearly meeting, where I was alſo with them. On third day John Pemberton left me at Ancocas, which meeting was in a good degree ſatisfactory, and alſo to the honour of Truth, the edification of the Lord's people, and the praiſe of his great Name! On third day evening I came to my worthy and well-eſteemed friend Elizabeth Eaſtaugh's, where I
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:018146_0120_0FA56087D45D8810"/>
lodged. On fourth day I was at a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Haddonfield; on fifth day at Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury; ſixth day at Solomon Lippincot's; ſeventh day at Piles-Grove. All theſe meetings, I thought, had a good tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the edification of the churches, and ended well. Thankſgiving and praiſe be to him that lives and abides for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more!</p>
                  <p>The nineteenth of the fifth month 1759, the yearly meeting for worſhip at Salem began, where we were much comforted together, in the enjoyment of divine goodneſs. The free extendings of the Goſpel-ſpring flowed plentifully, to the watering the heritage of God; the ſenſe whereof bowed many with humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in praiſes to his great and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Name, who is worthy for ever! The twenty-fifth we had a meeting at Eveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and went next day to Mount-Holly, where alſo we had a meeting; on ſeventh day to Croſwicks, where their quarterly meeting began for miniſters and elders. On firſt day I was at Bordentown in the fore part of the day, and at Tren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:018146_0121_0FA560892E694190"/>
day the meeting was very large, and I was deeply engaged for the honour of Truth's cauſe, there being a looſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſpirit amongſt ſome who go under the name of friends, yet never came under the yoke of Chriſt, to know the deeds of the body to be mortified; but live at eaſe in the gratification of their heart's luſts, and cauſe the way of Truth to be evil ſpoken of. My concern was chiefly to ſuch as live at eaſe in Zion, and to the backſliders in Iſrael, yet I had a word of comfort to the mourners in Zion, and the heavy-hearted in Jeruſalem, that they might hold on their way. I was glad of ſo ſeaſonable an opportunity, wherein I was led to ſpeak ſo cloſely to the ſtates of many, in true Goſpel-love, which was as a ſeal of divine favour.</p>
                  <p>Upon our taking leave of each other, we committed one another to the Lord, and parted in great love, and true Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-fellowſhip. I then croſſed Delaware at the Falls, in order to ſee my friends once more in Bucks county, where there is a large body, and got to my worthy friend John Scarborough's on fourth day, with whom I had travelled ſeveral weeks both in the Jerſeys and Maryland. I had great ſatisfaction in his company, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of a good underſtanding, a
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:018146_0122_0FA56089F4E6C920"/>
tender ſpirit, and very ſerviceable in the church. The quarterly meeting for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and elders began at Buckingham on fourth day, the thirtieth of the fifth month, which I attended, and alſo on fifth day a meeting for worſhip and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and I thought different ſentiments were getting in amongſt them. It great care is not taken to keep to Truth's teachings, and the une<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ring guidance of it, which will ſubdue and keep down all unruly ſpirits, there will be great trouble and uneaſineſs, if not ſeparation, in many places: for I ſaw an evil ſpirit of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was got into the church, and in the ways of its workings, it appeared in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhapes, in order to draw after it the hearts of the ſimple, and ſuch as, like itſelf, are unſtable; for it is an unſtable ſpirit, and by this it may be known, and ſuch as are led into its ways, and own its workings. For they will be reſtleſs, not eaſy, under the croſs; but will caſt off the yoke of Chriſt, and go from his teachings, meekneſs, and humility, into a haughty proud ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is rough, full of hatred and envy, deſpiſeth counſel, and will not bear reproof. This ſpirit, I thought, I perceived working in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquity; but its time is not yet fully come to bring forth its monſtrous

birth. The Lord's mercy is very great to his people, for this ſeed of the ſerpent hath hitherto been cruſhed, and put by, in its puttings forth; and the true ſeed, though through hard labour and travail, hath been brought forth into dominion, to the praiſe of Iſrael's God.</p>
                  <p>This quarterly meeting conſiſted of ſeveral hundreds, moſtly a young genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The gracious extendings of divine goodneſs was felt, and Truth's power did prevail over all the powers and ſpirits of darkneſs. I was glad I was here, and my ſpirit did rejoice in the Lord, the God of my ſalvation. After meeting on ſixth day I went home with Samuel Wilſon. On firſt day I was at Plumſtead meeting, which was attended with good, the power of Truth prevailing. In the evening I was at a meeting nigh Buckingham, at a ſchool-houſe. It was a large gathering, and we were much comforted and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the Lord. I was at their monthly meeting at Buckingham on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day, the fourth of the ſixth month, in which, through the prevalence and owning of Truth, which came over the minds of the people, things were carried on well, both in the time of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in tranſacting of the affairs of the church; for the power of Truth kept
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:018146_0124_0FA5608B2D3A2000"/>
down all reſtleſs and unruly ſpirits, which at times are putting up their heads in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the teſtimony thereof, and are for trampling all diſcipline under foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I was deeply exerciſed in my ſpirit before the Lord at times, that I might be kept in the innocency, meekneſs, and pure wiſdom. Some being as I thought, righteous over-much, I was afraid leſt they ſhould deſtroy themſelves, and ſo diſhonour the cauſe of Truth, which they at times had ſo zealouſly contended for.</p>
                  <p>After this meeting was over, I went to Wright's-Town monthly meeting, which was next day. In this meeting I had hard labour and exerciſe; yet things ended well, I came away ſatisfied, and thankful in my heart to the Lord, for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> unſpeakable mercies. The Falls monthly meeting being on fourth day, I was there alſo, had ſome ſervice for Truth, and parted with ſeveral friends in much love and tenderneſs, we not expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee each other again in mutability. On fifth day I was at Middletown month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, in which I was drawn forth, in the living ſprin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the Goſpel, both in the men's and women's meeting. Then feeling my ſpirit eaſy and clear, I left them in love, and the unity of the
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:018146_0125_0FA5608C27D5D488"/>
one ſpirit, which had united us together in a near manner.</p>
                  <p>On firſt day I was again at North-Wales, and had good ſatisfaction at their two meetings. On ſecond day I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again to Philadelphia, having been about a month from the town. On third day, the twelfth of the ſixth month, I was at the Bank meeting, in which we were comforted together, it being an edifying ſeaſon to many. I ſtaid in and about Philadelphia about four weeks, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting ſome families, and attending meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as they came in courſe, though, in meetings, I had little to ſay, being ſhut up, and much bound in my ſpirit to keep ſilence in that city. The cauſe is beſt known to the great overſeer of his people, who can do with them as ſeemeth to him good: and I ſaw it was good for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be reſigned and contented with all the openings and ſhuttings of his hand; with the various diſpenſations he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lead through, that there may not be any confuſion throughout the camp of God's Iſrael. I could not but rejoice, in thankfulneſs of heart, that I was quite ſilent, and ſtill in my ſpirit; being made ſenſible it was the Lord's own doings, and indeed it is marvellous in our eyes, that he who is the captain of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:018146_0126_0FA5608CA8E53918"/>
ſhould call for ſuch a ceſſation of arms, for a ſeaſon, that his ſoldiers might take a little reſt under his royal pavilion and canopy of pure love.</p>
                  <p>I was at Darby week-day meeting the fourth of the week; on fifth day at Cheſter week-day meeting; and on ſixth day at Chicheſter, where a meeting was appointed for me; which was large, and accompanied with the free extendings of divine mercy to our ſoul's refreſhment. On ſeventh day I was at London-Grove monthly meeting and alſo at their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on firſt day. It was a contriting and bowing time with many, and we parted in the true unity, fellowſhip, and heart-tendering love of the Goſpel of Peace. On ſecond day I was at Concord monthly meeting, which was a hard, laborious, exerciſing ſeaſon, both in time of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and diſcipline; things being much out of Goſpel order, by reaſon of ſtrife and diſcord, as oppoſite to the pure and peaceable government of the church of Chriſt, as darkneſs is to light. The evil ſpirit was kept down in a good degree, and that which was out of order much helped by the power of Truth.</p>
                  <p>The tenth of the ſeventh month 1759, I got to Philadelphia; the eighteenth, ſeveral friends accompanying me, we
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:018146_0127_0FA56090268534C0"/>
went to Cheſter, and the nineteenth on board a veſſel, which was bound for Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes. Sometime after we were got to ſea, I was cloſely exerciſed in my mind, which brought me very low, in humble ſupplication before the Lord, that he would be pleaſed to enable me to go through whatſoever he, in the courſe of his infinite wiſdom, might ſuffer to come upon me, whether for a trial of my faith, or any other of his wiſe and good ends. For I could appeal to him in great ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was in obedience to his requirings, that I had undertaken that voyage; and not in my own will. This was indeed with me as a time of renewing of my covenant, and coming under a cloſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, that if he would but be with me, to deliver and preſerve me in the way that I had to go, ſo that I might return again to his houſe in true peace; then he ſhould be my God, and I would ſerve him. May I therefore, with all the Lord's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants every where, not only make cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, when under cloſe and deep exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſoul; but, Oh! let us be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrictly to obſerve and keep them; for I am a living witneſs for him, that he is a covenant-keeping God with his people.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I was under this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

nearly united in the cloſeſt ties of nature, were brought nigh to me in ſpirit (though far ſeparated in body) with ſtrong deſires and fervent ſupplications, that they might be preſerved in the Truth, and that the Lord, in his infinite mercy, would be pleaſed to viſit their ſouls with a freſh vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of his pure love. The churches alſo of the Lord (eſpecially thoſe people I had ſo lately viſited, and had at times been ſo cloſely engaged for, in the love of the Father) were ſpread before me in the neareſt manner, with fervent prayer, that they might abide in his love, ſtand in his counſel, and live in his holy fear; that ſo we might ſtill be a people to his praiſe, and bring honour to his great and holy Name, and the profeſſion we are making of the bleſſed Truth; that the bleſſings which he hath reſerved, and laid up in ſtore, might not be withheld, but plentifully ſhowered down upon his heritage.</p>
                  <p>My mind now was much eaſed, and that which had been as a load upon my ſpirit was taken away, and I was freely reſigned to the will of God. At that time, if I rightly knew my own heart, the fear of death was alſo removed, and, I truſt, the occaſion of it, which is ſin; for I did not find that my conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:018146_0129_0FA56092935EC168"/>
me, though I well know, I have nothing to truſt in but divine mercy, through my dear Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in whom, and by whom, all our ſins are taken away, and we are redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto God, and that by his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood. It is by him we alſo have acceſs to the Father, his ſpirit bearing witneſs with our ſpirits, that we are his children, often crying, Abba, Father, through the eternal Spirit, which helpeth our infirmities, and maketh interceſſion for us; enabling us to aſk aright, and pray in an acceptable manner.</p>
                  <p>I may not omit remarking at this time, when the French were nigh taking us, my ſpirit was ſo at liberty, and over them, and all the powers of darkneſs in the Lord, that I did not ſee it would be ſo; and having had great freedom and liberty in my mind to go in this ſame veſſel, could not reflect upon myſelf for miſſing of it in any reſpect, except it was in making mention of it ſometimes too free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which it is likely ſome might lay hold of, and that not to their own advantage. When we were taken, the Frenchmen (conſidering all their views are for plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) did not uſe me ill. They took my little money, ſome of my linen, and part of my other wearing apparel; but my
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:018146_0130_0FA56092B45ED470"/>
bed and cheſt, with many other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they let me keep; which was of great ſervice to me afterwards. For I was now in a part of the world where I was a ſtranger, and no money of my own left; yet I do not remember I either murmured or repined at what had befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len me; or that any diſtruſtful thoughts roſe in my heart, ſo as to trouble and oppreſs my ſpirit; which I eſteemed as one of the moſt ſingular favours amongſt the many I have received from the great and merciful hand.</p>
                  <p>The privateer belonging to Martinico, we landed at a town called St. Peter's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great part of which was laid in aſhes about two weeks after we were ſet at at liberty, as I was afterwards informed. We were all had to priſon; but our captain, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the mate, and a paſſenger, were put into a little room, which opened into the priſon-yard. I think it was about twelve feet ſquare, and we upwards of twenty (if I remember right) to lie in it. Before we left the place, my fellow-priſoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved courteouſly and civilly, none of them offering me any abuſe, though I had often to reprove, and exhort them to amend their lives. It was extreme hot weather, and our yard, where we had liberty to walk, as well as our lodging
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:018146_0131_0FA56093834D0C08"/>
room, was expoſed to the ſun moſt of the day. They let me have my bed in the night next to the door and window for the benefit of the air, which was an advantage; but, alas! I had a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage along with it, for the tub in which we eaſed ourſelves, ſtood very nigh me, and the waſh and filth of the court-yard came through a hole in the wall, very nigh the window where I lay, ſo that oft in the night I was nigh fainting with ſtink, which the heat of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made very nauſeous. The bread allowed us was pretty good, but almoſt every kind of victuals was loathſome to my ſtomach in this ſtinking unwholeſome place. There were ſalt beef and pork for thoſe that could eat them; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither ſoaked, nor half boiled, I perceived there was but little of it eaten by any. My chief living, whilſt there, was bread and water, ſometimes a little cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, but that was ſeldom, for we could not always get it boiled. Oatmeal mixed in water was what I often drank, it ſerving alſo for food. The water they let the priſoners have, I believe, is very unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, it being taken up below, where the negroes waſh their clothes, and alſo where the filth of the town is caſt in. Moſt of the priſoners, I perceived, were
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:018146_0132_0FA5609463276B90"/>
troubled with a lax; and I had not been there above two or three days, before I was taken with it; which, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme heat, and unwholſomeneſs of the place, brought me ſo low and weak, that it was hard work for me to walk about a little in the priſon-yard; but I ſtrove, and was helped indeed beyond my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; for after we were ſet at liberty from the priſon, we were ſix days on board the veſſel that ſet us upon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh iſland, in which time I think I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more hardſhip than whilſt I was in priſon; for being very weak, and the weather ſtill hot, cloſe, and ſultry, I could not abide in the cabin among the people, but was forced to lie upon the deck, where I could get air, though I was expoſed to the night-dews, and guſts of rain, which we ſometimes had; all which tended to increaſe my diſorder. The French captain gave me the liberty of the cabin, and ſhewed me kindneſs in other reſpects. We were becalmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the iſland of Guadaloupe, and came to an anchor in a cove, where we took in freſh water; but I went not on ſhore. I was informed there was a great mortality among the Engliſh ſoldiers; and many others, who went about buſineſs, were taken off very ſuddenly at this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="unknown:018146_0133_0FA56094F858F8F8"/>The ſeventh of the ninth month they landed us at the iſland called St. Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's, where I found ſome kind friendly people; though the generality were very gay, light, and airy. After I had been there a little time, my diſorder abating, I began to gather ſtrength, ſo as to walk about; and I found a few here, who had ſome knowledge of friends, and their principles, by reaſon of their education. One Joſhua Lawſon, a ſail-maker by trade, a man of good report among his neighbours, was willing I ſhould have meetings at his houſe, he having a large room very ſuitable for that purpoſe. So I had ſeveral meetings, the town's people coming pretty generally, and ſeveral were reached, I believe, by the heart-ſearching power of Truth, which opened unto them their ſtates and conditions, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome of the younger ſort, who were tender, and very deſirous to have meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But, alas! their eye and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began to be ſo upon the poor weak inſtrument that I queried in my own mind, whether I ſhould have any more meetings with them; for that ſpirit, which hungers after words, ſometimes ſhuts up the ſpring of the true miniſtry; or it is withheld for a time on that account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="unknown:018146_0134_0FA56095B07CDF50"/>However, now about, it revived in my mind, that I had felt a draught of the Father's love towards the iſland of Nevis, when we ſailed paſt it, in our paſſage from Martinico; though I was told by one that knew the place (ſuch was the conduct of many of the inhabitants) there were little hopes of getting a meeting, or being received there; but that did not diſcourage me, I finding ſomething in my mind that removed that obſtacle out of the way. Therefore I, with Caleb Copeland, a young man from North America, took boat, and in a few hours arrived at Charles-town, the chief place on the iſland. We took up our quarters at a tavern. The day following, being their general court, many of their inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants came to town, and the place where we were being nigh the court-houſe, and the grand jury doing their buſineſs, and dining there, drew a pretty deal of company. Moſt of them, at their firſt ſeeing me, ſeemed as though they could hardly be ſatisfied with gazing; but I endeavoured to keep my eye to the Lord, whoſe preſence I felt to be nigh me in a good degree, to keep me ſtill and quiet. So they had their full view of me, till their curioſity was pretty well ſatisfied. They offered no other incivility,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:018146_0135_0FA560966A71E7E0"/>
than fleering, Iſhmael like. However, the grand jury, either out of kindneſs, or further to ſatisfy their curioſity, ſent us an invitation to dine with them; but it being late before they went to dinner, our landlady ordered ours ſooner. I did not find any thing in my mind againſt eating with them; though many of them be a light, vain, airy people, and their company not deſirable to a ſolid mind.</p>
                  <p>They ſent a meſſenger for us when they ſat down, by whom I ſent word we had dined. But they ſent again, ſo I went in, and told them we took their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation kindly, but we had dined, and therefore deſired to be excuſed from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down with them. They did not ſeem ſo light and airy now, as they did before; but ſaid, they ſhould have been glad to have had our company. I obſerved, they are very much in the cuſtom of drinking of healths, as well as in uſing many other vain compliments, which I had to ſhew my diſlike to, not only by not uſing them, but in letting them alſo know they were againſt our principles, and the apoſtle's advice to the believers, where he ſaith, <q>Be not conformable to this world; but be ye transformed, by the renewing of your minds.</q> I much deſire my children may take notice of theſe little
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:018146_0136_0FA560973B1C4748"/>
remarks, and put in practice that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent advice of the apoſtle, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the world's language, vain cuſtoms, and faſhions, which deface that beautiful image and likeneſs man was firſt created in: for every thing was good that God made, and had an excellency and beauty in it; man, the greateſt of all, as long as he keepeth his commandments; but he loſes that likeneſs and image of innocency, by hearkening to the voice of the ſerpent, who is called the prince of the power of the air, that now bears rule in the hearts of the children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. I would therefore, my dear children, that you may come to know a being transformed by the renewings of the grace and good ſpirit of Truth, upon your minds and underſtandings, into the nature, image, and innocency of the children of God, and ſtand in it, by keeping his commandments; for herein is man's perfection.</p>
                  <p>A meeting had been propoſed to be held in the court-houſe, ſeveral ſeeming to forward it, eſpecially an old prieſt, who beſtirred himſelf pretty much; which I thought ſomewhat ſtrange. When it was nigh time for the meeting, he went along with me to the court-houſe, where the juſtices and ſeveral others had dined,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:018146_0137_0FA56097E8B5A950"/>
and had not yet broke up; but that was more than I knew before I went in. However, the prieſt told them there was a gentleman, as he was pleaſed to call me, wanted to give them a ſermon, and requeſted that they would give liberty of the hall for a meeting to be held; but one whom they called their chief judge ſtarted up in a heat, and ſaid they had not done: and beſides, they wanted no ſermons; as for his part, he never loved to hear one in his life. A vulgar and unſavoury expreſſion to come out of the month of one in his ſtation; and it made me, that I could hardly tell what to ſay about having a meeting that night, only as ſeveral of the people from divers parts of the iſland were there, it ſeemed a very ſuitable opportunity. However, the old prieſt was not at all diſcouraged with the repulſe he had met with; he being reſolved I ſhould have a meeting, went over to the tavern where we lodged, and got the liberty of a chamber, and then came and told me there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient room, and ſeveral already wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I went, and found every thing in good order for a meeting, except the people's minds: I was alſo in great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, but I think quiet and much reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſat in ſilence a conſiderable ſpace,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:018146_0138_0FA5609C3A1552E0"/>
in which time they were very reſtleſs, and rude in their behaviour, ſuch as I had ſeldom ſeen or heard before: at length I had ſomething roſe in my mind to ſay, which reached, I believe, the witneſs of Truth in them; for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very quiet and ſtill, and ſat like another ſort of people; and many after meeting confeſſed to the Truth of what had been ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>I had another meeting at that place, and many came. It was a ſolemn bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing time. The Lord's power had the dominion over all the rough and unruly ſpirits: praiſes be to his all powerful name for ever! There ſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> a man at the cloſe of this meeting, and ſaid, he hoped what had been delivered would have a good effect; for it was very ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advice. More he ſaid, which is not needful to pen; and I thought it was in a good degree of ſincerity. Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, he gave me a friendly invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his houſe. I told him I took it Kindly, and ſhould come it opportunity would ſerve. The company being pretty much gone, he entered into a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with me, and told me, he himſelf was alſo a fellow labourer in the Lord; but he had as little the look of a prieſt, as any I had ever ſeen, us I thought.
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:018146_0139_0FA5609D2BDAAF40"/>
He told me alſo, he perceived that we had the advantage of them, in that we did not tie ourſelves up to one text of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they did, and ſo could ſpeak to the ſeveral ſtates of the people; for he ſaid, it could not be ſuppoſed that one remedy could be ſuitable to every diſeaſe. I made ſome remarks on his juſt obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with ſomething concerning the true miniſtry, the operation of the ſpirit, and that it was not to be limited; againſt which he made no objection, but freely aſſented to the Truth. We parted in a kind and friendly manner. I found he was a man of good underſtanding, bore a very good character among the people, and was well beloved.</p>
                  <p>This evening, after he was gone, there came a meſſenger from one Burnet, a man of note in the iſland, to deſire me to pay him a viſit before I left the place; which I did the next morning. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us very reſpectfully, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much ceremony. He aſked me ſome queſtions concerning my travels and uſage amongſt the French, which I gave him ſome account of. He did not ſeem to want to enter into any diſcourſe about religious matters, but deſired I would ſtay longer with them upon the iſland; for he ſaid there were ſeveral who were
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:018146_0140_0FA5609E0014DBD8"/>
the deſcendants of Quakers, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly would be glad to ſee me. But that did not at all induce me to ſtay, I finding myſelf pretty eaſy to leave them; hoping the Lord in his own time will ſend his ſervants and faithful labourers into not only this iſland, but many others in this part of the world, where the Goſpel rain hath not been ſo plentifully beſtowed. Oh, Old England, and North America! Though theſe people are too much in the churliſh dog's nature, yet many of them would be glad to partake of the crumbs that fall from your tables. Your dainty full ſtomachs have often loathed the honey-comb, and their poor ſouls are wandering about upon the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren mountains of a lifeleſs profeſſion, ſeeking the living amongſt the dead. May we therefore, that have received the knowledge of the Truth, and been ſo often watered, be faithful, and bring forth fruits, anſwerable to the bleſſings received! Then will the Lord, I am fully perſuaded, ſend forth from amongſt us ſuch as ſhall I ring them to Chriſt the good Shepherd and ford of true reſt and peace.</p>
                  <p>But to return. After I had ſtaid as long as time would permit, and was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my leave of the man, he put a parcel
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:018146_0141_0FA5609F0F679698"/>
of money into my hand, which I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and told him that we did not receive any money for preaching. He ſaid, we could not travel without expences, and I had been taken by the French, and had ſuffered ſome loſs, and as he gave it me freely, I might receive it. I told him, I was not then in neceſity, therefore was not free to take it: but acknowledged it was his good will, and ſo took my leave of him. After I had been a little time at our inn, we underſtood he had ſent his ſervant to the landlady, to charge her to take nothing of us, for he would pay all our expences; but it was already paid; and I ſaw it to be highly expedient for us, to remove all cauſe from them that might take occaſion, that the miniſtry might not be juſtly blamed. I left them in a lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good diſpoſition of mind towards friends, and am fully perſuaded there are hungerings begotten in the hearts of ſome of them after the true bread.</p>
                  <p>Afrer I returned to the iſland called St Chriſtopher's, where I had taken lodgings, not knowing how long I might ſtay, I was not eaſy to omit having meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, eſpeciaily on firſt days. Several people coming out of the country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had freedom to ſit with them, moſt of them behaving in a becoming and ſolid manner.
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:018146_0142_0FA560A06B3727F8"/>
Truth ſsometimes favoured us in time of ſilence; and though I had thought I ſhould have been ſhut up, I found the ſpring of the Goſpel was ſtill opened towards the people, at times, in the free extendings of God's love. And it came into my mind, in the opening of Truth, that the Lord hath a ſeed ſown in thoſe iſlands, which lies under the clods of the earth; but its riſing and coming into do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion muſt be left to his time; he being able to dethrone antichriſt, bring down his kingdom, with all his ſtrong holds, and in the room thereof, to eſtabliſh his own everlaſting righteouſneſs; that ſo in the very place where it was ſaid, they are no people, there ſhall they be called the children of the living God.</p>
                  <p>I found ſome of them deſirous that I would viſit them in their families, which I complied with, as I found freedom; often having to ſet before them their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian practice, in keeping their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures in ſlavery for term of life, and the cruelty they uſed towards them, which exceeded all that I had ever ſeen before; and it raiſed ſuch a juſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>t free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſpeech ſometimes in converſation. Yet I truſt I did not exceed the bounds of Truth, for I perceived it always had
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:018146_0143_0FA560A108C46280"/>
ſome good tendency, either to ſilence, or bring ſome acknowledgment from them, that the practice was unchriſtian, and not to be juſtified; that they had no right to plead for keeping them, but that of force, and they were a daily plague, and cauſed them to run into a great deal of ſin. Thus I have heard ſome of them complain, wiſhing they had never had them, or had ſome other way to get their bread. So we may perceive the Lord is riſing, by his pure witneſs, in judgment in the hearts of thoſe negro-keepers, ſhewing them the practice is evil, and they cannot juſtify it, becauſe the light condemns it, and maketh it manifeſt to them to be evil. I tarried at this place longer than I expected; but hope it was not time ſpent altogether unprofitably. And although I have been hindered from going to the place, I at firſt ſet out for, I have had evident tokens of God's love and fatherly care over me, in the various ſteps I have had to tread; yet notwithſtandiug this evidence of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine approbation, I have not been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that mouths would be opened not only againſt me, in ſaying I was wrong led, or under a deception, but alſo againſt the Truth; for the Truth hath many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and none greater and readier to

judge others, than thoſe that are making a profeſſion or it, but dwell not in the life and power. But it is not a new thing to be counted deceivers, and yet be true.</p>
                  <p>However, whilſt I tarried here, I often enquired for a paſſage to the winward iſlands, that ſuch occaſion might be taken away, and I be clear of the blood of all men. I thought by way of Antigua might be proper; but when I made ſome attempts towards it, I was always ſtopped in my mind, not being free to leave the place where I was. But when I had tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſome time longer, and had divers good opportunities among the people, I felt myſelf quite eaſy to leave the iſland; and not only ſo, but likewiſe a ſtrong deſire to be gone; alſo that view, and thoſe drawings I had before, to viſit the other iſlands, were entirely removed, and I was eaſy to return in a veſſel which was then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> for Philadelphia. Therefore, taking leave of thoſe I was pretty nearly acquainted with in Baſſeterre, the chief town on the iſland, I went by land to Sandy Point, where the veſſel lay to take in part of her cargo. Here I had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the town's people the day before we ſet ſail, which was the ſecond of the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:018146_0145_0FA560A2A64FC8F8"/>
eleventh month 1759, having been upon this iſland, and Nevis, eight weeks.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I tarried in thoſe iſlands, there was a great mortality among the people, bur it did not bring that awfulneſs and humility upon their minds, which it ought to have done; and therefore the divine hand undoubtedly will be ſtretehed out ſtill. The captain and men behaved very civilly to me in this paſſage. I had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meetings with the ſhip's company, which had ſome good effect, I believe, upon the ſeamen. We arrived at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia the twenty-ninth of the eleventh month, where I was very kindly received by my friends, who had, I believe, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſympathized with me in my late exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. I ſtaid in the city a little more than two weeks, except a ſhort viſit to Wilmington friends. A conferrence was held with the Indians whilſt I tarried here, which I was at; and Daniel Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and myſelf, with a few other friends, had a meeting with them at Philadelphia in the ſtate-houſe.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time of waiting in ſilence, I had ſomething to ſay, and one Iſaac Still, an Indian, who could ſpeak En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, delivered the ſubſtance of what I ſaid in the Indian language. He appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:018146_0146_0FA560A345C23E40"/>
tender and well ſatisfied, being a ſenſible ſober young man. Tedeuſcung, and ſeveral of the Delaware chiefs were preſent, and a few of the Jerſey Indians. They were ſolid, attentive, and behaved in a becoming manner. The meeting ended in humble prayer and ſupplication to Almighty God. My ſtay being but ſhort here, after I returned from the Weſt-Indies, I endeavoured to take my leave of friends in as general a manner as time would permit, and the ſixteenth of the twelfth month 1759, being the firſt of the week, after a good and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory ſeaſon with friends at Pine-ſtreet meeting-houſe, I took my farewell of them in the uniting love and pure fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Goſpel of peace.</p>
                  <p>I went on board the ſhip Carolina, at the wharf; the maſter's name was James Friend, a kind, courteous man. We had a very difficult paſſage, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of high winds, and a leaky veſſel; yet, through the mercy and goodneſs of kind Providence, we arrived ſafe at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the twenty-ninth of the firſt month 1760, where I ſtaid but a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I took leave of friends there, and returned home to my dear wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who, in my abſence, with all that

I had, had been kept, bleſſed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, far beyond my own expectation, or indeed my deſerving as a creature. I deſire I ever may be thankful for ſuch unſpeakable favours and mercies, and give him the praiſe, who is worthy for ever!</p>

and comfortable unto me in Chriſt, for whoſe ſake, and the Goſpel's, I have endeavoured to be given up, according to the diſpenſation of his grace given to me, in obedience to his will, in which I deſire I may ſtand faithful to the end; and the ſame deſire, at times, is ſtrong in my heart for all of you that I have left behind, that you may be faithful to the meaſure and manifeſtation of grace given unto you. I am not without fear, left ſome of my dear children, which are grown to years of underſtanding, ſhould be, through unwatchfulneſs and careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, drawn away into hurtful things.

but here have been but few ſhips from London this ſummer.

                  <p>Our friend having left no further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his travels after this voyage, until his ſecond embarkation for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, there is reaſon to ſuppoſe he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled but little, except attending the yearly meeting in London, or ſame ſhort diſtances near home. But about the year 1764, he again found a concern to viſit friends in America. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he embarked, in company with
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:018146_0161_0FA560B22BE98FD8"/>
Thomas Goodwin, and William Horne who were returning home from a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous viſit to this nation, and arrived ſafe at Philadelphia, and proceeded through moſt of the provinces; but his wife dying during his abſence, he, on account of his family, rather haſtened his return, and embarked in a veſſel bound for Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; from whence he came to London about the fourth month, 1766, and ſoon after returned to Wainſleet, the place of his reſidence.</p>
                  <p>Of this voyage, he kept only minutes of the meetings he viſited; ſo that we are deprived of a particular account thereof.</p>
                  <p>After his return, he viſited divers parts of this nation, and in particular the city of London, which he often hinted he thought might be the laſt time; but his love to the cauſe of Truth continued, and it was evident the fervency of his mind was as ſtrong as ever.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of great integrity of heart, a lover of peace, and ſought the promotion thereof, and had often a word of counſel to drop tending to edification. Not only at particular opportunities, but often, when abſent, has he imparted of the goodneſs and mercy of the Lord to his ſoul, and alſo been helpful in counſel

by letters. In one of the laſt I had from him, he expreſſed himſelf thus: <q>The ſap of life lies very deep in the root, and that muſt be waited for in thoſe pinching times I have met with; and yet I have a comfortable hope raiſed in me of late, that all would be well in the end, the proſpect of which to me hath ſeemed exceeding pleaſant, and, if ſafe, ſhould much deſire it might be haſtened; but that is not my proper buſineſs to look for, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the reward before the day's work is finiſhed. I have ſerved a good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but have ever looked on myſelf as one of the weakeſt of his ſervants; yet have endeavoured to come up in faithful obedience to his will made manifeſt in me, and in this now I have great peace, and an aſſurance of an inheritance that will never fade away, if I continue in the way of well-doing to the end of the race.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His illneſs was very ſhort; he was taken with a fit of the ague at night, and next morning, about four, departed this life, the ſixth of the fourth month, 1769, and was interred in friends burial-ground the 9th of the ſame, at Wainfleet, aged about; ſixty-three years.</p>

                  <p>IN reviewing the papers my late brother left behind him, I met with the manuſcripts from whence the following compilation is extracted: but rather in a looſe and undigeſted ſtate; being only a rough copy of what he ſeemed to have a deſign to digeſt, and, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, to continue further, if his life had been prolonged: yet even in this unfiniſhed ſtate, finding them to contain much uſeful matter, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pertinent, judicious and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reflections, worthy of, and, as I imagined, deſigned for a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſervice than to lie locked up in a ſcrutoir, or be confined to his

own private family; I willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted a portion of my leiſure time, to the reviſing, collating and digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. And I find no reaſon to repent of my labour, or think this portion of my time miſpent, having received much ſatisfaction and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable impreſſion therefrom, as I hope the candid reader will alſo, in the ſerious and unprejudiced peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal thereof.</p>
                  <p>Of literary ſubjects, hiſtory hath been ranked amongſt the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and intereſting: and, I think, it may be allowed this rank of precedence, ſo far as it leads by illuſtrious or pious examples, to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or good conduct in life; or by a detection of vicious characters, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the deformity of vice, and the ill conſequences thereof, as leſſons of caution, againſt the evils we are to avoid.</p>
                  <p>Yet the general ſcope of hiſtory; being moſtly relative to the actions of the great and the powerful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding the violent, or the crafty

meaſures, whereby worldly power hath been acquired, and the policy whereby it is ſupported and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; doth not, in general, abound with patterns for the private man, to form himſelf by; and too ſeldom exhibits ſuch, as the good man could copy after, without departing from his character.</p>
                  <p>Every man cannot riſe to conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous ſtations in life, or attain the abilities requiſite to fill them with reputation to himſelf, and advantage to the community: but every man may attain to (that which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beyond them) the favour of his Creator; by yielding obedience to his revealed will, and his divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. It is not every man's buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to copy the States-man, the Hero, or the Philoſopher; but it is every man's moſt intereſting concern, to live ſo in this world, as to obtain everlaſting happineſs in the next.</p>

                  <p>By authentic accounts we find he was born at Kendal in Weſtmoreland in the year 1712. And, in his young years, was made ſenſible of an inward monitor to reprove his propenſity to evil, and convince him of the error of his ways, which made, at times, profitable impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on his mind for a ſeaſon; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, through the inſtability of youth, theſe impreſſions proved not deep enough to be laſting, till about the twenty-firſt year of his age, when he removed from the North of England to Briſtol, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

of the divine power therein, he experienced a growth in the work of ſanctification, and was thereby formed into a veſſel prepared for the Maſter's uſe.</p>
                  <p>About the year 1738, he removed from Briſtol, and ſettled in Cork, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he came forth in a public teſtimony, to the virtue and efficacy of that truth, which himſelf had experienced the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial effects of, and growing in his gift, he became an able miniſter of the goſpel, and an inſtrument of ſervice in the church.</p>
                  <p>His firſt journey, in the work of the miniſtry, was in the year 1740, to the counties of Cumberland, Weſtmoreland, Lancaſhire, and part of Yorkſhire: His next to Leinſter province: and in the ſummer 1743, he viſited the meetings of friends through the principality of Wales, and many parts of England; in the courſe of which viſit, he attended the yearly meeting of Wales, with thoſe of Briſtol and London. Soon after his return he thought it his duty to remove into Leinſter province, and fixed his reſidence in Mountmelick, where his ſervice became extenſive, being in the center of a large body of friends. He almoſt conſtantly attended our province, quarterly and
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:018146_0178_0FA560C4406EA820"/>
national meetings, where he was often drawn forth in the pure ſtreams of goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel love, to the refreſhment, and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of friends: In the year 1774, he ſettled in this city, where he was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and well beloved, his innocent life and converſation adorning his goſpel la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours amongſt us, being filled with love to mankind in general, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the flock and family, with whom he was joined in religious fellowſhip.</p>
                  <p>He followed his occupation of ſchool-maſter, for ſome time in this city, but, in his advanced years, not being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently able to bear the fatigue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement attendant on that employment, and being deſirous to be more at liberty for the exerciſe of his gift, he gave it up: and for the three laſt years of his being a member of this meeting, travelled much abroad in the different quarters of this nation, viſiting the meetings, and, in many places, the families of friends, to ſtir up the pure mind by way of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and to provoke to love and good works.</p>
                  <p>And finally, being on a religious viſit to friends in the province of Munſter, and having proceeded to the city of Cork,
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:018146_0179_0FA560C4FAE09DD8"/>
(where he was engaged in a viſit to the families of friends, and had with much diligence nearly finiſhed the ſame,) it pleaſed the Sovereign Ruler of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, in whoſe hands our lives are, there to fix a period to his labours, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from works to rewards: for being ſeized with indiſpoſition, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſervice before him too cloſely (as was apprehended) it encreaſed upon him to ſuch a degree as brought on his diſſolution, and he quietly departed this life, at the houſe of our friend Joſeph Garratt, in ſaid city, (where he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately and tenderly attended and taken care of during his illneſs) we believe in peace with the Lord, and much regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by friends here and elſewhere, amongſt whom his zealous labours will be much miſſed.</p>
                  <p>We deſire that the removal of faithful labourers, may be ſo laid to heart by their ſurvivors, as that they may be incited to copy their examples, tread the ſame ſteps to bleſſedneſs, and thereby be qualified to fill their vacant places with propriety.— <q>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</q>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>FOR my own future benefit, and for theirs too into whoſe hands it may fall, I am induced to commit to writing the following review of my days, now in the 66th year of my age: for ſince we are launched on the ocean of life, our principal care ought to be to ſteer our courſe through it to the port of reſt, and unmixed felicity, though it were through all kinds of hardſhip and ſelf-denial; ſince, if we fail of this at laſt, it is then too late to amend it.</p>
                  <p>Could all the pleaſures and advantages of this life be attained and enjoyed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and unmixed to it's period, even ſo they would be no compenſation for the loſs of happineſs in a future and immortal ſtate. But thoſe pleaſures and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages never can he ſo enjoyed by any one, unleſs his paſſions and inclinations are ſubject to the government of God, who alone ought to govern his creatures, and who diſcovers his will, to the humble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive mind.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the temporary enjoyers of the good things of this life, may ſhew a face of pleaſure to ignorant ſpectators, while they ſeem to float, without interruption, in the midſt of gratifications and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: yet a ſecret worm is often felt by
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:018146_0182_0FA560C745C68018"/>
them, as it were gnawing at the latent root of their exaltation and grandeur.</p>
                  <p>It is the univerſal and impartial regard of Omnipotence, which rebukes them for letting looſe the reigns of their luſts or eager inclinations, deſigning thereby their timely reformation for their everlaſting good.</p>
                  <p>It often oppoſes the ambitious and proud, in their career, with the unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſcoveries, that they are roving in other purſuits than thoſe that heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for them: and not applying their precious time and talents to the great and good purpoſe for which they were given. Sometimes it diſplays the beauties and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of rectitude, deſerted by them; and ſometimes the horror and ſad conſequence of perſiſting in the neglect or viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of duty, thus diſcovered on the one hand, and counteracted by them on the other.</p>
                  <p>Hence too generally, diſliking the check to preſent eaſe and pleaſure, ſuch as are intruſted with the means of doing good, and helping others on their way, turn their attention from this omnipreſent monitor, this faithful boſom friend. They fly to tempting varieties, to ſoothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, to amuſing recreations; they bear their heads aloft among the envying multitudes, and ſeek to drown his ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:018146_0183_0FA560CA16E15878"/>
admonitions in ſplendor, noiſe, flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, intemperance and diſſipation.</p>
                  <p>Many ſuch I have known, who are now gone to their long homes, whom in my younger years I envied.</p>
                  <p>I have been ſo fooliſh as to transfer my envy from them, after they diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, to their vain and ſhort-lived ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; many of whom are alſo gone, and ſo will the reſt ere long. And then what follows thoſe that have left their heaven behind them, who aſſuming to themſelves the direction that was due to God, have refuſed the reverence and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his laws? Ah then the enviers and envied, like the blind led by the blind, fall into one abyſs. Unfit for the regions of pure love to God and each other, of perfect peace, of <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Peter</note>, they are debarred from admiſſion into them. Separated in the courſe of juſtice, plunged with the vaſt and innumerable hoſts of rebellious and execrable ſpirits, all their bitterneſs, envy, reſentment, eager deſires ungrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unceaſing vexation and anguiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend with them, with infinite increaſe in an unbodied ſtate.</p>
                  <p>A ſenſual earthly mind is too much vitiated to reliſh the pure joys, or to ſuit
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:018146_0184_0FA560CB74B95C38"/>
the ſociety of the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect. Goodneſs is painful to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being ſo contrary to the depravity of their nature. Heaven would be no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them.</p>
                  <p>A change of heart is neceſſary to be experienced by every man, from a ſtate of nature to a ſtate of grace; from earthly and ſenſual diſpoſitions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to holy and heavenly, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be fitted for the fruition of, as well as the admiſſion into the kingdom of heaven. It is then the greateſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, while time and opportunity are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, to uſe all diligence to attain that ſtate of mind, whereby we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared when all the tranſitory delights, amuſements and deſirable objects of this world fail, to be received into everlaſting habitations: and how ought our hearts to be filled with thankfulneſs to God, who in his univerſal love to mankind, hath provided for them a phyſician, able and willing to heal all nations, to create clean hearts, and renew right ſpirits in all, who ſubmit to him, and follow his directions.</p>
                  <p>But in order to attain this deſirable ſtate, we muſt make a total ſurrender of ourſelves to the divine will revealed to us, in daily ſelf denial and fidelity; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering therein to the end of our days, ardent in deſire to do good, and to be
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:018146_0185_0FA560CCC1BCCF18"/>
conformed to the mind of our creator.</p>
                  <p>The leſs we look out unneceſſarily into the world, or covet its honours, favours, friendſhip and greatneſs, and the more we look to God with a ſingle eye, and covet his honour, favour, friendſhip and riches, the more ſhall we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience a growth in the very root, and in all the branches of the divine life, that we may be as a chaſte ſpouſe to Chriſt in every deſire and aim, in every motion of the mind, and its companion the body too, and ſurely he ever merits it from us, even he who has graciouſly viſited, and from day to day invited, and called us out of the ſpirit and ways of the world, to join himſelf, in order to partake with him and his, of pure peace and joy in the preſent, and more infinitely in a future ſtate. His call is <q>Come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you, and I will be a father to you,</q> &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. vi. 17, 18.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this call were our honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors in the beginning, ſeparated from the ſpirit and ways of the world, and incited to refuſe touching the unclean thing or whatever ſprang from an impure ſource, what perſecution ſoever that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal might coſt them, knowing that he
<pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:018146_0186_0FA560CD30771AC0"/>
whom they obeyed and in whom they truſted, would carry them thro' all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which they experienced (to their unſpeakable joy) to be fulfilled, and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily teſtified to the world, many of them, both living and dying.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe happy men and women left the Lord's vineyard (thro' their faithful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with the divine bleſſing upon them) well fenced and clean (having gathered out the ſtones thereof) and abounding with the excellent fruits of the holy ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>After this, degeneracy ſtole in, revolting to the world, reimbibing it's ſpirit, reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its cuſtoms, language and manners: which has ſince widely ſpread and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed like a deluge, broken down the fence, and introduced an unhappy change in the ſtate of our ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is no change in God or his laws. Oh! then that we may ſpeedily return back to him and them, and to that ſtate from whence we have fallen, elſe great it is to be feared, will be our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>

good genius and a propenſity to learning I attained with facility and readineſs the Latin and Greek languages; and my quick proficiency therein, (I being of little ſtature for my age) excited admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, procured me the fame of a great ſcholar, vaſtly magnified my little ſtock of attainments; and alſo introduced me to the notice of ſeveral perſons of eminence in the town, who would frequently queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion me in reſpect to my learning, and were generally pleaſed with my ready anſwers.</p>
                  <p>In particular a diſtinguiſhed juſtice of peace, with his wife, took a ſingular notice of me, admitting me (young as I was) to free converſation with them, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing me at times into grand company which frequented their houſe. The ſaid juſtice would ſay, that if my parents would give me up to him, he would ſend me to the univerſity to receive a proper education. This flattered my ambition, as it was what at that time I heartily wiſhed for.</p>
                  <p>By theſe means the ſeeds of wild na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the noxious weeds of pride and vain conceit (the produce of every ſoil) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſtrength and nouriſhment in my early minority, and ſhot up high for my preſent childiſh age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:018146_0189_0FA560CFB1F064B0"/>But in ſome ſort to counterbalance theſe incentives to pride and airy notions, I had the advantage of receiving my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in a place, in and about which there lived many worthy friends, whoſe exemplary lives, and religious care and labours, often in my early years made good impreſſions on my mind, which (though my own propenſities ſoon effaced them) left fixed upon my breaſt an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable eſteem for thoſe truly good men and women, with painful reflections under the ſenſe of my own infidelity, and ſecret wiſhes for that happy condition, which, I really believed them to be eſtabliſhed in, by Chriſt their Redeemer and Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>My underſtanding was enlightened when very young, to ſee both my own defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies in duty, and thoſe of many others more advanced in years; and I thought, if I lived to be a man, their harms ſhould be my warnings.</p>
                  <p>I remember a worthy miniſter, Joſeph Jordan from Virginia, having had the ſmall-pox at a friend's houſe in Kendal, and being raiſed up again; at the firſt meeting which he got to after it, was drawn out in ſuch a moving manner in his miniſtry, that the meeting in general ſeemed to be impreſſed with great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under it: and I then (though but
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018146_0190_0FA560D02DCF8618"/>
very young) had a ſhare therein. The deſirableneſs of living ſo, as to obtain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour ſeemed to be very clearly and ſtrongly ſet before our view. And the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity had ſome good effect upon my mind for a ſhort ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Here we may remark the advantage that accrues to religious ſociety and to meetings, where they are favoured with a number of faithful elders, living miniſters, and ſpiritually-minded friends; men of truth, "fearing God and hating covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs."<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xviii. 21.</note> The livelineſs of their ſpirits; the clearneſs of their ſight, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of their conduct and converſation, qualify them to ſhew the people how they ſhould walk in the purſuit of peace, both by precept and example; precepts drawn from the living ſpring of experience, and examples formed by a watchful attention to the pointings and limitations of truth. I remember ſome whoſe very countenances ſeemed to command awe, and impreſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers with ſerious conſideration. As the ſalt of the earth, ſeaſoning thoſe amongſt whom they walked, with a ſenſe of the truth which lived and predominated in them; under the powerful influence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of theſe kept up meetings both for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018146_0191_0FA560D0EFF79250"/>
and diſcipline, and were enabled thereby to keep things in good order, as themſelves were a good ſavour in their allotments. On the other hand we may obſerve that where the elders and active friends are not under this qualification; but under the form, are ſuffering their hearts to go after their covetouſneſs, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly departing from under the influence of this divine principle, the cauſe and prevalence of Truth too often decline amongſt the different ranks of the people, <q>as in the day when a ſtandard bearer fainteth.</q>

                  <p>My mother made it her maxim in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that her cares and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, with the examples and labours of good friends, were to me as "bread caſt upon the waters,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Eccl. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018146_0192_0FA560D1E282BF50"/>
much mortified thereby, I exerted my wits to evade it, often feigning pretences of ſchool-taſks and exerciſes, ſet me by my maſter, and ſuch like groundleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes.</p>
                  <p>The great duty of education, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it rightly, needs divine inſtruction and aſſiſtance, as much as any duty in life, and therefore parents have need fervently to pray for it, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow it when received. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they may be in danger of falling ſhort, and the deviations and miſcarriages of the children (at leaſt in part) may lie at their doors.</p>
                  <p>But if my mother might ſeem to err on the one hand, viz. that of ſeverity, it is to be feared that the far greater number err on the other hand, viz. that of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and connivance: and that though the former be more painful for the preſent, yet the latter generally proves more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious in its effects and future conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. I verily believe, I have enjoyed a better ſtate of health, from being brought up in a hardy way, as my conſtitution was but weak and tender.</p>
                  <p>Upon a review of my ſtate at this age, my recollection repreſents it as a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ambition, envy, craft and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; but that even then, a divine moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018146_0193_0FA560D268128798"/>
was near me, to manifeſt and reprove the corruption of my heart, and the evil of my ways. I was ſenſible of my mother's anxious care for my preſervation from evil, and attainment of good: but I eluded as much as I could, the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhe thought conducive thereto, in keeping me under her own eye, and out of the way of corrupting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. I loved liberty; I fought it with eagerneſs, frequently got it by craft, and abuſed it to my hurt, as unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced young people are too apt to do.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate, I well remember, I was afraid and aſhamed to meet with good friends, ſuch as I yet loved and honoured, being inwardly convicted from the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of my own vile and unguarded conduct. Sometimes I received from ſome of them the reproof I deſerved; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I thought their very ſilence rebuked me. At other times in their company the love and deſire of goodneſs re-entered with a ſtrong force. But being withdrawn therefrom, temptation too often reinſtated vice in its wonted ſeat in my heart, and in the direction of my conduct.</p>
                  <p>I eaſily and clearly ſaw the wide differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt good and bad company, and how much the former was preferable; yet the powerful allurements of the latter
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018146_0194_0FA560D3376BCA38"/>
forcibly drew me into, and held me faſt in a wretched captivity thereto, manifeſtly contrary to my better judgment, which, I fear is the caſe of many others.</p>
                  <p>There being a large body of friends in the county of Weſtmoreland and the adjacent parts, our general meetings were many of them very largely attended; and as it was the care of the elders, and other friends concerned for the welfare of the youth, to encourage them very early to attend the meetings of diſcipline for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in virtue and ſobriety; I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended many of theſe large meetings, but too frequently without reaping any ſhare of the real benefit intended by them, or receiving any other impreſſions than thoſe of vanity and airy ambition: ſo that however ſuch meetings were favoured with divine virtue and power, the diſſipation and abſence of my fooliſh roving mind rendered it like the barren heath, not profiting by the fruitful ſhower, or chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beams of the ſun.</p>
                  <p>And there is reaſon to fear, that this may be the caſe of too many young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are pleaſed to go to theſe large meetings from other motives than thoſe of piety, who, forgetful of the intent and deſign of them, indulge their corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations in very unſeaſonable gaiety and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018146_0195_0FA560D62B7296D0"/>
What the faithful labourers in the church endeavour to build up, theſe in their unguarded conduct pull down, and ſometimes bring reproach and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable reflections on their religious profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Whereas had theſe meetings been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beautified with an uniformity in the conduct of profeſſors, conſiſtent with the divine principle of Truth and the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of its faithful miniſters, they would have proved of much greater ſervice. For as the Truth is in itſelf unſpotted, and its excellency unchangeable, the glory and dignity thereof would have ſhined forth very amiably and attractively in the eyes of the nations, had not the miſconduct of its profeſſors too frequently and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively eclipſed its genuine luſtre; which merits the ſolid conſideration of all, who have been educated, or have joined in profeſſion with us; both when they attend ſuch meetings, and at all other times.</p>
                  <p>(1727.) Being arrived at my fifteenth year, my mother was anxious to have me put to ſome buſineſs. Through her perſuaſion my father in the courſe of his travels, ſpoke to David Hall (the memoirs of whoſe life are extant, and for whom my mother had an honourable eſteem) and agreed with him to take me
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018146_0196_0FA55FA673950848"/>
as uſher to his ſchool, deſiring no other terms for me but my board, and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as he might ſee I yet needed: which gave my mother great ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>She accompanied me to his houſe at Skipton in Yorkſhire. And here I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the advantage of the education ſhe had given me, for thereby I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſubmit more willingly to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual employ and hardſhip. And though many of the boys coming from full houſes and plentiful tables, thought their fare here mean (as indeed the price for both boarding and tuition, was but eight pounds per annum) yet to me it was in general otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>There happened to be in the family at this time two youths, whoſe caſes or events in life, I think not improper to mention by way of caution: but their names I would wiſh to be buried in oblivion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they may yet be favoured with repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>The one was a lodger in the houſe. He was a valuable pattern and very helpful in the family. I eſteemed him to be in a happy condition, and ſtill believe he was ſo at that time. He had a few words in the miniſtry and grew in his gift; but afterwards becoming exalted, and too fond of applauſe, he fell into the ſnares
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018146_0197_0FA55FA7308D0420"/>
of the grand enemy, and brought a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach on the Truth, and on the miniſtry. What need hath he that ſtandeth, or thinketh he ſtandeth to take heed leſt lie fall!</p>
                  <p>The other was at that time an appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to David Hall. He was afterwards a miniſter well eſteemed among many friends; but alas! he alſo ſhamefully fell. And what renders the caſe of theſe my formerly well-beloved friends ſtill more melancholy, is, that though there is balm in Gilead, yet they and others, whom the enemy has thus wounded, and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, will not turn to the phyſician there, but rather endeavour to have their wounds deceitfully healed.</p>
                  <p>I remember to have heard one, who had baſely fallen in an unguarded hour, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few years after, that he had been waſhed in the bottom of Jordan, and had brought up ſtones of memorial; and this in an affected miniſterial way, when it appeared not to be the caſe to any but himſelf: but rather that the poor man was ſtill under the deception of the crafty enemy, willing to deceive himſelf, and wanting to deceive others, while he was at beſt but very ſuperficially waſhed from deep defilements. Judgment had not had its perfect work, though he was very
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018146_0198_0FA55FA7F0515E98"/>
willing to think and to have it thought by others that it had. And to evade that awful conſideration, that the moſt pure and righteous God is jealous of his honour, and requires our going clean through all that humiliation, labour and patience, which his light in the conſcience diſcovers to be neceſſary for repairing the diſhonour incurred. All palliations or ſoftening ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes; all arts to conciliate human com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and favour, are but like fig-leaf coverings, through which the nakedneſs of tranſgreſſors is manifeſt to ſuch as are endued with true ſight, and like dawbing over deſtructive breaches with untempered mortar.—But enough of this digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wiſhing it may prove uſeful where needed.</p>
                  <p>(1728.) When I had ſtayed in my ſervice at Skipton a little more than a year, my maſter gave me leave to return to Kendal to ſee my relations. He made me the bearer alſo of a letter to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein he ſignified, that conſidering my years, he approved of my qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conduct, and offered wages for my future ſervice. My mother took little notice of the offer; but was exceedingly rejoiced at the other part of the letter as giving her better hopes on my behalf than ſhe hitherto had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:018146_0199_0FA55FA8AC6C0260"/>In the courſe of the ſucceeding year, by agreement between my father and my maſter, I ſpent three months with Richard Kennedy writing maſter in Liverpool, to improve myſelf in writing, and learn ſome branches of the mathematics. One ſeventh day while here, I (having always a great propenſity to ſee towns and places that were new to me) went to ſee the city of Cheſter, and lodged two nights at Peter Leadbetter's; in my return by Faſtham Ferry, which is five miles athwart to Liverpool, an elderly gentlewoman hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got ſome play-books in the boat, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to read for her: as I was reading, ſome horſes in the boat grew unruly, which terrified her very much; ſo that ſhe put by her play-books, and would no more (while we were in the boat) touch them herſelf, nor ſuffer me to touch one of them.</p>
                  <p>Many remarkable preſervations I had in my younger days: but the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable was during this my reſidence at Liverpool which happened as follows. One firſt day in the afternoon I went with ſome other boys a boating in the dock, which by means of flood-gates was kept ſo full of water as to keep the ſhips afloat, when the tide was out. We rowed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times from one end of the dock to the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018146_0200_0FA55FA9A33686C0"/>
other At length ſome rude boys, that were ſtronger than we took from us our oar, or oars, and this in all probability proved the means of our preſervation. For now we found ourſelves obliged to work our way with our hands by the ſhips to the upper end of the dock. Which juſt as we reached, we heard a noiſe as of the loudeſt thunder: climbing up from the boat unto the quay, we ſoon found that the dock gates being grown old were broken down. The water ruſhing out in a rapid torrent, bore down all before it, overſetting and greatly damaging ſeveral veſſels that lay near them. The frightful nearneſs of ſuch a danger, and narrow eſcape from it ſo affected my mind, as to invade my ſleep that night, and repeat it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again to my imagination with aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of horror.</p>
                  <p>At the expiration of my three months here, I went to Kendal yearly meeting, where my father, being juſt arrived from a journey, in which he had made his way through Skipton, informed me that he had agreed with David Hall to bind me to him for four years longer; this was no agreeable intelligence to me, for although I honoured my worthy maſter, yet every thing elſe was not as I could wiſh it. I thought I could foreſee much hardſhip to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018146_0201_0FA55FAA35504CD8"/>
be unavoidably my lot: yet as my father had ſo agreed, I thought it my duty to comply. I endeavoured to put a good heart and face upon it, and ſo entered upon my part. During theſe four years my maſter was frequently abroad at meetings. He did not often miſs the quarterly meetings at York, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attended the yearly meeting at London, and then the care of the ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in and out of ſchool lay heavy on me.</p>
                  <p>Both before my coming to Skipton, and while I was there, I often had freſh deſires kindled in my heart after redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I was ſhewn clearly the neceſſity of it, and the danger of delays in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch conſequence; ſo that I left off playing for a time, thinking it great infatuation to ſquander my precious hours in play, when in danger of my life, and that too for ever. But the moſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reach I had, was at a meeting in our ſchool-houſe under the baptizing miniſtry of John Fothergill, whereby I was awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to vigilance for a ſeaſon, riſing early, and carefully attending to every ſtep in my buſineſs, and the duties of my ſtation. But ſoon, too ſoon, the fervour of this ſacred flame abated, and I gradually fell back, and became juſt what I was before:
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018146_0202_0FA55FAAF2A2E018"/>
yet I did not forget or wholly loſe the ſenſe of this day of my viſitation; but often privately lamented my revolt, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill to maintain a good character amongſt friends.</p>
                  <p>I do not remember much more than what I have already intimated in general of theſe four years, ſave that one time, when my maſter was abroad, I thought myſelf hardly and unreaſonably uſed, and thereupon conceived a deſign to run away by night (it being moon-light:) but that kind Providence whoſe fatherly care was over me, when I was too little careful for my own well-doing, with-held me. For when the time propoſed for putting my deſign in execution arrived, the pernicious conſequences of ſuch a procedure, were ſo clearly manifeſted to my mind, that I was diſcouraged from the attempt; and therefore concluded patiently to endure what might be permitted to befal me, till the termination of the time contracted for, might bring me my releaſe in a reputable and conſcientious way.</p>
                  <p>Near the expiration of my time I writ to ſome of my friends, acquainting them, that I intended to try ſome new place, and received a letter from my good friend John Wilſon of Kendal, ſignifying that Alexander Arſcott of Briſtol wanted an
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018146_0203_0FA55FAC4E274698"/>
uſher, and offered twenty pounds per ann. Which offer I readily embraced.</p>
                  <p>(1733.) So leaving Skipton, and the yearly meeting at Kendal approaching, I went thither, ſtaid a few days with my mother, and then ſet forward for Briſtol. In my way at Wolverhampton, ſtanding at the door of the inn where I alighted, I ſaw a crowd of people paſſing by, and heard it was a Quaker's funeral; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I went to it, and our friend Joſhua Toft (whom I do not remember to have ſeen before) attended it, and was raiſed up in a large and living teſtimony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I was afreſh reached, and conſiderably tendered, and thence proceeded on my way, under revived impreſſions of good upon my mind, to Worceſter; there I met with William Beeſly going to Briſtol year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, with whom I went in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Glouceſter, but my horſe being tired I was forced to leave him behind, and walk the greateſt part of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the way in my boots. In a few weeks after, that worthy miniſter and elder John Richandſon of Yorkſhire land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in company with Robert Jordan from Pennſylvania, who bought my horſe for the ſame price it coſt me.</p>
                  <p>My good maſter Alexander Arſcott was like a kind and tender father to me. He
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018146_0204_0FA55FACE1482058"/>
was the eldeſt ſon of the parſon of South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molton in Devonſhire, and himſelf edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated at the univerſity of Oxford, with intention to ſit him for the ſame func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But when he was juſt ripe for preferment, and might have had a fair proſpect that way, his father being well beloved and reſpected among the great men in that country; he turned his back on all proſpects of this kind, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the bleſſed truth. This was a great mortification to his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who would both ſit weeping by him in the bitterneſs of their hearts, as I have heard him relate. This, he added pierced him deeply, as he ſincerely deſired to be a dutiful ſon to tender and indulgent parents. A cloud came over his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the enemy in his own breaſt ſuggeſted that he was acting quite wrong. But as he humbled himſelf before the Moſt High, imploring his direction, he received a freſh ſight that he muſt forſake father and mother for Chriſt, and be faithful to the manifeſtation of his will, through all events. His parents became afterwards better reconciled to his change, when he was ſettled in good buſineſs in Briſtol, where he kept ſchool for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of friends and others, from that time till his deceaſe, being about thirty-five
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018146_0205_0FA55FB18AFE9340"/>
years, and proved helpful to the reſt of his father's family, in procuring them by his intereſt, places for getting a livelihood.</p>
                  <p>I came up to Briſtol quite plain in my garb (as David Hall would not ſuffer any other in his family) and it being the time of the yearly meeting, at a friend's houſe I fell in company with ſome well-minded friends, one or more of whom obſerved to me, that ſundry young people had come up the ſame way from the north of England to the ſouthern parts, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to London and Briſtol; yet after being there a while they ran into the faſhions of thoſe places, till they even out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripped the native inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>Now I had not only been educated in plainneſs; but had been inwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the foundation on which it ſtood; wherefore upon hearing this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ridiculous folly and inſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of my country folks, I was ſorry that they gave occaſion of ſuch remarks to their diſhonour, and took up a reſolution to continue ſteady in my old plain way. And I do not know that I ſuffered any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diſadvantage by it: and if I had, the cauſe of truth is worth ſuffering for, and the Almighty rewards patient ſuffering in a good cauſe. But I found that good friends ſeemed to love me the more on this
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018146_0206_0FA55FB3198A3D10"/>
account; and even others, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their degeneracy ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect me, as apprehending me to be better than themſelves: And I had moſt peace of mind in continuing in my wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plainneſs, though I was like a ſpeckled bird, there being even then very few plain-dreſt young people or others in the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Briſtol. But I have obſerved that deviating from this path of plainneſs, which Truth leads into, and making ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions in dreſs, opens the way to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate connexion with young people out of our ſociety, or libertines in it; and ſo leads further and further from a due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Chriſt's kingdom and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, often making them forget and loſe the good which they have formerly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and conſequently draws them along into the utmoſt danger. Whereas adhering to the truth and its plain path, opens the way for ſafer and more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and edifying connexions as I often found here, to my ſolid inward ſatisfaction, which I hope I ſhall never forget.</p>

pleaſed divine Goodneſs to take notice of me, and to favour me afreſh with a merciful and reaching viſitation of his love to my ſoul, and more clearly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his Son in me, whereby I was given plainly to ſee, that my ſafety here and happineſs hereafter, depended upon my yielding faithful obedience to his requirings by his light in my heart, and that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings would be only what tended to my real good, and laſting welfare.</p>
                  <p>This was a day of my ſoul's eſpouſal to Chriſt Jeſus. I was overcome with his love, and with admiration of his conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending goodneſs to ſuch an unworthy creature; it being the day of the Lord's power, I was ready and willing to do any thing that I ſaw I ſhould or ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Having a ſtrong inclination to poetry, I had ſometimes at Skipton indulged my fancy therein. But now when the Lord's power took hold of me, I ſacrificed all my idols and burned all my collection of poems, even though ſome of them were on what would be called good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; yet they had too much attracted my mind, and engroſſed my thoughts. I was made ſenſible that theſe poems were not my proper buſineſs, yet they took the place of what was really ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I gave them up. For I now ſaw that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018146_0208_0FA55FB56D7BFB60"/>
I muſt ſhut out and leave behind me what others generally crave and purſue, viz. The vain deſires and delights, which lead away the mind from that great Being, who wooes us to true happineſs.</p>
                  <p>And indeed my whole delight was in the company of Chriſt my dear Lord and maſter. I was directed by him to do all things well, and bear all things with meekneſs. And as I on my part carefully regarded and practiſed his directions, my ſoul enjoyed the ſweet ſenſe of his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. And I preferred it before all the world, which I ſaw to be of little value compared with the favour of its Almighty Creator. To pleaſe him I thought well worth all the toil and ſuffering of the day; and the deſire of doing it, whetted my induſtry and ſtrengthened my pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Thus I enjoyed a good time, and was often overcome with the love and kindneſs of my dear Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>For in him I had now a father, a guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and a friend, and an excellent one indeed, who embraced me with the moſt engaging affection, when I applied myſelf to do every thing rightly. All friends and relations, with all kinds of enjoyments ſeemed to center in him alone, for he alone amply ſupplied all, and having him was having every thing that was good. In
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018146_0209_0FA55FB63664F128"/>
his preſence there could be no want. It was then no hard matter for me to deny every natural and corrupt deſire, as for his ſake; and to renounce the objects which had formerly pleaſed me too well, and which I had been fooliſhly fond of: and yet for the rejection of theſe things, which had done me no good, but harm, I ever found him a rich rewarder.</p>
                  <p>In his preſence I could envy no man, however rich, eminent or ſeemingly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; but I loved all men as his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and wiſhed that all would come to him, and in and with him be truly happy for ever.</p>
                  <p>Then bidding farewel to the world and its vanities, whoſe beauty and alluring luſtre were tarniſhed and eclipſed in my eyes, through the ſuperior brightneſs of the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhining in my heart, I loved ſolitude that I might ſeek him, who was now become the life of my life, and wait for his freſh appearing to me, who brought with him not only light to ſhew me my blemiſhes and defects, but animating fortitude, fervent deſire, and divine help to withſtand and ſurmount corrupt habits and propenſities, and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly in the ſecret of the ſoul to guard againſt the firſt riſing of any imagination, or inclination, that was not conſiſtent

with the pure holy diſcoveries of his bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit. Thus with the royal Pſalmiſt, Pſal. xvi. 11. "In his preſence I found fulneſs of joy." My mind was moulded into a divine frame, a new creation of pure love to God and to men, wherein the heavens and the earth in a ſweet harmony, ſeemed to ſhew forth the power, wiſdom and goodneſs of the one good Father and preſerver of the whole. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced that I had lived to ſee ſuch a day, wherein I had a ſure evidence in my own boſom of being tranſlated to a better world, to live for ever united to him and his, if I ſhould then be ſnatched from this.</p>
                  <p>Happy had it been for me, had I ſtill thus continued ſteady in my progreſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection, through following his guidance towards it: but being in a great city, I ſometimes looked out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by again catched ſenſual deſires, which demanded to be gratified, and were too often obeyed, when in my power, by which I again did harm to myſelf, and gave away my inward ſtrength and fortitude for walking faithfully, as Sampſon gave away his to Delilah; yet I ſtill bore a good character, and many looked upon me as a young man of ſteady conduct; but by a painful feeling of my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability I knew myſelf better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="unknown:018146_0211_0FA55FB872A7E928"/>A good condition is eaſily loſt, for want of duly obſerving our bleſſed Lord's direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to watch and pray, leſt we enter into temptation.—While I obſerved it, I daily and hourly found the benefit of it, in my riſing up and laying down, and on my bed in the night ſeaſon, having my heart and affections wholly ſet on Chriſt, and the great end of his having given me exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, bleſſing his name for ſo revealing his goodneſs to me, renewing covenant with him, and watching againſt every thought that had a tendency to carry off my mind, and ſeparate it from him.</p>
                  <p>I roſe early, implored him to direct me how to ſpend every part of the day, moſt to the honour of his name; and to aid me to exert myſelf in the full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my duty every way, and oh! many times in the day, great peace and ſolid ſatisfaction flowed in my ſoul for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to and following his internal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.—Every thing went well and in proper order, through this conſtant care to walk exemplarily, and act faithfully in the duties of my place and ſtation in life. And many times in the evening of a well-ſpent day, my ſoul overflowed with the ſweet earneſts of the heavenly and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reward, reſerved for perſeverance in well-doing.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>May I never forget the day of this his moſt engaging kindneſs, and of my eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to him.

Ever worthy to be admired, adored, reverenced, loved and ſerved by all the nations in the world, as that which alone would make all happy in true love, and preſerve all in pure and ſpotleſs order every where. So would earth reſemble heaven, and its inhabitants be linked in a holy, bleſſed ſociety with Chriſt, with angels and the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, in enjoying together the brightneſs of his preſence, in whoſe preſence is joy and at whoſe right hand are rivers of pleaſure for evermore. For this our Lord prayed to his father on behalf of his diſciples; <q>ſanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</q>

                     <pb n="27" facs="unknown:018146_0213_0FA55FB9F2BB0B98"/>I continued in Briſtol upwards of four years, living with my worthy maſter, for whom I had a great and deſerved eſteem, as aſſiſtant or uſher in his ſchool to the time of his death, which happened the latter end of my fourth year there, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeized with a diabetes, which gradually weakened him, till at laſt in a ſweet frame of mind he departed this life, generally regretted by friends and others, having been a man remarkably ſerviceable, not only as a member of religious, but alſo of civil ſociety. His character for inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity being ſo univerſal, that he was very much employed in determining differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences between his fellow citizens either as arbitrator or umpire. So that to the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the peace-maker he might ſeem to have a title above moſt. His funeral from the Friars Meeting-houſe was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a very great number of friends and others. Four friends appeared publicly to a very crowded audience, viz. James Tylee, Daniel Badger, Iſaac Sharpleſs and Thomas Gawthrop. The next day the men's meeting elected Jonathan Nelſon ſchoolmaſter of Reading to ſucceed him, and deſired me to keep up the ſchool till it might be convenient for ſaid Jonathan to come, which I did, and at his coming reſigned it to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:018146_0214_0FA55FBAB2AA9C90"/>(1737.) Being informed that friends at Cork in Ireland wanted a ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, I agreed to go thither to ſerve them in that capacity; ſo calling to ſee and take leave of my brother, who lived with Thomas Bennet at Pickwick in Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire in the ſtation of uſher to his ſchool, I went from thence to Glouceſter and was at the two meetings there on firſt day, which were poor ſmall meetings. On ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day I rid to Worceſter, and ſtayed there at my kind friend William Beeſley's over third day. The week-day meeting there, was to me a tendering ſeaſon both in ſilence, and under the lively miniſtry of old John Corbyn; towards the week's end I reached Kendal, where I ſtayed two or three weeks; during which ſtay, my father took a fever and died. A day or two after his funeral, I left Kendal and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Briſtol, from whence, after waiting ſometime for a wind, I took ſhipping for Cork, in company with doctor Rutty of Dublin, who had been at the yearly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in London, and amongſt his relations in Wiltſhire and was alſo waiting for a paſſage to Cork.</p>
                  <p>I was affected with an awful impreſſion on my firſt embarking; it put me on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering on what foundation I ventured my life upon the water. On that head
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018146_0215_0FA55FBB6FF23F08"/>
I was ſoon favoured with inward ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reſignation to divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>The wind being unfavourable we had a very tedious paſſage, being ten days on the water from Pill to the Cove of Cork. It was late at night when we landed at Cove, and next morning went up in a boat to Cork, where I lodged about two weeks at Jonas Devonſher's, (a friend of a large eſtate) his two ſons being under my tuition, and afterwards boarded in a friend's family till I married.</p>
                  <p>The meetings of friends in Ireland, and particularly in the province of Munſter, not lying ſo contiguous as in many parts of England, could not ſo conveniently be joined ſeveral together, to conſtitute monthly or men's meetings of diſcipline for tranſacting the affairs of the church, but in theſe parts particularly, each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meeting was a men's meeting in itſelf, and ſome of the meetings both hereaway and in other parts, being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reduced in number, it became the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of friends in Ireland to recommend, to the larger meetings neareſt to them, the care of viſiting theſe little meetings fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to inſpect their ſtate, and help them by advice and counſel as occaſion might require. Two of theſe meetings,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018146_0216_0FA55FBCAA202E00"/>
viz. theſe of Bandon and Youghal were under the care of Cork men's meeting, which was regular and conſtant in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing viſits to them at the ſtated times.</p>
                  <p>I being now become a member of Cork men's meeting, (being recommended by certificate from Briſtol) it fell to my lot in company with other friends to go upon a viſit to the meeting of Youghal: here ſeeing Mary the daughter of John and Martha Dobbs of ſaid town, a plain and orderly young woman, I found my affections cloſely engaged towards her, and having propoſed to her parents my deſire to addreſs her in order to marriage, and obtained their conſent, after ſome time we were married there according to the good order uſed in our ſociety.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid John Dobbs her father being convinced of the truth, while he was a ſtudent at the univerſity of Oxford, was for his fidelity to conviction diſinherited by his father Richard Dobbs of Caſtle. Dobbs near Carrickfergus <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate worth ſeveral hundreds per ann. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eldeſt ſon.</p>
                  <p>His father left it to a younger ſon, who was to pay my father-in-law ten pounds per ann. out of it, which during the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of that ſon was but indifferently paid, and by his prodigality the eſtate
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018146_0217_0FA55FBD32170750"/>
was involved. But his ſon Arthur Dobbs, late governor of North Carolina, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the inheritance thereof, voluntarily doubled the ſaid annual ſum, and paid it punctually. My father-in-law having ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died phyſic at the college, practiſed it with good ſucceſs, and great Chriſtian charity to the poor, ſo as to ſave little from his income that way.</p>
                  <p>He had been the favourite of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but upon his joining in ſociety with friends, and giving up his whole heart to follow the diſcoveries of the light of Chriſt in his own conſcience, he was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his father with the utmoſt ſeverity as a rebel, and then caſt out as an alien. So that he might well be ſaid to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken for Chriſt's ſake, father and brethren, and ſiſters, and houſes, and lands; and like faithful Abraham to have offered up to the Lord whatever was deareſt to him in this world, and to have truſted in God, which was doubtleſs counted to him for righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Being beloved by friends, he was urged by ſome to have recourſe to the law for the recovery of the family eſtate as his birthright, which he had done nothing to forfeit, and aſſiſtance offered him for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Whereupon he was prevailed with at length to make a beginning; but
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018146_0218_0FA55FC0DCBF6000"/>
not having that inward peace with Chriſt which he preferred before all the world, in the firſt ſtep of contention, he put a ſtop to all further proceedings, and rather choſe to confide in God without it.</p>
                  <p>For a more particular account of him, ſee the collection of friends' ſufferings in folio, vol. 2, and doctor Ratty's Hiſtory of the Riſe and Progreſs of Truth in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Of him I have only to add, that he made a joyful and happy exit, in an exceeding thankful and triumphant ſtate, out of this world, with a full aſſurance of going to live for ever in a better. He died about ſeven or eight months after our marriage.</p>
                  <p>His wife Martha Dobbs was convinced of truth before their marriage, by the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſions of a handmaid of the Lord, viz. Deborah Sandham. She had a few words of public teſtimony in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſurvived her huſband ſome years, and died in a good old age, having been a heavenly-minded woman.</p>
                  <p>Previous to my marriage, a ſmall lot of ground offering for building on, which was very convenient to my ſchool, and the carpenter reckoning he could run up a neat ſmall houſe for a ſum I could then ſpare, (having in my employment in Briſtol and here ſaved ſo much) I adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018146_0219_0FA55FC29A917F98"/>
in conjunction with a friend, to take the ground and build upon it, and the houſe was finiſhed a few weeks after our marriage; but the coſt of it came to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſum the carpenter had propoſed it might be built for. This and ſome other things filled me with gloomy apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and I became very dull and dejected in my mind in conſideration of my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, finding I had gone too far, and owed what I was not able to pay. However, as my intentions were honeſt, and my anxiety great that I might not by any miſconduct blemiſh the truth, which I had been inſtructed ſo highly to prize, by exerted endeavours, with induſtry and frugality, and through divine aſſiſtance, in ſome time I got over this difficulty, and paid every farthing.</p>
                  <p>It may perhaps appear to ſome, that the recording of ſuch tranſactions, is of little importance or edification to uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted readers; but it hath not appeared ſo to me. The account of theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which for want of due care and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and a conſtant, ſteady and deep at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the unerring guide, we fall into, though more humiliating, may perhaps be no leſs uſeful for caution, than thoſe experiences, which we can review with more heart-felt ſatisfaction, are for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018146_0220_0FA55FC4236D1F50"/>
and imitation. Truth hath ever led to integrity, punctuality and upright dealing in our outward affairs, and to limit ourſelves to few exigencies, and an humble condition in life, rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade or riſque the properties of other men. We cannot all get a deal of the treaſures of this world (nor is a deal neceſſary to our well being. <q>A man's life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things he poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</q>) but we may all live on a little, if our minds be kept humble, and the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual appetites be ſubjected to the croſs of Chriſt. Now my view in relating how I was (undeſignedly indeed) involved in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed circumſtances, is for a caution to unexperienced young perſons, to be very conſiderate and careful in their expences, that they be neither laviſhed on things needleſs or ſuperfluous, nor in things otherwiſe convenient and lawful, in a meaſure diſproportionate to their ability to ſupport clearly out of their own, with honour, reputation and a good conſcience; (for in this circumſtance things lawful in themſelves are not lawful or expedient for them) that ſo the profeſſion of truth may not ſuffer reproach by their miſcarriage, as it hath done by that of too many others, to the great regret of the honeſt and right-minded of our religious ſociety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="unknown:018146_0221_0FA55FC46BD563C8"/>Furthermore, the narrative of theſe difficulties and anxieties, that attended my firſt ſetting out in the married ſtate, ſeems to me to convey this inſtructive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to all ſingle young perſons, who have not good patrimonies, or are not yet well ſettled in ſome buſineſs, proper to maintain a family, that if they would do well in the world, they ſhould not be haſty in this weighty affair; but conſider wiſely before they proceed toward it. While ſingle they have only themſelves to care for, and if they keep their hearts ſtaid upon the Lord (which is far eaſier for them to do, than when weighed down under a load of care and encumbrances) and come up faithfully in the way of their duty, they will be happy. And by all means let them beware of entering into this moſt intereſting engagement, which is for life, on which the happineſs or unhappineſs of this life very principally depends, and by which that of the next may be very materially promoted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded, till they ſee that in the due ſeaſon the Lord opens their way, and conducts them in it. Then the marriage will be honourable, the married will be like minded, ſtanding in the counſel of beſt wiſdom, will be truly helpmeets to each other both in their temporal and ſpiritual
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018146_0222_0FA55FC532C9ADB0"/>
concerns; joining together with united and prepared hearts in religious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily duties, and ſtrengthening each others hands for every good word and work; minding the in-ſpeaking word, more than the attention or opinions, the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or cenſures of the world. Such if they have but little of earthly treaſure are happily married. But on any other terms, whether married or unmarried, people are not in a good way. And it is infinitely better to be married to Chriſt, than to be married ever ſo grandly in the world out of the divine counſel and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>As I had a religious deſire in my choice, and that I might be rightly directed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I had reaſon on the whole (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe outward diſcouragements aforementioned) to hope that I was ſo. For my wife was the child of good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, from whom ſhe had received a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious education, of orderly converſation, innocent and well inclined, and we were in a good degree favoured together of the Lord, ſhe being free to give me up to every ſervice I thought it my duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in. Upon my firſt viſit to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſenſe of truth and the ſolid edifying converſation of her worthy parents deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed the beſt impreſſions on my ſpirit,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018146_0223_0FA55FC6078A30E8"/>
ſo that in my return home to Cork (twenty computed miles) my thankful heart was like a cup filled, the tears of divine joy overflowed, and ran down my cheeks the greateſt part of the way.— In this thankful frame I reached Cork, and my friends there, who generally had a love for me, were pleaſed to ſee me, and to hear ſuch account as I had to give. But then this good went off, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability of nature ſucceeded in a great degree, though ſtill mixed, with a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent view to the better part.</p>
                  <p>(1739.) About four months after our marriage, being at a meeting at Youghal, my heart was bowed in reverent fear, and filled with the ſweet influence of God's univerſal love, it then appeared to be my duty, in the clearneſs of that light and ſtrength of that love, to call to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite thoſe preſent to come to Chriſt, and yield grateful obedience to his laws. I had been for ſeveral years before, fully perſuaded that this would be required of me as a duty, and had deſired never to dare to venture upon it till it ſhould be ſo required.</p>
                  <p>Upon this duty being clearly preſented to me in this meeting, diſcouragements and obſtacles poured into my mind in abundance, ſuch as that if I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018146_0224_0FA55FC6D8DE45A0"/>
the words impreſt, I ſhould then be expoſed to much ſpeculation, and become the immediate ſubject of converſation among ſuch as love to catch and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate matter of amuſement; that perhaps the like duty might never be required of me again, and in that caſe I ſhould be likely to be remarked, and talked of for many years, as one who had begun and not gone on. Inſtances occurred of ſuch as had preached amongſt us for a time, and had either dropped it and fallen away, or had on one account or another, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred a public and general diſlike or diſgrace, and that therefore it might be ſafer and better for me to reſt quiet with good wiſhes for the people, and to exhort in a more private way, as I might have opportunity, and a freſh concern on my mind. Theſe grounds of heſitation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me till a friend kneeled down to conclude the meeting in prayer.</p>
                  <p>I then ſaw clearly that if the meeting ſhould break up without my uttering the exhortation, which was fixed with ſo much weight upon my mind, I ſhould unavoidably incur the ſtings of conſcious guilt, and the crime of diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>Therefore not attending to the friend's public prayer, my mind was earneſtly and cloſely exerciſed in mental ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to the Almighty, that he would abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate me to be faithful. I had a hard ſtruggle and conflict on this occaſion: but at length the power of divine faith prevailed, to the ſhutting out and putting to ſilence all manner of diſcouraging ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. And when the prayer was ended I durſt not ſit down, fearing I ſhould not have power to riſe again in time; but turning about to the meeting, and ſeeing ſome of the people ſtaring me in the face, ſuch was my weakneſs, that I raiſed up my hat, and holding it before my face, I ſpoke the words, which had lain with weight on my mind and ſat down. A flood of divine joy poured into my heart, and filled it all the day: I went in this frame of mind into ſeveral friends' fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and my heart being ſtill melted with divine love, the tears of joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſlowed down my cheeks, which ſome ignorantly miſtook for trouble of mind, ſaying one to another, <hi>they pitied me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was indeed a memorable day to me: for I ſeemed to myſelf to be raiſed above the ſordid and ſinful inhabitants of this world, and to be admitted a partner of the bleſſed ſociety of ſaints and angels, and ſpirits of juſt men made perfect

through entire obedience rendered to their God.</p>
                  <p>I had a full aſſurance in myſelf that if then ſudden death ſhould ſeize me, I ſhould immediately go to that bleſſed ſociety, to live in a holy and happy communion with them for ever, to adore that God and Sovereign, who had ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely favoured us. And this is the very nature of that truly excellent religion, which our dear Redeemer came to bleſs mankind with.</p>
                  <p>I might give ſome ſmall account of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and good effects, ariſing from my thus obeying the divine manifeſtation; but accounts of that kind I leave to thoſe, who have ſteered more ſteadily than I have done, and think it more proper for me to look to the other ſide of my caſe, and that with ſhame and confuſion of heart, mixed with humble admiration of divine Goodneſs, which has hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been great, and bleſt me with a few heavenly and good days, wherein I ſhould not have been afraid of death, or of the awful and tremendous judgment which is to follow it. Oh! that I may (through faithfulneſs on my part) attain the like again, and that my laſt day may be my beſt day! But alas, a conſciouſneſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity in divers reſpects is my preſent</p>

                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:018146_0227_0FA55FC8EA338EF0"/>It is lamentable to reflect how many in our age, even of the anointed ſons, and ſervants of the Lord, have by theſe means gradually declined and dwindled, and at length totally fallen off, as Judas did from Chriſt, and Demas from his faithful apoſtle, and made ſhipwreck of faith and of a good conſcience, and brought laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſgrace on themſelves, and that good cauſe, in which they had been humbly and honeſtly engaged. Yet truth changes not; it is the ſame ſtill, and ſtill able to preſerve from falling, to build up, and give an inheritance among the ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>I remember that the above conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made me earneſtly pray, that ſince I had given up, and put my hand to the plough, I might never look back to Sodom again, like Lot's wife; but rather ſuffer any thing in this world, than diſgrace the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Encouraged as above, I proceeded to miniſter in public meetings when I had ſomething given for that end, through which exerciſe my gift became gradually enlarged. But alas!

the ſpirit of Chriſt, which teaches divine wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Being of an active natural diſpoſition, it became a croſs to me to be ſilent, when it was beſt to be ſo. And ſometimes after I ſtood up I continued too long, till the teſtimony as to the life of it, flattened and grew tedious to the hearers. I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too to imitate ſome others, who, I thought, preached finely. Thus the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of man's happineſs continually ſeeks to tempt every claſs in the church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. As the eye is kept ſingle to the holy Head, and the body full of light, in the light he is diſcovered in all his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and transformations; but I was not conſtantly enough on my guard againſt his ſtratagems, and therefore was ſometimes ſeduced even to think I did well, when I was zealous, though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to true knowledge, nor to the honour of the great name of Chriſt our Lord: for he is moſt honoured by the ſubjection of ſelf; and by divine love, coupled with humility and patience.</p>
                  <p>Among the many good inſtitutions which the diſcoveries of celeſtial wiſdom have eſtabliſhed in our ſociety, that of faithful elders appointed to watch over the flock, and over the miniſtry, has been found to be very uſeful. And though the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018146_0230_0FA55FCC52E9F6F8"/>
love of ſelf-honour made me ſometimes bear hardly the reproof of a friend; yet I have afterwards, as in the cool of the day, diſcerned the expediency of it, and been induced to deſire to be more careful in future, and to be willing to receive advice, as well as to give it.</p>
                  <p>O ye, whom Chriſt calls into the work of the miniſtry, or any other office, give up your lives to him and it, both to do and to ſuffer what he may order or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: for the veſſels of the Lord's houſe are to be of <hi>beaten</hi> gold. Every ſon whom he loves he rebukes and chaſtens. Then ever receive with a good mind the counſel or the reproof of a friend.</p>
                  <p>If others revile and taunt in bitterneſs and wrath; in haughtineſs and inſult, as whoever will live godlily in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution; yet all things will work together for good to them that ſteadily abide under Chriſt's government. —Our nature having in it much droſs, and by long habit contracting an encreaſe of it, cannot be refined from it, but by fiery trials, nor have its evil humours purged out, but by drinking the bitter cup.—Applauſe pleaſes the creature, but greatly endangers it. Suffering in ſpirit, though more painful, is more ſafe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:018146_0231_0FA55FCEE0951080"/>O then ye! who have rightly begun, and favourably advanced in the work of truth or of the miniſtry, look well to your ſtanding, and guard againſt the transformations of your unwearied enemy.</p>
                  <p>When we firſt began, our ſingle view and deſire was to obtain divine approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that peace of ſoul, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from it; to die to ourſelves and all the world; to know no man after the fleſh, nor be known by them; but only to know the Lord, and to walk and act under his immediate notice and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving favour.—But afterwards there hath mingled herewith, the deſire of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man notice, of popular applauſe, of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantages and indulgences.</p>
                  <p>Thus too many miniſters, as well as others, who have given up their names to follow the Lamb, have ſlipped into a mixed ſtate. In them the ſpring once pure, hath become muddy, and the ſacred fervour hath dwindled. Though they have retained the form of godlineſs, yet its conquering power and fortitude have gradually died away, and left them as weak, and unable to reſiſt temptations, as thoſe who have never aſſumed that form.</p>
                  <p>This hath been the caſe of too many dry worldlings and ſenſualiſts in our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018146_0232_0FA55FCEF195D900"/>
who, far from helping the cauſe, which they profeſt a value for, have greatly hurt it, and given a handle to libertines to make both it and them, the ſubject of their deriſion.</p>
                  <p>When the humble regard and love of God ſingly preſided in my heart, then I have been diſpoſed to receive the advice or the rebuke of a friend in the love in which it was given, and to bear with Chriſtian meekneſs, the taunts and inſults of inſenſible hearts and unguarded lips undiſturbed thereby: but when I have ſlid off this foundation, then they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed my mind, and agitated it with ſelfiſh and uneaſy reſentments.</p>
                  <p>I have not ſo often met with this kind of returns to my miniſtry, as applauſe, which indeed is an intoxicating and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious cup for any to drink without great fear. It ferments the ſpirits with a falſe alacrity; elevates the mind with ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and an imagined ſuperiority to others, leads into an evil emulation, and even to ſlight thoſe who are in a much better ſtate, by dwelling in the valley of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſubject to Chriſt the beloved of their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>How hard for the creature not to be pleaſed with praiſe, and to offer it to him, to whom alone it is due! or after being at
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018146_0233_0FA55FD0075F6BB0"/>
any time ſignally honoured, to return like Mordecai diſmounted, ſtripped of the royal robes, and to ſit in a ſilent, abject condition at the king's gate, waiting on him in poverty of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>As applauſe is dangerous, ſo the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people, if not kept under proper government, both by the miniſter and his hearers, have a ſnare in them, as indeed hath every object of our ſenſes, without maintaining an inward watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; theſe things not being the proper mark or prize of a miniſter or a chriſtian. It is baſe to play the harlot with corrupt ſelf, and deck it with the Lord's jewels. For if we take theſe rewards of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, we are in danger of loſing that which he gives to the faithful, which is the one true and durable reward.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirit of the goſpel directs us, to ſubmit ourſelves, or give way, one to another, to be abaſed, and prefer others; the ſtrong to take the weak by the hand, and all to imitate the holy pattern of Chriſt, who was meek and lowly in heart, and ſtooped to waſh the feet even of his diſciples and ſervants.</p>
                  <p>It was he by his ſpirit, that not only raiſed up a living miniſtry in our ſociety, but by the ſame ſpirit animated our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful predeceſſors to eſtabliſh a ſalutary
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018146_0234_0FA55FD35BE84980"/>
diſcipline therein, upon the ſame founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and raiſed up and gifted men and women for valuable ſervices, conducing to the edification and ſtrengthening of one another in piety. Often have I ſat in meetings of diſcipline greatly humbled, tendered and revived in my ſpirit, with freſh reſolution to renew diligence in my journey heaven-ward.</p>
                  <p>One branch of this diſcipline, viz. the inſtitution of meetings of miniſters and elders, I highly regarded. For when we have (in a ſenſe of our entire inability without his help) proſtrated ourſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before the moſt high God, he hath graciouſly vouchſafed to open the living ſprings of counſel, ſuitable to the ſeveral ſtates and ſtations preſent, tending to ſtir up to diligence and devotedneſs in his ſervice, and pointing out livelily in the opening of goſpel light, the ſnares and dangers waylaying the ſpiritual traveller in his journey.</p>
                  <p>Often have theſe meetings, when we have been thus prepared for them, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented us together in an humble engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſoul toward God. Tender love hath abounded, which hath made us dear one to another, as children of one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and fellow-labourers in the higheſt and beſt cauſe. Chriſt our Lord has
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018146_0235_0FA55FD36CEC5DC0"/>
favoured us with his preſence, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign power, and made us partakers together of his heart-tendering goodneſs, and of a near communion, and divine fellowſhip with him through his ſpirit, and with each other therein, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing our ardent concern for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his name, and the promotion of his truth.</p>
                  <p>But when this preparation hath been wanting, and inattention and abſence of mind have taken place, then we have been barren as the dry heath; and like the earth, covered with darkneſs, without form and void, when the ſpirit of the Lord moved not on the face of the waters. Both the immediate and inſtrumental ſprings of lively and clear counſel and conſolation have been cloſed up, and the edification and watering of the flock with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. This hath cauſed living zeal, and even the attendance of them to decay, and to yield to temporal affairs and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the hurt and loſs of many.</p>
                  <p>May theſe conſiderations move both miniſters and elders more particularly, to ſeek after the preparations requiſite for their aſſembling in the name and power of Chriſt, and under a renewed concern for their individual preſervation, as well as for that of their brethren and ſiſters,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:018146_0236_0FA55FD5DAA99B78"/>
that they may thereby be comfortably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened, and enliven one another to all goodneſs, as men and women redeemed from the world, and fellow-citizens of the New Jeruſalem. Then, of great and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable benefit indeed, would theſe ſolemn meetings be, as heretofore, when faithful labourers in the Lord's ſervice, dignified, adorned and upheld them.</p>
                  <p>When I had reſided about three years in Ireland, my brother John, whom I left in the ſervice of Thomas Bennett, at Pick wick, Wilts, as noticed before, being deſirous to fix his reſidence in the ſame nation at leaſt with me, at the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his fourth year there, reſigned his place of uſher to that ſchool, in order to remove to Ireland, and going firſt to ſee our mother (and relations) at Kendal, ſhe concluded to accompany him in order to pay us a viſit of a few weeks, and about the middle of the ſummer 1740, they both arrived at Cork. After about five weeks abode with us, my mother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to return home; and I having a concern on my mind to viſit my native country in the ſervice of Truth, and my brother's arrival opening the way to ſet me at liberty; he willingly taking charge of my ſchool in my abſence, I concluded to accompany my mother in her return:
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:018146_0237_0FA55FD7DDB73550"/>
and having laid my concern before the men's meeting and obtained their certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and ſoon meeting with a veſſel bound to Whitehaven, we embarked therein, and had a favourable paſſage, being only about forty-eight hours from port to port.</p>
                  <p>This journey took me up about five weeks, in which time I viſited the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of friends p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Kendal, which was eminently favoured, and after it, went to lodge at Lydia Lancaſter's, a valuable miniſter, and a mother in Iſrael. Next morning went to

their meeting at Colthouſe near Hawkſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and after meeting went to William Rawlinſon's to lodge. Next morning in very wet ſtormy weather, I went to Height meeting.

                  <p>After meeting I went with James Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landſon's family to his houſe at Frith. His daughter Jane had for a little while paſt appeared at times in the public mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in our meetings. So much of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,

                  <p>Next day, that family accompanied me over the ſands to a meeting at Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and I returned with them, and from thence back to Kendal. The ſaid Jane Rowlandſon afterwards married George Crosfield, became a valuable miniſter, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Ireland twice while I lived there, and the continent of America once.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of this journey I was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the company and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſundry friends, whom in my younger years I had held in eſtimation, by reaſon of the good impreſſions I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their exemplary lives and labours, as before noted in its place. My quondam maſter, David Hall, treated me with affectionate reſpect; he had buried his former wife, who was my miſtreſs, and married again. He and his wife accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me to a meeting at Airton. I lodged at Thomas Anderſon's, a friend in the miniſtry, who viſited Ireland in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with David Hall; he was blind, but exceeding pleaſant and chearful. Next morning being a hard froſt, I went with ſaid Thomas and other friends over a great hill to a monthly meeting at Settle. By

me in the gallery ſat Julian Frankland, a good old woman, near ninety years of age, and a good meeting it was.</p>
                  <p>At and about Kendal alſo, I had much of the company of that honourable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and elder, James Wilſon, who as a nurſing father encouraged and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened me in the ſervice I was engaged in. His converſation was often pleaſant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and edifying; one remarkable paſſage he related, I think worthy of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, which was to the following pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                  <p>In his young years (having been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the eſtabliſhed religion or church of England ſo called) he had conceived a very contemptible opinion of the people called Quakers and their principles, and at a public houſe or inn, falling in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with ſome others of like ſentiments, this people became the ſubject of their diſcourſe; and as they were expreſſing their ſentiments of contempt and diſlike of them pretty freely, a perſon of ſome note, who had been an officer under Oliver Cromwell, came into the room and over-hearing their diſcourſe, obſerved to them in ſubſtance, <q>That he upprehended their prejudice towards this people aroſe from their want of knowing them: for my part (continued lie I entertain
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:018146_0242_0FA55FDAF7543710"/>
very different ſentiments or them;</q> and perceiving them ſtruck with admiration to hear him, whom they looked upon as a man of ſenſe, as well as conſequence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf after this manner, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the following purpoſe. <q>You ſeem to wonder that I expreſs a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opinion of the Quakers, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you the reaſon. After the battle of Dunbar, as I was riding in Scotland at the head of my troop, I obſerved at ſome diſtance from the road, a crowd of people, and one higher than the reſt; upon which I ſent one of my men to ſee, and bring me word what was the meaning of this gathering and ſeeing him ride up and ſtay there, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning according to my order, I ſent a ſecond, who ſtayed in like manner, and then I determined to go myſelf. When I came thither, I found it was James Naylor preaching to the people; but with ſuch power and reaching energy, as I had not till then been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of. I could not help ſtaying a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, although I was afraid to ſtay; for I was made a Quaker, being forced to tremble at the ſight of myſelf. I was ſtruck with more terror by the preaching of James Naylor, than I was at the battle of Dunbar, when we
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018146_0243_0FA55FDBAE6522E0"/>
had nothing elſe to expect, but to fall a prey to the ſwords of our enemies, without being able to help ourſelves. I clearly ſaw the croſs to be ſubmitted to, ſo I durſt ſtay no longer, but got off, and carried condemnation for it in my own breaſt. The people there, in the clear and powerful opening of their ſtates, cried out againſt themſelves, imploring mercy, a thorough change, and the whole work of ſalvation to be effected in them. Ever ſince I have thought myſelf obliged to acknowledge on their behalf, as I have now done.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, James Wilſon ſaid, proved the firſt ſtep towards his convincement of our principles, inclining him to go to our meetings, which before he had an averſion to the thoughts of, from the prejudice above hinted. In thoſe days the meetings of friends were more eminently favoured with divine power, as they lived more devoted to Chriſt; and conſequently more abounding with his love flowing in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>I was ready to think that Iſaac Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had been inſtrumental to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement. I find it recorded in the third volume of the <hi>dying Sayings,</hi> that ſaid Iſaac died at his houſe. Of him he gave me the following account, that <q>being
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:018146_0244_0FA55FDCCB115408"/>
in himſelf an illiterate ruſtick, ſoon after his convincement, he appeared in the miniſtry lively and powerful. A neighbour of his, having heard of his becoming a preacher, could not tell-how ſufficiently to expreſs his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he made it the ſubject of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from place to place, deriding him who had no learning for preſuming to preach, and the people for ſuffering him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This man attended the funeral or that great and good woman, Ann Camm. The meeting proved an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding enlightening, tendering oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: and even this derider was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trited and humbled therein. Iſaac Alexander was eminently raiſed up in his gift, to ſet forth the goodneſs, and the juſtice of God: the glory of Truth, the happineſs of obeying it, and the laſting infelicity of neglecting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt it. The man was ſo thoroughly penetrated with a clear ſight of his own caſe, that after Iſaac had done, he ſtood up in that very aſſembly; acknowledged the crime he had been guilty of, and begged the prayers of all good Chriſtians, that it might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:018146_0245_0FA55FDD2A7BA7F8"/>I moſtly finiſhed my ſervice in England in this journey, with the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Lancaſhire, at Lancaſter, and that for Weſtmoreland, at Kendal, held in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. At the former, I met with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Fuller, of Dublin, who had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied Moſes Aldridge from New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in his religious viſit to friends in Scotland, and was now, as well as myſelf on his return home; our meeting being quite unexpected, was a very pleaſing ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to us both; eſpecially, as we were like to be companions to Dublin. Here alſo, I met with Samuel Fothergill, then young in the miniſtry; but even then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing with that ſolemnity, brightneſs, and goſpel authority, as gave friends live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hopes of his proving, as he did, through the ſucceſſive ſtages of his life, a bright and ſhining light, a veſſel of honour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, of eminent ſervice in the church of Chriſt. The public ſervice in the ſaid quarterly meeting, fell to the ſhare of us who were young, (though many weighty experienced miniſters preſent,) and our good Maſter being with us, it proved a refreſhing, ſatisfactory, and edifying meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>From Lancaſter we went directly to the quarterly meeting at Kendal, which was alſo a good meeting, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:018146_0246_0FA55FE1A0215B68"/>
of the ſucceeding week, we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Whitehaven, in order to take ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for Dublin, where we arrived on ſeventh day following, and I lodged at Joſeph Gill's. I attended the meetings there the next day, and heavenly help being near, I was furniſhed with ability and matter, to miniſter to the general ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and edification of friends, and the eaſe of my own mind. And my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time quite a ſtranger to moſt friends in that city, and coming quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, occaſioned pretty much enquiry among them.</p>
                  <p>From Dublin I proceeded toward Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, by Mountmelick, Mountrath, and Kilconinmore, where John Aſhton was then living, a valuable good man, little inferior to moſt I have known in my eſtimation. Although not eminent for great and ſhining parts; yet he was a ſhining light in the country where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, in love and good works; a man of great humility, and ſervour of ſoul for the promotion of piety; much beloved and eſteemed of his neighbours and friends.</p>
                  <p>When I came to the good old man's houſe, (being now near eighty years of age) he was very much indiſpoſed; and it being about the middle of the eighth
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018146_0247_0FA55FE2FB444590"/>
month O. S. or October, and the friends in that part being late with ſome part of their harveſt, he propoſed notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his infirmity, to accompany me to Limerick: a great day's journey for him when he was well, as the roads were then: and his relations, apprehending it too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous for him to undertake under his preſent indiſpoſition, endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him from it: which made me deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that he might not ſuffer in his health, nor meet with any diſſatisfaction of mind.</p>
                  <p>It proved a fine day. He grew much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his converſation was very edifying. Our friends at Limerick rejoiced greatly to ſee him, being the laſt time of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there. Next day being firſt day, we had two comfortable meetings there. On ſecond day morning at parting, he told me "He was well paid for coming." He was well and hearty the winter following, and the next ſpring ſet forward towards the half-year's meeting at Dublin, but having reached Birr, he found himſelf unable to go further, returned home, and after a ſhort illneſs departed this life, leaving behind him a general teſtimony all round the country on his behalf, as of one who had eminently ſerved God, loved
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:018146_0248_0FA55FE51B48DD00"/>
mankind, and was greatly beloved by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every one that knew him.</p>
                  <p>He and his wife were both convinced at one meeting at Birr, through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful miniſtry of that able and eminent miniſter of the goſpel, Thomas Wilſon. Coming out of that meeting, they ſaid to each other, <q>The way of everlaſting happineſs had been clearly laid down before them, and they were reſolved to walk in it, come life or come death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after, John was thrown into priſon for his chriſtian teſtimony againſt the oppreſſive and antichriſtian yoke of tithes; here, being uſed to work without doors, he was at a loſs how to employ his time; but ſoon learned to make gartering and laces.</p>
                  <p>When at liberty, he with his wife, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly twice a week attended the meeting at Birr, generally walking on foot thither, being about ſeven Engliſh miles and very bad road, wading through a river in the way both going and returning. In winter in croſſing this river they ſometimes had the ice to break; and John ſaid he had wept to ſee the blood on his wife's legs in coming through it. In thoſe days truth was precious to its profeſſors, who alſo poſſeſſed it, and no difficulties or dangers, could prevent them from getting to their
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:018146_0249_0FA55FE56DC22068"/>
religious meetings, to enjoy the renewings of divine love and life, with their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>This good man alſo took great pains to get travelling friends to appoint meetings at his houſe; and then to acquaint peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof ſeveral miles round, travelling for that purpoſe by night, as well as by day, in the winter ſeaſon, and in ſevere weather, and underwent much reproach for this labour and diligence of his.</p>
                  <p>Yet he was bleſt in it, both inwardly and outwardly, many came to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at his houſe, ſeveral were convinced of the truth, and in proceſs of time a meeting was ſettled there, and grew larger than that of Birr, out of which it had ſprung.</p>
                  <p>He was at the time of his joining our ſociety but in low circumſtances: but through induſtry and the bleſſing of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he grew rich, and did abundance of good, being ſingularly hoſpitable, liberal, and charitable.</p>
                  <p>At the aboveſaid meeting at Birr, thro' the miniſtry of Thomas Wilſon, there was alſo convinced his wife's daughter Mary, the wife of James Sheppard. This was a great mortification to her huſband, who tried various means to reclaim her. At length a noted preacher being to
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:018146_0250_0FA55FE652EAD988"/>
preach at the worſhip-houſe he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he propoſed to his wife, that if ſhe would go with him to hear him, he would go with her next Sunday (as he called it) to the meeting at Birr, to which propoſal ſhe aſſented. She went accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and heard fine words and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: but that was not what her ſoul wanted.</p>
                  <p>Next firſt-day purſuant to his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he went with her to Birr. It proved to be a ſilent meeting there: yet thro' the reverent attendance of the ſouls of thoſe preſent upon Chriſt the beſt miniſter, they were favoured together with his life-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſence, with the ſenſe of which, the ſaid James was reached, and tendered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contrition in the ſight of the ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing path caſt up to peace with God. Hereupon, what he little expected at his going to that meeting, he immediately joined in ſociety with friends, and became a ſerviceable man in his ſtation.</p>
                  <p>After parting with John Aſhton, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded toward Cork, and reached it next morning before meeting.</p>
                  <p>Soon after I viſited ſome parts of Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter province. After my return I ſpared my brother, at the requeſt of Benjamin Wilſon near Edenderry, to be tutor to his children, and thoſe of a neighbouring
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:018146_0251_0FA55FE6FB5B01E0"/>
friend. When he had been there about a year and a half, I writ to him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare (after duly apprizing his employers) to return to Cork, having a deſire for once, while I had an opportunity (of his ſupplying my place) to be at the Welch, Briſtol, and London yearly meetings, and though the family was loth to part with him, yet as I wanted him on this account, he diſengaged himſelf and returned to Cork, in due time for me to proceed on the ſervice before me.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly in the beginning of the firſt month, O. S. (now called the third) I embarked on a ſixth day morning at Cork: On ſeventh day at night by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the light-houſes we got into Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-haven. On firſt-day morning I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Haverford-weſt, where I met with Abraham Fuller of Dublin, whom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted how I ſhould ſteer my courſe to North-Wales, as I underſtood here, that the Welch yearly-meeting was to be about a month from this time in this neighbourhood, viz, at Tenby in Pein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brokeſhire.</p>
                  <p>Abraham adviſed me to order my courſe ſo, as to be at John Goodwin's on a firſt-day, becauſe there was generally a large reſort of people there on that day, and gave me his directions how to
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018146_0252_0FA55FE7AC6D61F0"/>
accompliſh it, which I was pleaſed with, having heard before of that good old man, and having a deſire to be then at his houſe.</p>
                  <p>On third day after meeting I left Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verford-weſt, had a meeting next day at Carmarthen: on fifth day morning went to John Bowen's at Penplace, expecting to have a meeting there, but he being gone to their monthly meeting at John Reece's at Penbark, I followed him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where I found a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber met: After I had ſet down, old John Reece ſtood up and preached to us in Welch. On ſixth day I went to the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Evans's at Llandewy-brevy, in Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſhire, and expected next day to reach John Goodwin's, at Eſcargogh in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthſhire.</p>
                  <p>Next morning the friend who was to have been my guide came into my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber long before day, when I was about getting up, having an earneſt deſire to reach John Goodwin's that day. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me <q>I could not go thither that day without running the riſque of my life, as it ſhowed very hard, and it was a mountainous road.</q> I preſently got up, and found myſelf obliged to ſtay there, to the no ſmall diſappointment of my deſire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:018146_0253_0FA55FE8720D9558"/>I then went to their ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>et-town cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Tregarron, and there had two meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that day, the latter of which was large. Next day being firſt day, hearing of a prieſt called Daniel Rowland, whoſe pariſh worſhip-houſe was at Llangeithow, three miles beyond Llandewy-brevy, who was much flocked after by many people, even from other pariſhes, thither I went accompanied by three friends. When we arrived we found the houſe full, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at the outſide, who ſeemed to liſten to the preacher with attention, who was preaching in Welch. I deſired a young man to endeavour to get in to the Parſon, and acquaint him that an Engliſhman without, wanted to ſpeak to him, which I ſuppoſe he did. For when he had ended his ſermon the congregation broke up, and he came out one of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>I went to meet him and told him, <q>I had found my mind drawn in chriſtian love to viſit him and his congregation, and therefore deſired then the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to deliver to him and them what was on my mind.</q> After ſome enquiries he ſaid <q>It was not convenient then, as he had himſelf preached largely to the people.</q> Finding myſelf clear of him, I got upon a pretty high tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and the people generally drew near,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:018146_0254_0FA55FE92B3AC1D8"/>
being a very large multitude. The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity was greatly favoured, I being engaged to invite the people to Chriſt the free teacher, and of him to receive wine and milk (ſtrength and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their ſouls) without money and without price: tho' the people ſtood cloſe crowded, there ſeemed to be as great a ſtillneſs, as if ſcarce any were there. After I had ended what at that time flowed thro' my heart to them, I ſtood a little with my mind reverently and thankfully affected. At length I looked round to ſee on which ſide I might moſt eaſily retire. Some of the people near, who perceived it, deſired that <q>I would pray for them before I left them.</q> I anſwered that <q>I did indeed pray for them, but as for doing it vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, I durſt not, unleſs it appeared at that time to be my duty ſo to do.</q> They aſked then <q>Whither I intended to go next,</q> I told them <q>To Llambeter (about five miles off) where I intended to have a meeting that afternoon.</q> Thither many of them went.</p>
                  <p>When I had got a little way on the road, I was overtaken by one, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a gentleman, on horſeback, with his wife riding behind a man on another horſe, he told me <q>He had come out of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:018146_0255_0FA55FE9EBFF3AB8"/>
Carmarthenſhire fourteen miles over the hills to hear Daniel Rowland, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if I ſhould come into that county, that if I did he would meet me any where in it, if he could know the time and place; but would be better pleaſed if I could come and lodge a night with him,</q> which I afterward did.</p>
                  <p>As I advanced a little further, a certain woman not of our profeſſion, invited me and friends with me to dine, and gave us the beſt entertainment in her power. She expreſſed with ſolidity, <q>She had not underſtood one word I had ſaid; but had felt that which had done her heart good, as a friend interpreted her words to me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many people flocking to Llambeter, the meeting was held in the ſtreet. After it I parted with the people in mutual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and returned to Llandewy brevy in company with friends and others. I was at this time much overcome with the Lord's goodneſs, and thankful for the aforeſaid diſappointment of my deſire, as believing it to be in the ordering of beſt wiſdom, for the ſervice of the day, being filled with a comfortable hope, I was in my proper place, which cauſed the tears to run down my cheeks, moſt of the way I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ride.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:018146_0256_0FA55FEB0F370118"/>When I returned to my quarters, viz. the widow Evans's near Llandewy-brevy, a great number of the neighbouring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were come thither, and an unexpected meeting enſued, wherein ſeveral were broken, and tendered in the time of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. I briefly obſerved <q>that it had been made a good day to ſeveral of us, expreſſing my deſire that it might be duly remembered by us.</q> And in this lively tenderneſs we took our leave of one another.</p>
                  <p>But alas, when I came thither eighteen years after this, I found little ſign left of that ſervency toward God, which then ſeemed impreſſed on their minds. The enemy had got entrance, and too much ſtolen it away.</p>
                  <p>Next day I got to John Goodwin's, and he told me <q>he believed I was come in the right time, there having been but few at his houſe the day before, by reaſon of the ſnow that had fallen thereabout.</q> He accompanied me from his houſe to a meeting at the edge of Shropſhire.</p>
                  <p>John told me that his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were both convinced of truth about the ſame time, and received it in the love of it. At that time his father was clerk of the pariſh, and maſter of the free-ſchool
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:018146_0257_0FA55FEEF75C6CA0"/>
thereof; but upon his joining with friends, and giving up faithfully to divine convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was turned out of both theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and obliged to have recourſe to hard labour, wherein his mother heartily join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But, that himſelf their eldeſt child, then well grown toward the ſtate of a youth, not underſtanding their caſe, thought them fools to turn Quakers, and reſolved he would not be like them in that: Nor did they offer any compulſion to him therein: But their prayers, put up to the Lord for him, were manifeſtly anſwered; and they had in their ſon the comfort they deſired. At this time friends were grown numerous in Wales; but ſoon after, upon the encouragement given by William Penn, moſt of the friends in ſome parts of this principality, removed and ſettled in Pennſylvania, and amongſt the reſt John's father and mother, with moſt of their children. From inclination he would have removed with them; but a higher power directed his ſtay in his native land, and to that he gave up fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother and every thing. This good man recounted, to me the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Lord to him all along to that day, to the following purport.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When the Lord pointed out poor Wales as a field of labour for me, he
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:018146_0258_0FA55FF0969F4A50"/>
promiſed that if I was faithful to him in it, he would be with me and favour me therein: and now I have in my heart a teſtimony for him in my old age, that he hath abundantly made good his promiſe to me, both outwardly and inwardly, far beyond what at that day, I could have ever expected.</q> Which favours in divers reſpects he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over to me in a very edifying thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frame of mind: And ſpeaking of his wife in particular, he related the ſteps by which the Lord (whom they loved and ſerved) conducted and joined them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; livelily adding, <q>I think I may ſay, if ever man in the world got his right wife, I got mine.</q> He further told me. that he lived and maintained his family on a farm of four pounds a year, but at length had purchaſed it and improved it, ſo that at that time he reckoned it worth ſix pounds a year. The firſt journey he travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the miniſtry, being to viſit friends thro' Wales, he had then got of clear money above forty ſhillings in all; and he was free to ſpend it (if there were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) in the Lord's ſervice, knowing that he could give him, or enable him to get more; that the firſt time he began to entertain travelling friends (moſt of the meeting being then gone off to Pennſylvania) he
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:018146_0259_0FA55FF0B905DAC8"/>
had but one bed which he left to them, he and his wife taking up their lodging in the ſtable. Divers have been convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his miniſtry: and one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal worthies of our age I have eſteemed him.</p>

                  <p>And thoſe of low circumſtances from hence may learn that happineſs is confined to no ſtation in this life; but is the reſult of obſerving the law of God in the inward parts, being (as it preſcribes) content with the things which we have, not minding high things; but reducing our deſires to the level of our ſtation in life, that ſo we may fill it with propriety and act our parts well: If we thus walk by the unerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule of truth, tho' we be eſteemed poor in this world, we ſhall be rich in faith, and, with this worthy man enjoy in the obſcurity of the humble cottage what palaces too ſeldom afford, ſolid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the conſolation of a conſcience void of offence, and in reward of well-doing, <q>the peace of God that paſſeth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of men.</q> The moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and extenſive earthly poſſeſſions, when laid in the balance againſt durable poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions like theſe, are indeed as nothing and lighter than vanity.</p>

                     <pb n="75" facs="unknown:018146_0261_0FA55FF23B088898"/>Having parted with John Goodwin, I went to Shrewſbury, Colebrooke-dale, Bewdley, Worceſter, Birmingham, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry, Warwick, Eveſham; then back by Worceſter to Bromyard, Hereford, Amely and into Radnorſhire in Wales, to Brinfloyd and Talcot. To this laſt place came Mary Rickaby of Yorkſhire from Llandewy-brevy, much tired; but after a little reſt and refreſhment, ſhe had an edifying opportunity in the family; and from hence ſhe, with Miriam Bowen, and her uncle Edward Jones accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me to the Welch yearly meeting, as did alſo John Young from Leominſter, who met me at Hereford for that purpoſe, and was an acceptable companion.</p>
                  <p>Next morning we ſet out from Talcot about five o'clock and got to Nathaniel Anthony's a little after meeting time, a meeting having been appointed before-hand there, to begin at five in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. After meeting John Young and I went to lodge with that couple, who had before invited menear Llangeithow, where we met with a kind and cordial reception, and found them fervent in deſire after godlineſs. Next morning we met Mary Rickaby, and ſundry other friends at John Bowen's. Thence went to an evening
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:018146_0262_0FA55FF2F7913C28"/>
meeting at Carmarthen, which was large. Next day being ſeventh day, we went to John Lewis's houſe in the country; on firſt day with him to the meeting at Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and in the afternoon were at a large meeting at Haverford-weſt: And front hence on third day we went to the yearly meeting at Tenby.</p>
                  <p>After the yearly meeting, I went by Swanzey and Trevereeg to Pontipoole, being accompanied by good old Evan Evans. Thence by Shernuton and Roſs to Glouceſter, and from thence round by Oxfordſhire, Berkſhire and Wiltſhire to Briſtol yearly meeting; and from thence by Bath, Bradford, Shaftſbury, Poole, Ringwood and Southampton and the Iſle of Wight, to that of London.</p>
                  <p>At Shaftſbury the meeting had been pretty much dropped for ſeveral years, there being none of our profeſſion left, but an old friend a tanner and his two ſiſters: but at this time ſeveral were in part convinced, and thereupon the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revived. I was there on a firſt day, and had three meetings which were large. The ſecond day I ſpent in viſiting families, and in the evening had a concluſive meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with friends, and thoſe newly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. It was a ſatisfactory time; and one man's wife who had been in great grief,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018146_0263_0FA55FF3AA146E30"/>
paſſion and bitterneſs, on account of her huſband's joining in our profeſſion, was herſelf gained and joined him and friends; and another woman likewiſe joined us at the ſame time: yet the fervency which was then felt, proved but of ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſeveral of them. However the meeting hath continued, a new meeting-houſe was built there ſince that time, and the quarterly meeting of the county of Dorſet is ſometimes held there.</p>
                  <p>On my return from the Iſle of Wight, Thomas Whitehead and Philip Eliot met me at Portſmouth and accompanied me thence to London, with young Abel Hollis of the Iſle of Wight, who was then hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, next day being the fourth of the week we came to Alton; after meeting there on fifth day we came to an evening meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Godalmin. Sixth day morning were at a meeting at Guilford. After meeting, being joined by Samuel Bownas and Jeremiah Waring, we came to Eſher, and next morning to London to the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting.</p>
                  <p>In this journey Samuel Bownas was particularly kind and fatherly to me. We were together at Gracious-ſtreet meeting on firſt day morning, which was a good meeting, and wherein I was favoured in a good degree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="unknown:018146_0264_0FA55FF46CBBF720"/>Thomas Whitehead and Philip Eliot accompanied me after the yearly meeting was over to a meeting at Hertford. From Hertford I went to Hitchin, Jordan's, High-wiccomb, &amp;c. was at the quarterly-meeting at Okeham for the counties of Leiceſter and Rutland, and at thoſe at Lincoln, York, Lancaſter and Kendal.</p>
                  <p>At this yearly meeting were no repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives from Ireland, but Abraham Fuller and I. John Pim of Edenderry and his brother Joſhua Pim of Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath came as far as Coventry: and there the ſaid Joſhua, a valuable friend and elder, was viſited with a diſtemper, which for a time ſeemed dangerous. He reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but not till ſome time after the yearly meeting was over.</p>
                  <p>The like afterwards happened to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good friend and elder Joſeph Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams of Randal's Mills, who reached Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and was there by indiſpoſition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from getting out to any meeting, ſuch trials being ſometimes permitted for the proving and exerciſing the ſaith and patience of the Lord's ſervants.</p>
                  <p>In this journey I often travelled hard, and had two meetings a day wherever I could. It took me about five months. At Lincoln quarterly meeting friends lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:018146_0265_0FA55FF54C2CD240"/>
at inns: I don't remember that I knew one friend there, but John Scott from Leeds, and May Drummond. It being now about midſummer, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic meeting began at twelve o'clock, their men's meeting about two, and ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore four. In thoſe two meetings I had been ſhut up. I met with an elderly friend and aſked him, how friends ſpent the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of the long evening, he anſwered <q>In converſing together or taking a walk or the like.</q> I told him <q>I thought it was a pity, conſidering the large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of young people come together from ſundry parts of the county, that I thought the end would be better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, by ſome religious opportunity, or meeting, that might tend to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and be of benefit to ſome at leaſt.</q> He replied <q>They uſed to have evening meetings; but being on one hand much infeſted with rude people, and on the other too often weakly conducted, they proved diſſatisfactory; and for theſe reaſons friends had thought it beſt to diſcontinue them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon we were called in to dinner; but I had little appetite: after dinner I was called out. Some of the elders had drawn together, and upon my coming to them, ſignified if I had a concern for an
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:018146_0266_0FA55FF5E9C5C578"/>
evening meeting, that they were willing to appoint one to begin at the ſixth hour. I was afraid yet durſt not refuſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, ſo upon my aſſenting, the meeting was appointed, it was much crowded, and the life and power of truth was in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which eaſed my mind of its burden and filled it with thankfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>From hence John Scott, May Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond and I, came together with divers other friends to a meeting at Gainſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and on the firſt day after, were at the general meeting at Warnſworth, where we met with Joſeph Storr. From thence John Scott and I came together to the monthly meeting at Leeds, where we met with our valuable ancient friend William Slater. From Leeds I went in company with William Hird and his wife to the monthly meeting at Knareſborough, at which was John Fothergill, and from thence to the quarterly meeting at York, to which came in particular John Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, expected by few, having been thought to be near death for ſome time before, but being recovered a little, tho' ſtill very feeble in body, but ſtrong in faith, and warm in love to God and the brethren, in a journey of three days, which he had uſed to accompliſh in one or leſs, he
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:018146_0267_0FA55FF967E6E3B8"/>
reached this city, to have one more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn opportunity with his friends at this meeting.</p>
                  <p>In the meeting of miniſters the good old man was enlarged in much weighty and pertinent counſel in the clear opening of Goſpel light, but the public meetings were much hurt by raw and forward pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic appearances.</p>
                  <p>From York I came with Mary Slater to Skipton, and from thence was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by John Binns to a general meeting at Croſhabooth, where I met with Samuel Fothergill, Margaret Birtwhiſtle (after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards married to Jonathan Rain) and Sarah Routh, who afterwards married William Taylor: next day in company with the two laſt to the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Lancaſter.</p>
                  <p>Here in the meeting of miniſters Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Birtwhiſtle appeared livelily and very ſuitably: but a young man and one elder than he, by their public appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances hurt the meeting.</p>
                  <p>When I reached Whitehaven, I there met Suſanna Morris and Elizabeth Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of Pennſylvania juſt landed from Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin having viſited Ireland. Suſanna Morris was a good old woman and a ſound miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe faith was remarkably tried; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice ſuffered ſhipwreck on the coaſt
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:018146_0268_0FA55FFAEB6AF998"/>
of Ireland and once (as I have heard) on the weſtern coaſt of Europe; yet was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by that power and providence on which ſhe relied, and her faith not weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened thereby.</p>
                  <p>One time it happened in the north of Ireland, and the other time off Dungarvan, when, (as I have been credibly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) after hanging ſome hours in the ſhip's ſhrouds, apparently in imminent danger of being ſwept away by the waves every minute, and the ſtorm continuing ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that no boatmen durſt venture out to their relief, a popiſh prieſt was made the inſtrument of her preſervation, who by his influence and authority rouſed ſome of the inhabitants, at the riſque of their lives to attempt the relief of her and others, which they providentially effected, and brought her and Joſeph Taylor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, ſafe aſhore.</p>
                  <p>When I landed from Whitehaven at Dublin, I there received a letter from my brother, informing me that their next province meeting was to be at Limerick next firſt day. Garret Haſten accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying me, we leſt Dublin on fourth day morning and came that evening to Samuel Neale's at Chriſtian's town, and were next day at the week-day meeting at Rathangan, and after meeting went to
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:018146_0269_0FA55FFC4F793650"/>
John Ridgeway's at Ballycarrol; next day we reached Roſcrea, and Limerick, the day following. At this province meeting I was prevailed on to ſtay and join in a viſit to friends' families, towards which ſervice Garret had before expreſſed ſome concern on his mind. We were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by Joſhua Beale of Cork, John Philips, George Peaſe and William Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſon of Limerick. It proved a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeaſon: The pure influence of truth having prevaled in the preceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince meeting, had ſo prepared friends' minds, that we found in general great openneſs and in ſome families ſcarce a dry eye. No hardneſs, that I remember, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, except in one family: and the head of that family, being an eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuer of the world, in ſome time after failed conſiderably in debt. From thence I came ſtraight home to Cork.</p>
                  <p>On the whole of this long journey, and my third with a certificate, I have this obſervation to make. In my two firſt journeys being much among tender reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious friends, my labour was eaſy and edifying, and I often had great conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and divine ſatisfaction among them: but in this laſt, coming to many places that were poor and flat, as to the life of religion, and where other things more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:018146_0270_0FA55FFCFA518120"/>
I often had ſuffering ſeaſons, and came off but poorly.</p>
                  <p>In the next ſummer after my return, I removed from Cork (leaving my ſaid bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther John Gough there in my place) into Leinſter province, and ſettled near Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melick.</p>
                  <p>I have good reaſon to believe that I followed right direction, and the gracious call of divine goodneſs, in this removal, on divers accounts, as in the good hand of God, the author of all good, it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a bleſſing both to my wife and myſelf. There lived hereaway at that time divers valuable ſpiritually-minded friends, thro' whoſe tender regard, counſel and help we gained freſh good, and to whom we felt great nearneſs of heart, and dear affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the pure love of the one eternal ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Here I tried ſomething of the linen-buſineſs, but found myſelf ſo unfit for dealing with the common people, that I ſaw (notwithſtanding the kind aſſiſtance of ſome friends) I was not like to gain any thing by following this buſineſs. And as I had little elſe at preſent for a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, it ſometimes ſpread a dejection over my mind. Such diſpenſations are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, deeply exerciſing our faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and proving our foundation and
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:018146_0271_0FA55FFD6BDF1440"/>
our confidence in divine protection, and reliance on heavenly help. They are what we generally call trials; and ſo they are: but when we conſider that the earth is the Lord's and the fulneſs thereof, and that the cattle of a thouſand hills are his; are not his favours trials as well as his chaſtiſements? Affluence appears to me a trial as well as diſcouraging outward proſpects; but a trial of a different nature, that is of our fidelity as ſtewards of the mercies of God, to whom we are all to be accountable for the diſcharge of the truſt he hath inveſted us with, that we conſume them not upon our luſts, as if that was our own, which was given us to do good with, and be helpful to others who may ſtand in need; and as the ſunſhine of proſperity is apt to liſt men up too high into a ſtate of inconſiderateneſs and diſſipation, I have thought it as a trial, whereby we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der greater danger and temptation: and have a greater croſs to take up to be what we ought to be, than in humbler ſtations. It has not fallen to my lot to be much proved with trials of this kind, and I am led to believe that divine wiſdom, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all things well, knew beſt what was beſt for me. For when proſpects of things were pleaſing I was too prone to be too much elevated, and therefore needed to
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:018146_0272_0FA55FFE32F428B0"/>
be brought and kept low: but in the midſt of my diſcouragement, a door of hope often opened to me, from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evidence and perſuaſion of my being in my right place, and of faith that all things would work together for good, if we were preſerved thro' all to love and fear the Lord, and ſo I humbly truſt it proved. For my wife under the like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement being brought low in her mind, it proved in the hand of God a good ſtep to her to the more certain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his bleſſed preſence, and the comforts of his good ſpirit: She meeting with the like precious viſitation here, as I had done before in Briſtol, which made us partakers together, of the ſweet ſenſe of the gracious regard of him that is above all, and cloſely linked us together in true unity, and deep thankfulneſs, which often raiſed in us (to our unſpeakable joy) the cheering hope of a dwelling-place, with the ſanctified of the Lord in the regions of bliſs. May I never forget ſuch ſeaſons of unmerited mercy and goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>In the ſpring of the next year, my mind was again drawn to viſit ſome parts of Cumberland and Weſtmoreland. John Pim of Lackah and his wife offered me their eldeſt ſon Moſes for a companion, which I accepted. We met at his brother-in-law
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:018146_0273_0FA55FFEEC1D7CD0"/>
Samuel Neale's at Chriſtian's town. Thence we went next day ſome miles out of our way to ſee our dear friend Mary Peiſly being at that time in affliction.</p>
                  <p>She had been a gay young woman, but in the youthful years of her gaiety, ſhe was favoured with a powerful and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſitation of divine love, and giving up faithfully to the heavenly viſion, ſhe became a veſſel of honour in the maſter's houſe, receiving a gift in the miniſtry, and being reverently, watchfully and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily exerciſed therein to the edification of friends where her lot was caſt. She was indeed an uſeful member and a ſhining ornament to the church.</p>
                  <p>I am ready to conclude, that none in out day, from the time of this the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual viſitation of Chriſt to her ſoul, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered with more ſteadineſs to his guidance, through a variety of probations. She was moſt part of her time a member of the ſame monthly meeting with myſelf. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten were we together in public meetings; often on family viſits.</p>
                  <p>She viſited friends in England, Ireland and North America pretty generally; and ſoon after her return from her laſt journey married our friend Samuel Neale, and in a few days after departed this life. I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended both at her marriage and her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:018146_0274_0FA55FFFE9C23F20"/>
and am ſatisfied that ſhe is gone to enjoy for ever the reward of a well-ſpent life, very much devoted to the ſervice of God, and the promotion of truth upon earth.</p>
                  <p>After this viſit of friendſhip, we got to Dublin on ſeventh day evening, and there on enquiry I was informed at ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the whole fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et of Whitehaven ſhips had gone off that day; but in my return from the quay (accompanied by my kind landlord Thomas Strangman) met a man, who told us there was one prevented from getting off. So I ſtayed the two meetings in Dublin the next day, and had a ſatisfactory time with my dear friends there. After dinner on ſecond day we embarked, and on third day about noon landed at Whitehaven. That afternoon I went to John Harris's, and next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet off with him and his wife, a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable miniſter, to the quarterly meeting at Carliſle.</p>
                  <p>One thing appeared to me pleaſingly remarkable at that time. By reaſon of wet weather, people there were backward at their country work, and then very buſy, yet ſeveral of the men, put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their wives to go to the quarterly meeting, as they intended themſelves to the northern yearly meeting to be at Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:018146_0275_0FA56001565F2088"/>
about two weeks from that time. We were that day pretty many in company, but more women than men, tho' both the roads and the weather were but indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Hence I concluded that no other motive, but that of religious deſire drew them from home. It affected my mind, and made me hope for a good meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The widow of our worthy friend Robert Atkinſon, then about eighty years of age, with two other elderly women walked on foot eight miles to it.</p>
                  <p>On fifth day the quarterly meeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and on ſixth day ended, and was a large and good meeting. On ſeventh day I reached Kendal, and viſited meetings thereaway till the yearly meeting; and after it ſpent a few days thereabout, took leave of my poor mother, and never ſaw either the place of my nativity or her any more. She lived only about two or three years after this, and was favoured in her latter days with peace and quiet; which was mercifully continued to her laſt end.</p>
                  <p>This journey began well, like all my others; but, alas! it did not ſo continue and end, for want of my ſteadily adhering to the all-wiſe guide in my whole conduct. Yet I received inſtruction from it, and learned to exerciſe more care in ſome
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:018146_0276_0FA56001ED43DC30"/>
things, wherein I ſaw I had miſſed my way.</p>
                  <p>I embarked at Whitehaven for Dublin; but we were driven to the north, and put into Carlingford about fifty miles from Dublin. The paſſengers were three men and three women, and this being a poor place, we could only get two mean wretched horſes, on which we helped the women by turns to Dundalk about eight or ten miles. From Dundalk we hired three horſes, which carried double well to Drogheda where we lodged. Here were no horſes to be met with. So meeting with a return chaiſe I agreed for the three women to go in it, and myſelf ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on foot in company with one of the paſſengers, I arrived in Dublin in good time, and was at the half year's meeting there which was a ſatisfactory ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Still ſeeing little or no proſpect of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing by the linen-buſineſs, one morning Thomas Boake ſchoolmaſter of Mountmelick came to acquaint me, that the doctor had told him he muſt qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ſoon quitted it, and I ſucceeded him, in a ſchool poor indeed, as I found it, at my firſt entering upon it; for except a few friends whoſe children <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

had, who duly paid me, moſt of the reſt put me off with promiſes, few of which were ever performed; ſo that a dull proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſtill threatened, and looking back in my mind to both Briſtol and Cork, I thought it a ſtrange condition to which I was now reduced: yet hope in the Lord ſometime ſupported and cheered my mind; and it was not long till things began to wear a better face; for firſt ſome friends of Dublin, and afterwards others from other parts ſent their ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s to board with us, till we had above twenty boys board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our houſe, for whom we were well and duly paid.</p>
                  <p>About ten years after our marriage, my wife was delivered of a ſon, whom we named John, and in a few days after, ſhe departed this life. For about two years before her deceaſe ſhe had been engaged a little in the work of the miniſtry; but her principal ſervice was in friends' fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and in the women's meetings (in which her ſervice was much miſſed, when ſhe was removed.) She died in a ſweet frame of mind, and in near unity with good friends.</p>
                  <p>My brother had married at Youghal a relation of my wife's, upon whoſe death, he and his wiſe came into my houſe at my deſire, and in the winter following

I viſited Ulſter province pretty fully and thoroughly, being at ſundry meetings twice over; in this journey I was favoured with the company of old Robert Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon many miles, and to many meetings, in ſevere weather, and he about eighty-four years of age.</p>
                  <p>I had a particular concern to have a meeting in the town of Belfaſt: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted Robert upon it; but he did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it, not one of our profeſſion liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that town: He ſaid he had been at ſundry meetings there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but few of them proved to ſatisfaction. So I left the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſome days; but the concern fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me ſtill. And it opened in my mind, that if I would have the bread of life to my ſoul, I muſt go to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for me to receive it, viz. to Belfaſt.</p>
                  <p>I thereupon conſulted ſundry other friends, all of whom approved of it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on application the town hall was obtained for it, and fitted up with ſeats of deal-boards. Sundry friends attended from the meetings of Ballinderry, Liſburn, Hillſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and Newtown, particularly from Liſburn ſeveral friends accompanied me, and old Robert could not be eaſy without coming along in the rear of the company; he ſat next to me on the juſtices' bench.</p>
                  <p>The magiſtrates were ſo favourable, as to order the conſtables to ſtand at the door
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:018146_0279_0FA56007431D9F68"/>
to keep out the rabble: The inhabitants of the town of upper rank with their wives and children came to it in a decent ſolid manner.</p>
                  <p>I had had a great weight and fear on my mind reſpecting the undertaking; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on the foundation hinted above; a ſteady hope and reverent dependence on the Almighty ſtayed my mind, and I thought my friends felt for me, and felt unity of heart with me. The meeting was eminently favoured with the clear light of the goſpel, and the ſweet ſenſe and enjoyment of divine life and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. After the meeting, Robert in a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thankful frame of mind expreſſed his ſatisfaction, as did divers other friends. It proved a good day, honourable to the cauſe of truth, and affording ſolid joy to us, who attended that meeting, which had been crowned with the divine preſence.</p>
                  <p>After this I had meetings of the like kind at Dungannon, Moira, and Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curry or Rich-hill, all of them open, and comfortable. And indeed in this viſit to Ulſter province, I was favoured often with the ſupporting evidence of my being under right direction. It had been on my mind for ſome years before, and I thought I had waited till the right time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="unknown:018146_0280_0FA56008A8DECC90"/>I was accompanied in this journey ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles and to many meetings by my eſteemed friend Thomas Greer, whoſe company was truly acceptable; alſo by my dear friend Suſanna Hatton to ſuch meetings as ſhe could get out convenietly to attend.</p>
                  <p>Sometime after I alſo viſited Munſter province, accompanied by my friend John Pim of Lackah.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Methodiſts had got ſome footing in ſundry parts of Ireland, and in Mountmelick in particular: John Curtis, a friend of Briſtol, who had been one of them about a year, having been afterwards convinced of our principles, and received a gift of the miniſtry, came over upon a religious viſit to friends in Ireland, amongſt whom his ſervice was very acceptable.</p>
                  <p>I was with him at a large meeting in the court houſe in Athy, another in the aſſembly-room at Athlone, and at ſeveral others which were very large. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in inwardneſs of mind to attend upon his gift, and follow its leading; and concluded his ſervice in Ireland with an epiſtle to friends whom he had viſited, which the national meeting ordered to be printed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="unknown:018146_0281_0FA56008BAB743E8"/>I mention this by reaſon of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p>One afternoon John Weſley made his firſt entrance into Mountmelick, attended by a large company on horſeback of thoſe who joined him in ſociety. As ſeveral of their miniſters had been here before, ſome of whom had invited me to come, and bring my family, to hear them preach the goſpel, I had not as yet found freedom to go: but hearing that John Weſley was to preach that evening in the open market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, I was not eaſy to avoid going. So I went, and ſtanding at a friend's ſhop-door, I heard him begin with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preamble or introduction:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Before I unfold to you the oracles of God I muſt firſt remove a ſtumbling-block out of the way, which is this; I underſtand one John Curtis from Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol hath of late been travelling in theſe parts, and endeavouring to lay waſte that good work, which it hath pleaſed God to carry on by our hands, giving out that he was formerly a Methodiſt and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with me. Now he never was a Methodiſt to my knowledge, and I think he could not be one in or about Briſtol without it: And as to any acquaintance with the ſaid John Curtis, I ſolemnly declare I never had any; only I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:018146_0282_0FA5600B5BB86F80"/>
being twice in his company occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, about eight years ago. I hope no man will account me an offender for ſpeaking the truth. If George Fox were here he would embrace me for it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the ſubſtance of his introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſame words, or very nearly the ſame, in which he delivered it, for I gave good attention to this part. Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to what he called unfolding the oracles of God, which I thought was ſtamping the matter far too high.</p>
                  <p>That evening I got two friends to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me to his lodging to ſpeak to him hereupon. At the firſt mentioning of the ſubject he diſcovered ſome warmth. <q>I tell you John Curtis has done more harm in his journey thro' theſe parts, than ever he will do good as long as he lives. He has gone about ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poiſon.</q> This high charge he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to prove thus: <q>What poiſon is to the body, that bigotry is to the mind; but John Curtis has been induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious to ſow bigotry, that is to ſow diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection in the hearts of chriſtians to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one another, barely on account of difference in opinion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To all this I replied to the following import <q>I was an entire ſtranger to John Curtis till he came into theſe parts,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:018146_0283_0FA5600BAB690980"/>
ſince which I had made uſe of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of contracting an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, and being pretty much in his company, I have known him to be influenced with the univerſal love of God, and that he has endeavoured to propagate the ſame in others. This thou canſt never call ſcattering poiſon; and if my account differ from thine, ſo doth the foundation on which it is built. For thine is only upon hear-ſay, which is too ſlender a foundation whereupon publicly to aſperſe any man's character who is not preſent to anſwer and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himfelf.</q> At this he ſeemed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what confuſed, and acknowledged that he had not duly conſidered that part of the matter; but thought he might depend on the ſundry repeated informations, he had received from different quarters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I farther obſerved to him that he ought to have duly regarded our Lord's directions not to judge, &amp;c. For if any good is done it is the Lord that doth it, and in what way, and by what inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he pleaſes; and therefore all the glory of it is due to him alone, and no part of that glory or honour to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, which can do nothing of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that it would be a ſin in any inſtrument to take to itſelf what was
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:018146_0284_0FA5600C837D2870"/>
due to God only: and that if John Curtis faithfully did what the Lord directed, he would be accepted, tho' no ſhining out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward effects ſhould ariſe from it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And in regard to what thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of <hi>his ſowing diſaffection in the hearts of Chriſtians, towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, barely on account of difference in opinion;</hi> ſomething occurs to me on that head, which is that Jon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This opportunity concluded peaceably, with John Weſley's acknowledging, <q>that it had been to his edification, and that he therefore wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hed he could get the like opportunities with our friends more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; that he ſaw ſome things in a clearer light than he had done before, and that he would never ſay any thing againſt John Curtis publicly again, unleſs he adminiſtered a real foundation for it.</q> I heard he had the day before made the ſame preamble, or to the ſame
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:018146_0285_0FA5600D2FDF7A58"/>
purport before his ſermon at Edenderry, and would probably have gone on ſo from place to place.</p>
                  <p>I writ to John Curtis hereupon, who anſwered that he never pretended to, nor ever ſpoke of his having any intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with John Weſley; but that he was regularly a methodiſt for ſome time, he ſent me a certificate, ſigned by ſeveral of the ſame fraternity, and ſome other teſtimonials.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon he writ to John Weſley, and ſent me over copies of the letters that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between them. I did not ſee that this paper-war, if continued, would be likely to ſerve any good purpoſe, and ſo I wrote to him, and it dropped. And all the uſe I made of the above-ſaid teſtimonials was occaſionally to ſhew them to ſome of the methodiſts and to one of their miniſters.</p>
                  <p>I was glad to ſee ſome in that part awakened out of their ſleep of darkneſs, to a thoughtfulneſs about their ſouls, and ſincerely wiſhed the increaſe and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſolid piety: but I had opportunity to obſerve there that thoſe who were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and well-minded before have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the moſt ſteady and circumſpect in their conduct, that thoſe who had before gone into groſs pollutions, being induced
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:018146_0286_0FA5600E12673E20"/>
to believe that regeneration was an inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous, not a gradual work, did not ſufficiently remain under repentance, to let it have its perfect work; and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of preſſing forward after the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inward life, denying ſelf, and a conformity to this world in its corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in language and practice, their zeal too much ſettled in the frequency of their meetings, hearing ſermons, praying, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, and treaſuring up ſcripture texts and paſſages in their memories, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them over too lightly and cuſtomarily, in converſation, which rendered theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths like ſalt without the proper ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, taking from them the awful weight and dignity due to them.</p>
                  <p>By theſe means chriſtian fortitude for ſtanding ſtedfaſt in a reverent ſimplicity and holy vigilance ſoon retired; a ſilent dependance on Chriſt the true teacher was irkſome, and that dependence which was due to him miſplaced on fallible men. The conſequence was a dwindling, a blaſt on the firſt buddings of heavenly deſires, a decay of the divine life: and many of them ſoon returned, like the ſow that was waſhed, to wallow in the mire and filth of tranſgreſſion again; and threw off the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, the inſipid, and ſurfeiting talk of religion; the form of godlineſs, which
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:018146_0287_0FA5600ECF3DB008"/>
they had too much gloried in, for want of humbly abiding under the purifying pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof.</p>
                  <p>Sometime after this a vacancy falling out in the city of Dublin by the death of John Beetham friends' ſchoolmaſter there, and the return of George Routh (who had tried the place after him) to England, my brother being encouraged by friends there to take up the charge of that ſchool, ſeemed inclined thereto, and as the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſeemed promiſing, I freely aſſented to his removal, altho' thereby I was left ſingly to undergo the labour and care of a large family of boarders, in which he and his wife had been uſeful aſſiſtants ſince the death of my wife. This induced me to think of marrying again, and accordingly I married Elizabeth Barnes, daughter of Thomas Barnes, of Waterford. About two weeks after our marriage we went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the ſummer half year's meeting in Dublin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In our way thither we ſpent the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For in a few days after, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of their families came to Dublin to embark for North Carolina, to ſettle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my couſin Arthur Dobbs's lands there, who was their landlord at Timahoe, and who upon my application, had offered to
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:018146_0288_0FA5600F6C7A5A40"/>
me for life, and after it to my ſon John and his heirs one thouſand acres of that land: Robert Millhouſe of Timahoe was to chuſe land, next to that, which himſelf ſhould take, but the captain of the ſhip in which they went, not being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the coaſt, ran too far to the ſouthward, landed them at Charleſtown in South-Carolina, and thereupon they ſettled in that Province, ſo I was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in my expectation of getting the land taken up by him. Two other oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities afterwards preſented ſome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of getting them taken up; but by various accidents, my hopes were again diſappointed: may all diſappointments of this kind incite to a greater diligence in ſeeking the one thing needful, that good part, which ſhall never be taken away.</p>
                  <p>We reſided about ten years after our marriage in Mountmelick; during which time an increaſing private family, and the neceſſary attendance of my houſe and ſchool, prevented my going any great journey, but I attended monthly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and national meetings generally, in which I was often favoured with my brethren, with the freſh ariſings of life, and the renewing of inward ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>My wife being of a very weakly and tender conſtitution, I apprehended the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:018146_0289_0FA5601049EC15B8"/>
and burdenſome care of a boarding ſchool, a load too heavy for her, and from hence conceived a deſire, with ſubmiſſion to the ordering of divine providence, of a place where the weight might reſt more upon my ſhoulders, and leſs on hers: and, having made previous application, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an invitation to return to Briſtol, and reſume the ſchool there.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon after ſome time, I threw up my ſchool in Mountmelick, attended the fifth mo. national meeting at Dublin, after which I embarked there with three friends more, to attend the yearly meeting at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. We went aboard ſhip on fifth day morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and landed at Park gate next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and had an evening meeting at Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool. On ſeventh day went to Warrington: on firſt day morning, to the general meeting at Franley in Cheſhire. On ſecond day we reached Birmingham; after meeting there on third day we went to Coventry. On fourth day after a meeting at Coventry, we reached Towceſter, and London the next day. After the yearly meeting was over, Iſaac Jackſon returned home; Joſhua Wilſon ſtaid a little time amongſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and Joſeph Inman and I (accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by our kind landlord John Elie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

begin at the ſixth hour. Next morning Joſeph Inman and I were at the monthly meeting at Newberry, and that evening at a ſmall meeting at Marlborough; on fifth day we came to a meeting at Calne, and after it to John Fry's at Sutton-benjar. Next day after meeting there to Bath, and on ſeventh day to Briſtol, where we ſtayed till ſixth day morning, when leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Briſtol, we croſſed the new paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wales, that night came to Cardiff, and the next to Swanzey, were we ſtayed over the firſt day; and on a ſecond day were at an evening meeting at Carmarthen. On third day at Llandewy brevy. On fourth day, by way of Llaneedleſs we reached John Goodwin's. At Llaneedleſs we went to ſee a friend's widow. We found her ſpinning in her poor habitation, and ſhe ſeemed rejoiced to ſee us, and as we had no guide, ſhe readily offered herſelf for a guide to John Goodwin's, which they called five miles: but it took us near three hours riding.</p>
                  <p>On fifth day after meeting at this anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, worthy friend's houſe, we went to his ſon-in-law Humphry Owen's (on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide) who had married John's eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: On ſixth day after meeting, ſaid Humphry accompanied us to his brother Lewis Owen's near Dolgelthy in Merion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethſhire;

and next day along a mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous road to Carnarvan, where we ſtayed, and had a meeting by ourſelves, and after dinner came to Holy head on firſt day even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. On ſecond day morning about two o'clock our kind friend ſaw us on board the packet-boat and then took leave of us. On third day in the evening we landed in Dublin, and next evening I got ſafe home to my wife and children, in Mountmelick.</p>
                  <p>After my return I attended the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting for Munſter at Clonme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſundry kind friends, particularly Thomas Strangman of Mountmelick, we all got well to Waterford, and from thence (after ſtaying about ten days with our friends there) to Briſtol.</p>
                  <p>Now leaving Ireland, after having ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed there about twenty-four years, and received much affection and kindneſs from many friends there, of which I hope to retain the grateful remembrance as long as my memory ſhall continue, let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the ſtate of our ſociety there, during that ſpace of time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="unknown:018146_0292_0FA560169588E0E0"/>At my firſt going thither, there were yet living in moſt parts of the nation, where meetings were ſettled, ſome of the good old ſtock both miniſters and elders, who loved God and mankind, and were eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beloved by them, being kind and open-hearted, as well as faithful and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in all the branches of our chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian teſtimony, cloſely uniting in tender love one with another, in ſupporting it, and keeping things in good order in the church. Their pious care herein was like a fence about the flock, which kept them together in nearer unity and greater ſafety: So that the young people in moſt parts were generally trained up in innocence of manners, and in plainneſs of habit and ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Some indeed, chiefly of the young men grown up, had for ſome time paſt, refuſed ſubmiſſion to the good order eſtabliſhed; but I lived there long enough to ſee the unhappy conſequences thereof, both to themſelves, many of them, and to the body whereof they were members. What tho' their tables abounded with elegant diſhes, and variety of liquors: tho' they made a figure, and were envied or careſſed for a time; yet moſt of them were either cut ſhort by death, or fell into diſgrace. The hand of the Lord ſeemed to be againſt theſe
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:018146_0293_0FA56018D93F2E38"/>
introducers, and ſpreaders of corrupt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: add they never attained thereby that true honour and peace, which attended the worthy men and women above hinted, to whom the firſt excurſion of ſuch was matter of great concern and anxiety from a clear foreſight of the hurtful conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof: and much labour and pains, they took to put a ſtop to it, and prevent the ſpreading thereof, particularly in the city of Cork, and therefore they were clear of it.</p>
                  <p>But tho' ſome of theſe were too big for the girdle of truth, to meet about them, or to be limited by the deſires of their beſt friends; yet I found the diſcipline of the church better maintained, during my firſt years in Cork, than before them in Briſtol, tending to edification, brotherly comfort and love, and mutual encouragement in piety and virtue, with a joint deſire and care to preſerve an uniform regularity, and to revive and maintain a religious fervency toward God.</p>
                  <p>Some friends from the ſeveral parts attended their province meetings, which were held regularly once in ſix weeks, and circulated from one part to another, yet were moſt frequently held in Cork. Thoſe meetings were often ſweetly favoured, thro' the coming together of ſincere, lively ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited

friends: At one of theſe meetings, in particular in Cork ſoon after my coming to it, we had the company of John Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kett from Leinſter, a worthy elder. In the men's meeting he ſpoke to us with ſuch divine authority and ſweetneſs, that to me his words ſeemed fitly ſpoken indeed, and <hi>like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their half year's meetings in Dublin were attended by ſome friends from moſt parts of the nation. Here in their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for diſcipline, as well as for worſhip, a zeal for the honour of God, and the good of the church preſided, and friends were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to keep all things in proper order in the church. The firſt time I attended a half year's meeting was in the winter 1742, and it was indeed a lively good meeting, which I hope never to forget. After I removed from Cork to Mountmelick I attended the national, and provincial meetings for Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter pretty conſtantly, and often in them was affected with reverent gratitude to the Almighty, who by the diſcoveries of the divine wiſdom inſtituted them for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and edification of the church, and in them frequently owned the gatherings of his people in his name, by the evident ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his divine preſence.</p>
                  <p>In proceſs of time theſe worthy men and women, in whoſe hearts the love of God

and his people, had by long growth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deeply rooted, one after another finiſhed their courſe honourably, leaving an excellent favour behind them; but when they were removed, very few of the youth or others, ſucceeded them in the right line, to fill up their vacant places with propriety. Of their ſurvivors, on one hand, a conſiderable number retained the ancient plainneſs of language and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and rigidly cenſorious of any deviation therefrom, valued themſelves thereupon, as if it were the only teſt and badge of diſcipleſhip, while their hearts were gone after their covetouſneſs in eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, and ſordidly hoarding temporal wealth. On the other hand a large body of youth and others ſhooting up in ſelf-indulgence, in conformity to the world, and ruſhing headlong into the temptations of the times.</p>
                  <p>Yet amidſt this inundation of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and revolt, there remain in moſt places a number of ſincere-hearted friends, a few worthy miniſters and elders: but within theſe twenty years paſt, there has been a great alteration for the worſe.</p>
                  <p>The propoſals, which friends of Briſtol made me, appeared ſufficiently encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging to promiſe a probable proſpect of a pretty eaſy ſituation, as to temporals, and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:018146_0296_0FA55F1581965B58"/>
when in Mountmelick, this city was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to my view for a reſidence for me and my family, it was brought to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, how in my young years, it was made to me what Bethel was to Jacob in his youthful time, when all alone with his ſtaff, he travelled obeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his parents, that is, the place, where the Lord firſt viſited me with his power and light, and was a father to me, when I was as it were alone, and far from my parents and all my relations; and how he called Jacob after many years, and a great increaſe of family, to go up again to Bethel and dwell there, and erect an altar to his God: how Jacob thereupon, obliged his houſhold to put away their ſtrange gods, to be clean, and change their garments: and ſo they went<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Under this view, I hoped this removal might be attended with beneficial effects to me and mine, and that I had in degree divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence therein, being divinely favoured among my dear friends in Ireland in my laſt taking leave of them.</p>
                  <p>But promiſed happineſs in this life often proves a phantom that flies from us as we purſue; we often think we have it in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but it ſtill keeps beyond our reach: They who would attain certain and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:018146_0297_0FA55F15B97D54B8"/>
happineſs, ſhould extend their views beyond this life.</p>
                  <p>For notwithſtanding the apparent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging proſpect, after a while I found things, both proviſions and labour, ſo much dearer here than in Ireland, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and embarraſſments crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hat degree, that I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten brought very low, under the gloomy proſpect: and my faith was put to a ſevere trial: yet it pleaſed kind providence to make way for me, and raiſe me relief in his own time, for which I deſire to be ever gratefully thankful, and unreſervedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in heart to his ſervice, whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies fail not.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo I found a change in another reſpect not agreeable to the natural diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. He, who had viſited my ſoul, and called me into the miniſtry, had given me a great place in the particular and near regard, affection and eſteem of friends in Ireland, where I had an open door, and was often much enlarged in goſpel love. Moſtly attending the province meetings in Leinſter, friends were rejoiced to ſee me, and apt to think me much miſſed, if at any time I did not get out to any of them. Whenever I did, I met ſuch a welcome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception amongſt friends (being often open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their edification, and to our mutual

endearment to each other in the ſweet ſtreams of divine life) and ſuch ready at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and kindneſs as were very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to nature.</p>
                  <p>But coming from thence to Briſtol, where I was now become a ſtranger to many, and where they were full ſed as to vocal miniſtry, I was here very much ſhut up, and for a ſeaſon ſeemed to have loſt the careſſes, cordial invitations, and that place I had amongſt friends in Ireland; which, however, tho' (in my preſent trying cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances) a ſeemingly additional diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, was not an unprofitable diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: for tho' it was the great favour of the Almighty, whereby I was opened among my friends to their edification, and their hearts opened towards me; yet herein the enemy artfully laid his ſnares, and too much and too often prevailed over my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchful ſoul to my inward hurt. For what are all the careſſes of mankind? Of ſmall value in themſelves, and often inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to them whom they pleaſe, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hidden poiſon to the unguarded mind; while that which alone will ſtand us in real ſtead, and be of infinite advantage, is to get and keep the favour of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: may I therefore want, and even reject, whatever would pleaſe, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:018146_0299_0FA55F172ECB5AD8"/>
that ſpirit, which ought to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der daily mortification!</p>
                  <p>The inward near unity, ſympathy, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem and affection of friends and brethren is a very grateful and pleaſing enjoyment; but it may be proper and good for us to be tried and proved with being ſtripped of every leaning ſtock, but the only ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that we may thereby be driven to have recourſe to it, and keep our only ſafe habitation there. May this, after a life ſo toſſed up and down, as mine has been, at length become my caſe on any terms! and if it be, it will be more than worth all I have yet ſuffered, were it many times more: For all elſe will be ſoon over; but this will never end.</p>

                  <p>THUS far my deceaſed brother proceeded in the narrative of the tranſactions of his own life; I find by the papers in my hand, that (as noted in the preface) he drew up a review thereof at ſundry periods, and commenced the laſt in the 66th year of his age; which, it's propable, had he lived to finiſh it, would have exhibited, in a continued narration, the ſucceeding occurrences of his life to near the preſent time; but he proceeded only a little way in the laſt review: and the former in his 54th year terminates here; I condole with the reader the want of this continuation by that hand, which only could give it with thoſe intereſting reflections, reſulting from a recollection of the feelings attending the ſucceſſive occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of his life; this is an advantage that no other hand can ſupply, as no other

cured him alſo an open door for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of his labour and ſervice therein.</p>
                  <p>During this interval, in the year 1769 he met with a cloſe trial in the death of his deſervedly beloved ſon John; a young man of amiable manners, and valuable qualities beyond moſt of his years, being bleſſed with a good natural diſpoſition, and good capacity, well improved in his mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by a diligent application to uſeful learning, under the tuition of his father and preceptor; to whom the eaſy taſk of inſtructing him, hiſ aſſiduity, and ready proficiency conveyed ſecret joy, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hopes of future ſatisfaction in a ſon, who gave ſuch promiſing omens of making an uſeful and honourable member of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and civil ſociety. Nor were theſe hopes fruſtrated in the advancing ſtages of his ſhort life. For as he grew up, being favoured with ſolid religious impreſſions, he fought after, and attained beſt wiſdom to a degree, in general, exceeding his age. in this his entrance on the ſtage of life, a propriety and ſteadineſs of department, that might adorn advanced years, attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the notice and reſpectful regard of the beſt friends who had the opportunity or obſerving, or being acquainted with him. By a conſcientious diſcharge of every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and religious duty, as a dutiful ſon,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:018146_0303_0FA55F1A390922A0"/>
as an affectionate brother, as an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary pattern of plainneſs, ſobriety and circumſpection of life, he gave evident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, he was early acquainted with the grace and truth, which came by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I apprehend he was for a ſeaſon an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant to his father in his ſchool: but the weight of care, and exerciſing embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this occupation, with the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of encreaſing care, as the weight thereof ſhould devolve more immediately on his ſhoulders, not ſuiting the preſent temper of his mind, diſcouraged him from continuing in that line of life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meeting with an encouraging offer from a friend in London, to aſſiſt him in his buſineſs in the capacity of a clerk, he removed thither: and there he laid down the body in or about the 21ſt year of his age (as I recollect) having in this ſtation, as well as every other, conducted himſelf with fidelity, reputation and honour: In teſtimony whereof I have an extract of a letter, from his employer, to his father, communicated in one from the latter of tenth month 26th, 1769, as follows, viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I now doubt of my eldeſt ſon John's being any longer in this world: he was ſeized with a violent fever laſt firſt day week. B. R. in laſt ſeventh day's letter
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:018146_0304_0FA55F1AF60E0EF8"/>
writes For my own part I don't much expect his recovery, which is a great affliction to me on divers accounts: yet I hope to be reſigned to the will of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, being well aſſured if he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved it will he to his eternal gain, altho' my very great loſs as well as thine, and many others, by whom he is dearly beloved. Oh! that my life, and that of all that know him may be like his, that at our death we may ſay as he did to my wife; <hi>I have done all that had to do, and muſt now go home.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after he died ; and in my brother's next letter he writes me the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his funeral. <q>My ſon's John's funeral was uncommonly remarkable. It was taken to the new meeting houſe at Park in Southwalk. The meeting was exceſſively crowded, and many without doors It was attended by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral public friends, many friends from ſeveral meetings in the city, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out of the country from the love they bore him: the opportunity by all accounts was eminently favoured, the ſervice thereof falling to the lot of our worthy well qualified friend, Samuel For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <q>Through divine favour and aſſiſtance I freely gave him up, thankful for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a ſon, who hath left behind him too few like him in pure unmixed goodneſs, which diligently exerted itſelf to do well. He was a moſt affectionate, dutiful ſon, both to me and his preſent mother, ſo complete a pattern in every virtue, that I have heard many in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Briſtol ſay, that they never ſaw one of his years like him. He is happily gone before, ſafe landed in the port of reſt; and that we may land there is all that we have to deſire and be concerned for.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe ſhort teſtimonies to the memory of my deceaſed nephew, I thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to inſert here; Firſt, becauſe I am of opinion, had his father lived to continue his own account of the occurrences of his life ſo far, he would not have omitted one, ſo nearly affecting him; and it was my purpoſe to notice what I apprehend he would have done for edification, as far as I have materials. Secondly, I thought the delineation of ſuch a character, might be of ſervice, to ſome of the youth of this generation, as an example for them to imitate; as an evidence that early piety may through divine aſſiſtance, be attained, and that if we ſeek it in ſincerity, and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:018146_0306_0FA55F1D1F10A6E8"/>
with full purpoſe of heart, our ſearch will not be in vain: "I love them," ſaith wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <q>that love me, and they that ſeek me <hi>early,</hi> ſhall find me.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. viii. 17.</note>
                     </q> As an awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening inſtance of the uncertain tenure we have of all things in this tranſitory life; that all fleſh is graſs. and the goodlineſs of man as the flower or the field; and as a powerful incentive, in conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to extend our views beyond the ſhort-lived glory, and fading enjoyments of this uncertain world, to the durable riches of righteouſneſs, and everlaſting rewards thereof. May the riſing youthhereby be incited, ſo to number their days, as that they may apply their hearts unto wiſdom, in order to make timely preparation for their final change: and not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be ſo far deluded, as to put off this neceſſary work, to ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uture ſtage of life, which they can have no aſſurance of attaining unto, reaſoning with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (thro' the ſuggeſtions of the enemy) that gaiety, feſtivity, and fleſhly liberties, being agreeable to their preſent age may be ſafely indulged for a ſeaſon, as they have much time to repent and grow ſober in; and that at ſome more advanced period, when gravity and ſeriouſneſs will be more ſuitable to their years, they will then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:018146_0307_0FA55F1D30F7B4A0"/>
to thoſe things that belong to peace. Had this virtuous young man ſo reaſoned, and ſo acted, how different had the favour he left behind him been! But oh, how different! how very remotely different his condition in his immortal ſtate!</p>
                  <p>If any man will come after me, ſaid our bleſſed Lord, let him take up his croſs daily, deny himſelf, and follow me: <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke ix 23.</note> ſince then theſe are the preſcribed terms of diſcipleſhip, and, if we would be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy are to be ſubmitted to, at one period of our lives or other; they have greatly the advantage, who are ſo wiſe as to ſubmit thereto, in the early part of life. It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth, before his evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities be ſo confirmed by indulgence as to become habitual: cuſtom hath a powerful influence over the human mind, and the croſs to evil habits is hard to endure. Can the Ethiopian change his ſkin, or the leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard his ſpots? <q>then may ye alſo do good, who are accuſtomed to do evil.<note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. xiii. 23.</note>
                     </q> On the contrary, as cuſtom alſo makes hard things eaſy, iſ inſtead of accuſtoming ourſelves to do evil, and thereby ſtrengthening our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural propenſities thereto, and edging our painful ſenſations under the croſs; we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom our tender necks to the yoke of

Chriſt, we ſhall much ſooner feel his yoke become eaſy, and his burden light: that early piety is the ſureſt ground of an eaſy and peaceful paſſage thro' this vale of tears, as well as laying a good foundation for futurity. <q>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,<note n="*" place="bottom">Tim. i.4, 8.</note>
                     </q> and thoſe have in a general way proved moſt eminently ſerviceable, and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt lights in their generation, who have with Jacob, entered early into covenant with their Maker, and kept the covenant of their youth.</p>
                  <p>I ſincerely deſire the youth into whoſe hands this may fall, may deeply ponder theſe intereſting reflections, ſo as ſeriouſly to conſider their latter end, and make time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preparation for it; as not knowing at what hour the maſter may come, at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, at cock-crowing, or the dawning of the day. And then I am well convinced they would be weaned, not only from the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, diſſipation, and groſs enormities of the world, but from an affectation of, and conformity unto the vain amuſements, manners and faſhions thereof, which too many indulge themſelves in, to their hurt. Let them not ſatisfy themſelves with an apprehenſion, that they indulge only in
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:018146_0309_0FA55F1ED403A458"/>
things of an indifferent nature, and in which religion is not concerned: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of unwiſely meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing themſelves amongſt them ſelves, bring their deeds to the true criterion the light,<note n="*" place="bottom">Cor. ii. 10 12.</note> that they may be made manifeſt, what ſource they originate from: and in the light many of the little things will be ſeen to draw the mind from its proper center, and the ſeats of thoſe that ſell doves occupying the temple of the heart, to unfit it for an houſe of prayer. It is not ſufficient that we are preſerved from groſs evils (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' this is laudable ſo far) but if we are concerned to make our calling and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſure, and to ſecure an inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified, we are to walk in obedience to the will of God, (which is our ſanctification) revealed by his grace in our hearts, which teaches to deny ourſelves not only of thoſe things that are manifeſtly evil; but of thoſe alſo, that, under the appearance of indifferent, gratify our carnal deſires, and draw the mind into folly and vanity, from that ſtate of vigilance, on which our ſafety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: not only to abſtain from thoſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities in conduct, which injure our reputation with men; but to keep that

guard upon the avenues of the heart, that we ſuffer no thief to find entertainment there, to ſteal away our affections from God, or defile this temple of the Holy Ghoſt. Man that is created a little lower than the angels, is created for higher and nobler purſuits, than the gratifications of ſenſe: and not to reſt ſatisfied in merely avoiding that conduct which expoſes him to cenſure; but to follow that which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits praiſe, and procures divine approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <q>Finally, brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things.<note n="*" place="bottom">Philippians iv. 8</note>

                  <p>My brother, having now for ſeveral years been principally engaged, in the neceſſary care and labour to provide for thoſe of his own houſhold; in the latter end of the year 1773, felt a religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern on his mind to viſit friends in ſome of the counties of England: and alſo thoſe of Ireland, in company with Thomas Melhuiſh, of Taunton in Somerſetſhire: And in order to ſet himſelf at liberty to accompliſh theſe viſits, he reſigned his ſchool in Briſtol.</p>

                  <p>London, 18th 1ſt Month, 1774.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I have been now near four months cloſely employed in viſiting friends, thro' the four counties of Somerſet, Devon, Dorſet and Hants: and fat with friends at many of their monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the three quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Somerſetſhire, Dorſetſhire, and Hampſhire, all which were large for the ſeaſon of the year, and favoured by the maſter of our aſſemblies with that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of love, which unites his true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants every where in a holy concern for the honour of his name, and for the faithful ſupport of that teſtimony, he has called them to bear.</q>

                     <q>I reached this city laſt firſt day morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having ridden eleven miles before meeting. I was at Gracious-ſtreet that morning, at which were Sarah Taylor and Tabitha Merriott, the former of whom was favoured with a lively op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, —it was a good meeting
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:018146_0312_0FA55F20EF6D8290"/>
and ended well. I was thankful for having reached it. In the afternoon I was at Devonſhire-houſe, the meeting was very large, and freſh ability was given to treat with the youth and others, in the merciful opening of the pure ſpring of the goſpel. Yeſterday I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſelect morning meeting, and in the afternoon the two weeks meeting. And in the evening, Thomas Corbyn with his lodgers, the friends above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, viſited at my lodgings, where we had a conſolatory time of retirement, in which our heavenly father was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to break the bread of life amongſt us. I ſhall be likely to be three or four weeks, in and about London, and when I am clear, I have the meetings of Berkſhire and Wiltſhire, to viſit in my way home. I deſire to be every day where I ought, and as I ought, that if I can do no good, I may be in the way of renewedly receiving ſome freſh ſupply from the living fountain, which refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſpiritually unites all the true travellers heavenward, in daily grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the kind author of all good.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>My dear companion (who has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his credentials from their month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and quarterly meetings,) writes to
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:018146_0313_0FA55F221D871118"/>
me, that he is haſtened in his mind, to move forward: but both he and I muſt ſubmit to bear the curb, and exerciſe patience. I am at times aſſaulted with earneſt longings to make haſte home, to get a little time there, before my coming over to viſit friends in Ireland; till I am favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the renewing of that gracious help, which raiſes over all things and gives the ſingle deſire of being both <hi>where</hi> and <hi>what</hi> I ſhould be. I entered with an earneſt deſire that I might be both guided and guarded aright; and hitherto with great thankfulneſs, have to acknowledge that my prayers have been anſwered: and that he who hath the key of David, hath been graciouſly pleaſed many times to open his ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and from thence to unfold doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, counſel, conſolation, and reproof, to the differing ſtates of the people.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>London, 1ſt 3d Month, 1774.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I have now been in this city ſeven firſt days and ſeven ſecond days morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meetings, and thro' the other parts of thoſe weeks, have beſides thoſe of London, Weſtminiſter and Southwark, laboured in the ſundry meetings around them. To-morrow I expect the two laſt
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:018146_0314_0FA55F22B974C938"/>
meetings here, that for worſhip at Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious-ſtreet, in the morning, and the monthly meeting at Devonſhire-houſe, in the afternoon; next day to ſet off for Berkſhire, Wiltſhire and Briſtol. So that it looks like to be the 4th month before I can ſet out for Dublin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I have cauſe to be humbly thankful to the author of all our mercies, who hath been kind to me thro' my winter's travels, favouring me with good health, thro' all winds and weathers, and with a kind reception every where. At this city being entered into my proper la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and buſineſs, I have found that I could not retire hence, any ſooner than the day abovementioned, and I think I ſhall not overſtay my time, but rather otherwiſe, having found an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of heart beyond expectation, and having contributed to encreaſe the morning meeting of elders here, with a valuable addition thereto; tho' I found it hard labour thro' the diffidence and reluctance of ſome; yet the power and love of truth at length prevailed, to the ſatisfaction and comfort of many good friends.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I find accordingly that he got home on the 8th 3 mo. and in about a week after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward took a turn to the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:018146_0315_0FA55F26D54962F8"/>
of Somerſetſhire at Glaſtonbury, and that for Wiltſhire at Devizes, and was at ſome other meetings in his way from one to the other.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of 4 mo. he left home on his intended viſit to Ireland; he came to the quarterly meeting at Worceſter, and thence by Birmingham, Coventry, Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and Stourbridge to Colebrook-dale, where he was at meetings at the New-dale and Old-dale, and viſited ſundry families, accompanied by Daniel Roſe.</p>
                  <p>From Colebrook-Dale, by Shrewſbury to Dolobran, where the meeting-houſe was nearly full, the meeting began at 8 o'clock in the morning, and was very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. The next day he got to Llewin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee to William Howel's, ſon-in-law to the late worthy friend John Goodwin, (with whom John's widow was then living, being 83 years of age,) and had a meeting there, and from thence he went by Llaneedleſs to the Welch yearly meeting at Brecknock, which began on the 26th of 4th month: The meeting of miniſters and elders, began, at 9 o'clock in the morning, and at three in the afternoon, a meeting of friends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and after it the men's meeting, which held till it was almoſt dark, and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to the 7th hour next morning, when friends met again, and the, meeting
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:018146_0316_0FA55F29640F3768"/>
held till about nine. At ten the public meeting began in the Town-hall, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively crowded, and a ſatisfactory meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This yearly meeting ended the 27th 4th month, and the half-year's meeting in Dublin was to begin the 1ſt 5th mon. So he writes, <q>William Howel and I came 41 miles after dinner, to Llaneedleſs, where on the 28th we had a large meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the town-hall or ſeſſion-room, beginning at 8 o'clock, which was much favoured. Margaret Jarman, and Mary Hunt, accompanied us from thence to Eſcargoh, where we alſo had a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable opportunity, our hearts being much tendered together.</q> On the 29th being ſixth day of the week, he ſet off from Llewindee accompanied by Owen Owen ſon of Humphrey Owen aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and grandſon to John Goodwin, for Holy head, and that day, altho' they were detained ſome hours for the tide to fall, till they could croſs a river in the way, and in croſſing which, they were for a good while up to the ſaddle ſkirts, they reached Carnarvan, being fifty miles, that night, and Holyhead about eleven o'clock in the forenoon of ſeventh day; went aboard the packet-boat, about two o'clock on firſt day morning; but having little wind, did not get to Dublin till ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:018146_0317_0FA55F2A08EA64F8"/>
day evening being the ſecond day of the 5th month and of the national meeting.</p>
                  <p>Of this journey in Ireland, he kept a brief diary; but not ſo particular, as of the former thro' Wales, being only a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary account of the meetings and places he was at each day, without any remarks on meetings, or occurrences to diverſify the narration, and therefore I ſhall be obliged to comprize the relation thereof, in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs.</p>
                  <p>He viſited the meetings in courſe; firſt, by Edenderry, Rathangan and Ballitore, to the ſix weeks meeting at Carlow, and thence weſtward, to Ballimurry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the quarterly meeting at Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derry, in concert with his companion, Thomas Melhuiſh. From thence they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their courſe towards the province of Munſter, by Tullamore, Birr and Kilco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninmore to Limerick, and from thence thro' Munſter, finiſhing their viſit to that province, at the province meeting at Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford: thence thro' the county of Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and ſo into the county of Carlow, where Thomas Melhuiſh and he ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (at Caſtledermot) Thomas's draft being to Ulſter, and my brother's preſent concern, more to the adjacent parts of Leinſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="unknown:018146_0318_0FA55F2AB1B85520"/>After parting with Thomas Melhuiſh, he continued viſiting friends in thoſe parts, till the province meeting of Wicklow, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, and ſpending ſome days in Dublin, he went from thence to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince meeting for Ulſter at Ballenderry, and returned pretty directly back to Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, without appointing any meeting in that province, and continued viſiting meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in different parts of Leinſter province, chiefly till the enſuing quarterly meeting, which was held at Enniſcorthy, and from thence proceeded directly to Waterford, to take ſhipping for Briſtol.</p>
                  <p>This viſit took him up near four months, (for he embarked for Briſtol, on or about the 24th 8 mo.) the greateſt part of which time ſeems to have been employed in Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter province, having viſited moſt parts thereof, at leaſt twice over.</p>
                  <p>Having as aforementioned, reſigned his ſchool at Briſtol, in order to be at liberty to diſcharge what was pointed out to him as a duty: Now his ſervice being finiſhed, he was out of employment there, for the ſupport of himſelf and family. The proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of this in his giving up to this ſervice muſt, I imagine, have been a pretty cloſe trial of faith; as he could not at the time of his reſignation have any apprehenſion of the way which afterwards opened, for
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:018146_0319_0FA55F2B963C7D58"/>
their employment and ſubſiſtence: but knowing he was faithful who had called him into the ſervice, he was doubtleſs ſtrengthened to go forth in faith, and a humble dependence on him, whom he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for ſupport, inwardly and outwardly; and in the due time, away opened for him to his ſatisfaction. For by my removal from Dublin (where I had reſided upwards of twenty-three years) to Liſburn, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened during his travels in this nation; the ſchool there became vacant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon friends of Dublin made him propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to undertake the care thereof; to which he agreed, and ſoon after his return to Briſtol, removed with his family to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in that city.</p>
                  <p>Where again the neceſſary attendance of his ſchool, confined him pretty much to the place of his reſidence, and parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent; for the ſpace of two or three years; till about the ſummer 1777, when his family being grown up, and moſtly in a way to provide for themſelves; and his youngeſt ſon having gotten an agreeable place of apprenticeſhip, he found his way open finally to relinquiſh the confining and exerciſing occupation, of his ſchool, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be more at liberty in the evening of his day, to accompliſh the remaining part of his day's work, againſt the termination
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:018146_0320_0FA55F2C376AEF78"/>
thereof: and from this time to his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val out of this life, he was much engaged to travel and labour amongſt friends in the different quarters of this nation for the promotion of truth and righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>And as he had not viſited Ulſter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in his late viſit to this nation; the diſcharging of that debt was the principal ſervice pointed out to him, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, as he himſelf expreſſeth it in the introduction to his account of ſaid viſit.</p>
                  <p>Seventh mo. 1ſt, 1777. A good friend from England lately told us, in a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that our old copy books were ſullied, and too full of blots; that we ſhould get new books to keep our accounts in, and keep them fair and clean, and I wiſhed with the Lord's aſſiſtance to do ſo, viz. to have my heart and life made and kept clean.</p>
                  <p>I felt a longing deſire to undergo a freſh the "warning of regeneration,<note n="*" place="bottom">Titus iii. 3.</note>" in order to be favoured with <q>the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</q> I thought that he who ſaid to the blind man, <q>Go waſh in the pool of Siloam,<note n="†" place="bottom">John vii. 7.</note>
                     </q> ſaid unto me, Go to the northern parts of Ireland, to viſit what is left there of the profeſſors of truth; and therewith infuſed the new covenant, or
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:018146_0321_0FA55F2D18E630F8"/>
ſolemn engagement on my part, to give up thereto. Oh poor cold North; almoſt totally dead as to the divine life! In viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſons and daughters, I foreſee great anxieties, inward conflicts, and trying baptiſms; may I duly mind that part of Chriſt's counſel to his followers, <q>In your patience poſſeſs ye your ſouls,<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xxi. 19.</note>
                     </q> and indeed his counſel continually conveyed thro' his holy ſpirit; as I have the greateſt need cloſely to attend to it in all things, and practiſe faithful obedience thereto.</p>
                  <p>So may I daily watch and pray, and labour, both to open a new book of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, reſpecting the Lord's holy cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and my walking humbly therein, and endeavour to keep it carefully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blot or blemiſh, both within in his ſight, and without toward mankind; in a daily exerciſe <q>to keep always a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence, towards God and towards men<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xxiv. 16.</note>.</q> May I watch and ſtrive againſt corrupt <hi>ſelf,</hi> and keep a diary or daily account thereof, morning and evening, remembering <q>that to live after the fleſh is to die, but thro' the ſpirit to mortify the deeds of the body is to live.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 13.</note>
                     </q> Oh, that in me all ſelf were ſlain, that Chriſt might live and ever reign in my ſoul, who viſited, invited, attracted it, about the 22d year of my

age; and has, thro' his grace, preſerved me thro' many revolutions, and often opened a way for me to ſteer along, when no way, or next to none appeared, till now I am come to the ſixty-fifth year of my life.</p>
                  <p>Seventh mo. 17th. After I awoke this morning, this text ſprang in my mind <q>Chriſt gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works:<note n="*" place="bottom">Titus ii. 14.</note>
                     </q> with a ſtrong deſire that whatever it coſt me, whatever labour, ſelf-denial, or ſeeming hardſhip; I may obtain the great end, for which I have a being, the "one thing needful," which Mary made her choice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by pleaſed her Lord, viz. that of being more thoroughly redeemed, from every corruption of nature, or neglect of duty to God; more purified in heart and life; more inflamed with a holy zeal for his honour, <q>laying aſide every weight and burden, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet, and run with patience the race that is ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith, who, for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.<note n="†" place="bottom">Hebrews xii. 1, 2.</note>
                     </q> And now
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:018146_0323_0FA55F2EC8853A88"/>
I am likely ſoon to ſet forward as a poor pilgrim, to the coldeſt and remoteſt parts of the North of this nation, which are rarely viſited by any friends of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they meet with ſo much diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that way: but I muſt go and labour amongſt them, according to the ability given, for the working out our ſalvation, with fear and trembling.</p>
                  <p>Seventh mo. 18th. To-day we had a ſilent, but to me and ſome others I hope an edifying meeting, under the divine and ſpiritual miniſtry of the great miniſter of life and ſalvation, who therein ſet before me two ſervices, the one to procure ſome ſubſcriptions for the relief of a poor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which after meeting I ſet about and ſucceeded in; the other my journey to the North, with a lively and freſh encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement thereto, under the conſideration of the uncertainty of our time here, and that if my duty to God required me to be doing one thing in one place, and death ſhould arreſt me doing ſomething elſe in another place, how miſerable would my ſtate be! The covenant of my youth was now brought to my remembrance with a lively and affecting impreſſion, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage adopted by the prophet Jeremiah, ſpeaking in the name of the Lord, <q>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee, the kindneſs of thy youth;
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:018146_0324_0FA55F2F5CB41948"/>
the love of thine eſpouſals, when thou wenteſt after me in the wilderneſs, in a land that was not ſown. Iſrael was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to the Lord, and the firſt fruits of his encreaſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. ii. 2, 3.</note>
                     </q> When I firſt gave up to the heavenly viſitation, how was my heart melted into holy admiration of the love of God, and of his condeſcenſion to my low eſtate: pure goodneſs was then all my deſire and delight. In the intervals of labour I loved to retire from all the world, to him my beſt friend, who was with me in my labour, inſtructing and helping me in it, and making hard things eaſy, ſo that "I walked by faith, and not by ſight," my mind being in heaven, often overflowing with the effuſion of his grace, and goodneſs. Under this enlivening recollection, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire was rekindled in my heart, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new my covenant, to return to my firſt love; and do my firſt works, in an unreſerved reſignation, to do the will of God. And my heart was influenced with a wiſh, that our young people in general, might be induced to love religious retirement in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therein to become acquainted with the wonderful counſellor, who is mere readily met with therein, than in the crowds, commotions, and tumults of the world, and in their own experience prove, that <q>It is good for a man that he bear the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:018146_0325_0FA55F2FF66A34D0"/>
yoke in his youth, he ſitteth alone, and keepeth ſilence—He putteth his mouth in the duſt, if ſo be there may be hope:<note n="*" place="bottom">Lam. iii. 27, 28, 29.</note>
                     </q> May our converſation be in heaven, and our language and whole demeanour make it manifeſt that we have been with Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Eighth mo. 4th. I returned from viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the families of Timahoe meeting, in company with Joſeph Williams, wherein a divine viſitation ſeemed to be renewedly extended to them: It is much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that they may duly embrace it, to come up in their duty, and to perſevere in well-doing, to the end of their days.</p>
                  <p>Such viſits among our friends, under divine influence, are of ſervice, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of being often performed, as tending to renew the bonds of friendſhip, in the truth; to provoke to love and good works, and as they are engaged ſteadily to wait upon the Lord, frequently prove ſeaſons of renewing of ſtrength to the viſitors, as well as viſited.</p>
                  <p>Two days after, viz. the 6th of 8 mo. he ſet forward on his viſit to friends of Ulſter province, taking his way by the quarterly meeting for Leinſter province, held at Moate; and after the concluſion thereof proceeded to Oldcaſtle, Coothill and Caſtleſhane, in each of which three
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:018146_0326_0FA55F30B6F74DE8"/>
meetings he did not only labour amongſt his friends in their public aſſemblies, but alſo viſited them in their ſeveral families<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From Caſtleſhane, he croſſed over to Lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and was on firſt day at the meeting there, it being their men's and women's meeting. At that meeting I met him, and it was to ſome an edifying ſeaſon. From Lurgan, he went to Rathfriland, and viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the families belonging to that meeting. From thence he came to Liſburn, and had a meeting there, next day at Hillſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough. The three ſucceeding days were the quarterly meeting at Ballenderry, which he attended, and had acceptable ſervice therein. The following week, he took the meetings of Moyallen, Lurgan. Ballihagan, and Charlemount, in ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, viſited ſome families, and was again at the meeting near Charlemount, on firſt day following, which he obſerves, was large like a province meeting. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his courſe, from thence, to Antrim quarter, and as the viſiting of this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was in a particular manner impreſſed as a duty upon his mind, he viſited the meetings thereof, thoroughly, and all or moſt of the families of friends thereaway. On the firſt day, he was at Grange, of which he writ to a friend, <q>We had a kind of general meeting at Grange

                  </p>
                  <p>He ſpent about a week among friends, in this quarter. But (as I recollect) his viſit both to ſaid quarter in particular, and the province in general, was in ſome degree cut ſhort, by the arrival of our friends Thomas Corbyn, John Townſend, and Joſeph Roe, from London, John Storer from Nottingham, and James Backhouſe from the county of Durham, who came over in conſequence of an appointment of the yearly meeting of London, to viſit the ſundry meetings of diſcipline, in this nation.

<pb n="142" facs="unknown:018146_0328_0FA55F32461C3580"/>
eaſy to accompany them to Antrim, and from thence to Lurgan; from whence they proceeded to Charlemount, to be at the men's and women's meeting there on firſt day, and Ballihagan on ſecond day. My brother ſtaying firſt day morning meeting, at Lurgan, had alſo an evening meeting at Liſburn, appointed at the fifth hour, and next day at Newtown. Fourth day following, was with the Engliſh friends, at the men's and women's meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Lurgan, and next day came with them to that of Liſburn, held at Ballender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The province meeting at Lurgan, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by appointment, on ſixth, ſeventh and firſt days, over which he ſtayed, and after that, and having a meeting at Rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friland, in the market-houſe, one more at Lurgan, and another at Moyallen, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Dublin.</p>
                  <p>When he arrived at Dublin, he found Thomas Dobſon, (from near Carliſle, who had come over under a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for that ſervice) engaged in a viſit to friends' families in that city: upon his arrival, he joined him in the ſervice, and accompanied him to ninety families, he having viſited forty-ſix, before my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's return.</p>

Thus he was diligently engaged, moſt part of his latter days, in almoſt a continued ſeries of laborious ſervice in the church, either at home or abroad.</p>

                  <p>On the 3d day of 9 mon. 1778, he ſet forward on a journey, to viſit his friends in the province of Munſter, making his way pretty directly thro' the county of Carlow to Clonmel, where he commenced his viſit to ſaid province, being there on a firſt day, at their two meetings. On ſecond day he writes, <q>Not ſuiting for any public meeting hereaway, being the time of their aſſizes, we were at nineteen friends' houſes, and had good opportunities in ſeveral of them.</q> So proceeding, he had meetings in courſe,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:018146_0331_0FA55F35E0450C20"/>
at the following places, viz. Caſhel, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryroan, Limerick: Cork on firſt day, the two public meetings, and a third, with divers friends in the evening at Joſeph Garratt's, on ſecond day he went to Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, accompanied by ſeveral friends, and back to Cork; was at their meeting on third day, and after it, at the men's meeting; on fourth day to Youghal, to a meeting appointed at five o'clock that evening, ſtayed their week-day meeting next day, and after it returned to Cork, to the quarterly meeting. From thence by Garryroan, and Clonmel, to Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, where his viſit terminated. He fell in with the meetings of Foreſt, county of Wexford, Carlow and Rathangan, in his way from Waterford to the quarterly meeting for Leinſter province, held at Edenderry, the 4th of 10th month, and from thence returned home.</p>
                  <p>He continued at and about home, for near eleven months, for juſt at the ſame time of the ſucceeding year, viz. the 2d of 9th month, 1779, he left home, to go to the quarterly meeting at Edenderry, and thence by Moate and Ballimurry, he made his way into Ulſter province again; being at Oldcaſtle on firſt day, the 10th of 9th month. From thence to a meeting at Coothill, which was a large crowded
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:018146_0332_0FA55F35F1D431F0"/>
meeting, ſeveral of the town's people, I ſuppoſe coming in. From Coothill, he came to Caſtleſhane, thence to Moyallen, and attended the week-day meeting at Lurgan, which, he ſays, was a large and good meeting. The quarterly meeting at Liſburn ſucceeding, he attended it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, was at meetings at Rathfriland, Moyallen, Ballihagan, and near Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount ſucceſſively. At this laſt meeting, he joined in the viſit to the families of friends, and in company with ſome friends of that meeting, performed the ſaid viſit thoroughly, ſpending therein near two weeks, altho' cloſely engaged day by day. After this ſervice, he viſited the meetings of Antrim quarter, and the reſt of the meetings of the province in courſe, finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſervice, at the province-meeting at Lurgan, the 29th and 30th of the 10th month.</p>
                  <p>The next ſervice I find him engaged in, was a viſit to the monthly meetings of Mountmelick, and Edenderry, in his letter to me dated 1ſt month, 1780, he writes, <q>In the very cold weather, which we have had, I viſited all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar meetings of Mountmelick and Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derry monthly meetings, and tho' I could not but lament the ſtate of many

careleſs profeſſors, yet I had good ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in diſcharging my duty therein.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſummer of the ſame year, he made another excurſion, thro' ſome parts of Leinſter province, and as far as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford. And about the ſame ſeaſon, as the two paſt years, viz. on or about the 22d. 8th month, 1780, he ſet out again, on a viſit to friends, in the province of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. In his firſt day's journey his guide dropped his ſaddle-bags, whereby being deprived of neceſſary change of linen, &amp;c. for the journey before him, I was told it put him to a ſtand whether to proceed or return home; and alſo upon ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the grounds he ſet out on, and the validity of his commiſſion; and upon conſulting the oracle in his own breaſt, it was intimated to him, that he muſt go forward, <hi>if his life went for it.</hi> And to the grounds, or motive of his journey, the firſt meeting he had, was at Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melick, from whence he writ <q>We had a good meeting here to day, which ſeemed as a freſh ſeal to my commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and makes me ſtrongly deſire I may be preſerved, to attend ſingly to my duty, and faithfully diſcharge it.</q> From Mountmelick, he went by Roſcrea, Birr, and Kilconinmore, to Limerick to the province meeting for Munſter, which,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:018146_0334_0FA55F3AE28E9690"/>
by the account he gave, was ſaid to have been the largeſt that was remembered in that place, many friends from Leinſter attending it;—And further, <q>The kind father and author of all our mercies, favours my mind with the ſweet ſenſe of his divine love, and a deſire to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and ſerve him, who is a rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of all his faithful ſervants.</q> Here being requeſted by friends, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the family viſit, he conſented, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in following the pointings of duty. On the fourth day, after the province meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in conjunction with divers friends of that province, he entered upon this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing ſervice; his ſucceeding labours in this and the following ſervice, may be beſt underſtood from extracts, from his own letters, written to his wife, during his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged therein.</p>
                  <p>Limerick, 1ſt 9th month, 1780.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>On fourth day, we began the family viſit here, and that day, we had ſix ſolemn opportunities; viſiting ſo many families, and yeſterday we followed the buſineſs cloſely; having eight ſolemn meetings, ſome of which held long, ſo that it was near ten at night, when the laſt of them broke up. We hope that
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:018146_0335_0FA55F3D73B88A20"/>
two days more, will be ſufficient to finiſh the family viſit here, ſo after firſt day, expect to be thoroughly clear of this part of Munſter, and on ſecond day to proceed with the friends, who ſtay with me here, to Cork. To look at the labour, in a ſervice of this kind, thro' ſuch a very large increaſing extenſive meeting, as that of Cork, would appear very weighty, and almoſt terrifying, were it not for the earneſt, which the great and good maſter hath already given us: who hath led us along, in the ſweet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his own pure love, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hath united our ſpirits, and hath opened a door of utterance, to the reaching the witneſs, and tendering the hearts of many.</q>

We were on the ſervice yeſterday, and to day, at a little paſt ſeven in the morning. We had nine family meetings on ſecond day; yeſterday, one before meeting, five after, and to day hath been a day

of almoſt inceſſant labour, having had nine family meetings, and ſome of them pretty long, and ſome alſo much favoured, with the ſweet flow of the heavenly father's love, to the tendering the hearts of divers. Under this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour, I have had a ſtrong deſire, on the behalf of our children, that the great author of pure goodneſs, would incline their hearts more and more to their principal intereſt, and clothe their minds with the heavenly ſenſe of his love, and with the humility becoming depending creatures, and enamour them with the beauty of truth, which will never wax old, that thro' its power, they might freely ſacrifice to him, what he calls for; and not look after the temptations and vanities of the world; but have the eye ſingle to things infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more important, that therein they may be bleſſed of the Lord, with his favour, which is better than all things elſe.</q>

to divers families; particularly one young man, and his wife, who was not educated in our ſociety, but this day was reduced to tenderneſs, both ſhe and her huſband. I wiſh they may retain it, and come in at the right door to be uſeful and exemplary. We have followed the work, with great diligence from early in the morning till late in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>In his next letter, and the laſt he wrote, he gives an account of a current diſorder, viz. the dyſentery, with which many had been ſeized, and that it had followed him very cloſely for ſeveral days. It ſeems that, partly from reſerve, but chiefly, from a deſire to accompliſh the remaining part of the ſervice before him, ſo as to get through it in time, to return home, againſt the enſuing half-year's meeting; he ſuffered this diſorder to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrength before he let it be known, to a degree of obſtinacy, beyond the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of medicine to remove: for although no care of attendance, or ſuitable appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, under the direction of ſkilful phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians were wanting, yet theſe proving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, he departed out of this tranſitory ſtate of exiſtence, in much tranquillity of

mind, at the houſe of his kind friend, Joſeph Garratt, in Cork, on the 6th day of the 10th month 1780, and was buried in friend's burying ground, in the ſuburbs of that city, the 9th of the ſame month, his funeral being largely attended by friends and many others, as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſome friends from thence, one of whom writes, <q>We had a ſolemn oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, the wing of ancient goodneſs being over the aſſembly, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the laſt office, due to the worthy deceaſed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it pleaſed the divine Being, in whoſe hands our lives are, to releaſe him from further labour, in the church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and remove him from works to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, leaving among his ſurviving friends a good ſavour; his removal being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally regretted, and his memory greatly and extenſively reſpected, by moſt or all that knew him; being a man of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humility and univerſal benevolence; kindly diſpoſed, and affectionate to his friends, and mankind in general, he in return, poſſeſſed their affectionate regard and eſteem in a general way.</p>
                  <p>In his ſpirit, he was preſerved bright and living, thro' his concluſive labour, and to the laſt period of his life, by the accounts I received, from ſome of thoſe
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:018146_0339_0FA55F4072808338"/>
who were ſharers, and witneſſes thereof. My reſpected friend Samuel Neale, in ſympathy with our ſorrow, for the loſs of a near and juſtly beloved relation, obliged me with an affecting epiſtle of condolence, in which he expreſſeth, <q>It is needleſs to ſay, he is a great loſs, in a ſociety ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity he was fervent and devoted; his lamp was repleniſhed with oil, and it ſhined as bright as ever in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he finiſhed his courſe as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoldier; he finiſhed it, making war in righteouſneſs. I was with him at Limerick, at our province meeting, and accompanied him, to the families there, pretty generally; he was like an overflowing ſpring, and freely diffuſed what he was made partaker of, amongſt his friends and brethren, and all that came in his way. After which he came to our city, and the ſame ſtrength, zeal, and authority attended him, here in the public meeting, and more ſelect opportunities I was at with him. He was at the labour, early and late, until forced to ſubmit to the encreaſing infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of body, I think he had finiſhed all to five families, when the great orderer of all things, gave him a releaſe from further militant labour in his church.
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:018146_0340_0FA55F412B4A8118"/>
He was calm and compoſed in his mind, ſaid, <hi>he was reſigned to the divine will and was prepared for the event, relying on the mercy of God.</hi> He was certainly much favoured, by a divine qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as the evening approached, his ſun went down bright, which is the crown of all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And altho' he had his cloſe trials, and diſcouraging proſpects, in various ſeaſons of his life, as we may gather from the preceding pages, yet being through all enabled to ſtay his mind on the Lord, he was preſerved in peaceful reſignation, and ſafely brought through them all; and was favoured to enjoy the evening of his day, as to ſecular engagements, in ſerenity, and calm repoſe, in a ſtate of liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote himſelf more fully, to the ſervice of truth, and to fulfil his miniſtry to the edification of the churches in this nation: He lived to ſee his children well ſettled in marriage, to his full ſatisfaction, or in a way to ſupport themſelves reputably, if favoured with the divine bleſſing upon their labours, and preſerved in the fear of the Lord, which he deſired for them, more than outward riches. Incited through the gracious viſitation of divine goodneſs to him in his youth, in the firſt place, to ſeek the kingdom of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="155" facs="unknown:018146_0341_0FA55F422E2AF840"/>
he found the promiſe verified, that a ſufficiency of other things were added. And having been ſpared to his family, till his immediate aſſiſtance became leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their ſupport; and to the church, till his day's work was in a good degree well accompliſhed; he came to his grave, in nigh a full age, as a ſhock of corn, cometh in his ſeaſon,<note n="*" place="bottom">Job. v. 26.</note> experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the work of righteouſneſs to be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. xxxii. 17.</note> From hence thoſe who may be tried with the like probations, as this is a world of viciſſitude, may receive encouragement in the cloudy ſeaſon, in faith and patience, to caſt their care on that divine Being, who careth for his own, and will bring them ſafely thro' all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and diſcouragements, provided their hearts are ſincere toward him, and all things will work together for good, to thoſe that love God.</p>
                  <p>Now the end of theſe publications, is not to extol the man, ſo much as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend righteouſneſs to mankind, by pointing out the beneficial and happy effects thereof, in real life; and as the deſire of happineſs, planted deep in our nature, is an univerſal affection of the

If we have regarded the deceaſed with affectionate eſteem, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured them for their works' ſake, let our regard for their memory, prompt us to the imitation of their good examples. If we regret their loſs, and the vacancy of their places, let us conſider that a meaſure of the ſame divine ſpirit, which wrought powerfully in them for their redemption, and enlivened them to every good word and work, is alſo given to us individually, for the effecting of the ſame happy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in us, whereby through faithful obedience on our parts, we may receive qualification to fill up ſome of the vacant ſeats; be ſerviceable in our reſpective al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotments; exemplary in our lives, and bleſſed in our end.</p>

                  <p>And our fundamental principle is this, that as God has created us to be for ever happy, he hath beſtowed his light, grace, or holy ſpirit, to fit and prepare us for it.

                  <p n="3">III. Our bleſſed Lord commands us, "not to ſwear at all." It is our duty firmly to obey his command, whenever we are tried herein, and rather to ſuffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently what human laws may inflict, than to take an oath, on any account whatſoever. Thus Daniel and the three worthy Hebrews, choſe rather to ſacrifice their bodies to the lion's den, and to the fiery furnace, than to comply with the law of man, when it demanded a revolt from their duty, to their ſupreme Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The law of man ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>wars and fightings,</hi> and actively to contribute thereto: but Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to love our enemies, and do to
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:018146_0347_0FA55F466BA07500"/>
all men nothing but what is good. As his profeſſed ſubjects, we cannot therefore, actively contribute to military affairs. Our Lord ſaid to Pilate, <q>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants fight.<note n="*" place="bottom">John xviii. 36.</note>
                     </q> Again, whatever injuries or ill uſage we receive, we muſt follow his pattern, not rendering reviling for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling, leaving vengeance to the Lord to whom it belongs. None amongſt us, muſt either fight, or do any violent action, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to provoke thereto. We muſt truſt in the Lord, and then he will diſcover the beſt means of helping and healing the evil in others, or animate us innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bear our teſtimony againſt it, where hearts are too hard to admit any offered help. In this caſe our Lord aſſures us, that great is our reward in heaven: for ſuch uſage the righteous who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, have met with.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Our dear Lord commands his own miniſters freely to give, as from him they freely receive; and he changeth not: a hireling man-made miniſtry therefore, is none of his; nor can we join in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as ſuch. Tho' the law of man hath eſtabliſhed it, we ought to do as the apoſtles did, <q>And to obey God rather
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:018146_0348_0FA55F478D736F88"/>
than man.<note n="*" place="margin">Acts v. 29.</note>
                     </q> The goſpel of Chriſt is free, not ſubject to worldly traffic. It can neither be bought nor ſold. It is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God to ſalvation. It brings the ſoul, which receives and ſubmits to it, into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal union with the father of lights, by leavening it into his divine nature. That which ſelfiſh prieſts purchaſe and demand money for, is therefore not the goſpel; and their pretending it to be ſo, is an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful impoſition.</p>
                  <p>This with many other things of like kind, our anceſtors diſcovered in the true light, and therefore (like holy Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel and his brethren) paſſively ſubmitted to the laws, which required the ſupport of this impoſition, and to the rigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of thoſe laws. By their courage and conſtancy herein, they made the way ſmooth and eaſy to us, our ſufferings being light, in compariſon of theirs. It was nothing but the love of God, that animated them cheerfully to ſuffer great ſpoiling of goods, with long and hard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments: ſeparated from all that was near and dear to them in the world. It was in the ſupport of their teſtimony to the univerſality of God's love to mankind, who invites them that are athirſt, and
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:018146_0349_0FA55F48250E9E38"/>
them that have no money, to come and buy wine and milk, without money and without price.</p>
                  <p>May their deſcendants and ſucceſſors, from generation to generation, come up after them, in the ſame noble cauſe. So would they miniſter joy, to ſuch as have no other intereſt in view, but the ſpiritual health and vigor of the body, and of every member therein. Some indeed of late years, have degenerated from that fidelity to God, which thoſe worthies ever firmly manifeſted. Theſe throw down what their forefathers laboured to build up, and diſſolve that ſpiritual bond, which ſhould unite us in faith and love. I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire they would draw near in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to Chriſt, and to his militant church, to be a help to faithful friends. When any of you are tried with future demands on ſuch accounts, I cannot but wiſh for you, as I look back to the worthies gone, that like them ye may ſtand faſt, in the freedom of the goſpel, without flinching, or any way evading our teſtimony for it. I fully believe that your fidelity, in ſuch trials, would be the means of giving you new life and ſtrength, for the zealous and upright diſcharge of other chriſtian duties, and of making you both uſeful
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:018146_0350_0FA55F4C8CB167A8"/>
and honourable members, not only of civil, but alſo of religious ſociety.</p>
                  <p>As to that formal worſhip, which is begun and carried on in the will of man, our faithful predeceſſors could have no unity with it, nor actively contribute to the ſupport of the places or materials ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to ſuch worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. On the other hand, they moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly paid an active obedience to the laws, which enjoin the payment of cuſtoms, duties, and exciſe, to the King and government; and were zealous, both by example and precept, to induce all to be careful and punctual therein, and not on any account to deal in goods ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be clandeſtinely imported, nor even to buy any of them, for their own private conſumption. So ſhould we ſtill keep ourſelves, entirely clear from this, and every other ſort of unrighteous gains or ſavings.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The law of the land, ſets apart one day in ſeven, for religious retirement, and the worſhip of God. This our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers approved of, and religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; tho' at the ſame time, they teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that the Jewiſh ſabbath is ended, by the coming of Chriſt; and that, there is no inherent holineſs, in any one day more than another. I have long had an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:018146_0351_0FA55F4EF1BC48D8"/>
deſire, that all our friends would duly obſerve, and apply that day, to its proper purpoſe, to begin each week aright, and ſo to hold on to the end of it; to avoid as much as poſſible, travelling about worldly affairs on that day, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, while in health, in attending meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for worſhip. Deny yourſelves the liberty of walking abroad, at ſuch time, or in ſuch manner, as will not be of good example to the idle multitudes, who give the looſe rein to licentious inclinations, on that day: but rather chooſe to have your families collected, for reading the holy ſcriptures, or what may make good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on their minds, that when it ſhall be ſaid, <q>Give an account of thy ſtewardſhip, for thou mayeſt be no longer ſteward,</q> we then may be ready to give our accounts with joy, and receive the anſwer of <q>Well done, good and faithful ſervant. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. For want of this care, what harms abound! I am loth to mention them, but hope ye will bear with me when ye duly conſider that, nothing but well-wiſhing love, induces me to lay them before you, in order that all might join in contributing a timely remedy thereto,

with the means of doing it, which the Lord furniſhes us with.</p>
                  <p>It is apparent, that from hence the love of God in many waxeth cold. How they make light of religious duties! What a ſlender attendance of week-day meetings for the worſhip of God, as well as of thoſe which are held for an united care of the good of the body! So that it may now be ſaid of many, as in ſorrowful days formerly, <q>The ways of Zion mourn, becauſe none come to her ſolemn feaſts.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lam. i. 4.</note>
                     </q> Again, what reſtleſsneſs in meetings, what outward indications of ſpritual indolence, of abſent and wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minds, of neglect of the awful duty of worſhip, due from us to our great creator, what gazing about, or falling aſleep! Oh it is grievous, and tends to give ſtrangers a diſhonourable idea concerning us, while we profeſs the pure ſpiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, according to his own inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and while our dear Saviour hath aſſured us, that where two or three are gathered together in his name, he is in the midſt of them. Again, from hence what violations of our chriſtian teſtimony in its ſundry branches, what weakneſs and inconſiſtency in conduct with that divine
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:018146_0353_0FA55F5032957680"/>
principle, which we profeſs! How do many trample upon the precious labours, and ſufferings of men, whoſe memories are and ever will be bleſſed, as they were valiant for the truth, revealed to them by Chriſt their deareſt Lord! And ſhall we not be brought to account for theſe things? And will not our account be heavier, in the reckoning day, than that of others, who have not been favoured in ſo high a degree, nor ſo much driven with, by the ſpirit of the Lord, who declared to the old world, before its final ruin, <q>My ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Again, how many in theſe peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous days run back, and draw others with them, into the vanities of the times, into a conformity with the world, both in dreſs and addreſs, into the company of ſuch as indulge the ſame diſpoſitions, till the plain honeſt manners, of ſincere and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate friends, are falling into diſuſe, being ſuch as ſome are aſhamed of. Thus were many aſhamed of Chriſt, and offended in him, for his plain and humble appearance, when in the body: but he declared that, he alſo would be aſhamed of them, or would deny them, before his father and his holy angels.</p>
                  <p>From theſe pernicious liberties, have proceeded mixt marriages, running out to
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:018146_0354_0FA55F50F3FEDA20"/>
the prieſts, confuſion in families, afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anguiſh of parents, in the bad returns made to them by diſobedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, painful wounds to our chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Many, by theſe traps and ſnares of the common enemy, have been carried away into the wide world, and quite loſt as to the dedication of their hearts and lives, to the love and fear of God: and but few have ſtood in the gap, to prevent their thus running out: Few have joined in repairing the breaches, made by back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders, in that wall of defence, which the Lord by his power and ſpirit, had erected about us.</p>
                  <p>In this general decline of the ſociety, there ſeems to be great cauſe to fear the yet farther ſpreading of theſe harms, unleſs the Lord in mercy, turn the hearts of many, timely to himſelf, which we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently pray for, knowing that, except the Lord build the houſe, men labour but in vain: yet we muſt do our duty; otherwiſe we ſhall not be clear in his ſight: and he ordereth (now as he did formerly) line up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on line, and precept upon precept, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that all may be timely warned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will hear or forbear!</p>
                  <p>I believe there are none joined in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion with us, who deviate from our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſelf-denial, and plainneſs in habit
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:018146_0355_0FA55F51AC960060"/>
and ſpeech, who have not been ſecretly ſhewed that it is wrong, that it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the ſpirit of the world, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of the croſs of Chriſt, a denial of him before men: but they liſten to that voice, which beguiled Eve, which tells them that there is no harm in ſuch deviations, or that they are ſmall matters; tho' it is manifeſt, that ſuch ſmall matters have opened the door gradually wider and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the groſs declenſion which has overſpread. Tho' many are deceived and darkened by the enemy, to deem them ſmall matters, yet they have great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, as they tend to debar us of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs, and to center us in juſtly deſerved puniſhments, for diſobeying and diſregarding Chriſt, who leads into humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and plainneſs, and preferring that ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who ſeduces into pride, and worldly conformity.</p>
                  <p>I often look with pity, on the victims to the vanities of the world, who fell their birthright for a meſs of pottage; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereby they would give ſolid joy to their well-wiſhing friends, and gain an ample ſhare thereof in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; a joy not like the pleaſures of ſin,

which are but for a ſeaſon, and are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a certain and ſevere ſting; a joy, which will go beyond the grave, to receive an infinite increaſe, and an endleſs duration.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. In regard to ſuch as have not yet much departed from that plainneſs, (at leaſt in dreſs) in which they were edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, ſome probably may not be under any ſtrong temptation, to run into the fooliſh faſhions of a corrupt age. Yet the enemy ſeeks to catch them in ſome other ſnares: and perhaps ſome of theſe may be as ignorant, and as void of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the divine principle we profeſs, as ſome of the more faſhionable. Outward plainneſs, without inward humility, mercy, juſtice and charity, is of very little worth. Except we follow after theſe virtues, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious faults in temper and conduct, will appear, to diſcover our emptineſs, and to ſerve ſome for an argument againſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or for a ſubject of ridicule; and do more harm to the cauſe of truth, than greater errors, in the conduct of open and profeſt libertines.</p>
                  <p>How grievouſly diſappointing, are they who carry a right appearance, yet when tried are found to be inſipid, and dead, as to the life of righteouſneſs! Wherefore let none value themſelves on a plain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,

as if that of itſelf were ſufficient. It is as far from it, as the ſtate of thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly complained of; who drew nigh to the Lord with their mouths, and with their lips honoured him, but their hearts were far from him.</p>
                  <p>Be not deceived: God is not mocked by fair appearances, or empty pretences: But ſuch as every man ſows, he muſt reap. If under the beſt appearance, or ſtricteſt form, we ſow to the fleſh, we ſhall only reap corruption, and the miſerable fruits of hypocriſy, profeſſing one thing and practiſing another; when they who have ſowed to the ſpirit, ſhall reap the happy fruits of their fidelity to God.</p>
                  <p>If we look over our ſociety in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and take a view, both of them who are plain in dreſs, and who are otherwiſe, how many of both ſorts, have their minds faſt rooted in this preſent world, devoting all their talents to it, rejecting the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Chriſt, who directs us <q>to ſeek firſt the kingdom of God,</q> or to live and act, under his government! Hence in ſome places, what poor lifeleſs meetings! How little of the ſacred fire of divine love burning! How little of the light of the glory of God ſhining! No living miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter left amongſt them, and ſcarce one liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing member of the body of Chriſt, to
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:018146_0358_0FA55F5407A02DD0"/>
feel for the others, and take ſome tender care of them for their good; their lamps gone out, and ſcarcely any oil retained in a ſingle veſſel; a week-day meeting hardly kept up, and the one meeting on the firſt day badly attended. Thus have ſome meetings died away, and are loſt; and others appear to be in a languid, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condition, ſeeming ſcarce likely to live long, except they timely apply to the great and good phyſician, who is both able and willing to reſtore life, health, ſoundneſs and vigor, to raiſe up and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify <q>Judges, as at the firſt, and counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors as at the beginning.</q> But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, when in the body, in ſome places, he did none of his mighty works, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their unbelief: ſo now, when his miniſters viſit ſuch places, they find the goſpel has not a free courſe; they can at beſt but feebly labour in ſuch hard ſpots. The word preached, doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, by reaſon of not meeting with faith in them that hear.</p>
                  <p>Great is the myſtery of iniquity, in which the ſubtle ſerpent works in many, to their hurt or ruin, unawares to them, for want of their paying due regard and attention, to that grace of God, which would diſcover the hidden ſnare, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from it. Hence a wrong ſpirit

uſurps the government due to God, and gradually hardens the heart, till the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the immortal ſoul, becomes a matter of very little concern, the firſt and great commandment of loving God with the whole heart, being much violated: ſuch are in a moſt dangerous ſtate, except they turn in haſte "to flee from the wrath, that is to come." I often earneſtly deſire, that ye who are of this kind, would do it, leſt ye be left to your own courſes, in that broad way, which leads to deſtruction, and <q>the things which belong to your peace, be hid from your eyes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">XI. <q>The Lord hath ſhewed unto thee O man, what is good.</q> But many have ſuffered the good impreſſions they have been favoured with, to be like the morning dew, which ſoon paſſeth away. They ruſh into irreligious company, and ſelf-indulging liberties, which, like the fowls of the air, carry off all the good ſeed of the kingdom, which infinite goodneſs had ſowed in their minds.</p>
                  <p>What need have we then, to prize and purſue Chriſt's counſel, <q>to watch and pray,</q> not to enter into theſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to abſtain from all appearance of evil, to avoid ſuch company as deadly poiſon, as there can be no fellowſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt light and darkneſs, or betwixt Chriſt

                  <p>Never go to places of public diverſion, ſuch as Play-houſes, Horſe-races, Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fightings, or to Ale-houſes, thoſe haunts of the licentious, who fear not God.

Why then, will any amongſt us, be the enemy's inſtruments, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting apoſtacy, from the very life of true religion, and godlineſs? Oh rather chooſe to eſcape miſery, and enſure hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Break off all connections, which are obſtacles to it. It is Chriſt's command, "If thy right hand offend, cut it off." Lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which moſt eaſily beſets. Be obedient to him, and thou wilt be happy, ſeparated from the miſerable regions of obſtinate and obdurate ſinners.</p>

There are many we believe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and reputable, in their lives, who need to be more baptized into the ardent love of God, and dedication of heart to his cauſe, that they may not be like ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants, at eaſe in Zion, and indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, inſtead of ſerving the Lord. The harveſt is great, and needs more labourers, to fill up the vacant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of many removed from works to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. What want of miniſters, elders, of ſuch whom the Holy Ghoſt hath made overſeers, taking heed to themſelves, and to the flock, of helpers of one another in animating viſits, both to families and
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:018146_0364_0FA55F59347C7278"/>
individuals, in the lively flow of that love which the Lord giveth to them, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote their hearts to his ſervice!</p>
                  <p>A few yet are mercifully preſerved, who for Zion's ſake cannot be at eaſe, but thro' all diſcouragements hold on their way, knowing they ſerve a good maſter, and reſolving thro' his grace, never to deſert his ſervice, but to keep their places under his direction, and to hold faſt the bleſſed truth, in the love of it, to the end of their lives. May he grant an increaſe of their number and ſtrength! I deſire above all things for myſelf, that to the end of my days, I may be one of their number. O my ſoul, corne thou into their ſecret adoration of God; with their aſſembly herein, mayeſt thou ever be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted! For indeed the Lord is good to them, that ſeek and diligently ſerve him, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing that life, which is hid with Chriſt, a life which will never die; well reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, for all their labours, and for the ſacrifices which they offer to him on the altar of obedience, giving them an hundredfold.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. When our Lord told his diſciples, that one of them ſhould betray him, the reſt heard it with concern, and enquired, <hi>Is it I?</hi> Many have contributed to the great declenſion, and each of us ſhould
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:018146_0365_0FA55F5AB2AA7D50"/>
enquire, <hi>Is it I?</hi> Many have need to be created anew in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good works; but they muſt firſt put off the old man, with his deeds, in deep humiliation before the Lord; which to them, who pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently abide under his righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſin, draws down the gift of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto ſalvation, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of; and that new birth without which we can have no place in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. We muſt give up all our idols; elſe we are undone. Our own wills muſt be ſubjected to the will of God. All our own wiſdom muſt be laid at his feet. We muſt deny ourſelves, take up our croſs daily, and follow him. There are no other terms on which life everlaſting is to be had. Our Lord informs us, that they who expect to gain it, by climbing up any other way, will be treated as thieves and robbers. Oh then, my dear friends, in every part of Ireland, I earneſtly deſire that ye may buy the truth, whatever it coſt you, and ſell it not. Look upon all things beſide, but as droſs or dung, in compariſon of it. Let us hold faſt the one thing needful, whatever elſe leave us or be taken from us. So ſhall we have lived not in vain, obtaining the great end for which we had a being given us.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <pb n="180" facs="unknown:018146_0366_0FA55F5B6C174310"/>XVI. O ye parents, who have many children, and not much of the world for them, don't be over anxious on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or make it an excuſe, for non-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of religious duties. Conſider that it may be wiſely ſo ordered, as the means of their preſervation; and if they follow Chriſt, it may prove of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them, beyond what ye and they are aware of. A little ſatisfies a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind, as we brought nothing into the world, and can carry nothing out. They who obtain the favour of God, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want any thing needful, nor covet any thing ſuperfluous, but having food and raiment, therewith be content. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be anxious for them, only on this account, that they may lay hold on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and keep their hold of that; then they will be truly happy, but not without it, if they had ever ſo much in the world. They are indeed juſtly to be eſteemed, who having more, are thereby the more humbled, and more abounding in uſeful ſervices and good works.</p>
                  <p>And O ye young people, often conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ye are born into the world, to be happy for ever, on the terms laid down by Chriſt, as abovemention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d. With all your gettings, get the favour of the moſt high, who invites you to it: before ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:018146_0367_0FA55F5FE2548B30"/>
even true honour with God, is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; but pride goes before deſtruction. Ye need not envy any one, however great in the world, if ye have the Lord on your ſide. United with your dear parents, in walking humbly with him, ye will have the enlarged view of your happy portion. Your ſervent gratitude, obedience, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and firmneſs, will be crowned with the endearing pledges and encouraging foretaſtes, of endleſs bliſs. So will ye be well ſatisfied with your lots in every condition, and find that godlineſs coupled with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine contentment is the greateſt, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely the moſt valuable gain, being fitted by your bleſſed Redeemer for life, death, judgment, and for that eternal joy, which is unſpeakable and full of glory.</p>
                  <p>So will ye be alive to God, and of that number whom he pronounces bleſſed, who hanger and thirſt after righteouſneſs. So will ye carefully watch againſt every thing that is wrong, both in yourſelves and others, and endeavour to ſtop it in its firſt beginning: ye will love that which is good, and employ all your talents, with divine help, to promote it both by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and brotherly counſel.</p>
                  <p>Then would meetings both for worſhip and diſcipline be well attended; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them under the preparation of
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:018146_0368_0FA55F614873D568"/>
heart which is of the Lord, we ſhould by him be overſhadowed with his power and love; the wing of the ſun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would be overſpread, which illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the ſpiritual mind to diſcern its duties, and animates to diſcharge them, therein to ſhare the good things which God has in ſtore for them that love him. We ſhould hereby be edified and built up together in the moſt holy faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to live in reverent love and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him out of meetings, faithfully maintaining our teſtimony for Chriſt, our holy head in all its branches.</p>
                  <p>So ſhould we be again, as formerly, a people of one heart and mind, baptized by one ſpirit into one body: All the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ignorance and inexperience, all the coldneſs of the worldly or carnal mind would be removed; and Zion's light would yet again go forth with brightneſs, and the ſalvation of God be felt amongſt us, as a lamp that burneth.</p>
                  <p>With ſtrong deſires on the behalf of all, who, in this nation, join in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the bleſſed truth, that they may thus experience the poſſeſſion of it, and be partakers of its ſaving efficacy and laſting peace, I remain your affectionate and well-wiſhing friend.</p>
