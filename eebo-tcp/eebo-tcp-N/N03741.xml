            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help thinking for ourſelves, and judging of Things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Light they appear in; and we promiſe, that when that Gentleman ſatisfies us in theſe Things, we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him; and we <hi>cannot</hi> do it ſooner. But when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that he is but a Man; that great and good Men have <hi>been miſtaken;</hi> and that Infallibility <hi>(as far as we know)</hi> is entail'd neither on him nor his Followers, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their Souls, and will look on it as the moſt eminent Service can be done them, if by our Means they receive a Kindneſs that will turn to their Account, through a boundleſs Eternity.</p>
            <p>We confeſs, that we are at a Loſs to know what to make of ſome of his Expreſſions; if they have <hi>any Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all,</hi> we fear that it is a bad one; and will rejoice to find ourſelves diſappointed, if he ſhews us that they are ſound and good. But if he pretends Hurry or Want of Time, and <hi>does not either juſtify</hi> or <hi>condemn them,</hi> or give us <hi>ſome Satisfaction,</hi> he will <hi>conſtrain</hi> us to think, that he has his own <hi>Glory</hi> in View more than the <hi>Glory</hi> of God or the <hi>Good</hi> of his Church. He has ſuch <hi>high</hi> Conceptions of Man, or ſuch <hi>low</hi> Conceptions of God, that we fear he has <hi>juſt</hi> Conceptions of neither; to ſay, "That Man was adorned <hi>with all</hi> the Perfections of the Deity, that he was the Perfection of the <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>material</hi> World," as he does, <hi>Page 17, Vol. 2d. of Sermons,</hi> is what we can <hi>neither believe,</hi> nor find ground from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nor Revelation to ſupport it. When our Divines prove the Divinity of our bleſſed Lord, they ſometimes do it <hi>(we think to good Purpoſe)</hi> by proving, that the Scriptures attribute to him <hi>all the Perfections of the Deity,</hi> and of Conſequence, that he is the eternal God, equal with the Father and Holy Spirit; but if a <hi>meer Man</hi> may be adorned with <hi>all theſe Perfections,</hi> we know not what to make of this Argument, 'till he give us better Light. — Again, if Men be baptized <hi>into the Nature</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt, as he ſeems to aſſert, <hi>p. 128, vol. 2.</hi> is not this to make them, on their Converſion, Partakers of the Godhead, or ſomeway equal to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being? What ſhall we think of the Doctrine, that one while <hi>ſinks us</hi> into <hi>Brutes and Devils,</hi> and again <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts</hi> us to be equal to <hi>God?</hi> This puts us in Mind of ſome <hi>Antinomian</hi> Reveries, of being goded with God, and chriſted with Chriſt: And we hope the Readers will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us, tho' we deſire to get Light in theſe Things, ſeeing it is our great Concern to have <hi>right Notions</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>ourſelves,</hi> and to <hi>act</hi> accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:004586_0004_100D6AB7186BF7E8"/>When we hear him tell us, "That the Regenerate waſhes away the Guilt of Sin <hi>by the Tears</hi> of a ſincere Repentance, <hi>joined with</hi> Faith in the Blood of Chriſt," <hi>p. 22, 23, vol. 2.</hi> we think that it ſavours of <hi>Popery and Arminianiſm,</hi> to join any Thing with the Blood of Chriſt to waſh away Sin; and hope it will offend none, that we cannot believe this on his <hi>bare Word</hi> contrary to many Scripture Texts, for we abhor an implicite Faith. Is not that Expreſſion of the ſame <hi>Stamp? Vol. 1, p. 79,</hi> Where he ſays, "That a ſingle Aim at God's Glory,— <hi>alone</hi> can render our Actions <hi>acceptable</hi> in God's Sight:" If a ſingle Aim at God's Glory <hi>alone</hi> can render our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons acceptable in his Sight, what need is there for the Blood of Chriſt? We hope none of our Brethren will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that we cannot believe this <hi>popiſh</hi> Doctrine, till he explain or prove it from Scripture. — He further tells us, <hi>p. 128, vol. 2.</hi> (if we miſtake him not) "That our Lord commanded his Diſciples to baptize Men <hi>into</hi> the Nature of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt," which is either to convert them, or rather to make them equal with God: And if he has given Men <hi>Ability</hi> to do either the one or the other, by repeating the Words of the Inſtitution; Why <hi>may</hi> they not as caſtly change a Wafer into his Body and Blood? And this <hi>ſmells of Popery,</hi> and will <hi>ſupport</hi> the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. — When he tells us, "That we muſt be juſtified by the inherent Righteouſneſs of Chriſt," if by this he intends our Sanctification, or good Habits, and good Works performed by the Aid of the Spirit, does not he here again give another <hi>fair Invitation</hi> to bring us to <hi>Rome?</hi> And we hope we will be excuſed from <hi>ſetting</hi> our Face <hi>that Way,</hi> till we be once convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that it is the <hi>ſure Road</hi> to eternal Happineſs. Are not theſe Doctrines full of <hi>Arminianiſm?</hi> And 'tis no Wonder, that we are ſurprized to find them in his <hi>own Writings,</hi> and to hear him <hi>continually applaud</hi> Mr. <hi>Weſtly,</hi> who (we are informed) is an <hi>Arminian,</hi> when we find him cry them down in <hi>all but</hi> themſelves: We <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi>

When he tells us in his Letter againſt the Book, entitled, <hi>The Whole Duty of Man, p. 4,</hi> and <hi>5.</hi> "That <hi>God never made a ſecond Covenant with</hi> Adam <hi>himſelf, nor any of his Poſterity; That it is a Promiſe</hi> and no Covenant; <hi>That there are no Terms</hi> nor <hi>Conditions</hi> in it.

them againſt us, to call us blind and carnal Men, as uſual. Now, tho' Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> himſelf, by ſome Part of his Writings, would ſeem to be a Man of another Spirit and Sentiments from ſuch warm inconſiderate Adherents, as appears by many Expreſſions in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt Archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> and the Author of the Book entitled <hi>The Whole Duty of Man;</hi> particularly by his taxing the Diſſenters for acting very partially, for not ſpeaking ſo explicitely as they ought, againſt the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's Doctrine, when known to be contrary to the Truth of the Goſpel, albeit, the Archbiſhop was their Friend, and behaved with much Moderation towards them, whilſt he lived; we cannot ſee, how he could, conſiſtent with this, tax any of the Lovers of Truth for acting unchriſtianly, for enquiring into the Reaſons of ſome of his Aſſertions, when we judge, that they appear to us as contrary to Truth as ſome of the ſaid Archbiſhop's Doctrines: For, if we miſtake not, it is the Duty and Priviledge of every doubting Chriſtian, to enquire into the Reaſons of the plaineſt Scripture-Doctrine, when he heſitates about it: But we ſhould not ſpeak explicitly againſt any Doctrine, but what upon mature Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have found falſe.

we deſire your Judgments, whether it be any Breach of order, for us, at our own Expences, and ſuch as ſhall join with us, to put our Scruples into print, that ſo there may be an Opportunity given to Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> to clear his Doctrine, if miſrepreſented or miſapprehended by us: And that we may make a fair Eſſay to have our Doubts cleared, which for the preſent ſeem to be Bars and Letts to hinder us to join with our Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Matters of common Concern, with that One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind and Heart, which is deſirable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our mutual Comfort: For when one Side is as Zealous for, as the other is Jealous of a controverted Point, and Aſſertions about it in Matters of Conſcience, it is well known how difficult it is to go Hand in Hand.

of the Deity! What then is become of the Diſtinction, that all ſound Divines make between the communicable and incommunicable Attributes of God? Doth not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon ſupport this neceſſary Diſtinction? If the Soul of Man was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity, without Exception of any, what is the native and neceſſary Conſequence therefrom, but that the Soul then was in ſome ſort equal to God; which is too horrid to utter, without a Deteſtation of it? Were not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of this Import condemn'd for Blaſphemies in the Mouths of <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Naylor?</hi>

'Tis true, Faith in grown Believers, to make Application of his Blood to the Soul, muſt be exerciſed thereon: And it is true, that a Believer muſt renew the Exerciſes of Repentance, in order to regain the Senſe of Pardon; but ſtill, what <hi>ſolely</hi> obtains the Pardon, and blots out the <hi>Guilt,</hi> is the Blood of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning Sacrifice.

How then can there be any room to <hi>join</hi> our <hi>Tears</hi> with Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, to juſtify us before God, without we ſuppoſe the Satisfaction of the Croſs to be incompleat? By what Art can our Tears be <hi>joined</hi> with Faith in the Blood of Chriſt to cleanſe away the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin? What Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the one and of the other will make a due Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without Spoiling the Whole? Why may not ſome Grains of new Obedience be again added to our Tears to make the Compoſition more compleat; for ſurely

this is Duty, and a neceſſary Fruit of Faith as well as godly Sorrow, and as inſeparable from it?</p>

               <hi>Quer.</hi> II. How is this conſiſtent with what Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> himſelf ſaith, in his Letter againſt the Book entitled the Whole Duty of Man, <hi>p.</hi> 6. <q>God's Law was honourable, Jeſus Chriſt fulfilled it in our ſteads; and upon account of that Righteouſneſs imputed to us, and received by Faith, and <hi>not</hi> on our <hi>hearty Endeavour</hi> or <hi>Repentance,</hi> are we accepted by him?" What is there in our <hi>hearty Endeavour</hi> or <hi>Repentance,</hi> to recommend us to the Favour of God, or render them worthy of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined</hi> with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; as tho' that was not <hi>ſufficient</hi> of itſelf?</q> Further, Mr. <hi>Whitfield</hi> adds the Words of pious Biſhop <hi>Beveridge</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>p.</hi> 7. who ſaith, <q>Nay, I cannot confeſs my Sins, but my very Confeſſions are ſtill Aggravations of them: My Repentings need to be repented of: <hi>My Tears need Waſhing;</hi> and the very <hi>Waſhing</hi> of <hi>my Tears</hi> need ſtill to be waſhed over again with the Blood of my Redeemer.</q> Now, if Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> ſpeaks right in <hi>p.</hi> 8. of the ſame Letter; <hi>for there is no hopes of bringing People to the right Knowledge of the Goſpel, till their favourite, tho' erroneous Authors, are diſcountenanced and laid aſide:</hi> and it is therefore accounted a becoming Zeal in Mr. <hi>Whitfield</hi> to write warmly and keenly againſt the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others, upon this Account; How then can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be blamed for oppoſing ſuch Expreſſions in <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s Books as are as erroneous as thoſe he condemns in others? Nay, ſhould not Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> and his warm Adherents, be as careful in Correcting his own Sermons as the Books of others, if found faulty in ſome of the ſame Points, or other Points as material? If it be ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> is ſo buſily employ'd in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Writing againſt other Men's Writings, that he hath no time to look back upon his former Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; may not ſome of his Adherents aſſiſt herein to a good Purpoſe?

                  <hi>The Seed of the Woman,</hi> i. e. Jeſus Chriſt (who in all probability was <hi>ſpiritually</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Inſtant in the Heart of <hi>Eve</hi>) ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head</q>: Agreeable to which Notion, we have in Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> Vol. I. of Sermons, printed at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, p.</hi> 53. <q>The many Souls that are nouriſhed weekly by the <hi>ſpiritual Body and Blood</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt by your Means.</q>

If ſo, in what ſenſe can the New Creature, or Image of Chriſt in us, be called the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> or the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus? Is the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, and the New Creature in us, one and the ſame? Are we to believe in the New Creature, as the Chriſt held forth in this Promiſe? How, or when, did this New Creature, or this ſpiritual <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, who then had a Conception, bruiſe the Serpent's Head by his Obedience and Sufferings? Had the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as the Seed of the Woman, any other Conception, beſides that ſupernatural One by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> We would be glad to know, where there is any ſcripture Ground to ſupport the ſpiritual Conception of Chriſt,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004586_0013_100D6ACB4BC18580"/>
as the Seed of the Woman; or the ſpiritual Manhood of Chriſt? Are not theſe Notions as unintelligible as thoſe of <hi>Barclay</hi> in his Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 135, 136. where he ſpeaks of the Chriſt within? It is true, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Forming of Chriſt in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. but are not we to underſtand that Place as intending the Image, and not the Perſon of Chriſt, as God-Man? much leſs, can we underſtand it of Chriſt, as the Seed of the Woman, or as <hi>Man.</hi> We hope we do (according to our Meaſure) underſtand what it is to feed on a crucified Chriſt, but yet, we would deſire to know what is that <hi>ſpiritual Body</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Blood,</hi> with which Souls are nouriſhed? Is this <hi>ſpiritual Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt <hi>Humane</hi> or Divine? Are theſe finite or infinite? Was it not the natural Body of Chriſt that ſuffered for us? Was it not the natural Blood of Chriſt that was ſhed for our Sins? How then can we feed upon the ſpiritual Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which never (as we know of) had a Being in Heaven, nor on Earth? It is true, we own, according to the Scriptures, that Chriſt's Soul and Body have undergone a glorious and an ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Change; ſo that if we ſpeak of Chriſt's Body, as it now ſubſiſts in an exalted State, it may well be called a ſpiritual Body: But yet, when we feed by Faith on a crucified Chriſt, doth not Faith look to Chriſt's Body as Hanging on the Croſs; and to the real Sufferings of Chriſt in his humane Nature in a State of Humiliation, as what atones Juſtice for us, and as what feeds and nouriſhes our Souls?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. In the aforeſaid written Letter againſt the Book entitled, <hi>The Whole Duty of Man,</hi> wherein Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> quotes the 17th Paragraph of the Preface of that Book, wherein the Author, as Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> obſerves, talking of the Second Covenant, ſpeaks thus: <q>The Second Covenant, ſays he, was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and us in him, preſently after his Fall, and is briefly contain'd in theſe Words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. where God
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004586_0014_100D6ACDB0EAF300"/>
declares, that the Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head: And this was made up, as the Firſt was, of ſome Mercies to be afforded us by God, and ſome Duties to be performed by us.</q> 
               <q>Who that is any way enlightned, cannot but ſee the falſe Divinity and fundamental Errors of this Paſſage: For how can it be proved, that the Second Covenant was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> or that God ever entred into any Covenant at all with Man after he had broken the Firſt? It is true, God the Father did enter into a Second Covenant (and that from all Eternity) with the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the God-Man Chriſt Jeſus, in our ſtead: But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved, that he made any Second Covenant at all with <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, or any of his Poſterity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before we come to propoſe Queries on this Head, it may not be amiſs to premiſe a Word or two, to prevent Miſtakes, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. We freely grant that Chriſt Jeſus is our Second <hi>Adam,</hi> our common Head and Surety in the Second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was only a private Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Perſon, and ſo muſt come in, or enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God by or thro' a Mediator, and at a Second Hand (if we may ſo ſpeak) as well as we his Poſterity. And when we read the 16th Paragraph of the Preface of that 'fore cited Book, we cannot but judge that the Author thereof doth fully own this, when he ſaith, <q>For tho' by that Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> all Mankind were under the Sentence of eternal Condemnation, yet it pleaſed God ſo far to pity our Miſery, as to give us his Son, and in him to make a new Covenant with us, after we had broken the Firſt.</q> Thus far the Author ſeems ſound enough.</p>
            <p>Whether the next Paragraph that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> condemns may bear a favourable Conſtruction, we leave you to judge; but we cannot but heartily join with him in ſhewing our Diſlike to whatſoever in <hi>any Author</hi> may <hi>miſlead</hi> the <hi>Weak</hi> or <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or <hi>countenance</hi> the <hi>Erroneous:</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004586_0015_100D6ACF3459CB60"/>
Yet, whether this may lay a Foundation for ſuch a <hi>hard Cenſure</hi> as that he was not a <hi>Real Chriſtian</hi> at <hi>Heart,</hi> or had not ſo much as a <hi>Head Knowledge</hi> of the Goſpel of Chriſt, as Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> aſſerts, is what we are at a Loſs to determine? How would Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> or ſome of his warm Adherents, like it, if another would take the ſame Liberty to cenſure his Writings, and him for them, to the ſame Degree? Upon the like Ground, we muſt, and do condemn the Author of <hi>The Whole Duty Duty of Man,</hi> for Aſſerting that the Second Covenant was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and us in him, if thereby is meant, his being our Publick Head and Surety in the Second Covenant. And may not we alſo condemn Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> for running into another Extreme and an Error, that ſeems as dangerous as this, in Aſſerting that God never made any Second Covenant at all with <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, or any of his Poſterity? And muſt beg leave to lay before you the following Queries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> I. How can Chriſt be a Mediator of the new Covenant, if there be no other Parties in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but God the Father, and Chriſt engaging for us? Muſt not the Elect or Believers, be conſidered as a third Party in the ſecond Covenant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> II. How can the new Covenant be called a Teſtament, and Chriſt the Teſtator of it, if there be no Parties in it but the Father and him? He receives all from the Father as Mediator: On whom then doth he beſtow Legacies, without there be a third Party in this Covenant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> III. How is the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, a publick Head and Surety of his elect Seed, unleſs ſuch come under the Bond of the ſecond Covenant; and that not only virtually, as Elect, but alſo in Time actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as Believers; ſo that the Covenant may be truely ſaid, to be eſtabliſhed and made with them in Chriſt?</p>
            <p>

Is there any Promiſe made to the Sinner or Believer, but what is or may be, yea, muſt be owned to be a ſecond Covenant Promiſe? And are not all that are Strangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, or out of the Bond of the ſecond Covenant, without God, without Chriſt, and without Hope? How poor then is the Condition of all the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> if it cannot be proven, that God did make any ſecond Covenant with any of them? Muſt not then all of them be under the Law as a broken Covenant, and under the Curſe thereof, without Remedy?</p>
