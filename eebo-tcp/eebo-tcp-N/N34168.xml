            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THERE is a pathetic, elegant, and ſententious ſimplicity in the writings of great and good men, ſingularly expreſſive of that ſweetneſs, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and uniformity of conduct which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them through life, and which I take to be the natural reſult of conſcious goodneſs and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted virtue. The peruſal of ſuch writings affords more pleaſure than the pompous diſplay of rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical flouriſhes and refined elaborate periods: I was therefore highly delighted with a letter which a neighbour of mine, a quaker, has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me, wrote by Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> to his wife and children a little before his firſt voyage to <hi>America,</hi> and found after his death among ſome old manuſcripts never publiſhed. I have gained permiſſion to copy it, and here ſend it you. The ſentiments are not ſtudied, novel, or ſublime, but ſimple, ſincere and natural, adapted to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, flowing from the heart, and conſonant with the rules of true epiſtolary writing. Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> (as obſerved of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi>) appears not ſo
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:044758_0003_101F02268F0006E0"/>properly to ſpeak from nature, as that ſhe ſpeaks through him. Whether we view this great man in the light of a legiſlator, hiſtorian, or chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt, we muſt allow he had great extent of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, accuracy of judgment, and quickneſs of invention; and I think it is but juſtice to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to obſerve, that in all his writings the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, ſcholar and chriſtian are eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. He appears to have had a much deeper and truer ſenſe of religion than was common to the genius of the times in which he lived.</p>

               <salute>My dear wife and children:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY love, that ſea, nor land, nor death itſelf can extinguiſh or leſſen towards you, moſt endearedly viſits you with eternal embraces, and will abide with you for ever: And may the God of my life watch over you, and bleſs you, and do you good in this world and for ever. Some things are upon my ſpirit to leave with you in your reſpective capacities, as I am to one a huſband, and to the reſt a father, if I ſhould never ſee you more in this world.</p>
            <p>My dear wife, remember thou waſt the love of my youth, and much the joy of my life, the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:044758_0004_101F0228164D6D48"/>moſt beloved as well as moſt worthy of all my earthly comforts, and the reaſon of that love was more thy inward than thy outward excellencies (which yet were many.) God knows, and thou knoweſt it, I can ſay it was a match of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence's making, and God's image in us both was the firſt thing, and the moſt amiable and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ornament in our eyes. Now I am to leave thee, and that without knowing whether I ſhall ever ſee thee more in this world; take my counſel into thy boſom, and let it dwell with thee in my ſtead while thou liveſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt. Let the fear of the Lord, and a zeal and love to his glory dwell richly in thy heart, and thou wilt watch for good over thyſelf and thy dear children and family, that no rude light or bad thing be committed; elſe God will be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and he will repent himſelf of the good he intends thee and thine.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Be diligent in meetings for worſhip and buſineſs; ſtir up thyſelf and others herein, it is thy day and place: And let meetings be kept once a day in the family, to wait upon the Lord, who has given us much time for ourſelves. And, my deareſt, to make thy family matters eaſy to thee, divide thy time and be regular, it is eaſy and ſweet; thy retirement will afford thee to do it, as in the morning to view the buſineſs of the houſe, and fix it as thou deſireſt, ſeeing all be in order, that by thy counſel all may move, and to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:044758_0005_101F022AA1B42C80"/>thee render an account every evening. The time for work, for walking, for meals, may be certain, at leaſt let them be made ſo as near as may be; and grieve not thyſelf with careleſs ſervants, they will diſorder thee; rather pay them and let them go, if they will not be better by admonitions: This is beſt, to avoid many words, which I know wound the ſoul, and offend the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. Caſt up thy income, and ſee what it daily amounts to, by which thou mayeſt be ſure to have it in thy ſight and power to keep within compaſs; and I beſeech thee to live low and ſparingly till my debts are paid, and then enlarge as thou ſeeſt it convenient: Remember thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's example when thy father's public ſpirited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had worſted his eſtate (which is my caſe.) I know thou loveſt plain things, and art averſe to the pomps of the world, a nobility natural to thee. I write not as doubtful, but to quicken thee for my ſake to be more vigilant herein, knowing that God will bleſs thy caſe, and thy poor children and thee for it: My mind is wrapt up in a ſaying of thy father's, I deſire not riches, but to owe nothing; and truly that is wealth, and more than enough to live is a ſnare attended with many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. I need not bid thee be humble, for thou art ſo, nor meek and patient, for it is much of thy natural diſpoſition; but I pray thee be oft in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement with the Lord, and guard againſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching friendſhips; keep them at arm's end, for it is giving away our power, ay, and ſelf too,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:044758_0006_101F022E683BD9B8"/>into the poſſeſſion of another, and that which might ſeem engaging in the beginning may prove a yoke and burden too hard and heavy in the end. Wherefore keep dominion over thyſelf, and let thy children, good meetings, and friends be the pleaſure of thy life.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. And now, my deareſt, let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to thy care my dear children, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly beloved of me as the Lord's bleſſings, and the ſweet pledges of our mutual and endeared affection. Above all things endeavour to breed them up in the love of virtue, and that holy plain way of it which we have lived in, that the world in no part of it get into my family. I had rather they were homely than finely bred, as to outward behaviour; yet I love ſweetneſs mixed with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and chearfulneſs tempered with ſobriety: Religion in the heart leads into this true civlity, teaching men and women to be mild and courteous in their behaviour, an accompliſhment worthy indeed of praiſe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. Next breed them up in the love one of another; tell them it is the charge I left behind me, and that it is the way to have the love and bleſſing of God upon them, alſo what his portion is who hates or calls his brother fool. Sometimes ſeparate them, but not long, and allow them to ſend and give each other ſmall things to endear one another with; once more, I ſay, tell them it was my counſel they ſhould be tender and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:044758_0007_101F022FF4D3F4D0"/>one to another. For their learning be liberal; ſpare no coſt, for by ſuch parſimony all is loſt that is ſaved; but let it be uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſuch as is conſiſtent with truth and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not cheriſhing a vain converſation or idle mind; but ingenuity mixed with induſtry is good for the body and mind too: I recommend the uſeful parts of mathematics, as building houſes or ſhips, meaſuring, ſurveying, dialing, navigation, &amp;c. but agriculture is eſpecially in my eye; let my children be huſbandmen and houſewives, it is induſtrious, healthy, honeſt, and of good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; like <hi>Abraham</hi> and the holy ancients, who pleaſed God, and obtained a good report, this leads to conſider the works of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things that are good, and diverts the mind from being taken up with the vain arts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of a luxurious world. It is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in the princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the nobles of that empire, that they have all their children inſtructed in ſome uſeful occupation. Rather keep an ingenious perſon in the houſe to teach them than ſend them to ſchools, too many evil impreſſions being commonly received there: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to obſerve their genius, and do not croſs it as to learning: Let them not dwell too long on one thing; but let their change be agreeable and all their diverſions have ſome bodily labour in them. When grown big have moſt care for them, for then there are more ſnares both within and without. When marriageable ſee that they
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:044758_0008_101F02329F8F8F30"/>have worthy perſons in their eye, of good life and good fame for piety and underſtanding: I need no wealth but ſufficiency; and beſure their love be dear, fervent, and mutual, that it may be happy for them: I chuſe not they ſhould be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to earthly covetous kindred, and of cities and towns of concourſe beware: The world is apt to ſtick cloſe to thoſe who have lived and got wealth there: A country life and eſtate I like beſt for my children: I prefer a decent manſion of an hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> before ten thouſand pounds in <hi>London</hi> or ſuch like place in a way of trade. In fine, my dear, endeavour to breed them dutiful to the Lord, and his bleſſed light, truth and grace in their hearts, who is their Creator, and his fear will grow up with them. "Teach a child (ſays the wiſe man) the way thou wilt have him to walk, and when he is old he will not forget it." Next, obedience to thee, their dear mother, and that not for wrath but for conſcience ſake: Liberal to the poor, pitiful to the miſerable, humble and kind to all: And may my God make thee a bleſſing, and give thee comfort in our dear children, and in age gather thee to the joy and bleſſedneſs of the juſt (where no death ſhall ſeparate us) for ever.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear children, that are the gifts and mercies of the God of your tender father, hear my counſel, and lay it up in your hearts; love it more than treaſure, and follow it, and you
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:044758_0009_101F023586C379D0"/>ſhall be bleſſed here and happy hereafter. In the firſt place, remember your Creator in the days of your youth; it was the glory of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the ſecond of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and how did God bleſs <hi>Joſiah</hi> becauſe he feared him in his youth! And ſo he did <hi>Jacob, Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Moſes.</hi> O! my dear children, remember, and fear, and ſerve him who made you, and gave you to me and your dear mother, that you may live to him and glorify him in your generation. To do this, in your youthful days ſeek after the Lord, that you may find him, remembering his great love in creating you, that you are not beaſts, plants or ſtones; but that he has kept you, and given you his grace within, and ſubſtance without, and provided plentifully for you. This remember in your youth, that you may be kept from the evil of the world, for in age it will be harder to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the temptations of it. Wherefore, my dear children, eſchew the appearance of evil, and love and cleave to that in your hearts that ſhews you evil from good, and tells you when you do amiſs, and reproves you for it. It is the light of Chriſt, that he has given you for your ſalvation. If you do this, and follow my counſel, God will bleſs you in this world, and give you an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in that which ſhall never have an end; for the light of Jeſus is of a purifying nature, it ſeaſons thoſe who love it and take heed to it, and never leaves ſuch till it has brought them to the city of God that has foundations. O! that ye may be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:044758_0010_101F0239B026B0D0"/>ſeaſoned with the gracious nature of it: Hide it in your hearts, and flee, my dear children, from all youthful luſts, the vain ſports, paſtimes and pleaſures of the world; redeeming the time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the days are evil. You are now beginning to live. What would ſome give for your time? Oh! I could have lived better were I as you in the flower of youth. Therefore love and fear the Lord, keep cloſe to meetings, and delight to wait on the Lord God of your father and mother among his deſpiſed people, as we have done; and count it your honour to be members of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and heirs of that living fellowſhip which is enjoyed among them, for the experience of which your father's ſoul bleſſeth the Lord for ever.</p>
            <p>Next, be obedient to your dear mother, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe virtue and good name is an honour to you, for ſhe hath been exceeded by none in her time for her plainneſs, integrity, induſtry, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, virtue and good underſtanding, qualities not uſual among women of her worldly condition and quality: Therefore honour and obey her, my dear children, as your mother and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's love and delight; nay, love her too, for ſhe loved your father with a deep and upright love, chuſing him before all her many ſuitors; and though ſhe be of a delicate conſtitution and noble ſpirit, yet ſhe deſcended to the utmoſt tenderneſs and care for you, performing the painfulleſt acts of ſervice to you in your infancy as a mother and a nurſe too. I charge you before the Lord,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:044758_0011_101F023C4FF4DE90"/>honour and obey, love and cheriſh your dear mother.</p>
            <p>Next, betake yourſelves to ſome honeſt induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious courſe of life, and that not of ſordid cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, but for example, and to avoid idleneſs. And if you change your condition and marry, chuſe with the knowledge and conſent of your mother if living, guardians or thoſe that have the charge of you: Mind neither beauty nor riches, but the fear of the Lord, and a ſweet and amiable diſpoſition, ſuch as you can love above all this world, and that may make your habitations pleaſant and deſirable to you; and being married, be tender, affectionate, patient and meek: Live in the fear of the Lord, and he will bleſs you and your offspring. Be ſure to live within compaſs; borrow not, neither be beholden to any: Ruin not yourſelves by kindneſs to others, for that exceeds the due bounds of friendſhip, neither will a true friend expect it: Small matters I heed not: Let your induſtry and parſimony go no further than for a ſufficiency for life, and to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for your children (and that in moderation) if the Lord gives you any. I charge you, help the poor and needy. Let the Lord have a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſhare of your income for the good of the poor both in our ſociety and others; for we are all his creatures; remembering, that he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord. Know well your incomings, and your outgoings may be better regulated. Love not money nor the world;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:044758_0012_101F023DDE3DBAD0"/>uſe them only, and they will ſerve you; but if you love them you ſerve them; which will debaſe your ſpirits, as well as offend the Lord. Pity the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed, and hold out a hand of help to them; it may be your caſe; and as you mete to others God will mete to you again. Be humble and gentle in your converſation, of few words I charge you, but always pertinent when you ſpeak; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out before you attempt to anſwer, and then ſpeaking as if you would perſuade not impoſe. Affront none, neither revenge the affronts that are done to you, but forgive and you ſhall be forgiven of your heavenly Father. In making friends conſider well firſt; and when you are fixed be true, not wavering by reports nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting in afflictions, for that becomes not the good and virtuous. Watch againſt anger, neither ſpeak nor act in it, for like drunkenneſs it makes a man a beaſt, and throws people into deſperate inconveniences. Avoid flatterers, for they are thieves in diſguiſe, their praiſe is coſtly, deſigning to get by thoſe they beſpeak; they are the worſt of creatures, they lie to flatter, and flatter to cheat; and which is worſe, if you believe them, you cheat yourſelves moſt dangerouſly; but the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, though poor, love, cheriſh and prefer. Remember <hi>David,</hi> who aſking the Lord, Who ſhall abide in thy tabernacle? Who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill? anſwers, He that walketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, worketh righteouſneſs, and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart, in whoſe eyes the vile perſon is contemned, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</p>

Next, my dear children, be temperate in all things; in your diet, for that is phyſic by preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it keeps, nay it makes people healthy and their generation ſound: This is excluſive of the ſpiritual advantage it brings. Be alſo plain in your apparel; keep out that luſt which reigns too much over ſome; let your virtues be your orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, remembering, life is more than meat, and the body than raiment. Let your furniture be ſimple and cheap; avoid pride, avarice and luxury. Read my No CROSS NO CROWN: There is inſtruction. Make your converſation with the moſt eminent for wiſdom and piety, and ſhun all wicked men, as you hope for the bleſſing of God, and the comfort of your father's living and dying prayers. Be ſure you ſpeak no evil of any, no not of the meaneſt, much leſs of your ſuperiors, as magiſtrates, guardians, tutors, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and elders in Chriſt. Be no buſy bodies, meddle not with other folk's matters but when in conſcience and duty preſt, for it procures trouble, and is ill manners, and very unſeemly to wiſe men. In your families remember <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> their integrity to the Lord, and do as you have them for your examples. Let the fear and ſervice of the living God be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in your houſes, and that plainneſs, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and moderation in all things, as becometh God's choſen people. And as I adviſe you, my beloved children, do you counſel yours, if God ſhould give you any; Yea I counſel and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:044758_0014_101F0244589FF868"/>them, as my poſterity, that they love and ſerve the Lord God with an upright heart, that he may bleſs you and yours from generation to generation. And as for you who are likely to be concerned in the government of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and my parts of <hi>Eaſt Jerſey,</hi> (eſpecially the firſt) I do charge you before the Lord God and his holy angels, that you be lowly, dillgent, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, fearing God, loving the people, and hating covetouſneſs. Let juſtice have its impartial courſe, and the law free paſſage; though to your loſs protect no man againſt it, for you are not above the law, but the law above you. Live therefore the lives yourſelves you would have the people live, and then you have right and boldneſs to puniſh the tranſgreſſor. Keep upon the ſquare, for God ſees you. Therefore do your duty; and be ſure you ſee with your own eyes, and hear with your own ears. Entertain no lurchers, cheriſh no informers for gain or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Uſe no tricks, fly to no devices to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or cover injuſtice; but let your hearts be upright before the Lord, truſting in him above the contrivances of men, and none ſhall be able to hurt or ſupplant. Oh! the Lord is a ſtrong God, and he can do whatſoever he pleaſes; and though men conſider it not, it is the Lord that rules and overrules in the kingdoms of men, and he builds up and pulls down. I your father am the man that can ſay, He that truſts in the Lord ſhall not be confounded, but God in due time
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:044758_0015_101F0246E32EE988"/>will make his enemies be at peace with him. If you thus behave yourſelves, and ſo become a terror to evil doers and a praiſe to them that do well, God, my God will be with you in wiſdom and a ſound mind, and make you bleſſed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his hand for the ſettlement of ſome of thoſe deſolate parts of the world, which my ſoul deſires above all worldly honours and riches, both for you that go and you that ſtay, you that govern and you that are governed, that in the end you may be gathered with me to the reſt of God.</p>
            <p>Finally, my dear children, love one another with a true endeared love, and your dear relations on both ſides; and take care to preſerve a tender affection in your children to each other, often marrying within themſelves, ſo as it be without the bounds forbidden in God's law; that ſo they may not (like the forgetting and unnatural world) grow out of kindred and as cold as ſtrangers, but, as becomes a truly natural and chriſtian ſtock, you and yours after you may live in the pure and fervent love of God towards one another, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh brethren in the ſpiritual and natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: So, my God, that has bleſſed me with his abundant mercies both of this and the other and better life, be with you all, guide you by his counſel, bleſs you, and bring you to his eternal glory; that you may ſhine, my dear children, in the firmament of God's power, with the bleſſed ſpirits of the juſt, that celeſtial family, praiſing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:044758_0016_101F02486F623FC0"/>and admiring him the God and Father of it for ever and ever. For there is no God like unto him, the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the God of the prophets, the apoſtles, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Jeſus, in whom I live for ever. So, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to my thrice dearly beloved wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Yours, as God pleaſeth, in that which no waters can quench, no time forget, nor diſtance wear away, but remains for ever.</p>
