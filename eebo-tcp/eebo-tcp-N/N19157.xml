            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <argument>
               <p>IN obedience to the Orders of the <hi>HOUSE</hi> of <hi>REPRESENTATIVES</hi> of the firſt and ſecond days of November laſt, the firſt directing the Secretary of the Treaſury to report to the Houſe ſuch information as he may have obtained, reſpecting any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which may have occurred in the execution of the Act "<hi>repealing, after the laſt day of June next, the duties heretofore laid upon diſtilled ſpirits imported from abroad, and laying others in their ſtead; and alſo upon ſpirits diſtilled within the United States, and for appropriating the ſame,</hi>" together with his opinion thereupon; the ſecond directing him to report to the Houſe whether any, and what alterations in favor of the ſpirits which ſhall be diſtilled from articles of the growth or produce of the United States, or from foreign articles, within the ſame, can, in his opinion, be made in the act for laying duties upon ſpirits diſtilled within the United States, conſiſtently with its main deſign, and with the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the public faith—the ſaid Secretary reſpectfully ſubmits the following</p>
            </argument>
            <head>REPORT.</head>
            <p>FROM the ſeveral petitions and memorials which have been referred to the Secretary, as well as from various repreſentations which have been made to him, it appears that objections have ariſen in different quarters againſt the above mentioned act; which have in ſome inſtances embarraſſed its execution, and inſpired a deſire of its being repealed, in others have induced a wiſh that alterations may be made in ſome of its proviſions.</p>
            <p>Theſe objections have reference to a ſuppoſed tendency of the act: 1ſt, To contravene the principles of liberty: 2dly, To injure morals: 3dly, To op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs by heavy and exceſſive penalties: 4thly, To injure induſtry and interfere with the buſineſs of diſtilling.</p>
            <p>As to the ſuppoſed tendency of the act to contravene the principles of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the diſcuſſions of the ſubject, which have had place in and out of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, ſuperſede the neceſſity of more than a few brief general obſervations.</p>
            <p>It is preſumed that a reviſion of the point cannot, in this reſpect, weaken the conviction which originally dictated the law.</p>
            <p>There can ſurely be nothing in the nature of an <hi>internal duty</hi> on a <hi>conſuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> commodity more incompatible with liberty, than in that of an external du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on a like commodity. A doctrine which aſſerts, that all duties of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kind (uſually denominated exciſes) are inconſiſtent with the genius of a free government, is too violent and too little reconcilable with the neceſſities of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to be true. It would tend to deprive the government of what is in moſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries a principal ſource of revenue, and by narrowing the diſtribution of taxes, would ſerve to oppreſs particular kinds of induſtry. It would throw in the firſt inſtance an undue proportion of the public burthen on the merchant and on the landholder.</p>
            <p>This is one of thoſe caſes in which names have an improper influence, and in which certain prepoſſeſſions exclude a due attention to facts.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the law under conſideration is complained of though free from the features, which have ſerved in other caſes to render laws on the ſame ſubject
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024925_0003_0FCD81176055F058"/>
exceptionable. And though the differences have been pointed out, they have not only been overlooked, but the very things, which have been ſtudiouſly avoided in the formation of the law, are charged upon it, and that too from quarters where its operation would from circumſtances have worn the leaſt appearance of them.</p>
            <p>It has been heretofore noticed, that the chief circumſtances, which in certain exciſe-laws have given occaſion to the charge of their being unfriendly to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, are not to be found in the act, which is the ſubject of this report; namely: 1ſt, A ſummary and diſcretionary juriſdiction in the exciſe officers contrary to the courſe of the common law, and in abridgment of the right of trial by jury: and 2dly, A general power in the ſame officers to ſearch and inſpect <hi>indiſcriminately</hi> all the houſes and buildings of the perſons engaged in the buſineſs to which the tax relates.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt particular, there is nothing in the act even to give colour to a charge of the kind againſt it, and accordingly it has not been brought. But as to the ſecond, a very <hi>different power</hi> has been miſtaken for it, and the act is complained of as conferring that very power of indiſcriminate ſearch and inſpection.</p>
            <p>The fact nevertheleſs is otherwiſe. An officer, under the act in queſtion, can inſpect or ſearch no houſe or building, or even <hi>apartment</hi> of any houſe or building, which has not been <hi>previouſly entered</hi> and <hi>marked</hi> by the poſſeſſor as a place uſed for diſtilling or keeping ſpirits.</p>
            <p>And even the power ſo qualified is only applicable to diſtilleries from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign materials, and in cities, towns and villages from domeſtic materials; that is only in caſes in which the law contemplates that the buſineſs is carried on upon ſuch a ſcale as effectually to ſeparate the <hi>diſtillery</hi> from the <hi>dwelling</hi> of the diſtiller. The diſtilleries ſcattered over the country, which form much the greateſt part of the whole, are in no degree ſubject to diſcretionary inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſearch.</p>
            <p>The true principle of the objection, which may be raiſed to a general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary power of inſpection and ſearch is, that the <hi>domicil</hi> or <hi>dwelling</hi> of a citizen ought to be free from vexatious inquiſition and intruſion.</p>
            <p>This principle cannot apply to a caſe in which it is put in his own power to ſeparate the place of his <hi>buſineſs</hi> from the place of his <hi>habitation,</hi> and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignating the former by viſible public marks, to avoid all intermeddling with the latter.</p>
            <p>A diſtillery ſeldom forms a part of the <hi>dwelling</hi> of its proprietor, and even where it does, it depends on him to direct and limit the power of viſiting and ſearch, by marking out the particular <hi>apartments</hi> which are ſo employed.</p>
            <p>But the requiſition upon the diſtiller to ſet marks on the building or apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he makes uſe of in his buſineſs, is one of the topics of complaint againſt the law. Such marks are repreſented as a diſhonorable badge. And thus a regulation, deſigned as much to conform with the feelings of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, as for the ſecurity of the revenue, is converted into matter of objection.</p>
            <p>It is not eaſy to conceive what maxim of liberty is violated, by requiring perſons, who carry on particular trades, which are made contributory to the revenue, to deſignate by public marks the places in which they are carried on.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024925_0004_0FCD815BAE491348"/>
There can certainly be nothing more harmleſs or leſs inconvenient, than ſuch a regulation. The thing itſelf is frequently done by perſons of various call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the information of cuſtomers; and why it ſhould become a hardſhip or grievance, if required for a public purpoſe, can with difficulty be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
            <p>The ſuppoſed tendency of the act to injure morals ſeems to have relation to the oaths, which are in a variety of caſes required, and which are liable to the objection, that they give occaſion to perjuries.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of requiring oaths, is whenever it occurs, matter of regret. It is certainly deſirable to avoid them as often and as far as poſſible. But it is more eaſy to deſire than to find a ſubſtitute. The requiring of them is not peculiar to the act in queſtion. They are a common appendage of revenue laws, and are among the uſual guards of thoſe laws, as they are of public and private rights in courts of juſtice. They conſtantly occur in jury trials, to which the citizens of the United States are ſo much and ſo juſtly attached. The ſame objection in different degrees lies againſt them in both caſes. Yet it is not perceivable how they can be diſpenſed with in either.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that <hi>both</hi> the kinds of ſecurity to the revenue, which are to be found in the act, the oaths of parties, and the inſpection of officers, are objected to. If they are both to be abandoned, it is not eaſy to imagine what ſecurity there can be for any ſpecies of revenue, which is to be collected from articles of conſumption.</p>
            <p>If precautions of this nature are inconſiſtent with liberty, and immoral, as there are very few indirect taxes, which can be collected without them, the conſequence muſt be, that the entire or almoſt entire weight of the public burthens muſt, in the firſt inſtance, fall upon fixed and viſible property, houſes and lands, a conſequence which would be found in experiment productive of great injuſtice and inequality, and ruinous to agriculture.</p>
            <p>It has been ſuggeſted by ſome diſtillers, that both the topics of complaint, which have been mentioned, might be obviated by a fixed rate of duty, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted according to a ratio compounded of the capacity of each ſtill, and the number and capacities of the ciſterns employed with it; but this and every ſimilar method are objected to by other diſtillers, as tending to great inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ariſing from unequal ſupplies of the material at different times and at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places, from the different methods of diſtillation practiſed by different diſtillers, and from the different degrees of activity in the buſineſs which ariſe from capitals more or leſs adequate.</p>
            <p>The reſult of an examination of this point appears to be, that every ſuch mode in caſes in which the buſineſs is carried on upon an extenſive ſcale, would neceſſarily be attended with conſiderable inequalities; and upon the whole, would be leſs ſatisfactory than the plan which has been adopted.</p>
            <p>It is proved by the fulleſt information, that, in regard to diſtilleries, which are rated in the law, according to the capacity of each ſtill, the alternative of paying according to the quantity actually diſtilled is viewed in many parts of the United States as eſſential to the equitable operation of the duty. And it is evident that ſuch an alternative could not be allowed, but upon the condition of the party rendering upon oath an account of the quantity of ſpirits diſtilled by him, without entirely defeating the duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:024925_0005_0FCD815EC6B8FE38"/>As to the charge that the penalties of the act are ſevere and oppreſſive, it is made in ſuch general terms, and ſo abſolutely without the ſpecification of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle particular, that it is difficult to imagine where it points.</p>
            <p>The Secretary however has carefully reviewed the proviſions of the act in this reſpect, and he is not able to diſcover any foundation for the charge.</p>
            <p>The penalties it inflicts are in their nature the ſame with thoſe which are common in revenue laws, and in their degree comparitively moderate.</p>
            <p>Pecuniary fines from fifty to five hundred dollars, and forfeiture of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in reſpect to which there has been a failure to comply with the law, are the ſevereſt penalties inflicted upon delinquent parties, except in a very few caſes: In two, a forfeiture of the value of the article is added to that of the article itſelf, and in ſome others a forfeiture of the ſhip or veſſel, and of the waggon or other inſtrument of conveyance, aſſiſtant in a breach of the law is likewiſe involved.</p>
            <p>Penalties like theſe for wilful and fraudulent breaches of an important law, cannot truly be deemed either unuſual or exceſſive. They are leſs than thoſe which ſecure the laws of impoſt, and as moderate as can promiſe ſecurity to any object of revenue, which is capable of being evaded.</p>
            <p>There appears to be but one proviſion in the law which admits of a queſtion, whether the penalty preſcribed may not partake of ſeverity. It is that which inflicts the pains of perjury on any perſon who ſhall be convicted of "wilfully taking a falſe oath or affirmation in any of the caſes in which oaths or affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are required by the act."</p>
            <p>Precedents in relation to this particular vary. In many of them the penalties are leſs ſevere, than for perjury in courts of juſtice; in others they are the ſame. The latter are generally of the lateſt date, and ſeem to have been the reſult of experience.</p>
            <p>The United States have in other caſes purſued the ſame principle as in the law in queſtion. And the practice is certainly founded on ſtrong reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The additional ſecurity which it gives to the revenue cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Many who would riſk pecuniary forfeitures and penalties would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the more diſgraceful puniſhment annexed to perjury.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There ſeems to be no ſolid diſtinction between one falſe oath in violation of law and right, and another falſe oath in violation of law and right. A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in the puniſhments of different ſpecies of falſe ſwearing is calculated to beget falſe opinions concerning the ſanctity of an oath; and by countenancing an impreſſion that a violation of it is leſs heinous in the caſes in which it is leſs puniſhed, it tends to impair in the mind that ſcrupulous veneration for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of an oath which ought always to prevail, and not only to facilitate a breach of it in the caſes which the laws have marked with leſs odium, but to prepare the mind for committing the crime in other caſes.</p>
            <p>So far is the law under conſideration from being chargeable with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſeverity, that there are to be found in it marks of more than common attention to prevent its operating ſeverely or oppreſſively.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:024925_0006_0FCD8160EACB75A8"/>The 43d ſection of the act contains a ſpecial proviſion (and one which it is believed is not to be found in any law enacted in this country prior to the preſent conſtitution of the United States) by which forfeitures and penalties incurred without an intention of fraud or wilful negligence may be mitigated or remitted.</p>
            <p>This mild and equitable proviſion is an effectual guard againſt ſuffering, or inconvenience in conſequence of undeſigned tranſgreſſions of the law.</p>
            <p>The 38th ſection contains a proviſion in favor of perſons, who though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent may accidentally ſuffer by ſeizures of their property (in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the revenue laws ſometimes unavoidably happens) which is perhaps entirely peculiar to the law under conſideration. Where there has even been a <hi>probable</hi> cauſe of ſeizure, ſufficient to acquit an officer, the jury are to aſſeſs whatever damages may have accrued, from any injury to the article ſeized, with an allowance for the detention of it at the rate of ſix per centum per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num of the value, which damages are to be paid out of the public treaſury.</p>
            <p>There are other proviſions of the act which mark the ſcrupulous attention of the government, to protect the parties concerned from inconvenience and injury, and which conſpire to vindicate the law from imputations of ſeverity or oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>The ſuppoſed tendency of the act to injure induſtry, and interfere with the buſineſs of diſtilling, is endeavored to be ſupported by ſome general and ſome ſpecial reaſons; both having relation to the effect of the duty upon the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the firſt kind affirm generally, that duties on home manufactures are impolitic, becauſe they tend to diſcourage them; that they are particularly ſo, when they are laid on articles manufactured from the produce of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, becauſe they have then the additional effect of injuring agriculture; that it is the general policy of nations to protect and promote their own manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; eſpecially thoſe which are wrought out of domeſtic materials; that the law in queſtion interferes with this policy.</p>
            <p>Obſervations of this kind admit of an eaſy anſwer. Duties on manufactures tend to diſcourage them or not, according to the circumſtances under which they are laid, and are impolitic or not, according to the ſame circumſtances. When a manufacture is in its infancy, it is impolitic to tax it; becauſe the tax would be both unproductive, and would add to the difficulties, which naturally impede the firſt attempts to eſtabliſh a new manufacture, ſo as to endanger its ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>But when a manufacture (as in the caſe of diſtilled ſpirits in the United States) is arrived at maturity, it is as fit an article of taxation as any other. No good reaſon can be aſſigned, why the conſumer of a domeſtic commodity ſhould not contribute ſomething to the public revenue, when the conſumer of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign commodity contributes to it largely. And as a general rule it is not to be diſputed, that duties on articles of conſumption are paid by the conſumers.</p>
            <p>To the manufacture itſelf the duty is no injury, if an equal duty be laid on the rival foreign article. And when a greater duty is laid upon the latter than upon the former, as in the preſent inſtance, the difference is a bounty on the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024925_0007_0FCD8161B2169DD8"/>
domeſtic article, and operates as an encouragement of the manufacture. The manufacturer can afford to ſell his fabric the cheaper, in proportion to that difference, and is ſo far enabled to underſell and ſupplant the dealer in the foreign article.</p>
            <p>The principle of the objection would tend to confine all taxes to imported articles, and would deprive the government of reſources which are indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a due proviſion for the public ſafety and welfare; contrary to the plain intention of the conſtitution, which gives expreſs power to employ thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources when neceſſary; a power which is found in all governments, and is eſſential to their efficiency, and even to their exiſtence.</p>
            <p>Duties on articles of internal production and manufacture form in every country the principal ſources of revenue. Thoſe on imported articles can only be carried to a certain extent, without defeating their object; by operating either as prohibitions; or as bounties upon ſmuggling. They are moreover in ſome degree temporary; for as the growth of manufactures diminiſhes the quantum of duty on imports, the public revenue, ceaſing to ariſe from that ſource, muſt be derived f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m articles which the national induſtry has ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for thoſe previouſly imported. If the government cannot then reſort to internal means for the additional ſupplies, which the exigencies of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion call for, it will be unable to perform its duty or even to preſerve its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. The community muſt be unprotected, and the ſocial compact be diſſolved.</p>
            <p>For the ſame reaſons, that a duty ought not to be laid on an article manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured out of the produce of the country (which is the point moſt inſiſted upon) it ought not to be laid upon the produce itſelf, nor conſequently upon the land, which is the inſtrument of that produce; becauſe taxes are laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>land</hi> as the <hi>fund</hi> out of which the <hi>income</hi> of the proprietor is drawn, or, in other words, <hi>on account of its produce.</hi> There ought, therefore, on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the objection, to be neither taxes on land nor on the produce of land, nor on articles manufactured from that produce. And if a nation ſhould be in a condition to ſupply itſelf, with its own manufactures, there could then be very little or no revenue, of courſe there muſt be a want of the eſſential means of national juſtice and national ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Poſitions like theſe, however well meant by thoſe who urge them, refute themſelves, becauſe they tend to the diſſolution of government, by rendering it incapable of providing for the objects for which it is inſtituted.</p>
            <p>However true the allegation that it is and ought to be the prevailing policy of nations to cheriſh their own manufactures, it is equally true that nations in general lay duties for the purpoſe of revenue on their own manufactures; and it is obvious to a demonſtration that it may be done without injury to them. The moſt ſucceſsful nations in manufactures have drawn the largeſt revenues from the moſt uſeful of them. It merits particular attention, that ardent ſpirits are an article, which has been generally deemed and made uſe of, as one of the fitteſt objects of revenue, and to an extent in other countries, which bears no compariſon with what has been done in the United States.</p>
            <p>The ſpecial reaſons alluded to are of different kinds.—</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is ſaid, that the act in queſtion by laying a ſmaller <hi>additional</hi> duty on foreign ſpirits, than the duty on home-made ſpirits, has a tendency to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the manufacture of the latter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:024925_0008_0FCD816337DD7BB0"/>This objection merits conſideration, and as far as it may appear to have foundation ought to be obviated.</p>
            <p>The point however ſeems not to have been viewed in all reſpects in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect light.</p>
            <p>Before the preſent conſtitution of the United States began to operate, the regulations of the different ſtates, reſpecting diſtilled ſpirits were very diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar. In ſome of them, duties were laid on foreign ſpirits only, in others, on domeſtic as well as foreign. The abſolute duty in the former inſtances, and the difference of duty in the latter, was upon an average, conſiderably leſs than the preſent difference in the duties on foreign and home-made ſpirits. If to this be added the effect of the uniform operation of the exiſting duties throughout the United States, it is eaſy to infer that the ſituation of our own diſtilleries is, in the main, much better, as far as they are affected by the laws, than it was previous to the paſſing of any act of the United States upon the ſubject. They have therefore upon the whole gained materially under the ſyſtem which has been purſued by the national government.</p>
            <p>The firſt law of the United States on this head laid a duty of no more than eight cents per gallon on thoſe of Jamaica proof. The ſecond encreaſed the duty on foreign ſpirits to twelve cents per gallon of the loweſt proof, and by certain gradations to fifteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof. The laſt act places the duty at twenty cents per gallon of the loweſt proof, and extends it by the like gradations to twenty-five cents per gallon of Jamaica proof, laying alſo a duty of eleven cents per gallon on home-made ſpirits diſtilled from foreign materials of the loweſt proof, with a like gradual extenſion to fifteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof; and a duty of nine cents per gallon on home-made ſpirits diſtilled from domeſtic materials of the loweſt proof, with the like gradual extenſion to thirteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof.</p>
            <p>If the tranſition had been immediate from the firſt to the laſt law, it could not have failed to have been conſidered as a change in favor of our own diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, as far as the rate of duty is concerned. The mean duty on <hi>foreign ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> by the firſt law was nine cents, by the laſt the mean <hi>extra</hi>-duty on foreign ſpirits is in fact about eleven cents, as it regards ſpirits diſtilled from <hi>foreign</hi> materials, and about thirteen, as it regards ſpirits diſtilled from <hi>domeſtic</hi> mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials. In making this computation it is to be adverted to, that the four firſt degrees of proof mentioned in the law correſpond with the different kinds of ſpirits uſually imported, while the generality of thoſe made in the United States are of the loweſt claſs of proof.</p>
            <p>Spirits from domeſtic materials derived a double advantage from the laſt law, that is, from the encreaſed rate of duty on foreign imported ſpirits, and from a higher rate of duty on home-made ſpirits of foreign materials.</p>
            <p>But the intervention of the ſecond law has ſerved to produce in ſome places a different impreſſion of the buſineſs, than would have happened without it. By a conſiderable addition to the duties on foreign ſpirits, without laying any thing on thoſe of home manufacture, it has ſerved to give to the laſt law the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of taking away a part of the advantages previouſly ſecured to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic diſtilleries. It ſeems to have been overlooked, that the ſecond act ought in reality to be reviewed only as an intermediate ſtep to the arrangement finally contemplated by the legiſlature; and that as part of a ſyſtem, it has upon the whole operated in favor of the national diſtilleries. The thing to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the ſubſtantial exiſting difference in favor of the home manufacture, as the law now ſtands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:024925_0009_0FCD8E4B169AD998"/>The advantage, indeed, to the diſtillation of ſpirits from the produce of the country ariſing from the difference between the duties on ſpirits diſtilled from foreign and thoſe diſtilled from domeſtic materials, is excluſively the work of the laſt act, and is an advantage which has not been properly appreciated by thoſe diſtillers of ſpirits from home produce, who have complained of the law, as hurtful to their manufacture.</p>
            <p>Cauſes entirely foreign to the law itſelf have alſo aſſiſted in producing miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. The approximation of the price of home-made ſpirits to that of foreign ſpirits, which has of late taken place, and which is attributed to the operation of the act in queſtion is in a great degree owing to the circumſtances, which have tended to raiſe the price of molaſſes in the Weſt-India market, and to an extra-importation of foreign ſpirits prior to the firſt of July laſt, to avoid the payment of the additional duty which then took place.</p>
            <p>It is ſtated in the petition from Salem, that previous to the laſt act, the price of domeſtic to foreign ſpirits was as 1<hi>ſ</hi>9 to 3<hi>ſ</hi>4, of the money of Maſſachuſetts, per gallon, and that ſince that act it has become as 3<hi>ſ</hi>3 to 4<hi>ſ</hi>2.</p>
            <p>It is evident that a riſe from 1<hi>ſ</hi>9 to 3<hi>ſ</hi>3 per gallon, which would be equal to 20 cents, is not to be attributed wholly to a duty of eleven cents. Indeed if there were a concurrence of no other cauſe, the inference would be very different from that intended to be drawn from the fact, for it would evince a profit gained to the diſtiller of more than eighty per cent. on the duty.</p>
            <p>It is however meant to be underſtood, that this approximation of prices occaſions a greater importation and conſumption of foreign, and a leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of domeſtic ſpirits than formerly. How far this may or may not be the caſe, the Secretary is not now able to ſay with preciſion; but no facts have come under his notice officially, which ſerve to authenticate the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. And it muſt be conſidered, as poſſible, that repreſentations of this kind, are rather the effect of appprehenſion than of experience. It would even be not unnatural, that a conſiderable enhancement of the prices of the foreign article ſhould have led to a greater conſumption of the domeſtic article, as the cheapeſt of the two, though dearer itſelf than formerly.</p>
            <p>But while there is ground to believe that the ſuggeſtions which have been made on this point are in many reſpects inaccurate and miſconceived, there are known circumſtances, which ſeem to render adviſeable, ſome greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the duties on foreign and on home-made ſpirits. Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances have been noticed in the report of the Secretary on the ſubject of manufactures, and an alteration has been propoſed by laying two cents in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditition upon imported ſpirits of the loweſt proof, with a proportional increaſe on the higher proofs, and by deducting one cent from the duty on the loweſt proof of home made ſpirits, with a proportional diminution in reſpect to the higher proofs.</p>
            <p>This alteration would bring the proportion of the duties nearly to the ſtandard, which the petitioner Hendrick Doyer, who appears likely to be well informed on the ſubject, repreſents as the proper one to enable the diſtillation of geneva to be carried on with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he ſame advantage as before the paſſing of the act. He obſerves that the duty on home-made geneva being 9 cents the additional duty on foreign ought to have been 12 cents. By the alteration propoſed, the proportion will be as 10 to 8 which is little different to that of 12 to 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:024925_0010_0FCD8E4C8A8E3D70"/>It is worthy of remark, that the ſame petitioner ſtates, that previous to the paſſing of the act, of which he complains, he "could ſell his geneva 16 ¼ per cent. under the price of Holland geneva, but that he cannot do it at preſent, and in future lower, than 14 per cent." If, as he alſo ſtates, the quality of his geneva be equal to that of Holland, and if his meaning be as it appears to be, that he can now afford to ſell his geneva lower by 14 per cent. than the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva of Holland, it will follow that the manufacture of that article is in a very thriving train, even under the preſent rate of duties. For a difference of 14 per cent. in the price is capable of giving a decided preference to the ſale of the domeſtic article.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is objected that the duty, by being laid in the firſt inſtance upon the diſtiller, inſtead of the conſumer, makes a larger capital neceſſary to carry on the buſineſs, and in this country, where capitals are not large, puts the national diſtillers under diſadvantages.</p>
            <p>But this inconvenience, as far as it has foundation, in the ſtate of things, is eſſentially obviated by the credits given. Where the duty is payable upon the quantity diſtilled, a credit is allowed, which cannot be leſs than ſix, and may extend to nine months. Where the duty is charged on the capacity of the ſtill, it is payable half yearly. Sufficient time is therefore allowed to raiſe the duty from the ſale of the article, which ſuperſedes the neceſſity of a greater capital. It is well known, that the article is one uſually ſold for caſh, or at ſhort credit. If theſe obſervations are not applicable to diſtilleries in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior country, the ſame may be ſaid in a great degree of the objection itſelf. The courſe of the buſineſs in that quarter, renders a conſiderable capital leſs neceſſary than elſewhere. The produce of the diſtillers own farm, or of the neighbouring farms, brought to be diſtilled upon ſhares or compenſations in the article itſelf, conſtitute the chief buſineſs of the diſtilleries in the remote parts of the country. In the comparatively few inſtances, in which they may be proſecuted as a regular buſineſs, upon a large ſcale, by force of capital, the obſervations which have been made will ſubſtantially apply.</p>
            <p>The collection of the duty from the diſtiller has, on the other hand, ſeveral advantages. It contributes to equality, by charging the article in the firſt ſtage of its progreſs, which diffuſes the duty among all claſſes alike. It the better ſecures the collection of the revenue, by confining the reſponſibility to a ſmaller number of perſons, and ſimplifying the proceſs. And it avoids the neceſſity of ſo great a number of officers as would be required in a more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſyſtem of collection, operating immediately upon purchaſers and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Beſides, that the latter plan would transfer whatever inconveniencies may be incident to the collection, from a ſmaller to a greater number of perſons.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is alledged that the inſpection of the officers is injurious to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of diſtilling, by laying open its ſecrets or myſteries.</p>
            <p>Different diſtillers, there is no doubt, practiſe, in certain reſpects, different methods in the courſe of their buſineſs, and have different degrees of ſkill. But it may well be doubted whether in a buſineſs ſo old and ſo much diffuſed as that of the diſtillation of ſpirits, there are, at this day, ſecrets of conſequence to the poſſeſſors.</p>
            <p>There will at leaſt be no hazard in taking it for granted, that none ſuch exiſt in regard to the diſtillation of rum from molaſſes or ſugar, or of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024925_0011_0FCD8E50523AA040"/>
from grain uſually called whiſkey, or of brandies from the fruits of this country. The caſes in which the allegations are made with moſt colour, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to geneva, and perhaps to certain cordials.</p>
            <p>It is probable, that the courſe of the buſineſs might and would always be ſuch, as in fact to involve no inconvenience on this ſcore. But as the contrary is affirmed, and as it is deſirable to obviate complaint as far as it can be done, conſiſtently with eſſential principles and objects, it may not be unadviſable to attempt a remedy.</p>
            <p>It is to be preſumed, that if any ſecrets exiſt, they relate to a primary proceſs, particularly the mixture of the ingredients; this, it is ſuppoſeable, cannot take a greater time each day, than two hours. If therefore, the officers of inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were enjoined to forbear their viſits to the part of the diſtillery commonly made uſe of for ſuch proceſs, during a ſpace not exceeding two hours each day to be notified by the diſtiller, there is ground to conclude that it would obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the objection.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The regulations for marking of caſks and veſſels, as well as houſes and buildings, alſo furniſh matter of complaint.</p>
            <p>This complaint, as it regards houſes and buildings, has been already adverted to: But there is a light in which it is made that has not yet been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that the requiring the doors of the apartments as well as the outer door of each building to be marked, impoſes unneceſſary trouble.</p>
            <p>When it is conſidered how little trouble or expence attends the execution of this proviſion, in the firſt inſtance, and that the marks once ſet will endure for a great length of time, the objection to it appears to be without weight.</p>
            <p>But the proviſion, as it relates to the apartments of buildings, has for its immediate object the convenience of the diſtillers themſelves. It is calculated to avoid the very evil of an indiſcriminate ſearch of their houſes and buildings, by enabling them to deſignate the <hi>particular apartments,</hi> which are employed for the purpoſes of their buſineſs, and to ſecure all others from inſpection and viſitation.</p>
            <p>The complaint, as it reſpects the marking of caſks and veſſels, has ſomewhat more foundation. It is repreſented (and upon careful enquiry appears to be true) that through long eſtabliſhed prejudice, home-made ſpirits of <hi>equal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> with foreign, if known to be home-made, will not command an equal price. This particularly applies to geneva.</p>
            <p>If the want of a diſtinction between foreign and home-made ſpirits were an occaſion of fraud upon conſumers, by impoſing a worſe for a better commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, it would be a reaſon for continuing it; but as far as ſuch a diſtinction gives operation to a mere prejudice, favorable to a foreign, and injurious to a domeſtic manufacture, it furniſhes a reaſon for aboliſhing it.</p>
            <p>Though time might be expected to remove the prejudice, the progreſs of the domeſtic manufacture, in the interval, might be materially checked.</p>
            <p>It appears therefore expedient to remove this ground of complaint by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſing the ſame marks and certificates, both for foreign and for home made geneva.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:024925_0012_0FCD8E51AF061218"/>Perhaps indeed it may not be unadviſeable to veſt ſomewhere a diſcretionary power to regulate the forms of certificates, which are to accompany, and the particular marks, which are to be ſet upon caſks and veſſels containing ſpirits, generally, as may be found convenient in practice.</p>
            <p>Another ſource of objection with regard to the marking of caſks is, that there is a general prohibition againſt defacing, or altering the marks, and a penalty upon doing it, which prevents the uſing of the ſame caſks more than once, and occaſions waſte, loſs and embarraſſment.</p>
            <p>It is conceived, that this prohibition does not extend to the effacing of old marks and placing of new ones by the officers of the revenue, or in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and by their authority. But as real inconveniencies would attend a contrary conſtruction, and there is ſome room for queſtion, it appears deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that all doubt ſhould be removed, by an explicit proviſion to enable the officer to efface old marks and ſubſtitute new ones, when caſks have been emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of their former contents, and are wanted for new uſe.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The requiſition to keep an account from day to day of the quantity of ſpirits diſtilled is repreſented both as a hardſhip and impoſſible to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with.</p>
            <p>But the Secretary is unable to perceive that it can juſtly be viewed either in the one or in the other light. The trouble of ſetting down in the evening the work of the day, in a book prepared for and furniſhed to the party muſt be inconſiderable, and the doing of it would even conduce to accuracy in buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The idea of impracticability muſt have ariſen from ſome miſconception. It ſeems to involve a ſuppoſition that ſomething is required different from the truth of the fact. Spirits diſtilled are uſually diſtinguiſhed into high wines, proof ſpirits, and low wines. It is certainly poſſible to expreſs each day the quantity of each kind produced, and where one kind is converted into another, to explain it by brief notes, ſhewing in proper columns the reſults in thoſe kinds of ſpirits which are ultimately prepared for ſale.</p>
            <p>A reviſion is now making of the forms at firſt tranſmitted, and it is not doubted that it will be eaſy to obviate the objection of impracticability.</p>
            <p>On full reflection the Secretary is of opinion, that the requiſition in this reſpect is a reaſonable one, and that it is of importance to the due collection of the revenue, eſpecially in thoſe caſes, where, by the alternative allowed in favor of country diſtilleries, the oath of a party is the only evidence of the quantity produced. It is uſeful in every ſuch caſe to give the utmoſt poſſible <hi>preciſion</hi> to the object which is to be atteſted.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. It is alledged as a hardſhip, that diſtillers are held reſponſible for the duties on ſpirits which are exported, till certain things difficult to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed are done, in order to entitle the exporter to the drawback.</p>
            <p>This is a miſapprehenſion. The drawback is at all events to be paid in ſix months, which is as early as the duty can become payable, and frequently earlier than it does become payable. And the government relies on the bond of the exporter for a fulfilment of the conditions upon which the drawback is allowed.</p>
            <p>An explanation to the ſeveral collectors of this point, which has taken place ſince the complaint appeared, will have removed the cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:024925_0013_0FCD8E5511E6EA90"/>The ſame explanation will obviate another objection founded on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the bond of the diſtiller and that of the exporter are for a like purpoſe. The latter is merely to ſecure the landing of the goods in a foreign country, and will often continue depending after every thing relative to duty and drawback has been liquidated and finiſhed.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It is an article of complaint that no drawback is allowed in caſe of ſhipwreck when ſpirits are ſent from one port to another in the United States.</p>
            <p>There does not occur any objection to a proviſion for making an allowance of that kind, which would tend to alleviate misfortune and give ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The neceſſity of twenty-four hours notice, in order to the benefit of drawback on the exportation of ſpirits, and the prohibition to remove them from a diſtillery after ſunſet, except in the preſence of an officer, are repreſented as embarraſſments to buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The length of notice required appears greater than is neceſſary. It is not perceived, that any inconvenience would ariſe, from reducing the time to ſix hours.</p>
            <p>But it is not conceived to be neceſſary or expedient to make an alteration in the laſt mentioned particular. The prohibition is of real conſequence to the ſecurity of the revenue. The courſe of buſineſs will readily adapt itſelf to it, and the preſence of an officer in extraordinary caſes will afford due accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. It is ſtated as a hardſhip, that there is no allowance for leakage and waſtage in the caſe of ſpirits ſhipped from one ſtate to another.</p>
            <p>The law for the collection of the duties on imports and tonnage allows two per cent. for leakage on ſpirits imported. A ſimilar allowance on home made ſpirits at the diſtillery, does not appear leſs proper.</p>
            <p n="10">X. It is mentioned as a grievance, that diſtillers are required to give bond <hi>with ſurety</hi> for the amount of the duties, and that the ſufficiency of the ſurety is made to depend on the diſcretion of the chief officer of inſpection.</p>
            <p>The requiring of ſureties can be no more a hardſhip on diſtillers than on importing merchants, and every other perſon to whom the public afford a credit. It is a natural conſequence of the credit allowed; and a very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable condition of the indulgence, which without this precaution might be imprudent, and injurious to the United States.</p>
            <p>The party has his option to avoid it by prompt payment o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the duty, and is even entitled to an abatement, which may be conſidered as a premium if he elects to do ſo.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond point, if ſureties are to be given, there muſt be ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on the part of the government to judge of their ſufficiency, otherwiſe the thing itſelf would be nugatory; and the diſcretion cannot be veſted more conveniently for the party than in the chief officer of inſpection for the ſurvey.</p>
            <p>A view has now been taken of moſt, if not of all, the objections of a general nature, which have appeared.</p>
            <p>Some few of a local complexion remain to be attended to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:024925_0014_0FCD8E5700C3B978"/>The repreſentation ſigned Edward Cook, chairman, as on behalf of the four moſt weſtern counties of Pennſylvania, ſtates, that the diſtance of that part of the country from a market for its produce leads to a neceſſity of diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the grain, which is raiſed, as a principal dependance of its inhabitants; which circumſtance and the ſcarcity of caſh combine to render the tax in queſtion unequal, oppreſſive, and particularly diſtreſſing to them.</p>
            <p>As to the circumſtance of equality, it may ſafely be affirmed to be impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to deviſe a tax which ſhall operate with exact equality upon every part of the community. Local and other circumſtances will inevitably create diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parities more or leſs great.</p>
            <p>Taxes on conſumable articles have upon the whole better pretenſions to equality than any other. If ſome of them fall more heavily on particular parts of the community, others of them are chiefly borne by other parts. And the reſult is an equalization of the burthen as far as is attainable. Of this claſs of taxes it is not eaſy to conceive one which can operate with greater equality than a tax on diſtilled ſpirits. There appears to be no article, as far as the information of the Secretary goes, which is an object of more equal conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughout the United States.</p>
            <p>In particular diſtricts a greater uſe of cyder may occaſion a ſmaller conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirits; but it will not be found on a cloſe examination that it makes a material difference. A greater or leſs uſe of ardent ſpirits, as far as it exiſts, ſeems to depend more on relative habits of ſobriety or intemperance than on any other cauſe.</p>
            <p>As far as habits of leſs moderation, in the uſe of diſtilled ſpirits, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce inequality any where, it would certainly not be a reaſon with the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either to repeal or leſſen a tax, which by rendering the article dearer might tend to reſtrain too free an indulgence of ſuch habits.</p>
            <p>It is certainly not obvious how this tax can operate particularly unequally upon the part of the country in queſtion. As a general rule it is a true one, that duties on articles of conſumption fall on the conſumers, by being added to the price of the commodity. This is illuſtrated in the preſent inſtance by facts. Previous to the law laying a duty on home made ſpirits the price of whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key was about thirty-eight cents; it is now about fifty-ſix cents. Other cauſes may have contributed in ſome degree to this effect, but it is evidently to be aſcribed chiefly to the duty.</p>
            <p>Unleſs, therefore, the inhabitants of the counties, which have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are greater conſumers of ſpirits, than thoſe of other parts of the country, they cannot pay a greater proportion of the tax. If they are, it is their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to become leſs ſo. It depends on themſelves by diminiſhing the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reſtore equality.</p>
            <p>The argument, that they are obliged to convert their grain into ſpirits in order to tranſportation to diſtant markets, does not prove the point alledged. The duty on all they ſend to thoſe markets will be paid by the purchaſers. They will ſtill pay only upon their own conſumption.</p>
            <p>As far as an advance is laid upon the duty, or as far as the difference o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> duty between whiſkey and other ſpirits tends to favour a greater conſumption of the latter, they as greater manufacturers of the article, ſuppoſing this fact to be as ſtated, will be proportionably benefited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:024925_0015_0FCD8E586A819398"/>The duty on home made ſpirits from domeſtic materials, if paid by the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, is nine cents. From the communications which have been received, ſince the paſſing of the act, it appears, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat paying the rate annexed to the capacity of the ſtill, and uſing great diligence, the duty may be in fact reduced to ſix cents per gallon. Let the average be taken at ſeven and a half cents which is probably higher than is really paid.</p>
            <p>Generally ſpeaking, then, for every gallon of whiſkey which is conſumed, the conſumer may be ſuppoſed to pay ſeven and a half cents; but for every gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon of ſpirits diſtilled from foreign materials the conſumer pays at leaſt eleven cents, and for every gallon of foreign ſpirits at leaſt twenty cents. The conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer therefore of foreign ſpirits pays nearly three times the duty, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumer of home made ſpirits from foreign materials nearly fifty per cent. more duty, on the ſame quantity, than the conſumer of ſpirits from domeſtic mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, excluſive of the greater price in both caſes, which is an additional charge upon each of the two firſt mentioned claſſes of conſumers.</p>
            <p>When it is conſidered that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>/21 parts of the whole quantity of ſpirits conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the United States are foreign, and 7/21 parts are of foreign materials, and that the inhabitants of the Atlantic and mid-land countries are the principal conſumers of theſe more highly taxed articles, it cannot be inferred, that the tax under conſideration bears particularly hard on the inhabitants of the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern country.</p>
            <p>This may ſerve as an exemplification of a general propoſition of material conſequence, namely, that, if the former deſcriptions of citizens are able from ſituation to obtain more for their produce that the latter, they contribute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally more to the revenue. Numerous other examples in confirmation of this might be adduced.</p>
            <p>As to the circumſtance of ſcarcity of money, as far as it can be ſuppoſed to have foundation, it is as much an objection to any other tax as to the one in queſtion. The weight of the tax is not certainly ſuch as to involve any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar difficulty. It is impoſſible to conceive that nine cents per gallon on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled ſpirits, which is ſtating it at the higheſt, can from the magnitude of the tax, diſtreſs any part of the country, which has an ability to pay taxes at all, enjoying too the unexampled advantage of a total exemption from taxes on houſes, lands or ſtock.</p>
            <p>The population of the United States being about 4,000,000 of perſons, and the quantity of ſpirits annually conſumed between ten and eleven millions of gallons, the yearly proportion to each family, if conſiſting of ſix perſons, which is a full ratio, would be about ſixteen gallons, the duty upon which would be leſs than <hi>one dollar and a half.</hi> The citizen who is able to maintain a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and who is the owner or occupier of a farm, cannot feel any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from ſo light a contribution, and the induſtrious poor, whether artiſans or labourers are uſually allowed ſpirits or an equivalent in addition to their wages.</p>
            <p>The Secretary has no evidence to ſatisfy his mind, that a real ſcarcity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney will be found, on experiment, a ſerious impediment to the payment of the tax any where. In the quarter where this complaint has particularly prevailed, the expenditures for the defence of the frontier would ſeem alone ſufficient to obviate it. To this it is anſwered, that the contractors for the ſupply of the army operate with goods and not with money: But this ſtill tends to keep at home whatever money finds its way there. Nor is it a fact, if the information of the Secretary be not materially erroneous, that the purchaſes of the contractors of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024925_0016_0FCD8E5E199CCB10"/>
flour, meat, &amp;c. are <hi>wholly</hi> with goods. But if they were, the Secretary can aver, that more money has in the courſe of the laſt year been ſent into the weſtern country from the treaſury, in ſpecie, and bank bills which anſwer the ſame purpoſe, for the pay of the troops and militia, and for quarter-maſters ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, than the whole amount of the tax in the four weſtern counties of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania and the diſtrict of Kentucky is likely to equal in four or five years. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar remittances are likely to be made in future.</p>
            <p>Hence the government itſelf furniſhes, and in all probability will continue to furniſh, the means of paying its own demands, with a ſurplus which will ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly foſter the induſtry of the parties concerned, if they avail themſelves of it under the guidance of a ſpirit of oeconomy and exertion.</p>
            <p>Whether there be no part of the United States, in which the objection of want of money may truly exiſt, in a degree to render the payment of the duty ſeriouſly diſtreſſing to the inhabitants, the Secretary is not able to pronounce. He can only expreſs his own doubt of the fact, and refer the matter to ſuch information as the members of any diſtrict ſo ſituated, may have it in their power to offer to the legiſlative body.</p>
            <p>Should the caſe appear to exiſt, it would involve the neceſſity of a meaſure in the abſtract very ineligible, that is the receipt of the duty in the article itſelf.</p>
            <p>If an alternative of this ſort were to be allowed, it would be proper to make it the duty of the party paying, <hi>to deliver the article at the place in each county</hi> where the office of inſpection is kept, and to regulate the price according to ſuch a ſtandard, as would induce a preference of paying in caſh except from a real impracticability of obtaining it.</p>
            <p>In regard to the petition from the diſtrict of Kentucky, after what has been ſaid with reference to other applications, it can only be neceſſary to obſerve that the exemption which is ſought by that petition, is rendered impracticable by an expreſs proviſion of the conſtitution, which declares, that all duties, impoſts and exciſes ſhall be uniform throughout the United States.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of the foregoing examination of the objections which have been made to the law, ſome alterations have been ſubmitted for the purpoſe of removing a part of them. The Secretary will now proceed to ſubmit ſuch farther alterations as appear to him adviſeable, ariſing either from the ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the officers of the revenue or from his own reflections.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It appears expedient to alter the diſtinction reſpecting diſtilleries from domeſtic materials in cities, towns and villages, ſo as to confine it to one or more ſtills worked at the ſame diſtillery, the capacity or capacities of which together do not fall ſhort of four hundred gallons.</p>
            <p>The effectual execution of the preſent proviſions reſpecting diſtilleries from home materials in cities, towns and villages, would occaſion an inconvenient multiplication of officers, and would in too great a degree exhauſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the duty in the expence of collection. It is alſo probable that the alteration ſuggeſted would alſo conduce to public ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The preſent proviſions concerning the entering of ſtills are found by experience not to be adequate, and in ſome inſtances not convenient.</p>
            <p>It appears adviſeable, that there ſhall be one office of inſpection for each county, with authority to the ſuperviſor to eſtabliſh more than one, if he ſhall judge it neceſſary for the accommodation of the inhabitants; and that every diſtiller or perſon having or keeping a ſtill, ſhall be required to make entry of the ſame, at ſome office of inſpection for the county, within a certain determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024925_0017_0FCD8E5F2D2B5EA8"/>
period in each year. It will be proper alſo to enjoin upon every perſon, who reſiding within the county, ſhall procure a ſtill, or who removing into a county, ſhall bring into it a ſtill, within twenty days after ſuch procuring or removal, and before he or ſhe begins to uſe the ſtill, to make entry at the office of inſpection. Every entry beſides deſcribing the ſtill, ſhould ſpecify in whoſe poſſeſſion it is, and the purpoſe for which it is intended, as whether for ſale or for uſe in diſtilling; and in the caſe of a removal of the perſon from another place into the county, ſhall ſpecify the place from which the ſtill ſhall have been brought. A forfeiture of the ſtill ought in every caſe in which an entry is required, to attend an omiſſion to enter.</p>
            <p>This regulation by ſimplifying the buſineſs of entering ſtills, would render it eaſier to comprehend and comply with what is required, would furniſh the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers with a better rule for aſcertaining delinquencies, and, by avoiding to them a conſiderable degree of unneceſſary trouble will facilitate the retaining of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per characters in the offices of collectors.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is repreſented that difficulties have in ſome inſtances ariſen concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſons reſponſible for the duty. The apparent, not being always the real proprietor, an opportunity for colluſion is afforded; and without colluſion the uncertainty is ſtated as a ſource of embarraſſment.</p>
            <p>It alſo ſometimes happens, that certain itinerant perſons without property, complying with the preliminary requiſitions of the law as to entry, &amp;c. erect and work ſtills for a time, and before a half yearly period of payment arrives, remove and evade the duty.</p>
            <p>It would tend to remedy theſe inconveniences, if poſſeſſors and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of ſtills were made jointly and ſeverally liable, and if the duty were made a <hi>ſpecific lieu</hi> on the ſtill itſelf; if alſo the proprietor of the land, upon which any ſtill may be worked ſhould be made anſwerable for the duty, except where it is worked by a lawful and bona fide tenant of the land of an eſtate not leſs than for a term of one year, or unleſs ſuch proprietor can make it appear, that the poſſeſſor of the ſtill was during the whole time without his privity or connivance an intruder or treſpaſſer on the land; and if in the laſt place any diſtiller about to remove from the diviſion in which he is, ſhould be required previous to ſuch removal to pay the tax for the year, deducting any prior payments, or give bond with approved ſurety, conditioned for the payment of the full ſum for which he or ſhe ſhould be legally accountable to the end of the year, to the collector of the diviſion to which the removal ſhall be, rendering proof thereof under the hand of the ſaid collector, within ſix months after the expiration of the year.</p>
            <p>As well with a view to the forfeiture of the ſtills for non-entry, as to give ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to a <hi>ſpecific lieu</hi> of the duty (if either or both of theſe proviſions ſhould be deemed eligible) it will be neceſſary to enjoin it upon the officers of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to identify by proper marks the ſeveral ſtills which ſhall have been entered with them.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The exemptions granted to ſtills of the capacity of fifty gallons and under, by the 36th ſection of the law, appear from experience to require revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Tending to produce inequality, as well as to fruſtrate the revenue, they have excited complaint. It appears at leaſt adviſeable, that the obligation to enter, as connected with that <hi>of paying duty,</hi> ſhould extend to ſtills of all dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and that it ſhould be enforced in every caſe by the ſame penalty.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The 28th ſection of the act makes proviſion for the ſeizure of ſpirits unaccompanied with marks and certificates in the caſes in which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; but as they are required only in certain caſes, and there is no method of diſtinguiſhing the ſpirits, in reſpect to which they are neceſſary, from thoſe in reſpect to which they are not neceſſary, the proviſion becomes nugatory,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024925_0018_0FCD8E60AB816F98"/>
becauſe an attempt to enforce it would be oppreſſive. Hence not only a great ſecurity for the due execution of the law is loſt, but ſeizures very diſtreſſing to unoffending individuals muſt happen notwithſtanding great precaution to avoid them.</p>
            <p>It would be, in the opinion of the Secretary of great importance to provide, that all ſpirits whatſoever, in caſks or veſſels of the capacity of twenty gallons and upwards ſhould be marked and certified, on pain of ſeizure and forfeiture, making it the duty of the officers to furniſh the requiſite certificates <hi>gratis</hi> to diſtillers and dealers in all caſes, in which the law ſhall have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with.</p>
            <p>In thoſe caſes in which an occaſion at recurrence to the officers for certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates might be inconvenient, blanks may be furniſhed to be accounted for. And it may be left to the parties themſelves in the like caſes to mark their own caſks or veſſels in ſome ſimple manner to be defined in the law. Theſe caſes may be deſignated generally. They will principally relate to dealers, who in the courſe of their buſineſs draw off ſpirits from larger to ſmaller caſks, and to diſtillers who pay according to the capacities of their ſtills.</p>
            <p>As a part of a regulation of this ſort it will be neceſſary to require, that within a certain period, ſufficiently long to admit of time to know and comply with the proviſion, entry ſhall be made, by all dealers and diſtillers, of all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in their reſpective poſſeſſions, which ſhall not have been previouſly marked and certified according to law, in order that they may be marked and certified as old ſtock.</p>
            <p>The regulations here propoſed though productive of ſome trouble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience in the outſet, will be afterwards a ſecurity both to individuals and to the revenue.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. At preſent ſpirits may not be imported from abroad in caſks of leſs capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city than fifty gallons. The ſize of theſe caſks is ſmaller than is deſireable, ſo far as the ſecurity of the revenue is concerned, and there has not occurred any good objection to confining the importation to larger caſks, that is to ſay, to caſks of not leſs than ninety gallons. Certainly as far as reſpects rum from the Weſt-Indies it may be done without inconvenience, being conformable to the general courſe of buſineſs. The reſult of examination is that the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to this particular in favor of gin may be aboliſhed. Should any alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation on this ſubject take place it ought not to begin to operate till after the expiration of a year.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. There is ground to ſuppoſe, that the allowance of drawback without any limitation as to quantity has been abuſed. It is ſubmitted that none be made on any leſs quantity than one hundred and fifty gallons.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. There is danger that facility may be given to illicit importations, by making uſe of caſks which have been once regularly marked, and the certificates which have been iſſued with them to cover other ſpirits than thoſe originally contained in ſuch caſks. Appearances which countenance ſuſpicion on this point have been the ſubjects of repreſentation from ſeveral quarters.</p>
            <p>The danger may be obviated by prohibiting the importation in ſuch marked caſks on pain of forfeiture, both of the ſpirits and of any ſhip or veſſel in which they may be brought. A prohibition of this ſort does not appear liable to any good objection.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The duty of ſixty cents per gallon of the capacity of a ſtill was founded upon a computation, that a ſtill of any given dimenſions worked <hi>four</hi> months in the year, which is the uſual period of country diſtillation, would yield a quantity of ſpirits which at the rate of nine cents per gallon, would correſpond with ſixty cents per gallon of the capacity of the ſtill. It will deſerve conſideration,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024925_0019_0FCD8E635FDD4D88"/>
whether it will not be expedient to give an option to country diſtillers, at the annual entry of their ſtills, to take out a licence for any portion of the year, which they may reſpectively think fit, and to pay at the rate of 12 ½ cents per gallon of the capacity, per month, during ſuch period. This to ſtand in lieu of the alternative of paying by the gallon diſtilled. It would obviate in this caſe the neceſſity of accounting upon oath, and would leave it in the power of each diſtiller to cover the preciſe time he meant to work his ſtill with a licence, and to pay for that time only. A ſtrict prohibition to diſtil at any other time, than that for which the licence was given, would be of courſe neceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the regulation as far as regarded any ſuch licenſed diſtiller.</p>
            <p>The only remaining points which have occurred, as proper to be ſubmitted to the conſideration of the legiſlature, reſpects the officers of the revenue.</p>
            <p>It is repreſented, that in ſome inſtances, from the ill humour of individuals, the officers have experienced much embarraſſment, in reſpect to the filling of ſtills with water, to aſcertain their capacity, which upon examination is found the moſt ſimple and practicable mode. The proprietors have in ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not only refuſed to aid the officers, but have even put out of their way the means by which the filling might be conveniently accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>It would conduce to the eaſy execution of the law, and to the very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant purpoſe of retaining and procuring reſpectable characters as collectors, if the proprietors and poſſeſſors of ſtills were required to aid them in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this part of their duty, or to pay a certain ſum as a compenſation for the doing of it.</p>
            <p>The limits aſſigned in the law reſpecting compenſations are found in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice eſſentially inadequate to the object.</p>
            <p>This is ſo far the caſe, that it becomes the duty of the Secretary to ſtate, that greater latitude in this particular is <hi>indiſpenſible to the effectual execution of the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the moſt productive DIVISIONS the commiſſions of the collectors afford but a moderate compenſation. In the greateſt part of THEM the compenſation is glaringly diſproportioned to the ſervice, in many of them it falls materially ſhort of the expence of the officer.</p>
            <p>It is believed, that in no country whatever has the collection of a ſimilar duty been effected within the limit aſſigned. Applying in the United States to a <hi>ſingle</hi> article only, and yielding conſequently a leſs total product than where many articles are comprehended, the expence of collection muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be proportionally greater.</p>
            <p>It appears to the Secretary that 7 ½ per cent. of the total product of the duties on diſtilled ſpirits, foreign as well as domeſtic, and not leſs will ſuffice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the compenſations to officers and other expences incidental to the collection of the duty. This is to be underſtood as ſupplemental to the preſent cuſtom-houſe expences.</p>
            <p>It is unneceſſary to urge to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, how eſſential it muſt be to the execution of the law in a manner effectual to the purpoſes of the government and ſatisfactory to the community, to ſecure by competent, though moderate rewards, the <hi>diligent ſervices</hi> of reſpectable and truſt-worthy characters.</p>
