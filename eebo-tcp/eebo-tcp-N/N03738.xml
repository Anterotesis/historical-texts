            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is necessary here to mention two Points of no small Consequence to the Articles, which were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the House with dividing, and of which no mention is made in the Journals, the first was a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sir <hi>Richard Everard's</hi> to the House, seconded by Mr. <hi>Swann,</hi> that the Evidence which should be produced against the Chief Justice might be taken in writing, which was bore down by so great a Majority, that the Gentlemen who proposed the Question did not think proper to call for a Division upon it, the other was a Motion made to alter the Method of voting in the House, that upon any Question, the Names of the Members for and against the Question
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004582_0031_100D69F20F6DEBB0"/>
might be taken in writing, which was also refused by the House; these two Motions being determined as aforesaid, the Gentlemen who were for the Articles were under a necessity to take Minutes of the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Evidences themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is from those Minutes that the Matters of fact in this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as far as relates to the Articles are taken, and we assure the World that they are as near as may be exact as they were given in Testimoney to the House.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cted against that Motion, and desired that the House would not give their Sense of the Evidences to each Articles seperately in it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Course, but that they would suspend any Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination whatsoever until they had gone thro' the whole Charge. This produced a warm D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr. Speaker could have no other view in this Proposal of his but only to perplex the Understandings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That was
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004582_0032_100D31AEB1BB2F98"/>
the Question, and many of the Members who voted against the Articles afterwards owned that many of the Articles were sufficiently proved, but that the whole were not so well proved as might be expected in order to a Conviction: the small allowance of Time laid insuperable Difficulties upon the Gentlemen on the side of the Articles. Whether those Articles to which no Proof was produced, or which were not fully prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
