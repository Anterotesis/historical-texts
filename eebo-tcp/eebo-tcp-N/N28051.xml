            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BY your ſpecial deſire have I appeared among you this day, to aſſiſt in paying funeral honors to our deceaſed illuſtrious General GEORGE WASHINGTON! For whoſe loſs not only the Fraternity in general, with every individual member of this <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>venerable</hi> order muſt feel the moſt profound grief; but for whom a NATION weeps.—A loſs, of which we are ſenſible— lively ſenſible—but which to repair we are totally unable. All in our power to do, is, to recall to our minds all the <hi>good</hi> a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful GOD has beſtowed through HIM on our Nation; and to tell <hi>our</hi> children, that they may relate to <hi>their</hi> children the imitable character of WASHINGTON THE GREAT, in whom we have found talents very <hi>rarely</hi> united, abilities only for <hi>us</hi> united: diſplaying HIM on the reſplendent canopy of the ſhining hoſts of ancient and modern Sages, Legiſlators and Heroes to be a Star of the firſt magnitude.</p>
            <p>To honor with ſolemn ceremonies the names and the lives of great national Benefactors, has, notwithſtanding the <hi>illiberal</hi> epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets of Envy and Malice, ever been deemed one of the firſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and to commemorate deeds of high deſert, has been the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme; delight of Nations.

The Lord had wrought great glory by <hi>them</hi> through his great power from the beginning.

               </gap> Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, he mentioned Moſes, ſaying: <q>And the Lord brought out of Jacob a merciful man, which found favor in the ſight of all fleſh, even Moſes, beloved of God and Men, whoſe <hi>memorial is bleſſed.</hi> He made him like to the glorious ſaints and <hi>magnified him,</hi> ſo that his enemies ſtood in fear of him.

               </gap>heſe illuſtrious Chiefs <hi>are</hi> bleſſed.—There is an Analogy—and, this Analogy <hi>is</hi> peculiarly ſtriking.—</p>
            <p>THE ſtriking Analogy in the memorial of MOSES, the firſt Conductor of the Jewiſh Nation, and in the memorial of Lieut. General GEORGE WASHINGTON, the firſt Leader and Father of the American Nation: the <hi>One,</hi> as recorded in Sacred Writ ——the <hi>Other</hi> engraven as an evidence in the hearts of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans in general and his Maſonic Brethren in particular, is therefore our preſent theme.</p>
            <p>THIS Analogy we undertake to conſider:
<list>
                  <item>I. IN a remote manner.</item>
                  <item>II. As more proximate.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. THE diſtant Analogy between Moſes and Gen. WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON is worthy our conſideration. Firſt, with reſpect to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive countries and fatality of their progenitors.</p>
            <p>MOSES, born in Goſhen, one of the beſt provinces under Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian government, renowned for its fertility and richneſs of ſoil; from an honorable lineage, whoſe Anceſtors in a particular cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant with the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> moved thither by invitation and divine confirmation, to ſecure themſelves againſt the devaſtation of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and of which family, Levi, ſon to Patriarch Jacob, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037379_0006_100CF8B39ACD1D50"/>
great-grand father to Moſes is noted for his reſolution in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair with Shechem.</p>
            <p>GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON, born in the ci-devant Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh colony of Virginia, well known for its profuſion and wealth, from a reſpectable parentage, who emigrated from Britain, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not ſo much driven by neceſſity, like many of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts, as from views to enjoy on this ſide the Atlantic, greater advantages both civil and religious. Be this as it will, we may reſt aſſured that divine Providence, having once decreed for wiſe and happy purpoſes this extenſive Continent to be an aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, could inſpire with ſufficient motives and produce cauſes for emigration in the minds of the <hi>needy,</hi> or the <hi>wealthy,</hi> or the <hi>oppreſſed.</hi> However, it may not be amiſs here to remark: that both our Conductors drew their firſt breath in countries, where their Anceſtors firſt enjoyed perfect rational liberty and every bleſſing connected therewith, in which countries tyranny and oppreſſion did afterwards become to them inſupportable.</p>
            <p>THIS remote Analogy we conſider farther with regard to their Education. It often happens, that whom the Lord deſignates for great purpoſes, he will have previouſly fitted, and not ſuffer him to be deſtitute of proper means. But it may alſo be aſſerted, that many a man could have become more uſeful to himſelf and his country, had his natural talents properly and timely <hi>been</hi> cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and <hi>not</hi> remained in a total ſtate of nature by the <hi>inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>avarice</hi> of parents and guardians.—Moſes, we know, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his education by a particular providence at Court, and became learned not only in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians and all the arts and ſciences peculiar to them, but alſo in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the SUPREME BEING, which made him ſo mighty in words and fitted him to become the Deliverer of his Brethren.— Our illuſtrious Chief alſo had received an education, which not only well acquainted him with the ſituation, extent, laws, gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, liberty and importance of his country with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and diſadvantages ariſing from a colonial dependence on
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037379_0007_100CF8B649765918"/>
Great-Britain, and which prepared him for a Warrior, a Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and what is more, a Father of regenerated America——but which, early and laſtingly impreſſed on his mind the truth of that religion, which by a <hi>faithful</hi> obſervance of its divine precepts, <hi>"is profitable unto</hi> all <hi>things, and has the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE parity of their firſt heroic exploits is laſtly to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this remote analogy, which proved to be an <hi>indication</hi> of a happy iſſue favorable to their reſpective Nations. Moſes, at the age of forty, partly by natural affection and inclination, that he might learn the ſtate of his Brethren and help them as occaſion ſhould offer itſelf; and partly by divine impulſe, and with deſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that he might give ſome manifeſtation to them, that he was raiſed and ſent of God to deliver them, ſmote an Egyptian, who did oppreſs a Hebrew, one of his Brethren. But this he did not in a <hi>malicious anger,</hi> but by his <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>ſpecial vocation</hi> to be the RULER and DELIVERER of Iſrael. Which call of his, howſoever manifeſted, whether by his father, as Joſephus ſaith, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to himſelf, was evident to his <hi>own</hi> conſcience, and this he gave as a ſignal to make <hi>it</hi> evident to his Brethren, but, <hi>they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not.</hi>—Now, beloved Hearers and Maſonic Brethren! Turn with me your minds to the environs of the Ohio, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the firſt heroic exploit of our deceaſed General: when not yet in the meridian of his life, and in the ſervice of his country, he ſignalized his intrepidity and ſkill by reſcuing the remains of an ambuſhed and defeated army, headed by the <hi>unfortunate</hi> Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dok, when preſſed by the conquering ſavages and <hi>their</hi> as ſavage Allies. Did he not then diſplay ſuch military talents and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in his gallant manoeuvring, as drew deſervedly the attention even of OLD WARRIORS on Him, who was then in a comparative view but a Novice in the art? Was not this the <hi>earneſt</hi> of his bravery and heroiſm given to his country, which afterwards was fully diſplayed in ſo many brilliant actions for its ſalvation——and which, after an elapſe of near a ſcore of years, was not extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the memory of <hi>that firſt aſſembly of Patriots,</hi> who conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>WITHOUT pointing particularly at the exterior ſimilitude in their ſtatures, the one poſſeſſed of conſiderable ſtoutneſs of body with an auguſt and graceful countenance, the other appearing not leſs majeſtic in his external form and dignified in his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhall turn to the nearer reſemblance of their SUBLIME CHARACTER, which here juſtly takes the lead.</p>
            <p>SACRED Writ informs us, that Moſes, inſtructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, grew in faith and in piety to him. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion truly exerciſed and combined with natural talents, ſhewed its benign influence over Moſes.

            <p>GENERAL WASHINGTON, who had faith in God and was pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. HE, well inſtructed in the chriſtian ſyſtem, clave to it with all his heart. HE was aware of the neceſſity of divine ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not careleſs or above uſing them repeatedly in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Lord. HE <hi>was pious.</hi> Brethren of <hi>Maſonic Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der!</hi> HEARERS! <hi>"He that hath an ear among you let him hear,"</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and take it to heart: our juſtly lamented WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, the HERO—the LEGISLATOR—the FATHER of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was a CHRISTIAN, and—was PIOUS!!! A rare example in the <hi>preſent</hi> day—eſpecially among the <hi>great</hi> and the <hi>ſtrong</hi> of the earth, when pure revealed religion and the ſacred duties enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, <hi>are</hi> ridiculed and deemed as unbecoming good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—as ſuperfluous for preſent and future happineſs. His pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was, as it always is, the never failing fountain from which a ſtream of other eſſential virtues flowed: Juſtice and Humanity, Temperance and Charity, Mercy and Humility, Sincerity with Uniformity, Modeſty and Stedfaſtneſs <hi>were</hi> the iſſue. He poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed a mind clear and penetrating; a judgment ſound and ſtrong; a mien dignified and commanding; for deliberation, calmneſs and temper; in maturely formed reſolutions, firmneſs and perſeverance invincible; in the execution of the great charge his country had commiſſioned him with, ſtrict and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; acting for the proſperity of America with incorruptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and unwearied patriotiſm. He was merciful in the full ſenſe of the word, commiſerating with his fellow-ſoldiers, ſparing the effuſion of human blood both in war and in ſedition—for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037379_0010_100CF8BCA39D9590"/>
with his adverſaries—not given to revenge himſelf. And, who <hi>can</hi> accuſe him juſtly of ambition, or of ſelfiſhneſs, ſo common to Conquerors? Not even Calumny itſelf! He avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed honors <hi>juſtly</hi> beſtowed on him, rather than ſought them. At the return of peace he quieted the minds of the diſcontented and the factious—ſurrendered his authority into the hands from which he had received it; examplarily teaching a beholding world, that true greatneſs is found <hi>only</hi> in humility and ſelf denial. For, the ſatisfaction he had in the ſatisfaction of his fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens with his conduct, was the greateſt emolument and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation he wiſhed to receive from a grateful country, for <hi>all</hi> his ſervices during the conteſt. <note n="*" place="bottom">The greatneſs of his diſintereſted mind has ſince his death diſplayed itſelf more perſpicuous, not only to an admiring world, but to his mourning country, in a ſection of his laſt will, wherein we find that he had declined to accept of a handſome preſent, voted him by the Legiſlature of Virginia, in 1785, as an evidence of its approbation of the ſervices he had rendered the public during the revolution, amounting to the value of about £ 7250 ſterling, becauſe inconſiſtent with a principle he had <hi>adopted</hi> and had <hi>never departed</hi> from—namely: <hi>not to receive peculiar compenſation for any ſervices he could render his country in its arduous ſtruggle with Great Britain for its rights;</hi> and becauſe he had <hi>evaded ſimilar propoſitions</hi> from other States in the Union—unleſs the ſaid Legiſlature ſhould permit him to appropriate the ſaid intereſt to <hi>public uſes.</hi> Of which intereſt he has bequeathed £.5000 ſterling as a fund to the eſtabliſhment of a UNIVERSITY in a central part of the United States, in order to cultivate the <hi>arts</hi> and <hi>ſciences,</hi> and to remove local attachments and ſtate prejudices from our national coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, which too often become pregnant with miſchievous conſequences.</note> And ſince, he abandoned arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power and the ſeducing principle of ſelf intereſt. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample herein furniſhes an inſtructive and laſting monument to all, who in future ſhall be called to the command of our army, or fill the preſidential chair. In the humble and endearing ſcenes of private life, he was not leſs imitable: He was condeſcending to his equals—kind to his inferiors—tender to her, who was the partner of his love; in ſhort, his public virtues were illuminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the beams of his private character.</p>
            <p>THESE characteriſtic qualities as an effluxion from piety, were <hi>not</hi> beſtowed and ſupported by the gracious Father of lights to remain unemployed. For, God who gives to ſome men an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037379_0011_100CF8C075DC5868"/>
ſhare of talents, alſo makes opportunity for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play to HIS glory and the common good. As it was with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer of Iſrael, ſo we find it to be the caſe with the Deliverer of America. And this leads us next to conſider: This proximate analogy in their official actions, whereby they were ſignalized and made glorious.</p>
            <p>THE ſon of Sirach's Eulogy on Moſes enumerates ſeveral, and ſome can moſt eaſily be applied to <hi>our illuſtrious Chief</hi> by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt capacity. Time and ſeaſon will not permit us to dwell on theſe intereſting ſubjects, therefore we ſhall only remark on them as in paſſing by. On the whole we have to ſtate, that theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial great actions of Moſes, <hi>were,</hi> according to ſacred record, the effect of his Faith in God, and in the ſurety of his vocation and appointment from God, who, not without <hi>great reaſon</hi> had revealed himſelf to him, as the God of Abraham, of Iſaac and of Jacob. Which faith under many and great oppoſitions was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly exerciſed in obedience to this God, by the uſe of the preſcribed means, which, though ſeemingly weak and inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate for carnal reaſon, were nevertheleſs ſufficient for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the divine purpoſes. Now, as the deliverance of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>through Moſes,</hi> ſo was the deliverance of America, an act of <hi>faith</hi> accompanied with the prudent uſe of means, in <hi>our</hi> belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed GENERAL, whereby he in the courſe of our revolutionary war, by being frequently placed in the moſt perplexed ſituation and embarraſſing circumſtances—betrayed by ſome and deſerted by others; expoſed to every difficulty originating from ſcanty reſources, unequipped and undiſciplined troops and a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foe; yet, with a great and unſhaken mind ſurmounting the whole, was magnified and made glorious. We ſhall, in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting this ſtriking ſimilarity, only <hi>touch</hi> facts.</p>
            <p>THE Lord, ſaid the ſon of Sirach, magnified Moſes, ſo, that his enemies ſtood in fear of him. The Lord alſo magnified his ſervant WASHINGTON in the ſame manner. <hi>The heights near Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where his preſence inſpired firmneſs to an undiſciplined
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037379_0012_100CF8C2B3B866F8"/>
courageous Yeomanry, <hi>are witneſſes</hi>—THERE he kept a powerful and well provided enemy in awe. Long-Iſland, York-Iſland and New-Jerſey, can bear teſtimony, where he was engaged with ſuperior and well diſciplined armies; where he, but with a handful of brave Warriors, checked formidable hoſtile legions, conducted by an experienced chief. Who remembers not his preſence having been a terror to his enemies almoſt every where? The environs of Brandywine, the fields of Germantown, the hills of Whitemarſh, the camp at Valley-Forge and the plains of Monmouth can give ſatisfactory evidence. And, as Moſes was magnified by the Lord in conducting the hoſt of Iſrael through the Red Sea, (under no ſmall exerciſe of Faith) in a dreadful ſtormy night, thereby forwarding the utter deſtruction of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies, who ſecurely followed them; ſo was General WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON in conducting our thinned, worn down and almoſt diſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed remnant of patriots, under cover of a dreadful, ſtormy, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try night over the Delaware, which, furiouſly floating with ice forbade human approach, into the fields of Trenton, there and in the plains of Princetown conquering and purſuing a ſecure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy and opening to America <hi>the road to Fortune.</hi> He, who had commanded Moſes at the Red Sea, had alſo inſpired WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON on the banks of the Delaware with this memorable manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre, and—GAVE HIM SUCCESS.</p>
            <p>We read further: that Moſes by his words cauſed wonders to ceaſe. The 8th, 9th and 10th Chapters of Exodus inform us, that theſe words were cries and intreaties to the Lord to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, <hi>even</hi> to his enemies. Now, can it readily be ſuppoſed that General WASHINGTON, who knew his own and his country's critical ſituation—who loved religion and his country—who as a Chriſtian knew his privilege and the command to exerciſe it— who, at the ceſſation of hoſtilities after an eight years ſtruggle with oppreſſion, iſſued his general orders to the Army "to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thanks to Almighty God for all his mercies, particularly for his overruling <hi>the wrath of Men to his own glory</hi> and cauſing the rage of war to ceaſe among the nations," omitted prayer?—That
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037379_0013_100CF8C44F9B4510"/>
himſelf ſhould not have addreſſed the Throne of grace, to turn the hearts of his country's enemies and incline them to peace, and to grant ſuch other bleſſings at the reception of which his rejoicing heart felt the warmeſt gratitude?—No, it cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be ſuppoſed. An unneceſſary or unaſked-for gift lays proud human nature not eaſily under great and open acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to the <hi>giver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are further informed, that the LORD made Moſes glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſight of Kings, <hi>Five</hi> which were conquered, are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned particularly: The Kings of Egypt and of Baſhan—the Kings of the Amalekites, the Amonites and the Midianites. The great fame of our venerable Chief not only reached diſtant nations of Indians in America, but ſlew acroſs the Atlantic, and we know he did become glorious in the ſight of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, partly by victories <hi>over</hi>—or by treaties <hi>with</hi> them.</p>
            <p>WE alſo read, that Moſes eſtabliſhed laws and ſtatutes in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, that his nation might know the covenant with God and his judgments.—And, that he on the reſignation of his Office and before he went to ſleep with his fathers, ſhewed Iſrael their true intereſt in ſetting before them life and death, good and evil, in either worſhipping or abandoning that God, who with ſuch a powerful arm had delivered and brought them ſo nigh the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their temporal felicity, cloſing his farewell addreſs with exhorting them, <hi>to ſet their hearts unto all the words of his teſtimony.</hi> Now, that our WASHINGTON was not only a Hero and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, but the Sage, the Legiſlator, the Adviſer, the Admon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſher and the Father of his Country, will, I hope, never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by our lateſt poſterity. Did he not like unto Moſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he quitted the Preſidential chair, make his nation, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the people of theſe States acquainted with their true ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intereſt and duty? Read his Bequeſt to the nation!— Meditate on his Legacy!—Let your children ſtudy it in their ſchools, ſeminaries and univerſities!—Did he not therein in the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037379_0014_100CF8C60C933918"/>
moſt forcible manner inculcate real religion as the baſis of all proſperity——that religion of which his great heart was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded and therewith embelliſhed, I mean the religion of JESUS CHRIST? Permit me a ſmall quotation; let it ſink deep into your hearts as the words of a dying father! <q>Of all the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and habits which lead to political proſperity, RELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GION and MORALITY ARE INDISPENSABLE SUPPORTS. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who ſhould labor to ſubvert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, the firmeſt props of the duties of Men and Citizens. The <hi>mere</hi> Politician, equally with the <hi>pious</hi> Man ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with private and public felicity. Let it be ſimply aſked: where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the ſenſe of religious obligation <hi>deſert</hi> the oaths, which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in Courts of Juſtice? And let us with <hi>caution</hi> indulge the ſuppoſition, that morality can be maintained <hi>without</hi> religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar ſtructure; reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect that <hi>national morality can prevail in excluſion of religious principle."</hi>
               </q> The whole of this valuable Legacy of good advice, which he had bequeathed on his departure from public life—the reſult of long experience, and expreſſed in the language of firmneſs and paternal affection, ſhould, as we have no doubt it will, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven deeply on the minds of his fellow-citizens, and tranſmitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their ſanctioning approbation to their poſterity.</p>
            <p>THE third and laſt proximate Analogy between our two He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes conſiſts in the high eſtimation in which both were held. Our ſublime writer ſaith: Moſes was beloved of God and Men.</p>
            <p>THE LORD evinced his high love and eſteem for Moſes: in chooſing <hi>him</hi> out of ALL Men to be his ſervant and inveſting <hi>him</hi> for the conduct of his people with ſuch high authority and power; in admitting <hi>him</hi> as a Mediator between HIMSELF and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037379_0015_100CF8C83A61F410"/>
the people and granting <hi>his</hi> interceſſions; in exalting <hi>him</hi> before his enemies; in protecting <hi>him</hi> againſt the rebellious clamors of mutineering clubs; <hi>in making</hi> Moſes <hi>like to the glorious ſaints;</hi> developing HIMSELF to <hi>him</hi>; ſhewing <hi>him</hi> part of HIS glory, at the burning buſh and on the mount in the dark cloud; making <hi>him</hi> to hear and to underſtand HIS voice; ſpeaking to <hi>him</hi> face to face and revealing HIS GREAT and TERRIBLE NAME to <hi>him.</hi> —What he <hi>there</hi> ſaw, heard, underſtood, and foretaſted is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible, but can I preſume, without further explanation be ſufficiently underſtood by ſuch of my audience, who really have come from natural darkneſs to the divine light; who have been admitted to behold the ſublime myſteries in the <hi>inner</hi> Courts; and who, as humble, chriſtian-minded, exalted, well-informed and genuine Brethren can beſt underſtand and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of partake.</p>
            <p>THE Lord evinced his great regard further for Moſes: for in the laſt moments of his life he ſuffered him not to languiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a long preceeding illneſs, but on the ſure and irrevocable notice of his approaching diſſolution, he, in the cloſe intimacy exiſting between his God and himſelf, ſurrendered with calm reſignation his ſoul into the kind and powerful hands of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.—And what is more extraordinary: the LORD himſelf bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Moſes, and his ſepulchre was never diſcovered by any Man. Thus loved and eſteemed the Lord his ſervant Moſes! And thus did the Lord ſignalize in ſome degree the deceaſed General, our illuſtrious Chief. He had found grace before HIM—HE choſe <hi>him</hi> out of the tribes of America, to become its political Saviour——HE endowed <hi>him</hi> with the ſpirit of wiſdom and the love of piety; HE enabled <hi>him</hi> with that circumſpection of conduct, that dignity of character and majeſtic glory, for which he is ſo univerſally famed; He clothed <hi>him</hi> with authority and power; He exalted <hi>him</hi> before, and protected <hi>him</hi> againſt the ſnares, the plots, the calumnies, the hidden deſigns of his avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſecret enemies; HE made <hi>him</hi> become acquainted with the LAW OF LIFE AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS GREAT
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037379_0016_100CDA2B8AF86150"/>
AND TERRIBLE NAME; HE alſo favored <hi>him</hi> with a ſhort ſickneſs, and, painful as it was, he was ſtrengthened therein not to utter a ſigh or a groan, but with undiſturbed ſerenity render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſpirit to HIM who gave it exiſtence, and which, as we have ground to believe, was received in the manſions of peace. Thus he cloſed his courſe—forty-five years whereof were well ſpent in his country's ſervice—for which the Lord cauſed his Memory to be exceedingly venerated in his death. His Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre is known to us and will be to our poſterity: not to idolize, but to remember and imitate him in all his public and private virtues, and to caſt into oblivion all foibles and errors incident to human nature.</p>
            <p>MOSES was alſo beloved of men. Though there were among the hoſt of Iſrael ſome, who always murmured and found fault with him, yet the nation at large entertained the higheſt ſenſe of eſteem for him, which it evinced after his deceaſe by inſtituting a ſolemn and public mourning for him for THIRTY days. Jews, Mahometans and Chriſtians to this day look jointly on him with reverence as a Sage, a Legiſlator, an intimate Friend of the MOST-HIGH, and as an inſtrument of God to impart <hi>Wiſdom and Truth</hi> to an idolatrous and ignorant world. With reſpect to our <hi>venerable Chief,</hi> who was firſt in war, firſt in peace, and whoſe bleſſed Memorial is deeply engraven in the hearts of all <hi>true</hi> Americans in general, and his Maſonic Brethren in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar—notwithſtanding the reiterated grumblings of a ſet of men, actuated by the ſpirit of Korah, Dathan and Abiram; who being even jealous and fearful of their own ſhadow, are conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining and diſpleaſed with every meaſure tending to good order and government either in Church or State. Which contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with <hi>him</hi> all around this inhabitable globe, who has ſeen or heard of the graceful gifts, extraordinary talents and the humble exerciſe of them, that does not entertain a favorable idea of <hi>him</hi> and admires <hi>him</hi> as a wiſely choſen inſtrument in the hands of an all ruling providence to beſtow bleſſings on the American Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

            <p>RESPECTING the acquittal of the laſt duty, which we owe to ourſelves and which conſiſts in the prolongation of our life in this preſent, and the inſurance of the enjoyment thereof without miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and pain in a future ſtate, permit the exhortation: let us fear the Lord, hate ſin, embrace the all-ſufficient righteouſneſs of our bleſſed Redeemer JESUS CHRIST; endeavour conſtantly to imitate HIM as our great and infallible pattern in obedience, love and humility towards God, and in rectitude towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour—conſtantly ſoliciting divine aſſiſtance and attending on all goſpel-inſtitutions as means proper to obtain the deſired end. This duty well exerciſed is profitable unto all things and has the promiſe of preſent and future happineſs. That it is poſſible for men to be rich, live in exalted ſtations and withal love religion and exerciſe its duties, our deceaſed venerable Chief has evinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—Let us therefore copy occaſionally from his public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate virtues, and his piety as well in the legiſlation, the cabinet and the field, as in private life. This, and this alone will make us happy individually, and as a Nation.</p>
            <p>BRETHREN of Maſonic order! permit a few words eſpecially to enter your <hi>liſtening ears,</hi> and to ſink deep into your affected hearts. In the deceaſed General, for the honor of whom you aſſembled to-day in this temple, you have loſt a Brother, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <l>COLUMBIA's SONS may now lament,</l>
               <l>Their Spear is broke, their Bow unbent;</l>
               <l>WASHINGTON lies among the dead,</l>
               <l>His life, but not his glory fled.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh! join in grief each living ſoul,</l>
               <l>Your mighty, mighty loſs condole:</l>
               <l>The World's great friend, his Country's head,</l>
               <l>The noble WASHINGTON is dead!</l>

               <l>Who now ſhall wield the Sword of fate:</l>
               <l>To guard our lives and liberty—</l>
