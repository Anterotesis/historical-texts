            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have in this Chapter an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Five Miracles wro't by the hand of <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. It is the Second of 'em only that will fall under our preſent Conſideration, namely, <hi>That of his obtaining the Bleſſing of a Son for an Ancient Couple who had been long Childleſs.</hi> The Hiſtory of which begins at Ver 8. <hi>It fell on a day, that Eliſha paſſed to Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, where was a great woman; and ſhe conſtrained him to eat bread. And ſo it was as oft as he paſſed by, be turned in thither to eat bread.</hi> In the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004338_0004_10044876AA9DBAA0"/>Verſes following, we have an account of the Kindneſs of this great woman to the Prophet, who not only (with the leave of her Husband) hid him Welcome to her Houſe, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of it; but ſhe provides a Lodging room for him, whether he was wont fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to turn in, when in his Circuit he paſſed that way, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>The holy Man in gratitude for this Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, conſults what Recompence he ſhould make her (for Religion and Grace teach men gratitude.) He offers to uſe his Intereſt for her at the King's Court; but ſhe needs not this Favour, <hi>ver</hi> 13. Well, he conſulteth his Servant <hi>Gehazi,</hi> what ſhall be done for her, wherein he may Oblige her? Who tells his Maſter, That ſhe is Childleſs; hath a great Eſtate, but no Son to Heir it, <hi>ver.</hi> 14 The Prophet then ſends for her, and promiſes her ſhe ſhall have a Son; which was a great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to her; but was fulfilled at the exact ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, Ver. 15,—17. <hi>The woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and bare a ſon at that ſeaſon that Eliſha had ſaid unto her, according to the time of life.</hi> This no doubt was great Joy to the Family when the Heir was born. And after the Birth of this their Son, the Prophet no doubt was doubly welcome to the Parents; and the Child, no doubt was dear to the Prophet, as being a Son of his Prayers; and to the Parents, as being
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004338_0005_1004414E18FC2DE0"/>the Son of their Old Age, and an only Son: But as dear as he was to them all, he was not too dear for Death. For now being big eno' juſt to run abroad, he follows his Father into the Field; where either the Coldneſs of the Earth, or Heat of the Sun in harveſt-time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Child, that was tenderly bred; and he complains to his Father that his Head akes; who ſends him home to his Mother, not ſuſpecting him to be dangerouſly Ill; where he lay in his Mothers Arms till Noon and then died, <hi>ver</hi> 18, —20.</p>
            <p>But ſhe (inſtead of ſending for her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to lay out her dead Child) retires into the little Chamber and lays him on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's Bed; then goes out, ſhutting the door after her, and runs into the Field to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, not to acquaint him with the ſorrowful News, but to beg leave of him to go to the Prophet: He (after ſome Objections) gives her Leave; which ſhe having obtained and a Servant to wait on her, makes all poſſible ſpeed to the Prophet, with an heart full eno' of grief, Tho' ſhe behaved ſo excellently under it, and makes no more diſcovery of it. The Prophet ſeeing her coming, for whom he had ſo great a Reſpect, ſendeth his Servant <hi>Gehazi</hi> to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether any thing was amiſs with her, or her Family? As in the Text, <hi>Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and ſay unto her, Is it well
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004338_0006_1004487B4CC55920"/>with thee? Is it well with thy Husband? Is it well with the Child? And ſhe anſwered, It is well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The Queſtion which the Prophet by his Servant put to her, which is very particular, Is it well with thee with thy Husband &amp; with the Child? Is all well with thy Family?</hi> Thus it becomes the men of God, to Enquire of the welfare of their People with a tender concern to know how it fares with their Families, and with their Souls; how Religion flouriſheth among them, and what is to be done for them.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The Reply that ſhe makes to this Queſtion. And ſhe anſwered, It is well. "Gebazi</hi> was not the man ſhe came to complain to, and therefore ſhe turns him off with this general Anſwer, <hi>It is well.</hi> However, this ſhe ſpeaks very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as a pious and good Woman: And there is much in the Anſwer; It manifeſts the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent temper of her Mind, her quiet Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Providence of God, and her Faith that all ſhould be well in the Concluſion. It is well with me: Tho' I am ſorely bereaved and afflicted, Yet 'tis what God hath done, and what he doeth is well, and ſhall be well; and he can make it well to me, and well to my Husband. <hi>'Tis well with me, and well with my Husband; yea, and it is well with the Child too.</hi> Tho' the Child now lay dead in the Houſe. This ſaying of hers, was not the Effect of her
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004338_0007_10044905F14651A0"/>ſtupidity, as tho' ſhe was inſenſible of the Aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Providence, or didn't ſufficiently feel her Loſs. No, It appears by the Verſes following, that her Soul was full eno' of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; nor could a Mothers Bowels be more rent, than hers were; <hi>for her Soul was vexed within her,</hi> Ver 27. But it was her Grace and Faith that made her thus quiet and reſigned, and cauſed her to carry it ſo excellent well under ſo heavy and ſhocking a Diſpenſation, as the loſs of her dear and only Son, and the Son of her old Age, when ſhe could not expect another: Yet ſhe could (and that very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and well conſiſtent with her duty) ſay, It is well; 'tis well with me, and well with my Husband, tho' our all be taken from us; and it is well with the Child too, tho' it be dead.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The general Obſervation or Doctrinal Point may be this,</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <head type="sub">That when God removes our deareſt Relations out of the World by Death, it becomes us in quiet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the divine Providence, to ſay, It is well both with us and with them. — <hi>And ſhe anſwered, It is well.</hi>
               </head>

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004338_0008_10044882226651F8"/>
The Doctrine may be ſpoken to under the Three following Propoſitions, Namely,
<list>
                     <item>PROP. I. <hi>That our deareſt Relations, and we too, are Mortal, and muſt be Remov'd out of the World by Death.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>PROP. II. <hi>That when any are Removed out of the World by Death, 'tis divine Providence that orders the Time, and all the Circumſtances of their Removal.</hi> Hence,</item>
                     <item>PROP. III. <hi>When our deareſt Relations are ſo Removed, it becomes us in quiet Submiſſion to the divine Providence, to ſay it is well both with us and with them.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>PROP. I. <hi>That our deareſt Relations, and we too, are Mortal, and muſt be Removed out of the World by Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Truth no leſs certain, than it is awful; which tho' it cannot be too much tho't of by us, yet needs little to be ſaid for the proof of it. All grant this Truth. Every one knows that he muſt die, Eccl. ix. 5. <hi>For the living know that they ſhall die.</hi> And there is a Statute Law of Heaven for it, Heb. ix. 27. <hi>Is is appointed to man once to die.</hi> And the royal Preacher aſſures us, <hi>That this is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart,</hi> Eccl. vii. 2 Our dear Relatives, in whom we enjoy the greateſt Comfort, are Mortal and muſt die.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004338_0009_10044154909627A0"/>
                  <hi>There they buried Abraham &amp; Sarah his wife, there they buried Iſaac and Rebecca his wife, and there I buried Leah,</hi> Gen. xlix. 31. Friends are precious Comforts, yet they are fading Comforts too, that we can't Enjoy always. We and they muſt have our parting time. Children are pleaſant Flowers in our Eyes; but we muſt remember that they are but fading Flowers, that Death may ſoon turn into a lump of cold Clay and make us willing to bury them out of our fight. And we ſhould remember that theſe dear Comforts may ſuddenly be remov'd from us, as it was with the Child referr'd to in our Text: Well with his Father in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet dead with his Mother at Noon. And as ſudden may our own Deaths be. We know not at what Watch our Lord and Maſter may call for us. How highly then does it concern us to make it our firſt and great care to be alſo ready. <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant whom when his Lord cometh he ſhall find ſo doing,</hi> Mat. xxiv. 46.</p>
               <p>PROP. II. <hi>When any are Removed out of the World by Death, it is divine Providence that orders the Time &amp; all the Circumſtances of their Removal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it may briefly be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the preciſe Time of every perſons Death, is Pre-determined in the divine Counſel or Decree; is that whatever of Contingency may ſeem to attend
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004338_0010_10044883DA4A7800"/>the Death of any, as to Time, Place, Inſtruments, Cauſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet with reſpect to the divine Decree, there can be no ſuch thing.</hi> The exact time of every perſons Death being fore-known, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed &amp; fixed in the divine Fore knowlege and Decree, to a very moment; and therefore ſhall come at the exact Time, but cannot paſs it. <hi>It there not an appointed time to man upon Earth? Are not his days alſo like the days of an Hireling?</hi> Job vii 1. He that is hir'd, indents for a certain determinate Time, the period of which is exactly fixed. So long he can be held and no longer. So <hi>Job</hi> tells us it is with reſpect to the Date of humane Life. Every one hath his exact number of Years, Months, Days and Hours appointed him to fulfil in the World. And thus far he muſt come, and no further: <hi>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee: Thou haſt appointed his Bounds that he cannot paſs,</hi> Chap. xiv. 5. Yea, before the Child is born, it is appointed and determined juſt how long it ſhall live, and its Bounds are fix'd; which is equally Decreed in the divine Counſels and Fore-knowlege with its Birth. Hence we read, That <hi>to every thing there is a Seaſon and a Time</hi> (That is, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined, Appointed and Fixed in the divine Decree) <hi>to every purpoſe under Heaven. A time to be Born, and a time to Die,</hi> Eccl. iii. <hi>beg.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004338_0011_1004490DB62E6068"/>
2. <hi>The Providence of God orders all the Second Cauſes &amp; the Circumſtances of them, by which every one is bro't unto Death in his exact appointed time. For I know</hi> that <hi>thou wilt bring me unto death, and to the houſe appointed for all living,</hi> Job xxx 23. <hi>Thou</hi> wilt bring me unto death: For whatever be the Inſtrument, whatever be the Means by what the Effect is bro't about, God's Providence is the chief Efficient: At the Ordering and under the ſpecial Direction of which, every thing is Effected. And God by his Providence performs that, and that only which was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in the appointed time &amp; method. That thoſe Effects which with reſpect to Second Cauſes were moſt contingent, yet with reſpect to the Firſt Cauſe of all, are no more than what were long before determined on and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. So that as <hi>Job</hi> tells us, The thing that God accompliſheth in his Providence, is the ſame and no other than what was before fix'd and determined on in the Decree. Chap. xxiii. 14. <hi>For He performeth</hi> the thing that is <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for me, and many ſuch things are with him.</hi> And if as our bleſſed Saviour tells, the very Hairs of our head are ſo numbred (in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Decree or Counſel) as that not one of them can fall to the ground, without the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divine Providence; then much more our Deaths &amp; all the Circumſtances attending them, are certainly at the Ordering and under the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004338_0012_1004411667B5AA28"/>Direction of divine Providence. It follows then, that when any are removed out of the world by Death, divine Providence hath Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Time, and all the Circumſtances at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their Removal.</p>
               <p>Hence,</p>
               <p>PROP. III. <hi>When our deareſt Relations are ſo Remov'd, it becomes us in quiet Submiſſion to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, to ſay, It is well both with us and with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Language of that excellent, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and pious Woman in our Text, under a very ſore and ſudden Bereavement. Her only Son and only Child, a Child of Promiſe and a Child of Prayer, and a Child of Old Age, and given her in Love; and yet taken away by a ſudden Death, Well in the Morning, and dead by Noon; and died in her Arms: All her care, tenderneſs and Prayers cannot keep it alive, <note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>Henry</hi> in loc.</note> The ſtroke is very heavy. Yet how admirably doth the pious Mother keep her temper, and govern her ſpirit under this moſt ſurprizing Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction! Not one peeviſh or indecent word comes out of her mouth; but her ſpeech and behaviour manifeſts a humble Reſignation to the divine Providence. And Excellent Pattern for Chriſtian Imitation! And when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004338_0013_10044161611C45C8"/>by his Servant puts that Queſtion to her, Is <hi>it well with thee? Is it well with thy Husband?</hi> Is <hi>it well with the Child? She anſwered,</hi> It is <hi>Well</hi> 
                  <abbr>qd</abbr> It is well with me, It is well with my Husband, &amp; it is well with the Child. This is the Language of her quiet Submiſſion to the Providence of God, Acknowledging that all is well that He doth; and of her Faith, That all ſhould be well in the Concluſion. And ſurely ſhe ſpake right in this. And it is (no doubt) written for our Learning, and does teach us a like Submiſſion and humble Patience under the afflicting hand of God, when in like for bereaved of dear Relatives. This ſhould be the Language of our humble Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, It is well with us, and it is well with them. Thus he, 1 Sam. iii. 18 <hi>And be ſaid, It is the Lord: let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here will ariſe Two important Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>Queſt, 1. <hi>In what ſenſe may, and ought we to ſay, It is well with us, when our dear Friends are Removed from us by Death?</hi>

                  <item>Queſt 2. <hi>In what ſenſe may we ſay, It is well with our departed Friends when ſo Removed?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Enquiry then is, <hi>In what ſenſe may, and ought we to ſay, It is well with us, when our dear Friends are Removed from us by Death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Queſtion muſt be anſwered, firſt Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and then Poſitively.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004338_0014_1004489017A1BE60"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Negatively.</hi> We muſtn't underſtand this Aſſertion in our Doctrine, as tho' Religion and Grace remov'd the Bonds of Nature, or taught us leſs to value the Lives of our Friends, or to make light of their Death; or taught us not to Mourn their Removal. No, Nothing like Religion and Grace to make men tender-hearted, compaſſionate, full of love &amp; goodneſs to their Friends. So that that Phraſe, <hi>It is well with us when our dear Friends are removed from us,</hi> muſt not be otherwiſe underſtood, but that,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>Such Afflictions are in themſelves Evils, and as ſuch are to be Reſented.</hi> No Evil in it ſelf conſidered, is to be choſen; nor can we ſay of it, <hi>It is well.</hi> Afflictions in themſelves conſider'd, are the fruits and effects of Sin, and as ſuch are not to be choſen, but deprecated. The Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of dear Friends is a great loſs; the affliction is great. and as ſuch cannot be choſen. Nor can we ſay of it without ſin, That it is well we have loſt them: Which would be the moſt monſtrous Inhumanity. Religion don't teach us to caſt off Natural Affection; which to do is very ſinful, and an horrid violation of the Law of Nature; for which the Gentiles ſtand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted &amp; Condemned by the Apoſtle, Rom i. 31 <hi>Without Natural affection, Implacable, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmerciful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence,</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>It can't in'end but that we ought to Mourn our loſs in their Removal.</hi> Grief is Natural, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004338_0015_1004491819F1A1D0"/>never more ſo, than on ſuch ſorrowful Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And tho' natural Affection is ever to be govern'd by Reaſon and Religion, and to be kept within due Bounds, that we be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive in our Mourning (for Exceſs in any thing is Sinful) Yet we are never to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Humanity, as thoſe do who Mourn not the death of their dear Friends. So the royal Teacher exhorts, <hi>My ſon, deſpiſe not the chaſtning of the Lord, neither be weary of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> Prov. iii. II. Not to be affected with ſuch Afflictions, not to lay to heart ſuch Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reavements, nor to be awaken'd by them, is to deſpiſe the Chaſtning of the Lord here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. 'Tis with <hi>Ephraim</hi> to bear Afflictions as a Bullock unaccuftom'd to the Yoke. We muſt not (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>) be Stocks and Stones and Stoicks under our Afflictions; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of them, without feeling under them, or unmindful of the Errand on which they are ſent. We muſt not thus deſpiſe the Chaſtning of the Lord. Tho' on the other hand, We muſt take heed that we don't faint under them; that we be not diſpirited, nor run into Exceſs and ſuffer our ſelves to be unfitted for duty by our Afflictions.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>It does not intend but that there may be the righteous Diſpleaſure of God in ſuch Afflictions; which ought to be very humbling to us.</hi> On this account, ſuch frowns of Providence appear aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004338_0016_10044896A0514120"/>as there may be the diſpleaſure of God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in them. Then ſurely, on this account we cannot ſay, <hi>It is well.</hi> It is not well, but aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that we ſhould offend our Maker, &amp; expoſe our ſelves to his Frowns and righteous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; making divine Chaſtiſements need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us; on which account we have reaſon to walk ſoftly under Afflictions and greatly to humble our ſelves before God, making that humble Petition <hi>Job</hi> does, Chap. X. ver. 2. <hi>I will ſay unto God, Do not condemn me; ſhew me wherefore thou contendeſt with me.</hi> And we ought to improve all for the promoting our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; future Amendment. So <hi>Elihu</hi> adviſes <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. xxxiv. 31, 32. <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born</hi> Chaſtiſement, <hi>I will not offend</hi> any more.</p>
               <p>But thus far in a Negative way, to keep us from miſtakes is what follows. I now paſs on to ſay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And Poſuively.</hi> That we may and ought, in a quiet Submiſſion to the divine Providence, to ſay, <hi>It is well with us, when our dear Friends are removed from us by Death; or when under the exerciſe of any Affliction.</hi> And that on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing accounts eſpecially, Namely,
<list>
                     <item>(I) <hi>As our Afflictions are no other than what God hath ſeen meet to Exerciſe us withal.</hi> So we may and outh quietly to ſay, <hi>It is well.</hi> For what God does is well done. 'Tis done in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004338_0017_1004491DD33173C0"/>Wiſdom and Juſtice, and not without good Reaſon: Therefore it is well, as it is from God, and order'd by his Wiſdom; who knows all his own Works and the Reaſon of them, from the beginning to the end, <hi>Act.</hi> xv. 18. Nor is this any way inconſiſtent with what we above obſerv'd: For we may be truly ſenſible of our Afflictions, and mourn our Loſs, and yet at the ſame time may ſay with her in the Text, <hi>It is well.</hi> 'Tis what infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath order'd, 'Tis what the Great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World hath done; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is what we ought to acquieſce in as well done, and wiſely done, tho' it be for a humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to us and fills us with pain &amp; ſorrow. And thus it ſeems to have been with her in the text. Her Grief was great; her Soul was sore vexed; her Bowels were rent for the loſs of her only Son: Yet diſcerning by Faith the Hand of God in it; ſeeing it was He that had done it who does every thing wiſely &amp; well, and has the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone Right to diſpoſe of his Creatures, as in his own Wiſdom he ſees beſt, this ſilences her, calms her ſpirit; or at leaſt keeps her from immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sorrow, and from all indecent Behaviour. But this is ſtill her humble Language, <hi>It is well with me, &amp;c.</hi> It is no otherwiſe than what an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God, a Righteous Sovereign &amp; a Merciful Father hath done, &amp; that muſt needs be well done. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>

(2) <hi>As all our Afflictions have Merey mixed with them, &amp; are ever leſs than our Iniquities do deſerve, ſo we may ſay, It is well with us, be our Afflictions what they will.</hi> Our Afflictions in this life, ever have a mixture of Mercy with them, and ever leſs than our Iniquities do deſerve. This the Church acknowleges, <hi>Ezra</hi> ix. 13. Have we our dear Friends remov'd from us by Death? We our ſelves are yet ſpar'd, and have further time allow'd us wherein to prepare for our own Diſſolutions; and an't this a Mercy? An't it well for us? Had we been taken and they ſpar'd, where then had we been? Have we yet reaſon to complain or repine at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? Surely, no. Wherefore doth the living man complain, a man for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſins? <hi>Lam.</hi> iii 39. It is of God's meer Mercy that we are living Men, &amp; living Women our ſelves. And ſhall a living man complain under any Affliction or Bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? No, he has more reaſon to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Life and the Bleſſings of it, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Afflictions and Calamities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life. It better becomes us to ſay, <hi>It is well with us that we are our ſelves alive, which is mare mercy than we deſerve.</hi> Beſides, we have many Mercies to few Afflictions; and an't it great Mercy that it is ſo? And would it not be very ſinful in us, to ſuffer a few Afflictions, (tho' heavy &amp; grievous) to imbitter all our
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004338_0019_10044928D0F85088"/>Mercies to us, and render us unthankful for them? Yes. It ſurely better becomes us to ſay, <hi>It is well with us that we have ſo many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to ſo few Afflictions.</hi> We have had a dear Relation remov'd from us, but how many have we left to comfort us? We have had, it may be, ſome part of our Subſtance remov'd, yet we have more left us than was taken from us. We have been croſs'd &amp; diſappointed in ſome of our Enterprizes, but have we not been bleſs'd and proſper'd in other reſpects? You have, perhaps, met with much Affliction in one Relation, Friend or Child; but then hav'nt you as much Comfort in ſome others, in whom you enjoy a great Bleſſing? And isn't this Mercy? Thus the compare your Mercies with your Afflictions; weigh them in an even Balance, and the ſay, whether your Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ought not to be the ſame with hers in the Text, <hi>It is well with me, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>(3) <hi>As the Diſpenſation it ſelf that we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with (be it what it will) is under the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of an Alwiſe God, who knows how to bring about his own Glory and our beſt good by it, ſo we have reaſon on this account quietly to ſay,</hi> It is well. This Diſpenfation, this Affliction is not from a <hi>Creature:</hi> 'Tisn't order'd nor bro't about by a <hi>Creature,</hi> but by the Alwiſe CREATOR. And it is under the Government, and at the Direction of his Wiſdom, who can bring about
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004338_0020_100441234489F108"/>his own Glory &amp; advance our beſt good by it. Which Conſideration affords juſt ground for Comfort, and ſhould be quieting to us. This <hi>Job</hi> in his Afflictions ſeems to take ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and (no doubt) was quieting to his ſpirit, Chap. xxiii. ver. 14. <hi>For he performeth</hi> the thing that is <hi>appointed for me, and many ſuch things are with him.</hi> We are ready to ſay, <hi>Theſe things are againſt us;</hi> but that we don't know: The Providence, indeed, may look dark &amp; awful, but yet it is under the direction of the divine Wiſdom, which, it may be, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting our beſt good in it; and if we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtains we have a ſure Promiſe for it: For ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are the called according to</hi> his <hi>Purpoſe,</hi> Rom. viii. 28. Then ought we not, conſidering this, quietly to ſay, <hi>It is well?</hi> We are, it may be, under a Cloud; an heavy Burden it upon us: But yet, 'tis laid on us by God himſelf, and is at the Ordering of His Providence, who is a God of tender Mercy; who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders our Frame, and can lighten our Burden and make it Eaſie to us when he ſees fit. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> complains when his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> was Sold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> lay Bound there, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> muſt needs go down. Now ſaith he, <hi>Joſeph</hi> is <hi>not, and Simeon</hi> is <hi>not, and ye will take Benjamin</hi> away; <hi>all theſe things are againſt me,</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:004338_0021_1004416704B258C8"/>Gen. xlii. 36. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Henry</hi> in loc.</note> But that divine Wiſdom that ordered the Diſpenſation, deſign'd his good and the good of his Family by it, as he himſelf ſaw afterwards to his abundant ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. But at preſent he is full of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly tho'ts; too ready to complain: He gives up <hi>Joſeph &amp; Simeon</hi> as loſt; whereas <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> was in honour, and <hi>Simeon</hi> in the way to it. And then from his miſtaken apprehenſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Providence, he complains, <hi>That all theſe things were againſt him;</hi> when they were for him and his Family <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Henry</hi> in loc.</note>. Thus thro' cur lg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the wiſe deſigns of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and thro' the weakneſs of our Faith, we often apprehend that to be againſt us, which is really for us. We are afflicted in Body, in Name, Eſtate, Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to complain, <hi>That all theſe things are againſt us;</hi> whereas if we are ſincere Chriſtians, theſe things are working out for us <hi>a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and an eternal weight of glory,</hi> Cor.iv. 17.</item>

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004338_0022_100448A786AF4DC0"/>into; and to be ſtirr'd up and Quickned in the way of our Duty: And Afflictions may prove of great Service to us, unto theſe Ends, Hoſ. v. 15. —<hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> And that our Afflictions may have this happy Effect, 'tis our duty to be much in Prayer to God for a ſanctified Improvement of them. Times of Afflictions ſhou'd eſpecially be Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> Pſal. l. 15. <hi>Is any among you afflicted? let him pray,</hi> Jam. v. 13. Our afflictions, tho' we ſee them coming from the hand of God, muſt drive us to him, and not drive us from him: And when they do ſo, ſurely we have reaſon to ſay, <hi>It is well with us.</hi> Becauſe this is what we greatly need, and by this means, thoſe very Afflictions that we are ſo ready to complain of, as againſt us, may be turn'd into the greateſt Mercies to us, and without which we might have periſh'd in our ſinſul Security. Hence therefore,</item>
                     <item>(5) <hi>&amp;</hi> finally, <hi>If our Afflictions be really Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us for our ſpiritual good; do prove truly Humbling, Awakening and Quickning to us, that by them we are furthered in our way to Heaven, have we not then abundant reaſon to ſay, It is well with us when we are ſo afflicted? ſince that which makes moſt for our beſt Intereſt is certainly the beſt for us.</hi> The Pſalmiſt, who was much in affliction, tells us from his own Experience, That it was well with him, and good for him that he had been
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004338_0023_1004492ECF6A1F08"/>afflicted, &amp; gives us the reaſon why, Pſal. cxix 67 <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy word.</hi> And ver. 71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy ſtatutes.</hi> While in Proſperity, we are apt to be Secure, grow Worldly, indulge Pleaſures, forget God, and grow deaf to the Counſels of his Word: But ſanctified Afflictions humble and awake us, ſhew us the Vanity of the world, the Emptineſs of creature comforts, ſoften the heart, and open the ears to diſcipline; on all which accounts we have reaſon to ſay, <hi>It is well with us.</hi> Thus Afflictions many times prove the greateſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to good people We read, in Exod. i. 12 That <hi>the more the children of Iſrael were afflicted, the more they grew</hi> Many times, days of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are the moſt growing days with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: And is it not we with them when it is ſo? So that upon Conſideration of the whole, this ſhould ſtill be our humble Language under Afflictions, <hi>It is Well.</hi> All well that God does.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Thus much in way of Anſwer to the Firſt Enquiry. The Second was,</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>In what ſenſe may we ſay, It is well with our departed Friends, when remov'd by Death?</hi>
               </p>

The very tho is of this is eno' to make the ſtoureſt heart to tremble, and ſhould be meditated on by us, to our Awakening &amp; time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repentance, and to quicken us to a timely Preparation for Death, that it ſurprize us not in ſuch an unprepared Condition.

2. <hi>And Poſitively,</hi> In theſe following reſpects we may ſay, relating to the Deaths of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Friends, in a way of quiet Submiſſion to the Providence of God therein, <hi>It is well,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>As God hath taken them away in his own Time.</hi> They have liv'd their exact appointed Time, as long as they were to live when they were born. They have exactly ſulfill'd their Years, Months, Days &amp; Hours, ſo that in this ſenſe we ought to ſay, <hi>It is well.</hi> For God's time is the beſt time for us to die in. We are indeed ready to ſay, Why were they taken away in the midſt of their Uſefulneſs? Why was ſuch and ſuch a Perſon taken away when they were ſo Uſeful in their Day and Places, and likely to have done ſo much good in the world, and to have been ſo great Bleſſings to their Friends had they been ſpared? Or why muſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant be carried from the Mothers Arms to the Grave, and not live to do any Service in the world, nor be any Comfort to us? Why might we not have Enjoy'd them a little longer? But this Conſideration ſhou'd ſilence all, They are taken from us in God's time, and divine Wiſdom hath ſeen a Reaſon why it ſhou'd be ſo: And what God does is well &amp; wiſely done. And we ought without demanding any Reaſon, quietly to ſay with her in the Text, <hi>It is well.</hi> It is what God hath done, It is what infinite Wiſdom hath Order'd, &amp; that is well done that God doeth.</p>

'Twas deſcended of pious Parents, 'twas a Child of Prayer and the Covenant; and (doubtleſs) Early Dedicated to the Lord. The Mother therefore doubts not but that it is well with the Child now dead, as her anſwer fully implies. The like Faith we find <hi>David</hi> in the Exerciſe of, upon the Death of his Child, Born an Heir of the Covenant, and doubts not but it was well with its departed Soul; tho' it died on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, and ſo before it was bro't under the Seal of the Covenant: For the Benefits of the Covenant do not depend upon the Seals. And <hi>David</hi> comforts himſelf with the tho'ts, that he ſhould go to it, where it was; which muſt be underſtood of Heaven, 2 <hi>Sam</hi> xii. 23. And all the Faithful under the Goſpel, have the like
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004338_0028_10044127F4AEE870"/>ground of Hope for their Children dying in their Infancy, that it is well with them in the other World. For the Promiſe is to them and to their Children, as it was to the Saints and to their Children under the Old Teſtament diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, <hi>Act.</hi> ii. 29. Which Promiſe (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henry,</hi>) ſhall be perform'd to thoſe who do not put a Bar in their own Door, as Infants do not. God calls them His Children (ſaith the ſame Author) that are Born unto him. And if they be his, He will Save them. And our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR himſelf tells us, <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mark x. 14. And we know it is Eaſie with the Moſt High, by his Grace, to Sanctify the Soul of the Infant and prepare it for Glory. Yea, we read of them who have been Sanctified from the Womb, <note n="†" place="bottom">Jor. i. 5. Luk, i, 15.</note>.
<p>And tho' it may be <hi>Objected,</hi> That the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believing Parents, do not ordinarily partake of Converting Grace in their Infancy and Baptiſm, as appears Evident from their Conduct when they arrive to Years of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                        <p>Yet it is eaſily <hi>Anſwered,</hi> That theſe being appointed to Live, are left to the ordinary Means of grace and way of Converſion: But to thoſe Infants who were not to live to Enjoy thoſe Means, why ſhould we not think, That
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004338_0029_100449426F41DAC8"/>their Converſion, or what is Equivalent, may be effected for them &amp; wro't in them in a more Extraordinary way, by an immediate work of the Holy Ghoſt on their Souls Sanctifying them, and applying the Merits and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to them; in the Juſtifying Vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo preparing them for Glory. For it is eaſie to diſtinguiſh between the Gift convey'd and the Manner of conveying it. It is the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Merits that Juſtifies us, and not our Apprehending it. And this Application may be made to Infants, by the Holy Spirit, without their actual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. For tho' God tieth us to Means, yet not himſelf. Tho' Faith is abſolutely requird of all the Adult, to whom God affords Means of Believing, yet God can ſupply the defect of Faith, by his Sanctifying Spirit; which can do all things on our part, which Faith ſhould do.</p>

It is a very great Fault, that ſo many of the Children of the Church, when they come to Age, neglect Puulickly to own and perſonally to ratify what their Parents have done for them in their Minority, by Renewing their Covenant and ſo Joining themſelves to the Lord and his Church; their neglect to do which, is but too Evidential of their low eſteem of Sacred things and want of love to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; and ſo, indeed, of their being in a blind, ſecure and graceleſs Condition: Which it is tremendous to think ſhould be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſuch Multitudes as live in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this great duty and the holy Ordinance of the Supper, in theſe Churches, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and wounding of Religion amongſt us, as it is in direct Diſobedience to that great Command, <hi>This do in Remembrance of Me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But hath the conduct of our godly deceaſed Friends been otherwiſe? Have we obſerv'd them to love the habitation of God's Houſe, and to thirſt after his Ordinances?

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004338_0032_100448D3580D5170"/>holy Communion here, yet we may believe them joined in a moſt perfect &amp; bleſſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the general Aſſembly &amp; Church of the Firſt-born in Heaven; where they ſee no more thro' a glaſs darkly, as here, through Ordinances and Promiſes, but face to face, and know as alſo they are known; being fill'd with the fulneſs of God's Eternal Love, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually of thoſe perfect Pleaſures which flow at God's Right Hand for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Pſal</hi> xvi. <hi>ult.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004338_0033_1004412CD9E24FF0"/>Why, now we cannot but riſe up &amp; call them bleſſed; and ſay ſurely their good works do follow them. Did they in any reſpect ſuſtain a more Publick Relation amongſt us, &amp; therein behave wiſely and very diſcreetly towards every one? Were they Courteous and Free, Charitable &amp; Obliging to their Neighbours &amp; Friends, Condeſeending to thoſe below them, Humble and Modeſt in their whole deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Eyes that ſaw them cou'dn't but bleſs them, and the Ears that heard them give witneſs to their good Converſation? Our Reflection upon this, tho' it will make our Loſs in their removal the more diſtreſſing, when thoſe that were ſuch a bleſſing to us &amp; others, and on whom we had ſo great a dependance are removed from us, yet it will give us to ſee that we are not to Mourn for them as without Hope that it is well with them.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) finally, <hi>If from the moſt intimate Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them, we had to our ſatisfaction, well grounded Evidence of their Converſion and being in a ſtate of Grace, then we may with great Comfort ſay, It is well with them now they are gone.</hi> Thoſe that dwell together and have the opportunity of a free, conſtant Converſe, may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd (if Religiouſly inclin'd) to make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judgment on each others Hope, than any other Perſon can do, who hath not had the ſame opportunity. And there is nothing that

               <p>USE, I. <hi>From what hath been offer'd under the Doctrine, ſee ſomething of the Excellency of our holy Religion, that gives us ſuch hope in Death, and affords us ſuch Directions &amp; Conſolation in Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Death of godly Friends.</hi> The Phileſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pless &amp; wife Sages of the <hi>Gentile</hi> world taught men to bear Loſſes and Afflictions patiently, from the conſideration of inevitable Fate; and that it was unreaſonable &amp; unmanly to mourn
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004338_0035_10044945C0D702F8"/>or grieve at that which man cou'd not help. Poor foundation of Comfort! Yet as good as any of the Religions of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> teacheth. But our holy Religion teacheth us to comfort our ſelves under Afflictions, from the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that our real Felicity does not conſiſt in the Favour and Smiles, nor our Miſery in the Frowns &amp; Croſſes of this World. It teacheth, A man may be Poor in this world, yet exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rich, rich in Faith. Low and deſpiſed in this world, yet Heir of a Crown and Kingdom. That a man may be himſelf juſt ground of Comfort and ſolid Joy. <hi>For theſe light Afflictions that are but for a moment,</hi> if ſanctified by Grace, will be <hi>working for us a far more exceeding &amp; an eternal weight of Glory.</hi> So that under the heavieſt Trials, good Chriſtians may ſay, <hi>It is well with us ſtill.</hi> For all theſe things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good to ſuch, and ſhall in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion turn to their account.</p>
               <p>In a word, Our holy Religion opens to the Eye of Faith another World, an Eternal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence after this ſhort Life; and teaches us that it is well with us or with our Friends, or ill with us or them, as it is like to fare with us or them in the next World; to which this world and the affairs of it bear no proportion. If therefore we have good ground of hope for them that are gone, this will teach us that it is
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004338_0036_10044137C1745850"/>infinitely better with them now than when they were here? That they cannot wiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with us again. But were they to ſpeak to us, their Language ſurely would be, <hi>Mourn not for me, my Husband,</hi> or my Wife, my Parents or my Children, <hi>but for your ſelves that are ſtill in a world full of Sin, Snares and Temptations: but I am arriv'd thro' all theſe Dangers.</hi> And in ſuch Language as that of our bleſſed Saviour to his Diſciples, Joh. xiv. 28. <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid I go unto the Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, Our holy Religion aſſures us of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſurrection to Life again to all the godly, when their vile Bodies ſhall ariſe out of their Graves, ſhake off Corruption and put on a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Immortality, aſcend to Manſions of Light and never-ceaſing Joy, and ſo ſhall be for ever with the Lord. Therefore ſhould we learn to Comfort our ſelves and one another with theſe comfortable Conſiderations. Read 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> iv. 14, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>USE, II. <hi>Learn we from what hath been offer'd, That Chriſtians ſhould new Mourn as others do who have no ſuch Hope to ſupport them under Loſſes, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reavements and afflictive Diſpenſations, as we have.</hi> Our Conduct therefore and Behaviour ſhould be agreeable to our Chriſtian Hopes.

                  <hi>1.

We therefore ſhould be ſilent, and ſeek for a ſanctified Improvement. Beſides, Is it God that hath done it? Then not a word muſt be ſaid, not a mouth opened in way of complaint or finding fault; but all muſt be ſilent, becauſe He hath done it who hath a Sovereign Right to do as He hath done.

For we know</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:004338_0038_100448E008782AC8"/>ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that all things work together for good to them that love God,</hi> Rom. viii. 28.

For it is, <hi>If need be,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that ye are in heavineſs,</hi> I Pet. i 6. Yet there is really the Pity and Love, the merciful and kind Intentions of a Father too, in them; which is a moſt comforting Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the ſupport of good Chriſtians. Prov. iii. 12. <hi>For whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth, even as the father the ſon in where he delighteth.</hi> For tho' God be diſpleaſed with his Children when they walk Careleſly, grow Remiſs &amp; Froward, for which divine Wiſdom ſees it needful to Correct them for the reducing them to their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet it is all in Fatherly Pity and Love, as the Apoſtle teaches, Heb. xii 5, 6, 7. — <hi>For whom the Lord loveth he chaſtemeth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth. If ye endure chaſtning, God dealeth with you as with ſons,</hi> —</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe Christianity teaches us, Never to look upon the Death of our godly Friends as the Loſs of them; but only as their Removal out of a world of Trouble into a glorious Reſt, and to Mourn for them accordingly.</hi> Prov. xiv. 32. — <hi>The righteous hath hope in his death.</hi> I Theſ iv. 14. <hi>For if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus died, and roſe again even ſo them

               <p>I wou'dn't be tho't here to teach, That all Grief &amp; Mourning for godly deceaſed Friends (of whoſe good State we doubt not) is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. No. we may at leaſt weep for our ſelves, if not for them; weep for our loſs, tho' that may be their great gain. But yet, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity teaches us to be moderate and rational in our Sorrows: Becauſe to be Exceſſive on ſuch awful occaſions, looks as if we had no hope. It is to act like the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who have no hope of a better Life after this to moderate their Sorrows for their Dead, whom they look upon as quite loſt. Whereas we <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that have a moſt ſure hope of a glorious State after this (which is infinitely better than to be here, and who believe our godly Friends departed, to be gone to this glorious Reſt reſerved for the People of God in another world, where is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy &amp; Pleaſures evermore) ought never to Mourn their removal as tho' they were loſt, or as tho' we didn't expect to ſee them again with more ſatisfaction than ever in this world, or as tho' they were not now infinitely more happy than they could be with us here. Which hope therefore ſhould more than balance all our grief, and turn all our care into a ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004338_0040_1004486E315015A0"/>Endeavour to follow them in the ſame paths of Holineſs &amp; Devotion, they have gone in before us, that by and by we may be with them in the Joy of our Lord. And this is to Mourn as Chriſtians that have Hope.</p>
               <p>Here then, <hi>Reverend and dear Sir,</hi> Suffer me as a <hi>Brother and Partner with you in your preſent Affliction, and mingling my Tears with yours on this ſolemn Occaſion,</hi> to ſay to you, That you muſt not Mourn the Departure <hi>(not Loſs)</hi> of your dear, vertuous and faithful Conſort (nor yet your own Loſs in her Removal) as tho' you had not a good Hope in her Death, that it is well with her now, and a good Hope in the grace &amp; love of God, that in the Concluſion all ſhall be well with you &amp; well with your Family.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>With reſpect to Her, We truſt you have ſolid ground of Hope that ſhe was well Prepared for an happy Exit out of Time into a glorious Eternity, and therefore that you have abundant reaſon to ſay, It is well with her.</hi> Of this, you will ſuffer me, <hi>Sir,</hi> to remind you how comfortably you ſpake to us on the Day of her ſolemn Interment. And therefore that you have nothing to weep for on her account; which is a happy Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhould qualify and moderate our Mourning. And indeed, if Early Vertue, if a ſpotleſs Liſe in Youth and a pious Walking in riper Years, if a good Profeſſion and a Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable thereunto, be Evidential of the good
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004338_0041_1004494D581EDDA0"/>State of a Chriſtian, as indeed they are, theſe things we agree you have to comfort you reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the well-being of your departed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort. Beſides the clearer Evidence you have had of her Experiences, Self-denials, proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Knowlege and growth in Grace, ſince the time ſhe became yours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>With reſpect to the great Loſs you have ſuſtain'd and the wide Breach her Removal hath made in your Family.</hi> That God in whom you truſt, and whom you ſerve, can make it up to you and yours, in temporal Comforts, but abundantly ſo in ſpiritual Bleſſings &amp; Conſolations, which are far better. And for this, it is the Will of God, that we look to and truſt in Him. I know, <hi>Sir,</hi> you don't need my Inſtructions in theſe things, being able your ſelf to conſider them better and to more advantage than I can repreſent them. But here would I ſhew my willingneſs <hi>to ſtrengthen you with my mouth &amp; the moving of my lips ſhould</hi> (were it in my power) <hi>aſſwage your grief,</hi> Job xvi. 5. And when I can do no more, would I ſtir up your pure Mind by way of remembrance, what Conſolations the Promiſes of God afford good Chriſtians for their Support under all their Troubles, which abide but for a ſeaſon. Pſal. xxx. 5. <hi>His anger en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Once more,</p>

3. <hi>Suffer me,</hi> dear Sir, <hi>to remind you, That it is expected that we who ſuſtain Places of publick Truſt in the Church, ſhould be Examples of Patience and Submiſſion under trying Providences, as well as of Purity, Faith &amp; Charity in the whole Tenour of our Converſation.</hi> That thoſe we Teach, may ſee we are able to Comfort our ſelves with the ſame Conſolations wherewith we are Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to be Comforting them under the like Trials; and to Exerciſe the ſame Patience &amp; humble Submiſſion when tried our ſelves, that we are earneſtly Exhorting them unto.</p>
               <p>To conclude this head, <hi>May God of his free Grace, afford you that Support, Direction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, whereby you may glorifie him in this Trial; and may you be animated &amp; ſtrengthned in your great Work: May you Experience that God is doing of you good by the preſent Affliction, which for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is not joyous but grievous. And may God return in ways of Mercy to your Family, and yet Build it up, delighting in the Proſperity of it.</hi>

Here then,
<list>
                     <item>[1] <hi>Take heed that you Conduct well, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good tho'ts of God under the preſent Trial.</hi> 'Tis a very honourable Teſtimony the Holy Ghoſt gives of <hi>Job</hi>'s conſtancy &amp; good carriage under his heavy Afflictions, That when all was gone, not in the leaſt reflecting on the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Juſtice or Goodneſs of God, in what He had done to him, ſays, Chap i. 21, 22. —<hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; bleſſed be the Name of the Lord. In all this Job ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> Oh! Imitate this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Example. Whatever you do, keep up good thoughts of God under all. Submit to his Wiſdom &amp; Sovereignty. Nay, Bleſs him for his Goodneſs. Give to God the glory due to his great Name. 'Tis our duty and what will give us the comfortable Evidence of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Submiſſion to the Will of God, if we find it in our hearts to Bleſs God when he takes away, as well as when he gives. And if with holy <hi>Job,</hi> we can keep up the ſame good and great Thoughts of God &amp; his Goodneſs under Adverſity, that ever we had in Proſperity, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004338_0044_100448EBD0CF8338"/>are as forward to bleſs him, love &amp; truſt in him as ever; then may we hope our Afflictions are in Mercy and not in Judgment.</item>
                     <item>[2] <hi>Carefully guard againſt impatient Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in your Mourning.</hi> Let your Meditations be ſerious, humble &amp; guarded. Suffer not your ſpirits to be overwhelmed. As we muſt not deſpiſe the Chaſtening of the Lord, by indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence &amp; inconſideration under Afflictions; ſo on the other hand, we muſt not faint, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited or overwhelmed when Rebuked and Chaſtened of the Lord. <hi>If thou faint in the day of adverſity, thy ſtrength is ſmall.</hi> Tho' Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be natural &amp; lawful, yea, and decent too, yet you muſt guard againſt Extreams; ſinful Impatience, or murmuring Reflections.</item>
                     <item>[3] <hi>Be much in Prayer to God for Support under, Direction in, and a Sanctified Improvement of your Afflictions.</hi> By this means you may have them turned into the greateſt Mercies to you. Times of Affliction ſhould be times of Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Prayer. <hi>In the day of adverſity conſider,</hi> Eccl. vii. 14. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> Pſal. l. 15.

                  <hi>Again,</hi> Improve the Providence to convince you how uncertain all creature enjoyments are. Being of ſuch uncertain continuance, that we cannot promiſe our ſelves ſo much as for one Day.

               </p>
               <p>Here then, Brethren, Suffer me to mind you of Two things, Namely,
<list>
                     <item>[1] <hi>That God in the Removal of the Conſort of your faithful Paſtor, is ſeeming to Frown on you in this Place; and now you are called upon to Conſider
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004338_0046_100448EF0A8E1278"/>it &amp; ſuitably to lay it to heart.</hi> In the day of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity Conſider. She was the Conſort and Meet-help of your Paſtor, to alleviate his Cares and make the burden of his Labours among you lighter to him, that he might Serve you with more Freedom &amp; Agility; and ſo in this ſenſe was publickly Serviceable among you. But now ſhe can Aſſiſt &amp; Comfort him no more; nor ſhall you enjoy her Friendſhip &amp; Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, her good Wiſhes &amp; Prayers any more. And is not this to be look'd upon as a Frown of divine Providence, and ought you not to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon it as ſuch? Beſides, when ſuch Fruitful Chriſtians are taken away, the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence carries a warning Aſpect in it, eſpecially to the Careleſs and Secure, who may well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as a Warning to them. 1 Pet. iv. 17. <hi>For the time</hi> is come <hi>that judgment muſt begin at the houſe of God; and i</hi> it <hi>firſt</hi> begin <hi>at us, what ſhall the End</hi> be <hi>of them that obey not the goſpel of God?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>[2] <hi>Suffer me to mind you of your Duty to your Reverend Paſtor, under his preſent melancholy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</hi> That you do all that you can to Comfort him; and by your kind Offices to Aſſiſt him under the preſent broken Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Family. <hi>To him that is afflicted pity</hi> ſhould be ſhewed <hi>from his friend,</hi> Job vi. 14. The afflicted ſtate of your Paſtor beſpeaks your Compaſſions in the words of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap xix 21
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004338_0047_1004495B4670F4D0"/>
                        <hi>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, Oh! ye my friends, for the hand of God hath touched me.</hi> And there's not a little of Religion in this, <hi>Jam.</hi> i. 27 Conſider, <hi>Brethren,</hi> His Work is great, his Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den heavy: The care of his Family will now wholly devolve upon him. Therefore be not wanting to eaſe his Burden as much as may be. Now confirm your Love to him when he moſt needs it. And if you ſhould afford him ſome farther aſſiſtance under the riſing Charges of his Family, it would doubtleſs be a ſacrifice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable &amp; well pleaſing to the Lord <note n="†" place="bottom">Tho' while I am Tranſcribing this, I can't but in Juſtice add, That ſince my Preaching this Sermon, I have with great ſatisfaction heard the Reverend Mr. <hi>Lovett</hi> Relate how many kind Offices the People of <hi>New-Salem</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the People of his Charge) have done for him; and how ready they were to Oblige him with their Company and kind Aſſiſtance, in the Time of his ſore Affliction in his Family.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſecond &amp; laſt Branch of the Exhortation, is, To all, That you would ſo improve theſe Truths and live ſuch a life of Vertue &amp; Piety, as that when you ſhall go the way of all Fleſh, you may leave behind you thoſe comfortable Evidences of your good State, which may give your ſurviving Friends occaſion to ſay, to their Comfort &amp; the honour of your Name,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004338_0048_100449748BC09F08"/>It is well with them;</hi> as in the Text. And in order to this,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>Conſider, what your preſent State is, and how you Live.</hi> Is your State ſuch as would be ſafe for you to Die in? Had the late Summons of Death been for you, had it found you prepar'd? Had you been at reſt in <hi>Abram</hi>'s boſom? Think now of this matter ſeriouſly. Which of us muſt next follow, God only knows. We had need give diligence to be Ready. Have you then made your Peace with God, and obtain'd the comforts of a Pardon? Have you indeed been ſo convinc'd of Sin, of Righteouſneſs and of Judgment, as that it hath bro't you to throw down your weapons of Rebellion, &amp; to come in &amp; ſubmit yourſelves intirely to the grace &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Goſpel? Have you indeed clos'd with a Saviour, and receiv'd the Atonement?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> Do you indeed live a Chriſtian life, a life of Faith &amp; Repentance, of Devotion and Charity? Review your paſt conduct, What hath your Converſation been? Has it been in <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity &amp; godly Sincerity?</hi> Or havn't you rather been <hi>indulging your Appetires, Luſts &amp; Paſſions in exorbitant &amp; ſinful Practiſes?</hi> If you have indulg'd your ſelves in Eaſe and carnal Security, then what is your State? Suffer me to deal plainly, If you have liv'd in the ſinful neglect of ſome Duties, and in the careleſs performance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; if in the neglect of Family or Secret
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004338_0049_1004495CF8F4B810"/>Prayer, or both; or if you attend theſe but in a formal, cuſtomary manner, without a heart, will not this Evidence you to be in a graceleſs State? And then how can you think of Death and Judgment, without amazement? Do any live in <hi>Intemperate Practiſes,</hi> in <hi>Pride, Wantonneſs and Profaneneſs, in Revellings and Contentions; for which things ſake, the wrath of God cometh on the children of Diſobedience.</hi> And are not ſuch <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the Croſs of Chriſt?</hi> What then is your condition? Phil. iii. 18, 19. <hi>For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping,</hi> That they are <hi>the enemies of the croſs of Chriſt; whoſe end</hi> is <hi>deſtruction, whoſe god</hi> is <hi>their belly, and whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who mind earthly things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) and to Conclude, <hi>Be adviſed to be thorough in the great buſineſs of your Souls.</hi> Don't Triſle in buſineſs of the laſt moment. Your Souls &amp; the Redemption of them is precious. If the Soul be Loſt, there is nothing can Compenſate for the Loſs of it. <hi>For what ſhall it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit a man, if he ſhall gain the whole world &amp; loſe his own ſoul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> Mark viii. 36, 37. Your turn alſo will come to Die, and who knows how ſoon? <hi>For what is your life? It is even as a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away,</hi> Jam. iv. 14. Give diligence then to be Ready. And as you would be ſo, ſee to it that you be Converted; That a Saving Change do paſs upon you. Without this you vainly hope to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Then improve <hi>your Time</hi> with Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; Work whileſt <hi>the Day lasts.</hi> Make your Calling &amp; Election ſure, <hi>For ſo an Entrance ſhall be adminiſtred to you abundanily into the Everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 11.</p>
