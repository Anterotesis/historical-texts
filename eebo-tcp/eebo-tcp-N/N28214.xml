            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN sickness at stomach, especially when attended with pain in the head, loss of appetite, or indigestion, or when the person is threatened with a fever, dissolve one of these Powders in a tea cup full of warm water: let the person take a wine-glass of it every 15 minutes, until it operates sufficiently—drinking freely of warm water during the operation.</p>
               <p>Should a Puke at any time over work, half a tumbler of hot strong brandy grog, with 25 drops of laudanum may be taken to check it.</p>

               <p>In high burning fever, especially in pleurisy, rheumatic, or any other fever where there is great heat and thirst, give a teaspoonful of this powder in a tea cup full of balm or other herb tea; it may be repeated once in 2 or 3 hours, or oftener, if the heat, pain and thirst be great. In case of pleurisy, lung or rheumatic fever, where the pain and fever are great, bleeding in the first place may be proper.</p>

               <p>This medicine is proper to be given in the commencement of all fevers, and may be given every hour or hour and half, in balm or other herb tea, until plentiful sweating is produced.—They may be taken in snakeroot tea, when a person has taken a bad cold, every hour and half, until a free sweat is produced. They are more particularly proper in snakeroot tea, when there is a sore throat attending the cold.</p>

It is particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be given in diarrhoea, or in other cases where gentle purging is wanted, one of these Powders may be given in a little molasses; during the operation let the patient drink freely of water gruel.

               <p>Good in all violent pains, cholic, rheumatism, &amp;c. or to moderate the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent working of physic; also to procure sleep when wanted. From 25 to 35 drops is a dose, in wine and water, or tea. It is proper to put upon a fresh wound where it is very painful, and may be repeated so often as to keep the dressings wet until it relieves the pain. In case of cramp or violent spasm at the stomach, this may be given in a dose of 35 or 40 drops, and repeated (if it remains violent) every hour and half, or hour, until it relieves the pain. It should be given immediately in case of cramp, spasm, or violent cholic. 15 or 20 drops of Peppermint may be added to the dose in cramp at the stomach or bad cholic.</p>

be taken in a glass of wine, or brandy and water. These Bitters are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be given in almost all cases of debility, especially where the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is troubled with weakness at stomach, indigestion and want of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. They may be given twice, three or four times in 24 hours, as the nature of the case may require.</p>

               <p>Good in pains of the stomach; cholicy pain attended with wind; in trembling and nervous complaints, and in sea-sickness; 20 or 30 drops may be taken on sugar, or in a tea cup of warm water for a dose; and repeated as occasion may require.</p>

               <head>No. 9.—BARK.</head>
               <p>Proper in almost all cases of debility, particularly in intermittent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Previous to giving it, administer Purge No. 2. It is also proper in all putrid and nervous fevers, especially in the throat distemper.—Dose, a teaspoonful to be taken in a little wine, or water, and repeated once in two, three or four hours as occasion may require. In intermittent fever, or fever and ague (as it is called) should the disorder not give way by administering a Purge No. 2, and the use of the Bark for a week or fortnight, administer a Puke No. 1 when the patient first perceives the cold is coming on—afterwards use the Bark once in 2 or 3 hours. If this does not break it up at the coming on of the ague ſit, give 25 or 30 drops of Laudanum, and continue the Bark as before; which treatment will seldom fail of effecting a cure. In putrid fevers add to a dose of the Bark 10 or 16 drops of Elixir Vitriol No. 10, which will contribute very much to its efficacy. N. B.—In dangerous cases where the Bark is used it may be given as often and in as large doses as the stomach will bear. It should be given at the going off of fevers of all kinds.</p>

               <p>This medicine has long been in great repute, not only as a cathartic, but as a warm stomachic medicine in cold, phlegmatic habits, especially where there is a cold sensation, with pain at the stomach. It should be given in the dose of half a table spoonful, 3 or 4 times in the course of 24 hours, and oftener if need be, when it will seldom fail to relieve the above described complaint, by gently stimulating the stomach, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bowels. Dose, as a purge, from 2 to 4 table spoonfuls. It is a proper purge to be given in all cases where warm and stimulating purges are wanted. It has a good effect on those who have long been in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of using ardent spirit.</p>

Let it remain 4 or 5 days before removing the dressings. This Balsam is remarkable for easing the pain and accelerating the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fresh wounds.

               <p>BEING convinced from my own observation that sailors suffer more from the venerial disease, than all others, I have been induced to pay par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention, in writing these directions to provide the most proper and efficacious remedies for it in its various stages. I shall now attempt to give a plain and concise description of the disease in its various stages, and point out with as much precision as possible the different species, and the forms under which it appears. Much has been said by the most able writers on this disease to prove that gonorrhoea or clap, and syphilis or pox, are specifically distinct, and different diseases. Others have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with ability, and have clearly proved by experiments and facts, that the morbid poison which produces a gonorrhoea virulenta, or clap, may be productive of syphilis or pox. The latter opinion I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded is correct from my own observation, for I have frequently seen ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of clap where from inattention to cleanliness in the patient, the matter which was discharged from the urethra has been allowed to lodge about the glands penis, and has produced very obstinate and troublesome chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres. I have also seen cases where chancres were the first complaint that appeared, and where I believe the patient had not been connected with any other person, and the gonorrhoea afterwards came on, I am therefore clearly of an opinion that a simple gonorrhoea or clap is not so very sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a disease as is maintained by Mr. Bell, and some other writers on the subject, and his mode of treating it will I know from my own observation, often fail of effecting a radical cure.</p>
               <p>The preceding remedies I have been in the constant use of for sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al years past, and with universal success, some of which are of my own invention. In writing a plain, concise, and short description of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, I shall allude to the numbers adapted to the cure of particular symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and by careful attention any person on board a vessel may be cured as effectually as if under the care of a physician. Yet the patient has
<pb facs="unknown:037604_0011_100EE8C1004B60E0"/>
much to do. It is very necessary to avoid as much as possible the use of violent exercise, salt and high seasoned provisions, and strictly to abstain from the use of ardent spirit, and the free use of wine. Avoid exposure to wet and cold as much as possible. With these precautions and strict at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the directions, in recent cases, the patient may in a short time be effectually cured. Gonorrhoea virulenta or clap generally makes its appearance from two to five days after contracted. The first symptoms are a slight itching, which is followed by a slight twinging pain, and soon some scalding of the urine at the entrance of the penis. The running ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally follows in a few days, and the above symptoms increase, and chor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee frequently follows in a few days if nothing is done to mitigate the complaint.</p>
               <p>After a person has been connected with a suspicious woman and these symptoms follow, take a Pill No. 43, every night, make free use of Gum Arabic or Flaxseed Tea for constant drink, take two teaspoonfuls of Sugar of Lead No. 39, dissolve it in a pint of rain water, wash the end of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis five or six times a day; continue this course for four or five days, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the inflammatory symptoms have abated. Then take a Powder No. 44, dissolve as there directed, fill a Syringe, carefully introduce it into the end of the penis, throw it up, contract the end of the penis so as to keep it up for the space of one minute, repeat three times in this way for once using. Use three times a day and continue until the running abates entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If in the course of the disease there should be a troublesome chordee, and a painful soreness extending up the urethra, throw up a little Sweet Oil three or four times a day, and rub a little Mercurial Ointment exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally upon the urethra twice a day, which will generally soon remove the complaint.</p>
               <p>Under the above mode of treatment a simple clap will generally be cured in two or three weeks, yet they sometimes are very obstinate and do not readily yield, and an obstinate gleet remains. In these cases I have found the Mercury Drops No. 51 to succeed better than any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine I have been in the use of, see directions for taking. The Balsam Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paiva is a medicine in some repute for the cure of old gleets, and when they remain obstinate, and other things fail, it ought to tried, see No. 45 for directions in taking.</p>
               <p>It frequently happens in a clap that there is much inflammation and scalding, and sometimes a painful phymosis which is when the preputium or foreskin is so inflamed and swollen that it will not pass back over the glands penis, and paraphymosis, which is where the preputium or foreskin gets back of the glands penis and becomes so inflamed and swoln that it cannot pass forward. In these cases where the inflammatory symptoms run high, it will be necessary to bleed, and in addition to taking the Pills, a dose of Salts may be taken every other day, dissolve a teaspoonful of Nitre in a tumbler of Flaxseed or Gum Arabic tea, let it be taken 2 or 3 times a day, this will relieve the violence of the scalding. In case of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosis or paraphymosis, take half a pint of rain water and half a pint of sharp vinegar, dissolve 2 teaspoonfuls of Sugar of Lead in it, keep a linen rag wet applied constantly. If that does not remove the swelling and in flammation in 2 or 3 days, take of the same solution, and pound ship bread perfectly fine, make a poultice and apply that; repeat as often as necessary, until the swelling and inflammation subsides. Should there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main any hardness or thickness of the prepuce after the inflammation is gone, rub in a little Mercurial Ointment twice or three times a day until it goes off. Swelled testicles is a complaint which is frequently attendant on gonorrhoea virulenta. When it is occasioned by a sudden suppression of the running, warm fomentations applied to the penis, such as immersing the penis in warm milch, wetting flannels in warm milch and water, or Flax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed tea, kept constantly applied, and injecting sweet oil warm, will gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally bring on a return of the running and frequently relieve the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and swelling. Should not this succeed, and there is much inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pain, take a solution of Sugar of Lead, as above mentioned and keep a cloth wet with it cold, constantly applied. If this does not
<pb facs="unknown:037604_0012_100EE8C327347408"/>
succeed, make a poultice as directed in paraphymosis, and keep it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly applied. It will be necessary to keep the bowels gently open by giving Castor Oil or Salts, and afterwards if there is much pain give 40 drops of Laudanum, and repeat it occasionally if the pain be severe. Where there is much inflammation and pain, blood taken from the scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum by leeches, or scarifying with a lancet, will give much relief, but had better not be attempted unless by a physician, but take from the arm 12 or 16 ounces of blood. The testicles, during the inflammation and swelling, should always be kept suspended in a pouch, made of flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, if to be had, steaming them over warm vinegar where there is much hardness and pain, will generally give much relief, and may be done ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often. In some cases after the pain and inflammation have subsided, there will remain an obstinate hardness of the testicle. For this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint rub in a small piece of Mercurial Ointment twice or three times a day, and take of the Mercury Drops night and morning.</p>
               <p>In all cases of clap strict attention ought to be paid to cleanliness. If the matter which is discharged from the urethra is allowed to lodge about the glands penis, it is very apt to produce troublesome chancres. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ought a number of times every day to wash the penis thoroughly in milch and water, or water. This will make the cure much more speedy. Be very cautious not to tie any thing about the penis which will in the least obstruct a free circulation. I have seen several very bad and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cases of paraphymosis produced solely by this cause. I have likewise seen severe cases of swelled testicles produced in this way.</p>
               <p>It sometimes happens in a clap, that there is occasioned by the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the urethra, such a degree of spasm and stricture, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a total suppression of urine. In this case take a Bougee, oil it with sweet oil, carefully introduce it into the urethra, pass it up until it enters the bladder, let it remain for a short time, which will generally take off the spasm in such a degree that by withdrawing it the urine will flow freely. Repeat the use of it again if necessary. Whenever this stricture should happen, after obtaining a discharge of the urine, throw up sweet oil five or six times a day.</p>
               <p>Lues veneria, syphilis, or pox, is that species of disorder which is considered as the most difficult of cure. The system is considered as affected generally with the venerial virus. It makes its appearance in various parts of the body and in various forms; some of the principal are chancres about the glands penis, buboes in the groin, ulcers in the throat, foul obstinate ulcers about the legs and other parts of the body, carious bones, venerial blotches on the skin of a copper colour, venerial nodes or swelling of the periosteum (a substance which covers the bones), veneri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al warts, ulcers in the nose, violent inflammation which sometimes ends in a loss of the eye sight.</p>
               <p>When any of the above symptoms appear, it will be necessary to take Mercury enough to produce a sore mouth, unless the complaint gives way before. In case of chancres, while taking the Mercurial Pills, dress with the Salve No. 48. Should they be obstinate and not heal in the course of two or three weeks, dissolve a small piece of Blue Stone in a little water, and touch them with that once a day. If this does not effect a cure, take a little Basillicon Salve, mix with it Red Precipitate enough to make it quite red; dress twice a day with this spread on a piece of rag or Lint, and immediately applied to the sores. All obstinate veneri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ulcers are to be treated in the same way as chancres.</p>
               <p>In case of bubo or hard swelling in the groin while taking the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Pills, rub a small piece of Mercurial Ointment twice or three times a day upon the swelling and the inside of the thigh as low down as the knee. Should not the swelling go off in the course of two or three weeks, but become hard and painful, it will be necessary to poultice it and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to bring it to a head. After it becomes perfectly soft, and the matter is felt to fluctuate in the tumour, and it is pointed, take the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet and lay it open so that the matter may be discharged. If there
<pb facs="unknown:037604_0013_100EE8C5485FD838"/>
should remain much hardness after the matter is discharged, lay a little Lint over the orifice, and poultice until it subsides, then dress with Basillicon Salve. Should the sore be foul, and not heal kindly, mix Red Precipitate with the Salve and dress with that.</p>
               <p>Venerial warts are sometimes very troublesome. When they make their first appearance, touch them once or twice a day, with the Lunar Caustic, and mix a large proportion of Red Precipitate with Basillison Salve, spread it upon a little Lint or a piece of rag and apply it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the wart. Dress once a day. The Blue Stone may also be applied as caustic to venerial warts.</p>
               <p>In venerial sore throat the principal dependence is on the exhibition of Mercury internally. After the Mercury has been given some time and the ulcers do not heal; make a strong decoction of White Oak Bark, and let the patient gorgle his throat often with that. Should the ulcers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear high edged and foul, dissolve a small piece of Blue Stone in a little water, make a swab by winding two round the end of a stick, dip it into this solution, and touch the ulcers once or twice a day. If the White Oak Bark is not to be obtained, make a strong decoction of Bark No. 9, and use that for a gorgle.</p>
               <p>The principal dependence in the cure of venerial nodes or enlarged bones, is the internal exhibition of Mercury. It should be continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the mouth become sore, and a tenderness of the gum should be kept up for two or three weeks. Where there is much pain and restlessness during the night, give 40 drops of Laudanum. It often happens that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a person has had the venerial disease several times, that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a troublesome eruption upon the prepuce and glands penis. For this complaint take one teaspoonful of Sugar of Lead and the same quantity of Calomel, add half a pint of rain water, shake it throughly every time of using it, wash 4 times a day; this is a very effectual reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This wash used once or twice a day assists much in the cure of chancres.</p>
               <p>Ulcers in the nose from venerial infection are to be treated much in the same way as venerial sore throat. If it does not give way by the use of Mercury till the mouth become sore, which should be kept so for two weeks, inject into the nose the solution of Sugar of Lead and Calomel twice a day.</p>
               <p>In all the above cases of syphilis or pox, where they have been of long standing and obstinate, I have found the Mercury Drops to be the most effectual remedy; they may be taken much longer without producing a sore mouth than the other preparations of Mercury, and the patient is not so apt to take cold on exposure to wet and cold. It is an extremely useful and efficacious medicine in old bad cases.</p>
               <p>In all the above cases, after the use of Mercury, if there is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the Bark should be taken 3 or 4 times a day until appetite and strength returns.</p>

If it be an arm or leg, let one person take hold of the limb below the fracture, and gently pull, while another places his hand upon the fracture and places the bones in their right place. If the limb is strait, of equal length, and every other way corresponds with the other, you may generally conclude that the bone is reduced into its right place. Carefully bathe the limb with brandy and vinegar, or brandy; then pass a flannel bandage a number of times round the limb 5 inches above and 5 below the fracture; upon the bandage place four splints, 10 or 12 inches long, covered with tow, at equal distance from each other, securing them with any convenient string; bathe it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently through the bandage with brandy, or Sugar of Lead water, and should it swell so as to make the bandage too tight, loosen it occasionally as may be necessary.</p>

               <head>WOUNDS.</head>
               <p>In bad wounds there is often a profuse bleeding, which requires the first and most particular attention. The application of dry Lint, and a bandage, will often succeed; but if an artery of any considerable bigness is injured, and the blood spirts out largely, you must form some tight compression between the wound and the trunk of the body, or heart, which will stop the discharge till you can find the bleeding, and secure it with your needle. If it be an arm or a leg that is wounded or taken off, take a strong handkerchief or large cord, and tie it moderately tight some way above the wound; if the injury is below the knee or elbow, it will be best to fix the cord 2 or three inches above the knee or elbow, and put a round short piece of wood or cane beneath the cord; by turning the cane you tighten the cord till it stops the blood; let some person hold the cane in this position till you wipe the blood from the wound, then let him slack the cord till the blood spirts out, at which time fix your eye upon the vessel, order the cord again tightened, and keep sight of the vessel till you pass your needle, which is crooked, along side of the vessel, about a quarter of an inch deep, and draw the thread half through; then enter the needle near where it came out, and pass it up the other side of the blood vessel, so that the point may come out near where you entered it; then draw the thread through and tie it tight, and you will find it will stop the bleeding of that vessel. If there be others that bleed, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them in the same manner; after which you must take off the cord, and dress the wound with Lint, bandage, &amp;c. After the first dressing, it is best to let the wound go 3 or 4 days before opening it, after which it may be dressed every, or every other day. If the discharge of matter be considerable, apply a little Lint over the wound, and over that a plais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Basillicon; but when there is little or no discharge of matter, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply simply a plaister of Healing Salve.</p>

               <p>Which are most incident to people in India, are the bilious or remitting fever, and the liver disease. The first is known by the following symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. It generally comes on suddenly, and begins with a sense of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb facs="unknown:037604_0015_100ED34B6EB93650"/>
and great lowness of spirits. These symptoms are attended with a greater or less degree of chilliness, a giddiness, nausea, pains in the head and loins, and a trembling of the hand; the countenance has a pale or yellow cast, the skin is commonly dry, the eyes dull and sometimes yellow; and as the disease advances, the sickness of the stomach increases, and often an obstinate vomiting takes place. As soon as the person is seized with the above symptoms, it will be proper to give him a purge of Jalap and Calomel (one of the Powders No. 2) in a little molasses; if the first dose should not operate in 4 hours, give another; and if the second dose should be vomited up without taking effect, dissolve a dose of Salts in a gill of hot water, and add a table spoonful of vinegar to it, and when cold give the patient one quarter part of it every hour, till it produces a free discharge by the bowels. If the patient should be much exhausted by the purge, it will be proper to give him 30 drops of Laudanum. If the fever the next day should remit, give the patient two teaspoonfuls of Bark in wine or porter, every 2 hours; but if the pain in the head should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main obstinate, and the fever and sickness should be violent, it will be better to repeat the medicine given the first day. Should the patient's skin be dry, and the thirst and fever very violent, it will be proper to give him on the third day the following medicine: dissolve a powder of Tartar Emetic (No. 1) and a dose of Salts in a gill of hot water, and when cold let the patient take 2 table spoonfuls every 2 hours until a free discharge is excited. If the patient should be thirsty, let him drink free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Cream of Tartar beverage. As soon as the stomach and bowels are thoroughly cleansed, the principal part of the cure must depend on the Bark, which must be given as freely as the stomach can bear. During the whole course of the disease a costive habit must be avoided by taking the purges above mentioned, and by drinking the Cream of Tartar beverage. If the bark should prove purgative, from 5 to 10 drops of Laudanum may be added to each dose as occasion may require.</p>

If the salivation should incline to be violent, it may be moderated by laying aside the Pills and Ointment for a short time, and give a little Flour of Sulphur night and morning to keep the bowels open. If the Mercury should incline to run off by the bowels, give 15 or 20 drops of Laudanum once or twice a day as may be necessary.
