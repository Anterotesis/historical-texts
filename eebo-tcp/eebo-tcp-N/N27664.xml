            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CONFESSION OF JOSEPH BAKER, (CANADIAN BY BIRTH.)</head>
            <p>Conſidering the awfulneſs of my ſituation, the dreadful tribunal before which I muſt appear, there to give an account to a jealous and much-offended (but juſt and merciful God) of all my vile and wicked crimes, committed at this early time of life, I deem it a duty I owe to captain Wheland, and to the community, in general, to give a clear and circumſtantial account of the horrid act, and of all the circumſtances leading thereto, ſo that ſuch of my fellow-men as follow the ſeas, might take warning at my fate, and learn to fear God; to ſhun ſuch wicked prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, and thereby avoid thoſe diſagreeable feelings which I have and am now ſuffering, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious and untimely end to which I muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be brought.</p>
            <p>I was born in the year 1779, at Les-trois-riviers, in Canada, in a ſtreet called Forge-ſtreet. I was eighteen years old when I left my father, and went to Lake Champlain, from there I went to Virginia, on Lake Champlain, being ſixty miles from the line of Canada: In June, 1799, I work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my paſſage in a boat from thence to Albany and New-York, where I went to work in company with another Canadian, at making ſtaves, and continued in that employment 8 days, at two dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars per day; to the other man, with whom I worked, I lent money to pay for his lodging, and gave the remainder of my money and clothes in
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:036873_0003_100B287DB0FC0230"/>
his charge, with all which he run off: I then went in the country to one colonel Robiſts, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one miles from New-York, and got from him a recommendation to obtain work at the ſhip-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter's buſineſs. On my return to New-York, there I became acquainted with one Pierre Lewis Lacroix, (who is now under the unhappy ſentence with myſelf, for the ſame crime.) One evening I went to a tavern in company with Lacroix; and, in converſation, he aſked me where I lodged? I told him where my lodgings were, and the next day he (in company with Brous, now under the ſame ſentence alſo) called upon me: they told me I was a fool to ſtay in ſuch a country as this was, when, if I would go the Weſt-Indies and work at my trade, I could get five dollars per day. They told me of an Engliſh veſſel at New-York, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eighteen guns, which was bound to Jamaica, with a cargo of flour and lumber. I went and entered on board of this veſſel as ſhip-carpenter. There were ſeven Italians and Frenchmen on board this veſſel, who propoſed to me to enter into a ſecret conſpiracy for ſuprizing the captain and crew on her voyage to the Weſt-Indies, and make ourſelves maſters of the ſhip and cargo: But I would not agree to their propoſal, and, therefore, quitted the ſhip; in conſequence of which, Pierre Lewis Lacroix and Joſeph Brous, quitted her alſo. I came to Philadelphia on the twentieth of Auguſt, 1799, and took up lodgings at a board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe in Water-ſtreet, in company with Pierre Lewis Lacroix: The before-mentioned Brous, having found out where we lodged, came and took lodgings in the ſame houſe. As I did not like the company of Brous, I told Pierre Lewis Lacroix, to let us go, and look out for a veſſel that was going to the Weſt-Indies, and quit Brous. We found one captain Wheland who was bound to St. Thomas. I enquired of him if he wanted any hands: he told me he wanted two,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036873_0004_100B2881EA2BBEF0"/>
and ſhipped Lacroix and myſelf at twenty-five dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars per month, Lacroix and myſelf then went to another part of the city to lodge, till the veſſel ſhould be ready to ſail; but, unfortunately, we meet with Brous in the ſtreet, and he aſked me to lend him three dollars, for the purpoſe of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his board. I accordingly lent it to him, and told him I never wanted to ſee him any more. The next Monday morning Lacroix and myſelf went on board the veſſel to ſtay; and, to our great ſurprize, we ſaw Brous on board at work. I then aſked him if he was ſhipped with the veſſel? he told me he was to work his paſſage. We told him that this was not the way to go to the Havannah, as he ſaid he meant to do. He told me he would find ſome veſſel at St. Kitts that would be going to the Havannah. After which, the captain took him to the merchant to ſign articles to work his paſſage. The merchant aſked him what country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he was: he told him he was an Italian. The merchant told him it was not true, for he was a Frenchman, and he had no paſſage for him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the captain told him to go on board to work, and he would pay him for what he did: the captain that afternoon told him he would give him his paſſage, although the merchant had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it. He accordingly went on board the veſſel, and we ſailed from Philadelphia, bound to St. Thomas, on the 27th Auguſt, 1799. The 4th Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember following, being at ſea, Brous aſked me if I would aſſiſt him in taking the veſſel. I told him I would not. After which, he put the ſame queſtion to Lacroix. He alſo told him he would have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do with it; but he continually harraſſed us for three days to conſent to his wicked propoſal: Lacroſe then told him, that if he would take the veſſel, he (Lacroix) would take her into port. He then aſked me to take ſome poiſon out of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine-cheſt, and put ſome in the ſoup, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of deſtroying the captain, and the three other
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036873_0005_100B28836E9C7308"/>
men. I told him that I had not ſo hard an heart as to kill any man. I then aſked him if he had a heart hard enough to kill a man? yes, ſays he, and if I had fifty of them tied hand and foot, I could kill them all, and my father at the head of them too. I told him that my heart was not ſo hard as all that come to Brous then told me that he was an officer in the ſervice of the French Republic; and ſaid, that if I did not conſent to aſſiſt in taking the veſſel, that the firſt French cruiſer they came up with, he would report me thereto, and have me ſhot. I told him I was not a Frenchman, but was a Canadian. He told me that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me to be a Frenchman, and not a Canadian, and that general de Forneaux would take his word before he would mine. I told him that I would ſee that, and he ſaid it was very well. I was in hopes every day that ſome American or Engliſh veſſel would come in ſight, as I intended to have reported to captain Wheland what Brous had ſaid; but, unfortunately for us, we met with none. About two days after Brous and I had had the foregoing converſation, Brous again aſked me (at about 10 o'clock at night) if I was ready to help him to take the veſſel? I told him I would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with it. He then replied, "I will begin, and you muſt take care of yourſelf," and called me a coward. Next night, about ten o'clock, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me to light a candle. I, accordingly, was about doing ſo, when the mate aſked me where I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I told him I was about lighting a candle for the binnacle, and when I brought up the candle, I found the mate lying dead on the companion. Brous had an axe in his hand, and Lacroix had a handſpike in his, ſtanding ſide by ſide. They told me to go down and take the captain's ſword, and if he was a-ſleep, to run it through his body, and if I did not do it, they would kill me: I went down, but I could not find it in my heart to kill the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but ſtruck him on the hand with a hatchet:
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036873_0006_100B28872D7BD450"/>
he then jumped up, and made a catch at me, and I then ſtruck him on the head. Immediately I ran up on deck: Brous then attempted to kill me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had not killed the captain: I told him I had not the heart to kill him.</p>
            <p>Lacroix ſtood on the companion, with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpike in his hand, to kill the firſt man that came up. The ſupercargo came up, with a piſtol in each hand, and Lacroix knocked him down with the handſpike: Lacroix then told me to lower the peak of the chain-ſail; but, juſt as I was going to do it, I obſerved the ſupercargo coming after me, with a piſtol in each hand, to kill me. I then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behind me, and ſaw a ſtick, which I picked up and ſtruck him with, and knocked him down. All this time the captain was below, and called out to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croix. I aſked what he wanted; he told me to ſave his life. Brous told the captain to come up; the captain ſaid, "you will kill me if I do." I told him to ſtay down, and ſurrender himſelf a priſoner of war. The captain then ſaid he would. Lacroix then went down to bring up ſome liquor, and called me down to help to bring up the ſupercargo on deck. Brous and myſelf went down and brought him up. We then laid him down till Lacroix brought ſome liquor to waſh his wounds, but Brous ſaid he would give him liquor enough; and immediately threw him overboard, though he was yet living. Brous told us to come along with him and kill the ſailor in the forcaſtle: I told him I would not. Brous bid me go down to the ſailor. I accordingly did ſo. the ſailor aſked me if I wanted to kill him? I told him, that I did not, but that Brous did. He aſked me where Brous was: I told him he was on deck, laying in wait to kill him: he then jumped on deck to catch Brous, but, before he could get to him, Brous ſtruck him with a handſpike, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him. He then threw him overboard. We had now killed all but the captain, who conſidered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a priſoner of war. About four days after,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036873_0007_100B2888B4376E80"/>
Lacroix found a bottle of opium in the medicine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt; he told me to take care of it. I took it, and hid it: Brous came to me afterwards, and aſked me where the bottle was? he ſaid he wanted to give ſome to the captain to drink, ſo as it might kill him: I told him I had loſt it; but, a little time after, he found another bottle of the ſame kind, which he ſaid he would keep himſelf, and give it to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to drink, as ſoon as we ſaw a veſſel heave in ſight; ſo that he might ſay that all hands had died on board, except us three I told the captain of his danger, that Brous was determined to kill him the very firſt veſſel we ſaw. The captain ſaid he could not help it; but he would do the beſt he could to ſave himſelf.</p>
            <p>The next day the captain told me he was ſick, and deſired me to go and get ſome ham for him: La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croix and myſelf went down to get ſome for him, and when we went down, the captain took the axe and knocked Brous down. He then immediately <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ocked down the forecaſtle, ſo that we could not get up. Lacroix told me to aſſiſt him below, in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the maſt down, ſo that it might fall, and tear up the deck, that we might get out: I told him that I did not want to do ſo, and, in conſequence of my refuſal, he abuſed me very much, and ſaid I was a coward. We were fourteen days in the hold before we got to St. Bartholomews, and, during that time, we lived upon flour and water, and ſome liquor. After we arrived at St. Bartholomews, the captain put us on board an American armed veſſel, the lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of which abuſed us in a violent manner, and put ropes round our necks: we remained in this ſituation three days, and then we were taken to St. Kitts, where we were put in priſon and kept in irons, on five ounces of bread and water per day for nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days. We were then put on board the United States ſloop of war Ganges, and were in irons eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, ſleeping on deck all the while. Brous and Lacroix told me to declare myſelf a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036873_0008_100B288BC38CAD18"/>
at the peril of my life. They alſo told me, if I would conſent to this declaration, each of them would give me the 700 dollars; to which I conſented. We arrived at Philadelphia on the 12th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1799, and were landed from on board the Ganges, conducted to priſon under guard, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately lodged in the cells. 'Tis but juſtice I owe to the inſpectors, and to every keeper about the priſon, to ſay, that we have always been treated with every degree of humanity, and, in every reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as well as the nature of our ſituations could admit of, received full allowance, nor were we ever put in irons until after we received the fatal (tho' juſt) condemnation of death, (and that by order of the court.)</p>
            <p>And now, having finiſhed my narration, and the time approaching faſt when I muſt ſuffer the juſt reward due to the horrid crime in which I have been too great a participator, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing move for me to add, but to declare that I die in the full belief of the Roman Catholic religion <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
