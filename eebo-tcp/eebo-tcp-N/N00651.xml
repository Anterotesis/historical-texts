            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THERE have been few Churches in the World ſo <hi>lifted up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in Reſpect of a Succeſſion of Supereminent Miniſters of the Goſpel, as the Church in <hi>Cambridge</hi> ha's been. <hi>Hooker, Shepard, Mitchel, Oakes</hi> (all of them <hi>yours</hi>) were <hi>Great Lights.</hi> You know that if <hi>Light</hi> ha's been brought into a Room, when it is Removed, the Place becomes <hi>Darker,</hi> than if never any ſuch <hi>Light</hi> had been there.

who was from them removed to plant Churches for Chriſt, in this <hi>American Deſart</hi>: And pray's them to Conſider,

               <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and a <hi>Congregational</hi> man, (who are nevertheleſs <hi>United Brethren</hi>) is this. There is no <hi>Congregational</hi> man, but he <hi>reports to the Church</hi> ſomething of what the perſon deſiring Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, has Related to him; which the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> does not, only Declares his own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and giveth the Brethren a Liberty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the Converſation of the <hi>Admittendi.</hi> I know <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who are ſtricter in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations and Admiſſions, than ſome <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> men. It appears therefore, that ſuch <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> into the <hi>Spiritual Eſtate</hi> of them, who are to be Admitted unto full Communion, in all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Goſpel, is no <hi>Singular</hi> or <hi>Novel</hi> Practice: Nothing but what is confirmed by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Antiquity,</hi> and has been ſtrenuouſly Aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Great <hi>Reformers,</hi> both of the former, and this preſent Age. Whether the <hi>Brethren,</hi> as well as the <hi>Elders</hi> ſhould not be concerned as <hi>Judges,</hi> concerning the Qualifications of thoſe whom they Receive into their Communion, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Queſtion,</hi> which I ſhall not here enlare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is certain, that in the <hi>Primitive Ages</hi> of the Church, they had that Liberty; otherwiſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> would never have ſaid, <hi>Vix Plebi perſuadeo ut Tales patiantur admitti,</hi> &amp;c. And elſewhere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his Obligations, and Reſolutions, <hi>Nihil ſine conſenſu plebis, privata ſententia gerere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo certain, that this is an avowed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all who are eſteemed <hi>Congregational</hi> In the Declaration of the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> owned

and practiſed in <hi>Congregational Churches</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> agreed and conſented unto, by their Elders and Meſſengers, in their Meeting at the <hi>Savoy, Octob.</hi> 12. 1658. They declare, <hi>That the Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches are Saints by calling, viſibly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting their Obedience to the Call of Chriſt, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further known to each other by. their Confeſſion of Faith wrought in them by the Power of God, declared by themſelves, or otherwiſe manifeſted, conſent to walk together according to the appointment of Chriſt.</hi> I have known many in <hi>England</hi> of that way; but never any that did not concern the <hi>Brethren</hi> as well as themſelves, to be <hi>Judges</hi> of the fitneſs of thoſe who have deſired to be received into their Communion. It is evident, that the Church, (and not the Officers only) have power given them by Chriſt to Judge who are meet to be <hi>put out</hi> of their Communion. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.12 Then they muſt needs have the like pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as to thoſe that are to be <hi>taken into</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. <hi>Ejuſdem eſt poteſtatis conſtituere et deſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere,</hi> is a known received <hi>Axiom.</hi> If the <hi>whole Church</hi> has power to <hi>Judge</hi> of the Repentance of one that is to be <hi>Re admitted,</hi> then of the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of one that is to have his <hi>firſt Admiſſion.</hi> But the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Church,</hi> and not to the <hi>Officers</hi> only to reſtore the penitent <hi>Corinthian</hi> to their Communion. 2 Cor. 2.8. Again, If the <hi>whole multitude of Diſciples</hi> have power to Judge whether perſons are qualified with that Wiſdom and Grace as to be meet for <hi>Office-Relation</hi> in the Church, then they have power to Judge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000790_0024_0FAA54873063F850"/>
the Knowledge and Grace of <hi>Communicants.</hi> The Argument is <hi>a majori ad minus.</hi> They that are meet <hi>Judges</hi> in a <hi>greater matter,</hi> much more in that which is <hi>leſs.</hi> But the former is clear from the Scripture. Acts. 6.2, 3, 4.

            <p>Theſe things I have ſuppoſed to be proper for me to Write to you the Church of Chriſt in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>; not as doubting of your Stedfaſtneſs in the Truth to this day profeſſed and practiſed by you, but as deſiring that thoſe who ſhall ſucceed you, may continue to walk therein; &amp; that ſo I might teſtify, the peculiar Reſpect, that I do (and ought to) bear unto you, on the account of the Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Love, which all of you have manifeſted towards me. Five years are not expired, ſince you were pleaſed unanimouſly to Invite me to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the <hi>Paſtoral Office</hi> over you. But the unwillingneſs of the Dear People among whom I have been Labouring in the Goſpel for the ſpace of Thirty ſix years, that I ſhould leave them, in conſideration with ſome other Obſtacles, kept me from complying with that your loving motion. Nevertheleſs, I cannot but whilſt I Live, have a Dear Affection for you, and know not how to expreſs it more, than by Endeavouring what in me lies, that you, and your Children after you, may be Confirmed in thoſe wayes of the Lord, which your Fathers, and your ſelves too, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſo much of His Preſence in. And I
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000790_0025_0FAA5487F3A4EE98"/>
have alſo conſidered, that you are ſingularly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, in that there are Reſiding with you, the <hi>Sons of the Prophets,</hi> whoſe Eſtabliſhment <hi>in the preſent Truth,</hi> I am more than any man in the World, under an Obligation to promove, and I certainly know (not altogether without an Awful Senſe of it) that the <hi>Son of God,</hi> will e're long Enquire of me, whether I did, in this matter, Diſcharge my Duty, according to his Expectation, to whom I muſt be accountable concerning the Improvement of whatever <hi>Talents</hi> or Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Serve His Intereſts, He has or ſhall Truſt me with, whilſt I am in this World.</p>
            <p>A few words let me further ſpeak to you, who belong to that <hi>Nurſery,</hi> for Religion and Learning, which has for a long time been the <hi>Glory,</hi> not of <hi>Cambridge</hi> only, but of <hi>New England.</hi> Sixteen years will this <hi>Summer</hi> be Lapſed ſince God, by His Providence, devolved the <hi>Praeſidentſhip</hi> of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety into my Hands, to manage it (ſo far as my <hi>Inſufficiencies</hi> for ſuch a Service will permit) for the Ends, which He (and our <hi>Fathers,</hi> as His <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>) did at firſt Erect a <hi>Colledge</hi> in <hi>New England</hi> upon; which was chiefly, that ſo <hi>Scholars</hi> might there be Educated for the ſpecial Service of Chriſt and His Churches, in the <hi>Work of the Miniſtry,</hi> and that they might be ſeaſoned in their Tender years with ſuch <hi>Principles</hi> as brought their Bleſſed Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors into this Wilderneſs. What my Sollicitudes for this have been in both <hi>Englands,</hi> is known to Him, who ſaid to the Churches, <hi>I know your works.</hi> There is no One Thing of greater Concernment

to theſe Churches, in preſent and after times, than the Proſperity of that <hi>Society.</hi> They cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without a <hi>Colledge.</hi> There are at this day not above Two or Three of our Churches but what are ſupplyed from thence. Nor are the Churches like to continue <hi>pure Golden Candleſticks,</hi> if the <hi>Colledge,</hi> which ſhould ſupply them, prove <hi>Apoſtate.</hi> If the <hi>Fountain</hi> be corrupted, How ſhould the <hi>Streams</hi> be pure, which ſhould <hi>make Glad the City of God</hi>? How ſhould <hi>Plants of Renown</hi> ſpring up from thence, if the <hi>Colledge</hi> it ſelf become a <hi>Degenerate Plant</hi>? You that are <hi>Tutors</hi> there, have a Great Advantage put into your Hands (and I Pray God give you Wiſdom to know it!) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. The Lord hath made you <hi>Fathers</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Pupils.</hi> You will not deny, but that He has made <hi>me</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>you</hi> It was my Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that brought you into that <hi>Station.</hi> And therefore, as my <hi>Joy</hi> will be the Greater to ſee you Acquit your ſelves <hi>Worthily,</hi> ſo my earneſt Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes for it muſt needs be the more, on <hi>that</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. There are many (I believe, you wiſh you could ſay ſo of all of them) who were once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your <hi>Tuition,</hi> that do worthily in <hi>Ephratah,</hi> and are like to be famous in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> for which you ought to (and I doubt not but you do) humbly Bleſs the Lord, That <hi>you</hi> (and they who ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed you) may be yet <hi>Greater Bleſſings,</hi> Let me Commend unto you the Example of this Bleſſed Man, whoſe <hi>Life</hi> is here deſcribed. When <hi>Jerom</hi> had conſidered the Life of <hi>Hilarion,</hi> he Reſolved <hi>Hilarion ſhall be the Champion, whom I will follow!</hi>

Say each of you, <hi>Mitchel,</hi> (once a <hi>Tutor</hi> in <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard Colledge) ſhall be the Example, whom I will Imitate</hi>! You will ſee in the Story of his Life, that he did not only Inſtruct his <hi>Pupils</hi> in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> but that he would ſometimes diſcourſe them about the <hi>Spiritual Eſtate</hi> of their Immortal Souls. Such private <hi>Perſonal Inſtructions,</hi> are many times more Effectual to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> than <hi>Publick Sermons.</hi> Some very worthy Perſons who were once his <hi>Scholars,</hi> have a Living Remembrance of his Words, to this Day. Others of them are now with him in Glory, bleſſing God to Eternity, whoſe Providence diſpoſed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a <hi>Tutor.</hi> Famous Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> choſe rather to Live in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> than in any place in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> becauſe by Reaſon of the <hi>Univerſity</hi> there, he had an Opportunity, <hi>Non modo dolare Lapides ſed Architectos,</hi> to <hi>prepare Builders for the Houſe of God.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven would not think it beneath them, to be employed in ſo Great a Work and Service for the Churches of Chriſt as that which Infinite Grace has call'd <hi>you</hi> unto. If you follow thoſe, that have gone before you (<hi>Mitchel</hi> in particular) as they have <hi>followed Chriſt,</hi> your <hi>Names</hi> will be Precious &amp; Honourable like theirs, &amp; you ſhall <hi>Live</hi> after you are <hi>Dead,</hi> as they now do.</p>
            <p>As for you that are the <hi>Students</hi> in the <hi>Colledge</hi>: I have often (as you know) in my Diſcourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, Exhorted you above all things to <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Chriſt,</hi> and to be mindful of, <hi>The One Thing Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.

and yet be of all in the world the moſt <hi>miſerable,</hi> and moſt like to the <hi>Devils,</hi> as a <hi>Converted Indian</hi> once ſaid concerning ſome <hi>Scholars.</hi> You know that many Philoſophers who were <hi>Heathen</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in that which is called, <hi>Humane Learning.</hi> And ſo have ſome <hi>Popiſh</hi> Authors (<hi>Jeſuites</hi> eſpecially) done, whoſe Books have been very Edifying to others.

It was not (I can aſſure you) on any ſuch Account that your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers followed Chriſt into this <hi>Wilderneſs, when it was a Land not ſown.</hi> If you degenerate from the <hi>Order of the Goſpel</hi> (as well as from the <hi>Faith of the Goſpel</hi>) you will juſtly merit the Name of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,</hi> and of <hi>Degenerate Plants.</hi> And ſuch Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy in the Children of <hi>New-England,</hi> and moſt of all in <hi>you</hi> will be worſe, than in any Children in the world.

IT is Reported concerning the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Phrygians,</hi> that when a <hi>Prieſt</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired among them, they Honoured him with a <hi>Pillar</hi> Ten Fathom high, whereon they placed his <hi>Dead</hi> Body, as if he were to continue, after his <hi>Death,</hi> from thence Inſtructing of the People.

But I may without any Danger of <hi>Miſtake,</hi> venture to affirm, That there cannot Eaſily be found, a <hi>Minister</hi> of the Goſpel,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000790_0033_0FAA54902D479D20"/>
in our Dayes, more worthy to have the Story of his <hi>Life</hi> employed for the Inſtruction of <hi>Mankind,</hi> after his Deceaſe, than our Excellent <hi>Mitchel.</hi> And therefore I ſhall now Endeavour to ſet him on as high a <hi>Pillar,</hi> as the beſt <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that I can give of his Exemplary <hi>Life,</hi> can erect, for that Worthy man; for whom Statues of <hi>Corinthian Braſs,</hi> were but Inadaequate Acknowledgments.</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. If it were counted an Honour, to the Town of <hi>Halifax</hi> in <hi>York</hi> ſhire, that the famous <hi>John de Sacro Boſco,</hi> Author of the well known Treatiſe, <hi>De Sphaera,</hi> was born there; this Town was no leſs Honoured by it's being the Place of Birth to our no leſs worthyly famous <hi>Ionathan Mitchel,</hi> the Author of a better Treatiſe, Of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> who being deſcended (as a Printed Account long ſince ha's told us) of <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Wealthy</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, here drew his firſt Breath, in the year 1624. The preciſe <hi>Day</hi> of his Birth is loſt, nor is it worth while for us to enquire by an <hi>Aſtrological Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> what Aſpect the <hi>Stars</hi> had upon his Birth, ſince the <hi>Event</hi> has proved, That <hi>God the Father</hi> was in the <hi>Horoſcope, Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Mid Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Sixth-Houſe, Repentance, Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> in the <hi>Eighth</hi>: and in the <hi>Twelfth,</hi> an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs,</hi> where no <hi>Saturn</hi> can dart any malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Rayes. Here, while the <hi>Father of his Fleſh</hi> was endeavouring to make him <hi>Learned</hi> by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Education, the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> uſed the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Grace to make him <hi>Serious</hi>; eſpecially by

a ſore <hi>Feavour,</hi> which had like to have made the <hi>Tenth</hi> year of his Life, the <hi>Laſt,</hi> but then ſettled in his <hi>Arm,</hi> with ſuch Troubleſome Effects, that his Arm grew, and kept, a little <hi>bent,</hi> and he could never ſtretch it out <hi>Right,</hi> until his Dying Day. And upon this Accident he afterwards wrote this Reflection; <hi>Thus the Lord ſought to make me Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (Oh! when will it once be!) by ſteeping my firſt Entrance into years of Underſtanding, and into the Changes of Life, and my firſt motions to</hi> New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>in Eminent and Special Sorrows.</hi> Now his <hi>Firſt Motions to New-England,</hi> mentioned in this Reflection, invite us to Haſten unto that part of our Hiſtory, which is to Relate, that his Parents were ſome of thoſe Exemplary <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which by the <hi>Unconſcionable</hi> Impoſitions and Perſecutions of the Engliſh <hi>Hierarchy</hi> upon the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of People, as Remarkable for True <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as any in the Realm, were driven out of it. In the year 1635. the Ship, which brought over Mr. <hi>Richard Mather,</hi> and many more of thoſe <hi>Puritans,</hi> which had found the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then governed by ſuch an <hi>Aſſembly of Treacherous men,</hi> (a Faction to whom that Name, <hi>The Church of England,</hi> never truly belonged) that they were put upon wiſhing with the Perſecuted Prophet, <hi>Oh! that I had in the Wilderneſs a Lodging place of way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring men</hi>! was further enriched by having on Board our <hi>Jonathan,</hi> than a Child about Eleven years of Age; whoſe Parents with much Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reſolution carried him unto <hi>Briſtol</hi> to take

Shipping there, while he was not yet Recovered of his Illneſs. On the Coaſt of <hi>New England,</hi> they were delivered from a moſt eminent and amazing hazard of periſhing, in a moſt <hi>horrible Tempeſt</hi>; upon which Deliverance Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> Preached a Sermon from that Scripture Joh. 5.14. <hi>Sin no more, leaſt a worſe thing come unto thee</hi>; whereby farther Impreſſions or <hi>Seriouſneſs</hi> were made upon the Soul of this <hi>Young Diſciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§ 3.

A <hi>Shallop,</hi> which he ſent unto the River's mouth was taken, and burned by the <hi>Pequots,</hi> and Three men in the Veſſel Slain, in all of whom he was nearly concerned: So that indeed the <hi>Pequot</hi> Scourge fell more on this Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than on any other in the Land.

It is the Flouriſhing of a Common Wealth, to be well furniſhed with Learned, Worthy and Able men for all Purpoſes. And God will not give us ſuch men by Miracle, ſeeing He hath vouchſafed us other wayes, and means to obtain them. Learning is an Unwelcome Gueſt to the Devil, and therefore he would fain Starve it out. But we ſhall never long retain the Goſpel, without the Help of Learning. And, if we ſhould have no Regard unto Religion, even the Outward Proſperity of a People in this World, would neceſſary Require Schools and Learned men. Alas, that none are carryed with Alacrity and Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to take care for the Education of Youth, and to Help the World with Eminent and Able men.</hi> 'Twas from Conſiderations, like theſe of <hi>Luther's,</hi> that he did with an Accurate and judicious Pen,

               </gap>er, was it not worthy of a <hi>Machiavel</hi>!] <hi>That he who Writes an Hiſtory, muſt be a man of no Religion.</hi> By that profane Rule, the firſt and the beſt Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian in the World, the moſt <hi>Religious</hi> MOSES, was ill accompliſhed for a Writer of <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> But the <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> which we are now Writing, does Profeſſedly intend nothing ſo much as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Religion,</hi> even of that <hi>Religion,</hi> whereof our MITCHEL made an Exemplary Profeſſion. Wherefore we go on, to ſay; Know, Reader, That he was a Great Example of a <hi>Walk with God.</hi> He was much in <hi>Prayer,</hi> much in <hi>Faſting,</hi> Sometimes taking his Virtuous <hi>Wife,</hi> therein to make a <hi>Conſort</hi> with him; and ſometimes alſo he kept, whole <hi>Dayes of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> privately with his Family, beſides what he did more publickly; Devoting himſelf, as a <hi>Thank Offering</hi> to God, for his <hi>Mercies,</hi> with a <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service.</hi> In his <hi>Diary,</hi> He betimes laid that Rule upon himſelf, <hi>Oh! that I could Remember this Rule, never to go to Bed, until I have had ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſpecial Communion with God!</hi> He kept a ſtrict <hi>watch,</hi> over not only his <hi>Words,</hi> but alſo his very <hi>Thoughts</hi>; and if by the <hi>Reflections,</hi> which he was continually making on himſelf, he judged that his Mind had not been always full of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> that his <hi>Heart</hi> had been, what he called, <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>ſlight,</hi> that he had been <hi>Formal,</hi> in his <hi>Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that he had not <hi>profited</hi> abundantly by the <hi>Sermons</hi> of other men, that he had not made

Conſcience of Doing all the <hi>Good</hi> he could, when he had been in any <hi>Company</hi>; he would put <hi>Stings</hi> into his Reflections, and Rebuke and Reproach himſelf with an Holy Indignation. Severe might ſeem the Rule of <hi>R. Hanina. If two ſit together and there be no Diſcourſe of the Law, 'tis the Seat of the Scornful:</hi> Severe might ſeem the Rule of <hi>R. Simeon, If Three do Eat at one Table, and ſay nothing about the Law, they are as if they Eat the Sacrifices of the Dead</hi>: And ſevere might be the Rule of <hi>R. Hananiah, He that wakes in the Night or walks by the way, and let's his Heart lie Idle, ſins againſt his own Soul:</hi> But our <hi>Mitchel</hi> reckoned it no <hi>Severity</hi> unto himſelf, to impoſe upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuch <hi>Rules</hi> as theſe for his Converſation. I have Read, That <hi>Five</hi> Devout perſons being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there was this Queſtion ſtarted among them, <hi>How,</hi> In what wayes, By what means, <hi>they ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened themſelves in Abstaining from Sin against the God of Heaven</hi>? The Firſt Anſwered, <hi>I frequently, meditate on the Certainty of Death, and the Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Time for my Death, and this makes me Live in the Fear of Sin, every Day as my Laſt.</hi> The Second Anſwered, <hi>I frequently meditate on the ſtrict Account of Sin that I am to give at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Everlaſting Torments in Hell, to be inflicted on them that can give no Good Account.</hi> The Third Anſwered, <hi>I frequently meditate on the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and filthineſs, and loathſomeneſs of Sin, and the Excellency of Grace, which is contrary unto ſo vile a Thing.</hi> The Fourth Anſwered, <hi>I frequently medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:000790_0101_0FAA53C7EC1120C0"/>
on the Eternal Rewards and Pleaſures Reſerved in Heaven, for them that avoid the pleaſures of Sin, which are but for a moment.</hi> The Fifth Anſwered, <hi>I frequently meditate on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and His wondrous Love to miſerable Sinners, in Dying a Curſed and a Bitter Death for our Sin; and this Helps me to Abſtain from Sin, more than any other conſideration whatſoever</hi>; And the Anſwer of this laſt was indeed the greateſt of all. Now all theſe were the Subjects, which our Holy <hi>Mitchel,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged himſelf to an aſſiduous <hi>Meditation</hi> upon; and by <hi>Meditating</hi> on theſe it was, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very <hi>Holy.</hi> Moreover, he was as <hi>Holy</hi> men uſe to be, very ſolicitous to make a due Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all <hi>Afflictions,</hi> that the Providence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven diſpenſed unto him. He would ſay, <hi>When God perſonally Afflicts a man, it is as if He called unto the man by Name, and jogged him, and ſaid, Oh! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, be Humbled, be Serious, be Awakened</hi>: Yea, he could not ſo much as be kept a little from the Labours of his Miniſtry, by an <hi>Hoarſe Cold</hi> arreſting him, without writing down this Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; <hi>My Sin is Legible in the Chaſtiſement: cold Duties, cold Prayers (my voice in Prayer,</hi> i. e. <hi>my Spirit of Prayer fearfully gone) my Coldneſs in my whole Converſation, chaſtiſed with a Cold; I fear that I have not Improved my voice for God formerly as I might have done, and therefore He now takes it from me.</hi> But the <hi>Affliction</hi> which moſt of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed him, ſeems to have been in the ſucceſſive <hi>Death</hi> of many and Lovely <hi>Children,</hi> though all of
