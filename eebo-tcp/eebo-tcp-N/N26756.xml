            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE observations contained in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages, are solemnly addressed to your conscience and to your judgment. My object is to demonstrate to the people, and to you, that the constitution of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, has been violated. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are used to effect this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, are derived from the first and purest principles of political science, and are exhibited in that plain form, which truth alone can centure to assume.</p>
            <p>If, Sir, these arguments shall excite in your mind, a doubt concerning the power of Congress, to define and punish libels, my purpose will be accomplished. The virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous servant, of a free people, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a single act of power, unless be is <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:035605_0004_1005FCFC07032A80"/>ſure,</hi> that be is authorised to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, by that charter whose sacred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts he has pledged himself to God and to his Country to observe. If, relying too much on the decision of an angry and agitated as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, he has hastily given his assent to a measure, of which his judgment now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels him to question the propriety, disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all considerations, but those of truth and justice, he will come forward with the firmness which belongs to virtue, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to the world, the real situation of his mind. In doing this, he will exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit to mankind, an instance of rectitude and candor, which it has been seldom if ever their fortune to behold; and by this glorious homage, voluntarily offered to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and to truth, he will promote the cause of liberty and virtue, and render his own name immortal. He will dispel solicitude and sorrow from the bosoms of thousands, whose patriotism is as pure as his own, and still the tumult that is now rising in the country, and which threatens to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the union with ruin and confusion.</p>
            <p>I will not offend you, Sir, by saying that on this subject, you <hi>muſt</hi> entertain <hi>ſome doubt.</hi> It is possible that you may be <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſure,</hi> that the Congress of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States does possess a power, which certainly is not expressly given, nor can be
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:035605_0005_1005FCFD926EF2C8"/>shewn to be necessary to carry any given power into effect. It is possible, that you may be <hi>abſolutely</hi> sure, that you are in the right, although forty of the representatives of the people, equal at least in talents and integrity, and almost equal in numbers to their opponents, have told you that you are in the wrong. It is possible that you may retain this absolute conviction, in spite of the solemn decision of the respectable legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures of Kentucky and Virginia. All this is possible, and if you shall say either by your words or actions, that it is actually the case. I shall not hesitate to believe you; but this belief will be accompanied with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the most profound regret.</p>
            <p>Yet, Sir, however clear your opinion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever decided your conviction may be, on this great constitutional question, there is one point in which we must all agree. It is a truth, which cannot be denied, a truth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by facts, as notorious as they are alarming, that the sedition bill is in the highest degree dangerous and inexpedient. In this part of the world it is justly regarded as an attack on the liberty of the press, and has roused the attention of the most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine. It has inflamed that spirit of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and discontent, which, unfortunately for the people, has been already too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully excited, and has a direct and obvious
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035605_0006_1005FD0035C048D0"/>tendency to produce the very crime which it professes to punish. God forbid that I should say, that such was the object for which the law was made. If I entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an opinion so dishonorable to my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, so disgraceful to humanity, my soul would sink with horror and despair. But I cannot despair. Truth, liberty, and virtue, must prevail in America, and I therefore, believe, that the servants of the people, will not continue a law, merely because it has passed, when they know, when they see, that the evil which it has already produced, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely outweighs all the good which they expected to obtain.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.</head>
            <head type="sub">PART I. TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.</head>
            <p>IT is the object of the following addreſs to demonstrate, that ſo much of the late act of Congreſs, commonly called the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Bill, as relates to libels, is <hi>not warranted</hi> by the Constitution of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States; and that ſo much thereof as relates to <hi>printed</hi> libels, is <hi>expressly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi> by it. To theſe two points, my obſervations will be excluſively confined.</p>
            <p>The following principles, it is preſumed, will be conceded. If the reader denies or doubts their truth, he need not proceed.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035605_0008_1005FD0357E34BA0"/>The whole argument is founded on a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that they are true.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That all power originally belongs to the people.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the powers of government are powers granted by the people.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the individuals selected from the maſs of the people, to administer the government, poſſeſs no powers, general or ſpecial, but thoſe which are either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly delegated or are <hi>necessary</hi> to carry a power expreſsly delegated into effect.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That it has frequently happened in the courſe of human affairs, and may again happen, that the individuals thus ſelected may abuſe the power entrusted to them, and may uſurp more power than was meant to be entrusted to them.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That one abuſe does not justify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and that the uſurpations of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs cannot be vindicated by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the State Legiſlatures.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That the deciſion of a constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional question, ought not, in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to be affected by the conduct of France, or the opinions of Mr. Jefferſon, or any other man, or men, in the world, but ſhould rest on the immutable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reaſon and of truth.</p>
            <p>It is on the ground of this last postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, that no anſwer is given to the <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:035605_0009_1005FD0840ECB1C0"/>founded on opinions and writings aſcribed to Mr. Jefferſon, and to others; and on the ſame ground, the aid which might be obtained from the writings and ſpeeches of Publius and other distinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed federalists, in ſupport of the poſition now meant to be establiſhed, is totally rejected. It is the purpoſe of the preſent addreſs, not to aſcertain what <hi>particular</hi> individuals <hi>have</hi> thought, but what <hi>all</hi> men <hi>ought</hi> to think, concerning the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the government, and the freedom of the preſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If all power originally belongs to the people, thoſe who exerciſe any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of power, must derive their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the people, and can poſſeſs no power, that is not given, expreſsly, or by fair and neceſſary implication. To aſcertain the preciſe portion of power, which they have granted, we must reſort to the instruments or writings by which their intention to grant power is expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe instruments are the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſeveral States, formed at a time when they were independent ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties, and the Federal Constitution, which unites all the States.</p>
            <p>The State Constitutions preceded by ſeveral years, the formation of the Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Compact. By theſe Constitutions go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035605_0010_1005FD0A848ED308"/>were organized, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures were intrusted with a <hi>general</hi> power to do what they might think the public good required. This power had been exerciſed in all the States, and the regulations, which it was thought the public good required, had been adopted. The rights of perſons and things, public and private wrongs, which furniſh all the materials for local and municipal law, had been accurately defined, and were well understood. <hi>Adequate provision mas made to secure reputation</hi> as well as liberty and life. Still, however, a Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was deemed eſſential, to the peace and happineſs of the people of America; not becauſe the State institutions were defective and required amendment, not becauſe liberty was in danger, or becauſe character was not ſufficiently guarded from defamation, but becauſe there were many important ſubjects on which the State Legiſlatures could not act with ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. They could not make effectual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for paying the public debt, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate Commerce, nor borrow money on the credit of the United States, nor esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a ſystem of general defence. Theſe were the great objects which could not be attained, but by means of a Federal Government, and for the attainment of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035605_0011_1005FD0C32DB93B8"/>theſe objects a Federal Government was instituted. The powers therefore delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this government were ſpecial and limited, and from the state of things could not have been otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more obvious, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has been more generally admitted, than the distinction, between the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which is the baſis of the State go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and that which forms the baſis of the Federal Constitution. To the State governments, general powers of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation are granted, and they may legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late on all ſubjects, except thoſe on which they are expreſsly forbidden to act. To the Federal Government, ſpecific powers only are given, and Congreſs can legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late on thoſe ſubjects only on which they are expreſsly authoriſed to act. The State governments poſſeſs all powers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the people, except thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly withheld: the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment poſſeſſes thoſe powers only which are expreſsly granted, or are neceſſary to carry a power expreſsly granted into ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. When therefore a doubt ariſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the conſtitutionality of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſional law, the firſt queſtion ought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly to be, is the power to paſs this law expreſsly granted to Congreſs? If it be not expreſsly granted in plain words
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035605_0012_1005FD0F672E0B68"/>for that purpoſe, the next queſtion muſt be—Is this law neceſſary to carry any power expreſsly granted into effect? If it be not neceſſary, there is an end of all doubt or difficulty on the ſubject, and the law is abſolutely void.</p>
            <p>Let the Sedition bill be brought to the test of an examination on theſe principles, and the reſult will be, that thoſe clauſes in it, which puniſh inſurrection or <hi>actual</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the authoriſed meaſures of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, will be found warranted by the terms and meaning of the federal compact; becauſe the beſt laws would be of no avail, unleſs Congreſs poſſeſſed a power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe who oppoſed their execution. The power of puniſhing acts of oppoſition to the laws, therefore, being neceſſary, to carry the laws themſelves into due opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is readily conceded to belong to Congreſs. But the inquiry purſued far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on the ſame principles, will terminate in a conviction, that ſo much of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Bill as relates to libels on the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or the individuals belonging to it, is not within the words or meaning of the Conſtitution. It will not be ſaid that the power of puniſhing libels is expreſsly given. Several offences are enumerated which may be defined and puniſhed by the general government; but libels are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035605_0013_1005FD10F1D8F4B0"/>If then the power of puniſhing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels is not expreſsly given, it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, unleſs it can be ſhewn to be <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> to carry ſome given powers into effect. What is the power expreſsly given, which is carried into effect, or is in any ſhape aided in its operation, by the power of puniſhing libels. Plain as this queſtion is, it never has been anſwered. In fact it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be anſwered. Gallatin propounded it at the last ſeſſion to the advocates of the Sedition Bill, with his uſual perſpicuity; but neither the eloquence of Otis, nor the ingenuity of Harper could be brought to encounter it!</p>
            <p>One caſe more will completely illuſtrate the doctrine here inculcated. In 1792 Congreſs paſſed a law puniſhing with death perſons concerned in robbing the mail, or ſtealing letters from the poſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. If the enumerated powers of the government be examined, it will be found that the power to paſs ſuch a law is not expreſsly granted—ſtill however it is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Conſtitution, becauſe it is neceſſary to carry into effect the general power expreſsly granted to Congreſs, to eſtabliſh poſt offices and poſt roads.</p>
            <p>The poſition, that Congreſs can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe no power that is not given expreſsly, or by <hi>necessary</hi> implication, tho' manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035605_0014_1005FD1354CA1138"/>reſulting from the nature of a federal compact, and ſupported by every fair and rational conſtruction of the conſtitution, has, from exceſs of caution, been expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recognized by the 12th article of the Amendments, which declares, <q>that powers not delegated to the United States by the Conſtitution, nor prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by it to the States, are reſerved to the States reſpectively or to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Solid as the foregoing principle is, and ſolemn as its recognition has been by the people of America, it has been boldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by ſome, and artfully evaded by others. It has been ſtrenuouſly contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Congreſs had power to adopt all meaſures which they might think condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the general welfare. Mr. S. from South-Carolina was the firſt who openly proclaimed it as his opinion, that conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality and expediency were convertible terms.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who advocate this doctrine, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to vindicate their conduct by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting to the preamble, and to the 8th Section of the firſt Article of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States.</p>
            <p>But before the arguments drawn from theſe ſources are noticed, it is proper to obſerve, that all reaſoning on any propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035605_0015_1005FD14DFEDC460"/>may be reduced into the form of a ſyllogiſm; and if the first and ſecond terms be true, and the concluſion correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stated, the demonstration ſought for is obtained; and according to all the rules of logic, and the plain dictates of common ſenſe, principles from which a different concluſion is deduced, cannot be true.</p>
            <p>The propoſition here maintained is, that ſo much of the Sedition Bill as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a puniſhment for libels is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Federal Constitution.</p>
            <p>To demonſtrate this propoſition to be true. I have recourſe to the following ſyllogiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Congreſs poſſeſſes no power unleſs it be expreſsly given, or neceſſary to carry a given power into effect. See the 1ſt, 2d, and 3d postulates.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The power of preſcribing a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for libels is not expreſsly given, nor neceſſary to carry a given power into effect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Concluſion. Therefore ſo much of the Sedition Bill as preſcribes a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for libels, is not warranted by the Federal Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Upon principles of fair and logical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, thoſe who advocate the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality of the Sedition Bill, muſt admit the concluſion here ſtated, unleſs they controvert the truth of the firſt or ſecond terms of the foregoing ſyllogiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035605_0016_1005FD18EA6A9CB0"/>
The truth of the first term is controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome on the ground of the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Constitution—the words are, <q>We the people of the United States, <hi>in order</hi> to form a more perfect union, establiſh justice, inſure domestic tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, provide for the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, promote the general welfare, and ſecure the bleſſings of Liberty to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and our posterity, <hi>do ordain and establish this Constitution,</hi> for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States of America.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From the language of this preamble, it has been contended, that Congreſs have a power, expreſsly granted, to paſs any laws which in their opinion may tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the common defence, or promote the general welfare.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Sewall's Speech on the Sedition Bill.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame inference has been drawn from the 8th Section of the 1st article of the Constitution, which declares, <q>that Congreſs ſhall have power to lay and coHect taxes, duties, exciſes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posts to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the United States.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Otis and Bayard's Speeches on the Alien Bill.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Arguments are ſometimes brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in diſcuſſion, the refutation of which requires more patience than ſkill—of this deſcription is the argument now stated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:035605_0017_1005FD1A7452AF10"/>
As to the Preamble. The ſpecial reply to this argument is, that the preamble to a statute or constitution, which is the ſupreme statute, is no part of it. This is not mentioned as a principle of common law, but as a principle of common ſenſe; a preamble states the general objects of the law of the constitution, and the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which follow preſcribe the means by which, and by which only, the attainment of theſe objects is to be purſued; the preamble can neither enlarge nor restrain the body of the act; it is in fact, nothing more than a declaration of objects; the constitution or law, is a ſpecification of means. The preamble to the Constitution therefore ſays, in ſubstance, <q>We the people of the United States in order to promote the general welfare, <hi>do ordain this</hi> Constitution:</q>—that is, <q>we do ordain this Constitution, in order to promote the general welfare.</q> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage cannot be more plain. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution is unequivocally announced as the instrument or mean by which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral welfare is to be promoted.</p>
            <p>As to the 8th Section of the 1st article. The ſpecial reply to the argument founded on this ſection is, that the plain, gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical meaning of the ſentence, even ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by itſelf, and without any reference
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035605_0018_1005FD1D036C4C08"/>to the uniform tenor of the Constitution, forbids the inference before mentioned. The Constitution by the words of this Section, meant to give not a general pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to provide for the general good of the union, but the ſpecial power of laying and collecting taxes and duties, <hi>for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> of paying the debts and providing for the general welfare. According to this construction, a ſpecial power is given for a general purpoſe, in other words for the general good, which is in truth the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which all power is granted; but according to the construction contended for by the advocates of the Sedition Bill, the ſame ſentence which gives a ſpecial power, alſo gives a general power, which renders the ſpecial delegation of power uſeleſs. Which of theſe two construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is the most rational, is a question that is not ſuppoſed to be in the ſmallest degree doubtful.</p>
            <p>It ſeems clear then that a fair construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preamble, and of the 8th ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that article, conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, does not warrant the doctrine maintained by the friends of the Sedition Bill, that Congreſs poſſeſſes a general power to provide for the welfare of the Union. This doctrine appears not only not warranted by the particular clauſes
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035605_0019_1005FD207812E390"/>relied on, but abſurd, when theſe clauſes are taken into view with all the other clauſes of the Constitution.</p>
            <p>It has been already ſtated, that in each of the ſeveral ſtates, the local and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal regulations which were thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient had been adopted. With theſe the people were ſatisfied. When, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a federal government was deemed <hi>necessary</hi> by the people, it would not be their intention or wiſh that the federal government ſhould make laws on any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, on which ſatisfactory laws were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made, or might be made, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of their repreſentatives. A federal conſtitution <hi>could not be necessary</hi> for any purpoſe completely within the reach of ſtate legiſlation: and, therefore, general powers could not be intended to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>It is a ſound principle, that all parts of a law or writing are to be taken together, and that ſuch a conſtruction ought to be adopted, if poſſible, as will allow every part ſome meaning and operation. Now, if the preamble, or the 8th ſec. of the 1ſt article, confers on Congreſs a general power to do what they may think right; thoſe parts of the conſtitution which dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſpecial powers are unmeaning and without operation. On the other hand, if
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035605_0020_1005FD22D2C22790"/>the preamble be regarded in its true light; as a declaration of objects; and if the 8th Section of the 1ſt article be conſidered as only giving a ſpecial power for a general purpoſe, every other clauſe and ſentence of the conſtitution, will have a meaning and effect. This latter conſtruction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>must</hi> be adopted.</p>
            <p>Again, if Congreſs poſſeſſes a general power to promote the general welfare, if conſtitutionality and expediency be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible terms, what meaning is to be given to the 12th amendment, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that "powers not delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to the ſtates, ſhall remain with the ſtates reſpectively, or with the people." This language is ſo irrational and abſurd, unleſs there are ſome powers which are not delegated, that it aſſords <hi>conclusive</hi> evidence, of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conviction, throughout the ſtates, and in Congreſs, that this <hi>general power</hi> did not exiſt.</p>
            <p>Further, if it was really meant that a general power ſhould be given to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, why were ſpecific powers enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and granted? This enumeration is made with a degree of accuracy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, abſolutely ridiculous, if a general power was meant to be given. Surely, if ſuch had been the object, plain words,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035605_0021_1005EC0754ADABB0"/>which men of the plaineſt capacity might comprehend, and about which there could be no doubt, might have been, and would have been ſelected for the purpoſe. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if ſuch had been the object, men of common honeſty, and common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after expreſſing in plain words what their object was, would not have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in ſo idle and uſeleſs a talk as the enumeration of ſpecial powers, but would have proceeded directly to mark out the different departments of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to decide among theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments the general powers meant to be beſtowed.</p>
            <p>Again, we have ſeen that the ſtate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments poſſeſs general powers of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. They may do every thing which tends to promote the welfare of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſtates, unleſs expreſsly prohibited by the ſtate or federal conſtitutions. Now, if Congreſs poſſeſſes general powers of legiſlation alſo, over the people of the United States, it is manifeſt that we have a government within a government, one of which muſt inevitably periſh. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments leading to a concluſion ſo monſtrous <hi>must</hi> be erroneous.</p>
            <p>This last obſervation may be complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuſtrated by the law in queſtion. The ſtate governments have yet a right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035605_0022_1005FD27045A1320"/>a puniſhment for ſlander, which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the reputation of individuals, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this ſlander be by ſpeech, writing, or printing. Before the federal government was formed they poſſeſsed this power, and muſt yet retain it, unleſs it has been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered. No man, however, has yet ſaid nor can it be ſaid, that this power may not be legally and conſtitutionally exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by the ſtates. Suppoſe then that the legiſlature of Pennſylvania ſhould paſs a law, preſcribing a fine of fifty dollars only, without any impriſonment, for defaming any individual by means of the preſs. The officers of the general government are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more or leſs than individuals, and are bound by the general expreſſion of a law as well as other people. By what law would a libeller of the Preſident be tried? By the ſtate law, by the congreſſional law, or by both? This queſtion, difficult as it is, muſt be anſwered by thoſe who advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the general power of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverting the general powers of the ſtate legiſlatures. This, however, never hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet been done, it is preſumed will not be done.</p>
            <p>Finally, no poſition can be true from which error or abſurdity can be fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. If Congreſs poſſeſſes a general
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035605_0023_1005FD2A2461F700"/>power to promote the welfare of the union, there is no limitation to this power, but their own diſcretion. They may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, like the ſtate governments, every pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er except thoſe which they are expreſsly forbidden to exerciſe. They are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to grant titles of nobility, but they are <hi>not</hi> forbidden to paſs laws by which a powerful ariſtocracy might be created. They might paſs a law eſtabliſhing in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica the ſyſtem of intails, by which the ariſtocracy of Britain, in ſpite of oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, luxury, and profuſion, has been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for ſo many ages. But bold as the ſpirit of uſurpation may be, this doctrine has never yet been explicitly avowed. It is believed to be too abſurd, ever to be explicitly avowed; and yet it muſt be avowed, or at leaſt admitted, by thoſe who advocate the general power of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States.</p>
            <p>But others more artful, though not more formidable, contend, that it is a principle of obvious policy and common ſenſe, that every government ſhould have within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the means of ſelf preſervation; that the power of puniſhing libels on the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: and its officers is eſſential to the preſervation of the government, and that therefore the general government poſſeſſes the power of puniſhing libels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:035605_0024_1005FD2C759A1B60"/>
This argument is exhibited in its beſt form, but when examined, it cannot mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead. The firſt branch of the propoſition is neither admitted, nor denied to be true. It is contended to be immaterial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected with the ſubject in debate. The queſtion is not, what powers ought a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to poſſeſs, but what powers does the government now exiſting poſſeſs? The firſt queſtion was determined by the Convention in 1788, and the Congreſs in 1789, the laſt is to be determined by the people now. The firſt queſtion ariſes, when a conſtitution is about to be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the latter, after it is formed. This part of the propoſition, therefore, being immaterial, the reaſoning founded on it cannot be concluſive. What, in truth, can be more repugnant to all the rules of logic, than the attempt to prove that a power <hi>has been</hi> granted, by arguments to ſhew that <hi>it ought to have been</hi> granted.</p>
            <p>When the firſt term of any regular ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is proved to be untrue, or ſhewn to be immaterial, it is neither neceſſary nor proper to controvert the ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, whether right or wrong, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion if correctly deduced, muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true or immaterial. I will not, therefore, deviate at this time, from the plan of ſtrict diſcuſſion, which is announced in the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035605_0025_1005FD2E043A0FD0"/>firſt paragraph, to prove, that the power of puniſhing libels, <hi>however important to the men of government,</hi> is of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the government itſelf.</p>
            <p>There remains only one more argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in favor of the ſedition bill. This is noticed here, not becauſe it is worthy of notice, but becauſe it affords a complete ſpecimen of the <hi>acute and logical reasoning,</hi> by which this odious meaſure has been vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated. It is conceded, ſays Mr. Otis, that government has a right to puniſh ſedition or inſurrection: it therefore has a right to puniſh every thing which may <hi>lead</hi> to ſedition or inſurrection.</p>
            <p>The force of this argument may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by exhibiting it in a regular form, and applying it to the ſubject on which it was urged.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Congreſs has a right to puniſh ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inſurrection. This is conceded to be true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Libels <hi>lead</hi> to ſedition and inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now this is not true; nor does Mr. Otis attempt to prove it to be true. But, whether true or not, it is immaterial. The affirmation here ought to be, not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels <hi>lead</hi> to, but "libels are <hi>acts</hi> of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or inſurrection" and then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion would re-gularly follow.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:035605_0026_1005FD2F954D56B0"/>
3. That Congreſs has a right to puniſh libels. But neither Mr. Otis nor any other man will ſay, that any libel is an act of ſedition or inſurrection, or even a breach of the peace.</p>
            <p>It deſerves farther to be remarked here, that the power of puniſhing ſedition is not expreſsly given to Congreſs: it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, however, to belong to Congreſs, becauſe it is <hi>necessary</hi> to carry the laws themſelves paſſed, in conformity to the conſtitution, into effect. The power of puniſhing libels, not being given, can be claimed like the power of puniſhing ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, only on the ground of neceſſity; This carries us back to the question for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly put, what power expreſsly given to Congreſs is ever <hi>aided</hi> by the power of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing libels?</p>
            <p>According to Mr. Otis if a government has a power to puniſh one offence, it has of courſe a right to puniſh all acts which may lead to that offence. In other words, if it has a power to puniſh one offence, it has of courſe a power to puniſh twenty offences, however different in name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Under this ſystem of reaſoning, if the general government was authoriſed to puniſh the murder of a man in the ſervice of the United States, it would have of courſe a right to puniſh an inſult, becauſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035605_0027_1005FD32B02F53C0"/>inſults lead to quarrels, and quarrels lead to murder. Various other caſes might be put which would expoſe the fallacy of reaſoning like this; but it is already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently expoſed. The argument which implies the power of puniſhing libels, from the power of puniſhing ſedition, which is in itſelf only an <hi>implied</hi> power, must be condemned as ſoon as it is understood, even if it could be ſhewn that libels do lead to ſedition. But they do not lead to it. This negative poſition, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary now to prove, the contrary being affirmed by Mr. OTIS ought to be proved by him.</p>
            <p>It was before mentioned, that there was an univerſal conviction in the United States, that general powers of legiſlation did not belong to Congreſs. The 12th amendment was offered as concluſive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of this aſſertion. If then the people of the United States re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuppoſed that Congreſs poſſeſſed only the powers delegated, expreſsly, or by fair and neceſſary construction, and it turns out that Congreſs poſſeſſes a power never meant to be bestowed, in conſequence of certain general expreſſions, the force of which was not accurately estimated, what man, who pretends either to integrity or
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035605_0028_1005FD35C9101950"/>republicaniſm, will dare to ſay that he will carry ſuch a power into effect?</p>
            <p>The principle on which ſo much of the ſedition bill as preſcribes a puniſhment for libels, is declared to be unconstitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, having been it is believed, clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and establiſhed, and the principle on which the advocates of that meaſure rely, having been ſhewn to be unſound in itſelf and abſurd in its conſequences; the first part of my undertaking ought to be conſidered as performed. But many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations have been made concerning the common law of England, and the force which it has in the United States, ſome notice ought to be taken of them here.</p>
            <p>It has been alledged by ſome, that the common law of England is in force in the United States, and that libels are an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at common law, and were puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able even before the Sedition Bill. Judge Peters it is ſaid committed Mr. Bache, the late Editor of the Aurora, on this ground.</p>
            <p>Before this doctrine is examined, there is one remark which deſerves attention. A legiſlative act has been performed: it is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that this act is not warranted by the Conſtitution of the United States. The friends of the meaſure ſay that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional, and to prove their aſſertion
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035605_0029_1005FD3753DCCB08"/>they refer you not to the conſtitution it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by which alone power, general or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, can be claimed, but to the common law of England!!</p>
            <p>To prove that Congreſs has a right to paſs a law to puniſh libels, they ſay that there already exiſts a law in the country, by which libels may be puniſhed! The ſyſtem of moderation, which was adopted at the commencement of theſe papers, and from which there has been as yet no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation, prevents me from ſpeaking of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments like theſe in the terms which they deſerve.</p>
            <p>If the common law of England be in force in the United States, it muſt be in force becauſe it is declared to be ſo by the conſtitution, or by ſome law of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States—no <hi>municipal</hi> ſyſtem of law can, be of any authority here, unleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly adopted in one of theſe two ways. The conſtitution is ſilent on the ſubject— this ſilence was wiſe; becauſe, a ſyſtem of law adopted by the conſtitution could not be changed by any act of ordinary le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation; nor is it adopted by any law of the United States; and if it had been ſo adopted, the queſtion would be preciſely the ſame that is now diſcuſſed. For if Congreſs have no right to paſs a law pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing libels, it follows that they have
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035605_0030_1005FD39DC272358"/>no right to adopt a ſyſtem of laws, one of which, preſcribes a puniſhment for libels.</p>
            <p>I repeat that no law can be in force here, unleſs adopted in one of the two ways juſt mentioned. Law is a rule of action preſcribed by the ſupreme power of a ſtate. The ſupreme power of the United States has not declared the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of England to be in force here: therefore, it is not in force here. It will be obſerved, that I ſpeak not here of the law of nations.</p>
            <p>If there be a paſſage through which the municipal regulations of one country, can get into another country, and acquire anthority in it, without the expreſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people, thoſe who have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the migration of the common law of England into the United States will inform the public, whether it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied in its voyage by the civil law or not. If this <hi>singular</hi> invaſion of our country is not firmly repelled, we may expect depredations on our ſtate inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from all the codes of the eaſtern world. The compendious and energetic ſyſtem by which the Sultaun keeps his ſlaves in peace, may at this moment be on its way to America, and on its arrival here will be preciſely of as much force as the common law of England.</p>

            <p>Again, if the common law of England be in force in the United States, and is to be the guide by which the federal judges ſhall conduct themſelves, what becomes of the various changes in the common law which have been effected at different times by the ſeveral ſtate legiſlatures? are the improvements on the common law, which have been made in the ſtate of Virginia, for the accommodation and convenience of the people, to be entirely done away without their knowledge or conſent? Is the right of primogeniture revived? Or, is it only the criminal law that is in force here? Theſe are two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035605_0032_1005FD3E66299F70"/>points, among a thouſand others, on which information is required from the advocates of the common law.</p>
            <p>The Congreſs of the United States, ſo far from adopting the common law of England, which, it muſt be again obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they had not a general power to adopt, have expreſsly enacted that the laws of the ſeveral ſtates, except where the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, treaties, or ſtatutes of the United States, ſhall otherwiſe require or provide, ſhall be regarded as rules of deciſion in trials of common law in the courts of the United States in caſes where they apply. See Act paſſed 24th Sept. 1789.</p>
            <p>On this ſubject, there is one argument, which in itſelf is abſolutely concluſive. The Congreſs of the United States have a power to paſs a law concerning libels or not. If they have this power, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it, by preſcribing a puniſhment for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, the courts of the United States muſt be governed by the law of the United States, and cannot exerciſe any common law juriſdiction on the ſubject. But if Congreſs does not poſſeſs the right to paſs a law concerning libels, then the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which ſhew that the courts of the United States have a juriſdiction over li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, alſo ſhew that their juriſdiction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſubjects, on which Congreſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035605_0033_1005FD40B0E39830"/>legiſlate. Thus the power of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary will embrace objects beyond the reach of the legiſlature, and of courſe the laws by which the judiciary think proper to be governed, muſt remain forever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed. Surely it will be at once admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that every argument whoſe object is to prove, that the judiciary power is not co-extenſive with the legiſlative power, but <hi>more</hi> extenſive, muſt be unſound.</p>
            <p>This admiſſion will be made without heſitation, by every one who underſtands either the general principles of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the plain meaning of our own conſtitution, which ſays, Art. 3, Sect. 2. "The judicial power of the United States ſhall extend to all caſes in law and equity ariſing under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which ſhall be made under their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity." Theſe are the great ſubjects on which the judicial power of the United States is to be exerciſed according to the expreſs direction of the Constitution. The other caſes to which their authority is declared to extend, are totally uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with common law juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>But, it is ſaid, the ſame clauſe declares, that the judicial power of the United States ſhall extend to <q>controverſies to which the United States ſhall be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</q>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:035605_0034_1005FD4240F456C8"/>From this ſome have inferred, that the federal judiciary have juriſdiction over every offence againſt the United States, becauſe the United States consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the party injured.</p>
            <p>It has been already ſhewn, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law is of no force in the United States; now if the courts claim a juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, in which they may think that the United States are a party, by what law will they define and puniſh the offence? If the laws of the United States are ſilent, there is no law by which the offenders can be tried. But if the laws of the United States are not Blent, if Congreſs paſſes a law, by which an offence against the United States is defined and puniſhed, by which the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States are in any caſe constituted a party, then the question recurs, as in the preſent instance, whether Congreſs had a constitutional right to paſs ſuch a law or not. The question therefore about the extent of the legiſlative power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, is the only question, that ought to be diſcuſſed.</p>
            <p>This question, it is preſumed, has been now fairly and fully diſcuſſed, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult is that ſo much of the Sedition Bill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as relates to Libels is not warranted by the Constitution of the United States.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.</head>
            <head type="sub">PART II.</head>
            <p>IT is the object of the following obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, to demonstrate, that ſo much of the ſedition bill, as relates to <hi>printed</hi> libels, is expreſsly forbidden by the conſtitution of the United States. This queſtion, in ſtrictneſs, ought not to be diſcuſſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if Congreſs have not power given, either expreſsly, or by neceſſary <hi>implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to paſs the law under conſideration, it is totally immaterial whether they are forbidden to paſs it or not. But as the "freedom of the preſs," has never yet been accurately defined, and as there is no ſubject in which the welfare of ſociety is more eſſentially concerned, my original undertaking ſhall be fully performed.</p>
            <p>The words of the conſtitution, which contains the expreſs prohibition here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035605_0036_1005FD4974B7ED08"/>on, are, "Congreſs ſhall make no law abridging the freedom of ſpeech or of the preſs." See the third article of the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Before any preciſe conſtruction is put on theſe words, "freedom of the preſs," an argument in favor of the foregoing propoſitions preſents itſelf, which to me feems concluſive.</p>
            <p>The federal government had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſed, and its operation had commenced, ſome time before the third article of the amendment became a part of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. During this period, the preſs <hi>was free,</hi> from any control. It is a fact, that no law was paſſed by Congreſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol it. It is a truth already proved, that no law could be paſſed by Congreſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol it; and it is alſo a truth, already proved, that there neither was nor could be any <hi>other</hi> law, by which it could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled. Before th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> amendment. was adopted, therefore, the preſs was free.— The meaſures of the government were ſubjects of general diſcuſſion, and were ſtated, ſometimes truly, ſometimes falſely, at the diſcretion of the printer. Nothing that was ſaid, however falſe, however ſcandalous, could be noticed by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. In this ſtate of things, a clauſe is added to the conſtitution, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035605_0037_1005FD4B04B67390"/>that the freedom of the preſs ſhall not be abridged. In other words, the preſs ſhall continue to enjoy that total ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from legiſlative control, which at this moment it poſſeſſes. The law, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which abridges this exemption, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly forbidden.</p>
            <p>The ſubject before us, hath furniſhed the materials for much diſcuſſion; and it has been ſo often ſaid to be impoſſible to draw the line between the freedom and licentiouſneſs of the preſs, that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt has never been made. The legal and political writers in England contend, however, that this line muſt be drawn; but, they admit, that the exact degree of longitude has not yet been diſcovered.</p>
            <p>This uncertainty in the law is well adapted to the situation of the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It enables the miniſter to act and puniſh as times and circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; without ſubjecting himſelf to the odium of having tranſgreſſed the law. But, however important this uncertainty may be in a country, where privilege and monopoly form the baſis of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the United States it is diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. In a republican government the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to know, the people have a right to know, the exact, the preciſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035605_0038_1005FD4CAFD6CF98"/>of every law, by which any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual may be called before a court of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
            <p>Fortunately for the people of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, the queſtion which has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed the politicians and lawyers of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, does not exiſt here. The conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having declared, that the freedom of the preſs ſhall not be abridged, has, in fact, pronounced that no line of diſcrimination ſhall be drawn. For, if the freedom of the preſs is not to be abridged, and if no man can tell where freedom ſtops, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs begins, it is obvious that no man can ſay, to what extent a law againſt licentiouſneſs ſhall be carried. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, then, that <hi>no law can</hi> be made to reſtrain the licentiouſneſs of the preſs.</p>
            <p>The words, "freedom of the preſs," like most other words, have a meaning, a clear, preciſe, and definite meaning, which the times require, ſhould be unequivocally aſcertained. That this has not been done before, is a wonderful and melancholy evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the imbecility of the human mind, and of the ſlow progreſs which it makes, in acquiring knowledge even on ſubjects the most uſeful and intereſting.</p>
            <p>It will, I preſume, be admitted, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the words in queſtion have a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but that the framers of the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035605_0039_1005FD4E637D8E58"/>containing theſe words, meant ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when they declared, that the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the preſs ſhould not be abridged.</p>
            <p>To aſcertain what the "freedom of the preſs" is, we have only to aſcertain what freedom itſelf is. For, ſurely, it will be conceded, that freedom applied to one ſubject, means the ſame, as freedom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to another ſubject.</p>
            <p>Now freedom is of two kinds, and of two kinds only: one is, that abſolute freedom which belongs to man, previous to any ſocial inſtitution; and the other, that qualified or abridged freedom, which he is content to enjoy, for the ſake of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and ſociety. I believe there is no other ſort of freedom in which man is concerned.</p>
            <p>The abſolute freedom then, or what is the ſame thing, the freedom, belonging to man, before any ſocial compact, is the power, uncontrolled by law, of doing what be pleaſes, provided he does no injury to any other individual. If this definition of freedom be applied to the preſs, as ſurely it ought to be, the preſs, if I may perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify it, may do whatever it pleaſes to do, uncontrolled by any law, taking care how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to do no injury to any individual. This injury can only be by ſlander or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035605_0040_1005FD523B4FCAC8"/>and reparation ſhould be made for it in a ſtate of nature, as well as in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>But freedom in ſociety, or what is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed civil liberty, is defined to be, natural liberty, and ſo far reſtrained by law as the public good requires, and no farther. This is the definition given by a writer, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly diſtinguiſhed for the accuracy of his definitions, and which perhaps cannot be mended. Now let freedom, under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, be applied to the preſs, and what will the freedom of the preſs amount to? It will amount preciſely to the privilege of publiſhing, as far as the legiſlative power ſhall ſay, the public good requires: that is to ſay, the freedom of the preſs will be regulated by law, in the ſame manner as freedom on other ſubjects is to be regulated by law. If the word free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was uſed in this ſenſe, by the fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the amendment, they meant to ſay, Congreſs ſhall make no law abridging the freedom of the preſs, which freedom, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is to be regulated by law. Folly itſelf does not ſpeak ſuch language.</p>
            <p>It has been admitted by the reader, who has advanced thus far, that the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the amendment meant ſomething. They knew, no doubt, that the powers granted to Congreſs, did not authorize
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035605_0041_1005FD54B58460E0"/>any control over the preſs, but they know that its freedom could not be too cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly guarded from invaſion. The amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in queſtion was therefore introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Now if they uſed the freedom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt definition, they did mean ſomething, and ſomething of infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in all free countries, the total exemption of the preſs from any kind of legiſlative control. But if they uſed the word freedom, under the ſecond definition, they meant nothing, or nonſenſe, which is worſe than nothing; for if they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the freedom of the preſs, was abſolute freedom, ſo far restrained by law as the public good required, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the amendment left the legiſlative power of the government on this ſubject, preciſely where it was before. But it has been already admitted that the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had a meaning: the conſtruction therefore which allows it no meaning is abſurd, and must be rejected.</p>
            <p>This argument may be ſummed up in a few words. The word "freedom" has a meaning. It is either abſolute, that is, exempt from all law, or it is qualified, that is regulated by law. If it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the control of law, the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Bill which controls the "freedom" of the preſs, is unconſtitutional. But if
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035605_0042_1005FD565DE80D38"/>it be regulated by law, the amendment which declares that Congreſs ſhall make no law to abridge the freedom of the preſs, which freedom however may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by law, is the groſſeſt abſurdity, that ever was conceived by the human mind.</p>
            <p>That by the words "freedom of the preſs" is meant a total exemption of the preſs from legiſlative control, will further appear, from the following caſes, in which it is manifeſt, that the word freedom is uſed with this ſignification and no other.</p>
            <p>It is obvious in itſelf, and it is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all men, that freedom of ſpeech, means the power uncontrolled by law, of ſpeaking either truth or falſehood at the diſcretion of the individual, provided no other <hi>individual</hi> be injured. This power is, <hi>as yet,</hi> in its full extent in the United States. A man may ſay every thing which his paſſion can ſuggeſt, he may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all his time and all his talents, if he is wicked enough to do ſo, in <hi>speaking</hi> againſt the government matters that are ſalſe, ſcandalous, and malicious, but he is admitted by the majority of Congreſs to be ſheltered by the article in queſtion, which forbids a law abridging the freedom of ſpeech. If then freedom of ſpeech means, in the conſtruction of the conſtitution,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035605_0043_1005FD590D899F38"/>the privilege of ſpeaking <hi>any thing</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out control, the words freedom of the preſs, which form a part of the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, mean the privilege of printing <hi>any thing</hi> without control.</p>
            <p>Happily for mankind, the word "free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom" begins now to be applied to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo. In the United States it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in its fulleſt force, and religious freedom is completely underſtood to mean the power uncontrolled by law of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and publiſhing any opinions on reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious topics, which any individual may chooſe to profeſs or publiſh, and of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting thoſe opinions by any ſtatements he may think proper to make. The fool may not only ſay in his heart, there is no God, but he may announce if he pleaſes his atheiſm to the world. He may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to corrupt mankind, not only by opinions that are erroneous, but by facts which are falſe. Sill however he will be ſafe, becauſe he lives in a country where religious freedom is eſtabliſhed. If then freedom of religion, will not permit a man to be puniſhed, for publiſhing any opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on religious topics, and ſupporting thoſe opinions by falſe facts, ſurely free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the preſs, which is the medium of all publications, will not permit a man to be puniſhed, for publiſhing any opinion on
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035605_0044_1005FD5B6FC0F9C0"/>any ſubject, and ſupporting it by any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion whatever.</p>
            <p>Again, the 6th Section of the 1ſt article of the Conſtitution of the United States declares, that the members of the Senate and Houſe of Repreſentatives, ſhall not be queſtioned, in any other place, for any ſpeech or debate in either houſe. The object of this clauſe is, manifeſtly, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to the members, freedom of ſpeech and debate. Of this there can be no doubt. But how is this freedom ſecured? It is ſecured, in the only way, in which perfect ſecurity can be given, and that is by a total exemption from the control of any law, or the jurisdiction of any court. Thus the meaning of the word freedom, is preciſely and unequivocally eſtabliſhed by the conſtitution itſelf.</p>
            <p>The power which each houſe has over its own members affords no argument againſt the inference deduced from the foregoing ſection of the conſtitution. The power of puniſhing, and expelling a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is only to be exerciſed, in caſe of "diſorderly behaviour."</p>
            <p>The word freedom when applied to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is underſtood preciſely in the ſame way in the Britiſh parliament. Fox, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridan, and Grey indulge themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the Houſe of Commons, in the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035605_0045_1005FD5DD2178FB0"/>uſe of expreſſions, concerning the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much more violent than thoſe for which private perſons have been ſent to Botany Bay. In fact, freedom of debate in parliament, is ſecured, by Statute 1. William and Mary 2d. in terms ſimilar to thoſe uſed in the Conſtitution of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States.</p>
            <p>I contend therefore, and it appears clear, that if the words freedom of the preſs, have any meaning at all, they mean a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal exemption from any law making any publication whatever criminal. Whether the unequivocal avowal of this doctrine in the United States would produce miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief or not, is a queſtion which perhaps I may have leiſure to diſcuſs. I muſt be content here to obſerve, that the miſchief if any, which might ariſe from this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, could not be remedied or prevented, but by means of a power fatal to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the people.</p>
            <p>That the real meaning of the words "freedom of the preſs," has been aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the foregoing remarks, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear still more clearly, if poſſible, from the abſurdity of thoſe constructions which have been given by the advocates of the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bill.</p>
            <p>The conſtruction clearly held out in the bill itſelf, is, that it does not extend to the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035605_0046_1005FD6025EB8500"/>privilege of printing facts, that are falſe. This conſtruction cannot be correct. It plainly ſuppoſes that "freedom," extends only as far as the power of doing what is morally right. If, then, the freedom of the preſs can be reſtrained to the publication of facts, it follows, inevitably, that it may alſo be reſtrained to the publication of true opinions. There is truth in opinion, as well as in fact. Error in opinion may do as much harm, as falſity in fact: it may be as morally wrong, and it may be propagated from motives as malicious. It may do more harm, becauſe the refutation of an opinion which is erroneous, is more difficult than the contradiction of a fact which is falſe. But the power of control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling opinions has never yet been claimed; yet it is manifeſt that the ſame conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which warrants a control in matters of fact, does the ſame as to matters of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. In addition to this, it ought to be remarked, that the difficulty of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in many caſes between fact and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is extremely great, and that no kind of criterion is furniſhed by the law under conſideration. Of this more, perhaps, will be ſaid hereafter.</p>
            <p>Again, if the congreſſional conſtruction be right, if the freedom of the preſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the full enjoyment of the privilege
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035605_0047_1005FD61B4E99FB0"/>of printing facts that are true, it will be fair to read the amendment, without the words really uſed, after ſubſtituting thoſe ſaid by Congreſs to have the ſame import. The clauſe will then ſtand thus: "Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhall make no law abridging the right of the preſs, to publiſh facts that are true!" If this was the real meaning of Congreſs, and the ſeveral ſtates, when they ſpoke in the ſtate conſtitutions, and in the amendment of the "freedom of the preſs," the very great ſolicitude on this ſubject diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played throughout the continent, was most irrational and abſurd. If this was their meaning, the "palladium" of liberty is indeed a "wooden ſtatue," and the bulwark of freedom is indeed a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable fortification of paper. The officers of the government would have a right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade this fortification, and to make pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of the garriſon, whenever they thought that there was a failure in the duty of publiſhing only the truth, of which failure perſons choſen by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are to judge. This is too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd even for ridicule.</p>
            <p>That ſuch was not the meaning of the convention of Virginia is manifest. They ſolemnly protest againſt any kind of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative control, and declare, that the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035605_0048_1005FD65AB832518"/>of the preſs is not to be restrained or modified by any law whatever.</p>
            <p>This venerable and enlightened aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly had too much wiſdom to avow a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo totally incompatible with the real object of their wiſhes. They knew that there never was a government in the world, however deſpotic, that dared to avow a deſign to ſuppreſs the truth: they know that the most corrupt and profligate adminiſtrations, that ever brought wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and oppreſſion upon a happy and free people, ſpeak in their public acts the language of patriotiſm and virtue only, and that, although their real object is to ſtop inquiry, and to terrify truth into ſilence, the vengeance of the law <hi>appears</hi> to be directed againſt falſehood and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice only: in fact, they know, that there are many truths, important to ſociety, which are not ſuſceptible of that full, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and poſitive evidence, which can alone be exhibited before a court and jury:</p>
            <p>That men might be, and often would be deterred from ſpeaking truths, which they could prove, unleſs they were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely protected from the trouble, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, loſſes, and expence of a proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:035605_0049_1005FD6802172418"/>
That in the violence of party ſpirit which government knows too well how to produce, and to inflame evidence; the most concluſive, might be rejected, and that juries might be packed, "who would find Abel guilty of the murder of Cain:"</p>
            <p>That nothing tends more to irritate the minds of men, and diſturb the peace of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, than proſecutions of a political nature, which like proſecutions in religion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the evils, they were, perhaps, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to remove:</p>
            <p>They knew that the licentiouſneſs of the preſs, though an evil, was a leſs evil than that reſulting from any law to reſtrain it, upon the ſame principle that the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened part of the world is at length convinced, that the evils ariſing from the toleration of hereſy and atheiſm, are leſs, inſinitely leſs, than the evils of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</p>
            <p>That the ſpirit of inquiry and diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was of the utmoſt importance in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry free country, and could be preſerved only by giving it abſolute protection, even in its exceſſes:</p>
            <p>That truth was always equal to the taſk of combating falſehood without the aid of government; becauſe in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it has defeated falſehood, backed by all the power of government:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:035605_0050_1005FD69971FCCC0"/>
That truth cannot be impreſſed upon the human mind by power, with which, therefore, it diſdains an alliance, but by reaſon and evidence only.</p>
            <p>They knew the ſublime precept inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the act eſtabliſhing religious free dom, that "where diſcuſſion is free, error ceaſes to be dangerous:" and, therefore, they wiſely aimed at the total excluſion of all Congreſſional juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>But, it has been ſaid, that the freedom of the preſs, conſiſts not in the privilege of printing truth; but in an exemption from previous reſtraint, and as the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bill impoſes no previous reſtraint, it does not abridge the freedom of the preſs. This <hi>profound</hi> remark is borrowed from Blackſtone and De Lolme, and is gravely repeated, by thoſe who are weak enough to take opinions upon truſt.</p>
            <p>If theſe writers meant to ſtate what the law was underſtood to be in England, they are correct. Even if they meant to ſtate what the law ought to be in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, perhaps they are ſtill correct; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is extremely probable, that a preſs abſolutely free, would in the ſhort courſe of one year "humble in the duſt and aſhes," the "ſtupendous fabric," of the Britiſh government. But this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not deſerve to be tranſplanted
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035605_0051_1005FD6D4981E238"/>into America. In Britain, a legiſlative control over the preſs, is, perhaps eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the preſervation of the "preſent order of things;" but it does not follow, that ſuch control is eſſential here. In Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, a vaſt ſtanding army is neceſſary to keep the people in peace, and the monarch on his throne; but it does not follow that the tranquillity of America, or the perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſafety of the Preſident, would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by a ſimilar inſtitution.</p>
            <p>A ſingle remark will be ſufficient to expoſe the extreme fallacy of the idea, when applied to the constitution of the United States. If the freedom of the preſs conſists in an exemption from previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous restraint, Congreſs may, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the freedom of the preſs, puniſh with death any thing <hi>actually</hi> publiſhed, which a political inquiſition may chuſe to condemn.</p>
            <p>But on what ground is this Britiſh doctrine about the freedom of the preſs introduced here? In Britain, the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is acknowledged to be omnipotent. It has exerciſed this omnipotence, and converted three years into ſeven years. In Britain there is no constitution, no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of legiſlative power; but in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, there is a constitution, the power of the legiſlature is limited, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035605_0052_1005FD6FA7DA6C50"/>of one limitation is to ſecure the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the preſs.</p>
            <p>If this doctrine is avowed here, under the idea that the common law of England is in force in the United States, even this idea will be of no avail. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law knows nothing of printing or the liberty of the preſs. The art of printing was not diſcovered, until towards the cloſe of the 15th century. It was at firſt in England, a ſubject of ſtar-chamber ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and afterwards put under a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencer by ſtatute. This ſtatute expired juſt before the commencement of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent century. Before this event, the rights of the preſs, were at the mercy of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle individual. There can be no common law, no immemorial uſage or cuſtom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a thing of ſo modern a date.</p>
            <p>The freedom of the preſs, therefore, means the total exemption of the preſs from any kind of legiſlative control, and conſequently the ſedition bill, which is an act of legiſlative control, is an abridgment of its liberty, and expreſsly forbidden by the conſtitution. Which was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>
            <p>In the foregoing pages, I have kept clear of authorities and quotations, even when expreſsly in point. Theſe can be reſorted to without my help. I do not
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035605_0053_1005FD71325D3040"/>contemn the opinions of others; but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion is endleſs, where authorities are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on. I have kept clear too, of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal remarks. Theſe would have been justified by the manners of the times, and to many, would have been more acceptable than argument itſelf. But the influence of truth is not aided by invective and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. I have addreſſed myſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the underſtanding only;—and I hope, that the ſacred cauſe of liberty and truth, if not promoted by the arguments, has not been diſgraced by the temper or language of</p>
