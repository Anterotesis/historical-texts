            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THAT the greatneſs and proſperity of a people depend upon the proportion of public ſpirit and the love of virtue, which is found to exiſt among them, ſeems to be a maxim eſtabliſhed by the univerſal conſent and I may ſay experience of all ages.</p>
            <p>MAN is formed with a conſtitution wonderfully adapted for ſocial converſe and connection. Scarcely uſhered into the world, but his wants teach him his inability, of himſelf, to provide for them. Wrapt in aſtoniſhment, with an anxiety inexpreſſible, the ſolitary exiſtant looks around for the aid of ſome friendly neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016836_0005_0F9EC000E82EBA58"/>and ſhould he perchance meet the deſired object; ſhould he find one, endowed with intellectual faculties, beſet with the ſame wants and weakneſſes, and in all reſpects the very image of himſelf; ſhould he find him with a heart open to mutual kind offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a hand ſtretched out to beſtow a proportion of his labour, with a boſom glowing with gratitude, his ſoul is on the wing to expreſs the ſenſe he entertains of the generous obligation.</p>
            <p>A CONFIDENCE is eſtabliſhed between him and his benefactor, they ſwear perpetual friendſhip, and a compact for mutual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and aſſiſtance becomes imperceptably conſented to. Thus doubly armed, together they purſue their morning rout to ſatisfy thoſe demands only which nature reminds them of, and while the ingenuity of the one is exerciſed to enſnare, the ſtrength of the other is perhaps employed to ſubdue their vigorous opponent.</p>
            <p>THEIR little family ſoon encreaſes, and as their ſocial ring becomes gradully enlarged, their obligations to each other are equally circular. Honeſt induſtry early teaches them that a part only is ſufficient to provide for the whole, and that a portion of their time may be ſpared to cull the conveniences as well as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wants of nature. Property and perſonal ſecurity appear to be among the firſt objects of their attention, and acknowledged merit receives the unanimous ſuffrage to preſide guardian over the rights and priveledges of their infant ſociety. The advantages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived are in a moment experienced. Their little policy, erected
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016836_0006_0F9EC0017A897558"/>upon the broad baſis of equality, they know of no ſuperiorty but that which virtue and the love of the whole demands; and while with chearfulneſs they entruſt to his care a certain part of their natural rights, to ſecure the remainder, the agreement is mutual, and the obligation upon his part equally ſolemn and binding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them back, either at the inſtance and requeſt of their ſovereign pleaſure, or whenſoever the end ſhould be perverted for which he received them.</p>
            <p>INTEGRITY of heart, benevolence of diſpoſition, the love of freedom and public ſpirit, are conſpicuous excellencies in this ſelect neighbourhood. Lawleſs ambition is without a friend, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating profeſſional pleas of tyrants, ever accompanied by the magnificence and ſplendor

PATRIOTISM is a virtue which will ever be univerſally admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even by thoſe incapable of poſſeſſing it.

WHEN the Syracuſians, groaning under every ſpecies of cruelty, which luſt, avarice and ambition could inflict, ſupplicated their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous neighbours for aſſiſtance, to alleviate thoſe miſeries they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had been expoſed to.

No, but fired with a generous glow of ſoul, fired with the manly ſentiments of freedom, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable hatred to oppreſſion of all kinds, he marches his troops to the deliverance of this afflicted people, and with a firmneſs becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoldiers, fighting under the ſtandard of liberty, after a ſeries of fatigue and toil, harraſſing marches and fierce conflicts, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrones the tyrant, and is proclaimed the deliverer of Syracuſe.— Having reſtored tranquility to this unhappy country, repeopled their cities, revived their laws, and diſpenſed juſtice to all ranks and claſſes, he reſigned his command, and retreated once again to the private walks of life, accompanied with the greatful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of millions as the patron of their liberty and the ſaviour

The danger of the iſſue is now paſt, and if we but retain the ſame patriotick ardor, with which we firſt defended our rights from the graſp of our enemies, they are every day in our power.

IN our day we are called to ſee a happy country laid waſte at the ſhrine of ambition; to experience thoſe ſcenes of diſtreſs which hiſtory is filled with, but experience rivetts it's leſſons upon the mind, and if we reſolve with deliberation, and execute with vigor, we may yet be a free and flouriſhing people.

               </note> for ourſelves, independent upon any nation or people upon earth. We have the experience of ages to copy from,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016836_0021_0F9EC011A20215D0"/>advantages that have been denied to any who have gone before us. Let us then, my fellow-citizens, learn to value the bleſſing. Let integrity of heart, the ſpirit of freedom and rigid virtue, be ſeen to actuate every member of the commonwealth. Let not party rage, private animoſities, or ſelf intereſted motives, ſucceed that religious attachment to the public weal which has brought us ſucceſsfully thus far; for vain are all the boaſted charms of liberty if her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt votaries are guided by ſuch baſe paſſions. The tryal of our patriotiſm is yet before us, and we have reaſon to thank Heaven, that it's principles are ſo well known and defuſed. Exerciſe towards each other the benevolent feelings of friendſhip, and let that unity of ſentiment which has ſhone in the field, be equally animating in our councils.</p>
            <p>REMEMBER that proſperity is dangerous; that though ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful we are not infallible; that like the reſt of mankind we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of erring. The line of our happineſs may be traced with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, and ſtill there may be a difficulty in perſuing it. Let us not forget that our enemies have other arts in ſtore for our deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that they are tempting us into thoſe ſnares, which after ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful ſtruggles, proved the ruin of the empires of the Eaſt, and let this ſacred maxim receive the deepeſt impreſſion upon our minds, that if avarice, if extortion, if luxury and political corruption, are ſuffered to become popular among us, civil diſcord and the ruin of our country will be the ſpeedy conſequence of ſuch fatal vices, but while patriotiſm is the leading principle, and our laws are contrived
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016836_0022_0F9EC0129675D508"/>with wiſdom and executed with vigor, while induſtry, frugality and temperance are held in eſtimation, and we depend upon public ſpirit and the love of virtue for our ſocial happineſs, peace and affluence will throw their ſmiles upon the brow of the individual, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth will flouriſh, our land become the land of liberty, and AMERICA an aſylum for the oppreſſed.</p>
