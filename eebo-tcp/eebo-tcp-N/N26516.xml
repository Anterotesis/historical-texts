            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE ART OF EXCELLING; AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>EMULATION is commmon to all our race. Competition pervades every age of life, and every grade of character. From the child who liſps his alphabet, to the grandſire who tells the ſtory of his better days; from the boy whirling his ball, to the hero commanding his army; we find all influenced by a ſimilar ſpirit of emulation. The object of emulation is excellence. All competitors wiſh for excellence, whatever may be the object of purſuit; whether gold or glory, amuſement or virtue. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we have never known the man who could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſee all men excel himſelf in all things. He might, in many reſpects, yield the palm of excellence to many; but he would have ſome favourite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition in which he would willingly be equalled by none.</p>
            <p>WITH all this ardour for excellence, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence life with no native pre-eminence. Our real character is the production of our own exertion. God has wiſely given to man merely eſſence; he has left the formation of his character to the effort of his own energies. He has ſaid, that unleſs he mark himſelf with deeds of ſplendour, which may give him to ſhine along the current of duration, even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035254_0005_1001CEBAAF305E38"/>
itſelf ſhall but perpetuate his inſignificance, and continue him an undiſtinguiſhed particle in the great ocean of being.</p>
            <p>THUS deſtitute of ſuperiority, and thus deſirous of diſtinguiſhing merit, each young mortal awakes from the ſlumbers of nihility; and, ſtarting off in the career of exiſtence, eagerly enquires how he muſt run, to obtain the prize of excellence. The art of excelling, therefore, is univerſally important. It intereſts every individual of man. It cannot then be improperly choſen for the ſubject of a few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations before a Society which has no views ſeparate from the common intereſt of humanity.</p>
            <p>EXCELLENCE may be obtained, firſt, by an eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our powers; and ſecondly, by calling up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our minds the motives naturally urging theſe powers into exertion.</p>
            <p>AFTER a perfect review of all the energies of his nature, man muſt be perſuaded that every atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which can augment human merit, lies within the reach of human acquiſition. The firſt rule, therefore, in the art of excelling, is to convince our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that we can excel.</p>
            <p>FOR want of this conviction, many things are fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. All imperfect actions are the offspring of undecided efforts. If any thing be done weakly or partially; if any enterprize be feebly attempted and fail in the execution, it is becauſe he who attempted the performance doubted his ſkill, his energy, or his ſucceſs. This doubtfulneſs generates that timidity which forever unnerves the arm of exertion. On the contrary, all noble deeds have been done by thoſe who greatly believed God had rendered them capable of the atchievement. This generous perſuaſion of mind gives courage, fortitude, perſeverance; and thus diminiſhes danger, removes difficulty, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts obſtacles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:035254_0006_1001CEC599617F60"/>THESE truths will be ſtill more illuſtrated and evinced, if we advert to a few examples. Many a midnight taper has ſhed its laſt glimmering ray on the ſons of contemplation, who, but for this perſuaſion, had repoſed themſelves with the children of thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ignorance, or rioted amidſt the votaries of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
            <p>DEMOSTHENES, from a timid, liſping, heſitating, ſtammering ſchool-boy, formed himſelf into an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſo perfect—ſo perſuaſive—ſo commanding—that for years he baffled all the intrigues of Macedonian uſurpation; puſhed back the torrent of popular li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs; and, while all Greece was falling into the iron hands of ſlavery, he, by the mere charms of his eloquence, allured liberty to hover over his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive city, and give at leaſt a momentary luſtre to the fading glory of Athens. How did he perform this? He believed he could perform it. This belief gave him reſolution, gave him perſeverance, gave him ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>SOCRATES, the pride of Pagan morality, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was prone to every vice. He was deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, intemperate, voluptuous, addicted to revenge, a betrayer of men, a blaſphemer of the Gods. All theſe vices were ſo congenial to his nature, that they were marked in the very features of his face. But, in reality, he was the very reverſe of all theſe. He was ſincere, moderate, above the allurements of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, patient of injuries to a proverb, of a fidelity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be corrupted, and influenced by an habitual reverence for the gods, and a devotion to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. How was this? How did Socrates thus oppoſe the united current of all his propenſities, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and paſſions? How did he thus change, and in a manner re-create himſelf? It was becauſe he felt a certain divine conviction of ſoul, that all this mighty revolution lay within the reach of his power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:035254_0007_1001CECFCB4B8A60"/>THE diſcoverer of the new world affords us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtrious example. All the avarice, envy, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſuperſtition of the fifteenth century, roſe up againſt him. An ocean lay between him and the object of his enterprize. He could ſtand on the hills of Europe, and view the wave, riſing at his foot, and rolling until it waſhed againſt the diſtant hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon; but all beyond was uncertainty. It might be a continent of inacceſſible rocks; it might be a world of waters, by whirlpools and ſhallows impaſſable, and vexed with everlaſting ſtorms. What but this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting perſuaſion of mind, could have given him a ſuperiority to all theſe obſtacles?</p>
            <p>IT was the ſame perſuaſion which, in the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can revolution, carried the volunteers of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land through the pathleſs, ſavage-haunted, winter wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Maine. It was this which tore the laurel of conqueſt from the brow of Albian glory, and wrote the names of COLUMBIA and WASHINGTON among the ſtars. If, indeed, any thing good or great, any thing worthy to be heard by nations, to be told to poſterity, and had in perpetual remembrance, has ever been done, it has been done by thoſe alone who nobly believed ſucceſs was within their power. Let, therefore, him who would excel, firſt be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he is capable of excellence. Let him believe he can do all things within the reach of human at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement; that his mind may progreſs in improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, until nothing but infinity remains incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, nothing but boundleſs benevolence unprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</p>
            <p>THOUGH we may have ſurveyed the powers of our nature, and feel the certainty of ſucceſs, yet we ſhall never attempt any enterprize, until we are aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the completion of it will in ſome reſpect augment our felicity. All our actions are the offspring of motives; and our own felicity is the great motive
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035254_0008_1001CEDA78124750"/>
of all our actions. We have three great ſources of felicity with which every other ſtream of delight ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately mingles itſelf. The firſt is ſelf-approbation; the next the praiſe of other beings; and the laſt the eternal duration of all thoſe acquirements, by which the two others are obtained.</p>
            <p>LET us then, as another rule in the art of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, contemplate theſe three primary ſprings of our felicity as the great motives of excellence.</p>
            <p>IF the mind be not vitiated, ſelf approbation can be acquired by nothing leſs than excellence. For if emulation be one of our ſtrongeſt paſſions, if the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of emulation be excellence, if we are convinced that whatever conſtitutes excellence lies within the reach of our poſſible acquiſition, then it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the mind entirely to approve itſelf, until it has obtained excellence.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS nothing more augments our felicity than ſelf approbation. The approbation of thoſe moſt dear to us, ſpreads over the heart the fineſt touches of delight. The parent in whoſe boſom we have been nurtured, and the country where we firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held this pleaſant light of heaven, are forever dear to us. It is becauſe their idea, woven into the very texture of our exiſtence, forms a part of ourſelves; and we have it not in our power to rend them away from us, and not lacerate the fibres of that heart with which they are thus incorporated. Yet ourſelves are more dear; and all the love which we feel for any part of ſenſitive creation, is but the offspring of that love which we feel for ourſelves. God has wiſely given each man to conſider himſelf the centre of that moral hemiſphere in which he has placed him. Things intereſt him leſs and leſs, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from him; until, by diſtance, they fade into undiſtinguiſhed indifference, and ſink below the far-off horizon. If becauſe our fellow men, our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035254_0009_1001CEE7C5BBB660"/>
and our friends are dear to us, we are delighted with their approbation, what muſt we feel when our boſoms warm with conſcious integrity, and expand with the exhilirating ſmiles of our own ſouls?</p>
            <p>THIS conſciouſneſs is not all. A pleaſure attends the exerciſe of thoſe acquirements, which purchaſe ſelf approbation. When our minds are not vitiated, what perfects our nature we approve; what depraves it we condemn. The man, therefore, who thoroughly approves himſelf, has acquired every perfection of which his nature is already capable. He is poſſeſſed of virtue, knowledge, ſcience, taſte, refinement. The ſerenity of temperance, the firmneſs of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the magnanimity of benevolence, are among the habits of his heart. He has contemplated moral and material nature, until his expanded mind ſeems a region emboſoming the univerſe; and ſplendidly ornamented with all the rich garniture of phyſical and intellectual ſyſtems.</p>
            <p>THE value of ſelf approbation is enhanced by its independence. It muſt be to its poſſeſſor certain and permanent, becauſe it lies within himſelf. That vortex of contingency which whirls in its duſty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere all things elſe of man, reaches not the ſtill retreat of a ſelf approving heart. Envy, malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and calumny, have no power over it. They gnaſh their iron fangs, and raiſe their nocturnal howls in vain.</p>
            <p>SELF approbation is a ſource of pleaſure inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from us. Wherever we may be called by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or driven by neceſſity; whether in the retreats of rural ſolitude, or the noiſy tumults of the clamorous city; place us on the winter-beaten plains of Labrador, or the ſerpent-haunted ſhores of ſtormy Huron, or in the rocky boſom of the frowning Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leghanies, none of theſe peregrinations will ever remove us from a ſelf approving heart. It ſmiles
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035254_0010_1001CEF580D8A108"/>
with a kind of omnipotent beneficence, will forever ſtrew the vernal glories of paradiſe before us. Nay, let theſe bodies become the ſport of accident; let the corroding current of time wear them away; let their particles, unlocked from each others' embrace, be driven by whirlwinds round the globe, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized to aether, and ſcattered through immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; ſtill ſelf approbation will be with us while our conſciouſneſs or our ſouls remain, be they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of no matter what department of duration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on this or t'other ſide the billowy waſte of ages.</p>
            <p>IF therefore ſelf approbation give ſenſations ſo delightful; if it comprehend all the improvements of our nature; if it lie above the reach of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and be forever inſeparable from us, does it not contain much of that which makes us bleſſed? If ſelf approbation can be obtained by no mean acquiſition; if the ſoul never ſmile on itſelf ſo long as it has tarniſhed one deed with a malevolent deſign, or left one meritorious action unperformed; if nothing but excellence can purchaſe ſelf approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then ſurely as much as each man deſires a ſource of felicity exquiſite, comprehenſive, independent and durable, ſo much will he labour for that excellence, by which alone it can be obtained.</p>
            <p>THE praiſe of that Being, to whom we are all amenable, is a ſubject too ſolemn for the preſent occaſion, too hallowed for the preſent ſpeaker. With what, and how many other beings we ſtand related, is now, perhaps, ſomewhat doubtful. In ſpeaking, therefore, of the praiſe of other beings, as a ſource of happineſs, and a motive of excellence, the praiſe of our fellow men only will be mentioned.</p>
            <p>For this praiſe perhaps all have a fondneſs: It may with juſtice be ſaid, that man loves the applauſe of man. The wiſe ancients were of this opinion. They regarded a love of glory as the ſtrongeſt proof
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035254_0011_1001CEFFE3567688"/>
of man's divine original; and ever conſidered thoſe minds the moſt exalted, which had the ſtrongeſt paſſion for praiſe. Men ſeem prepared by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not only to admire and applaud whatever is magnificent in the atchievements of others, but alſo to feel a peculiar delight in the merit and fruition of that applauſe which is the juſt reward of noble actions. The ſame men who have readily reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eaſe, pleaſure and tranquility; aſſumed care, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured fatigue, and ſmiled amidſt perilous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, have yet trembled at the firſt approach of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. None are ſo baſe, ſo worthleſs, ſo entirely inſignificant, ſo contaminated with crimes or ſcarred with ignominy, but they ſtill fancy themſelves poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſome ſhade, ſome faded tint of excellency. Place them on the loweſt grade of human infamy, and even there the cold dank breath of univerſal neglect cannot entirely extinguiſh this god-like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. From that abyſs of depreſſion, they lift their eyes towards the ſun of glory, and vainly ſolace themſelves with recollection of their blighted ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
            <p>THAT the acquiſition of this glory and applauſe, which men ſo ardently deſire, will greatly augment the felicity of thoſe who obtain them, cannot be doubted. It is no leſs certain, that this applauſe can be obtained by excellence alone. In the unvitiated ſtate of public opinion, there ſeems to be a tacit agreement among mankind, to beſtow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary praiſe on nothing but extraordinary merit. This originates from the very conſtitution of our nature. We never ſet a high value on eaſy acquiſitions. Rational men ſeldom arrogate to themſelves any merit on account of the poſſeſſion of accidental honour or emolument. But acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made by toil, care, vigilance and long perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, are highly prized. Their value ſeems en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035254_0012_1001CF086EB2C5E0"/>
by all the anxiety of purſuit, and all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of acquiſition.</p>
            <p>THE emergencies of ſociety render this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary. Some ſocial duties would never be performed, if any thing leſs than their performance could purchaſe the ſame applauſe and glory. We are ſometimes called to defend our country. It is true our country involves objects endeared to us by ſo many relations, that, without any hope of glory for it, we might be induced to ſtretch out our arm in its defence. But this is not enough. Men would fight with a caution little leſs than puſillanimous, if they fought merely on the defenſive. More than this muſt be done in the day of battle. Men muſt then make aggreſſions, muſt fight for acquiſition, ruſh on danger, and be in a manner prodigal of life. When this is done, it is only becauſe no other atchievements purchaſe ſo much glory as deeds of valour. It is the expectation of this glory which plucks from the brow of battle all its terrors, ſoftens the field of ſlaughter into the bed of honour, and renders dying for our country delightful.</p>
            <p>A DIFFERENT conſtitution would, perhaps, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ſociety. If applauſe were beſtowed on baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, indolence and cowardice; if the wreath of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were unbound from the brow of the valiant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of his country, and held out to him who ſhrunk from the point of danger, or betrayed the armies of his nation to their enemies, would not that virtue, "which ſeeks no intereſt, no reward but praiſe," indignant retire from an ungrateful world? Would not vice, thus countenanced, encouraged and applauded, ride through the nations triumphant? Yes, the hero of Mount-Vernon would have ſunk into contempt and oblivion, while the traitor of Weſt-Point had not only reſcued his name from the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035254_0013_1001CF1585981D18"/>
gibbet of infamy, but riſen glorious amidſt the ruins of his country. God hath therefore ſaid to man, beſtow praiſe and applauſe on thoſe only, who have deſerved fame and glory by excellence.</p>
            <p>IF then nature has given us ſuch a deſire for praiſe; if this paſſion be inextinguiſhable by time or accident; if our feelings, the emergencies of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and in a manner the voice of God himſelf, command us to beſtow praiſe on thoſe only who have earned it by extraordinary merit, what motive can more loudly call up all the energies of our ſouls, and give us a warmer ardour in purſuit of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, than a perſuaſion, that by it alone, we can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that praiſe of our fellow men, which the human heart forever ſo anxiouſly deſires?</p>
            <p>THE eternal duration of thoſe acquiſitions by which we purchaſe our own approbation, and the praiſe of other beings, is another ſource of felicity, and another motive to excellence. All our mental improvements will be ours forever. The ſoul's immortality is implied in this conſideration. The truth of this doctrine is denied by the new ſect of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. In an aſſembly like this, compoſed of enlightened Americans, we ſhall not find one of that ſect; one who is delighted with the degradation of his nature; who prefers annihilation to exiſtence; who diſbelieves doctrines becauſe all men believe them, and becauſe God himſelf has declared them to be true. If there ſhould be, now liſtening to the ſpeaker, one ſuch monſter of abſurdity, to him no argument can be addreſſed. Pity may be extended to him, though his character muſt be abhorred. He muſt have deſigned or perpetrated iniquity, until he has travelled down all the grades of wickedneſs; until, by the laſh of remorſe, he is driven from the dominion of reaſon; and, to eſcape the ſcourgings
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035254_0014_1001CCFA7A417B90"/>
of his own conſcience, he throws himſelf headlong into the abyſs of annihilation.</p>
            <p>MEN of rationality can eaſily perceive that every thing of man evinces his immortality. He deſires it; he believes in it; he hopes for it. His toil, his exertion, his ambition, all ultimate on things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the region of time. If man be immortal, all nature is conſiſtent; if not, all we know of God or his creation, is abſurdity.</p>
            <p>MEN, therefore, ſtarting off in the career of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, warmed with emulation, and eager for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of excellence, ought to conſider this life as the commencement of their exiſtence. It will continue forever; and he who, by ſuperior exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, advances forward of his fellow beings, may retain that advantage through an eternal progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. We ſhall make no improvement in vain; for when we die in this ſtate of exiſtence, we ſhall live in another. Thoſe who have moſt knowledge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and virtue in this world, will have moſt knowledge, excellence and virtue in that. Thoſe who in this world have toiled for the improvement of their nature; who have refrained from pleaſure; endured ſelf denial; earned their own approbation, and purchaſed applauſe and glory, ſhall ſtand bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by all theſe excellencies on the ſhores of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>IMMORTALITY gives importance to all our acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. Write eternity on the moſt trivial conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of our moſt trivial actions, and they expand themſelves into a magnitude, whoſe dimenſions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reached by finite conception. The thread, though attenuated down almoſt to imperceptibility, yet, if it be infinitely extended, will comprehend the material univerſe.</p>
            <p>INDEED, without immortality, nothing would be worth purſuit. If death be the termination of our
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035254_0015_1001B299D9A2CE20"/>
exiſtence, the grave will deſtroy all acquiſitions, and equalize all characters. The ſage and the fool, the philoſopher and the child of ignorance, the virtuous and the debauchee, the hero and the coward, the honourable and the infamous, the excellent and the contemptible, will crumble together into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon indiſcriminate inſignificancy. If this be ſo, who will toil to improve his nature, or brighten the path of his exiſtence with deeds of ſplendour? Even glory itſelf would not be worth purſuit. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what is the glory attainable by one who lives but three ſcore years? A moment's reflection will diſcover. Survey the many kingdoms, countries and regions of the earth, together with the millions who inhabit them; look back over the numberleſs generations of men, whoſe names are blotted out of time; turn your eye forward to the myriads of their poſterity, riſing in long ſucceſſion to follow them down the ſame duſky road of oblivion; walk abroad into the univerſe, beholding the multitude of worlds ſwarming with population, and then turn and inſpect this earth, and mark out the ſpot of which we are tenants, and the number of beings to which we are known, and in this view of "the amazing whole," muſt not a ſmall part of a ſmall country on this little earth be the ſcene of our moſt mighty deeds? And in ſo ſhort a period, to how few of the countleſs myriads of intelligences ſucceſſively tenanting all ſpace, and exiſting through all duration, can we poſſibly render ourſelves known!</p>
            <p>NAY, were the fame of our actions to be carried to the remoteſt corner of the earth; were poſterity to gaze on the ſplendour of our glory, and even our buried forefathers to pauſe amidſt their iron ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and liſten to the renown of their ſons; yet, how ſhort and how very worthleſs is that reputation, to which we muſt become inſenſible at the cloſe of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035254_0016_1001CF354C293860"/>
this life! If, therefore, the ſoul does not live for an everlaſting fruition of its acquiſitions, nothing can be more important to man, than the few tranſitory objects that come in contact with his ſenſes. "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," might juſtly be his wiſeſt rule of life.</p>
            <p>BUT when we meaſure our exiſtence by the line of eternity; when we know our preſent actions will give a colour to the whole current of our being; that each virtue, which in this life bloſſoms in our ſouls, ſhall exhale immortal fragrance, and bluſh with beauty forever renovating; that each of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deeds, brightened by the conflagration of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial nature, ſhall with us riſe reſplendent from the wide ruins of mortality; we ſhall feel ourſelves warmed, and elevated, and energized with deſires which can be ſatisfied with nothing leſs than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal excellence.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE FEDERAL ADELPHI,</p>
            <p>THOUGH we ſhroud ourſelves in myſtery, and conceal the arcana of our Society from the world by unviolated ſilence, yet improvement was the deſign of our inſtitution. As men, and as philoſophers, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man actions are the moſt intereſting ſubjects of our reſearch. The philoſophy of them is not more ſubtle and curious, than uſeful and important. A ſketch of this philoſophy has juſt been attempted. If the principles adduced exiſt in our nature, they give birth to a train of conſequences which ought exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to influence our conduct.</p>
            <p>If a conviction that we can excel be the firſt ſtep towards excellence, then, as friends to human im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, we ought to exalt human nature. We may not depreſs even a child, in its own eſtimation;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035254_0017_1001CF3F9AF6FC10"/>
and he who does it, may remember that he quenches an immortal ardour, "and cruſhes in the birth a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er etherial."</p>
            <p>I KNOW there is a gloomy-minded philoſophy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly employed in decrying human nature; "the laſt and beſt of all God's works" on earth. Men who have been long lectured by the profeſſors of this philoſophy, have at length doubted their ability to perform even the common vocations of life; and become degraded in their own eſtimation, until they were prepared for the moſt benighted ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the moſt paſſive ſlavery. Let their doctrine once he univerſally credited, and we ſhall all adopt the maxims of Indoſtan philoſophy. We ſhall ſay, to ſit ſtill is better than to walk; to ſleep than to wake; and to die is beſt of all. Perhaps there are few me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods by which we could more advance human im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, than by reaſoning or ridiculing from the catalogue of human opinion, this gloomy, heart-ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, foul debaſing doctrine.</p>
            <p>IF ſelf approbation be a motive of action, then our moral taſte ſhould be carefully formed on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of rectitude. Though in the healthy ſtate of the mind, when all its ſenſes are correct and delicate, it approves of excellence only; yet our mental, like our corporeal ſenſes, may be greatly vitiated. I know not but our moral ſenſe may be ſo vitiated, that we may approve ourſelves for actions which we now condemn as vicious. If from infancy, falſhood and treachery have been recommended to us, may we not finally feel ourſelves more excellent in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe vices, than in the practice of the moſt perfect ſincerity and faithfulneſs? If from the birth of reaſon to its maturity, we have been taught, by the precepts and examples of all around us, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn ſcience, its inſtitutions, diſciples and inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035254_0018_1001CF4A2D162510"/>
ſhall we not look on the preachers of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and knowledge, and morals, and religion, as the pilferers and peſts of ſociety? Shall we not ſay to evil, "be thou our good;" ignorance, be thou our excellency? So far, therefore, as ſelf approbation is a motive of excellence, we ſhall aim to excel in what we moſt approve. If this be what is good and wiſe, we ſhall aim to excel in goodneſs and wiſdom; if it be what is wicked and fooliſh, we ſhall aim to excel in wickedneſs and folly.</p>
            <p>How important, then, is a correct and delicate moral taſte; a taſte approbating ourſelves for no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which does not produce felicity!</p>
            <p>MAY we not juſtly doubt that creed, which char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acterizes actions <hi>entirely</hi> by their motives; which teaches means may be ſanctified by their end? This jeſuitical caſuiſtry has been modernized in the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical laboratories of Europe. From thence it comes forth an all purifying eſſence. It gives its poſſeſſor to wade through ſeas of horrors with garments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contaminated; or bleaches his ſcarlet abominations white as the robes of innocence. Let us ſtand afar from its dreadful influence.</p>
            <p>IF the praiſe of our fellow men be a motive of action, then it is important that the public taſte be correct. Though the world will be juſt, though a thouſand erroneous opinions will fade away, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but uncontaminated truth finally appear; yet public taſte may be at times as much vitiated as that of individuals. Like a river, it is formed from many ſtreams; and like that, from all theſe ſtreams it may be rendered impure. Individual wickedneſs viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates public taſte. Voltaire, and his cotemporary tribe of philoſophiſts, by conſtantly, ſilently and art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully infuſing into the minds of the French people their pernicious principles, finally corrupted the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035254_0019_1001B2BECEDEBB70"/>
whole maſs of public opinion, and entirely vitiated the taſte of the nation. How far this will extend, or how long it will endure, are queſtions too nice for human calculation. It may ſpread round half the globe; it may be a century before the public mind can be reſtored to rationality. During this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, and among theſe nations, ſcience and virtue muſt be retrogreſſive; becauſe public patronage will ſanctify and encourage private wickedneſs. For, if we perform actions becauſe men praiſe them, then, if virtue and ſcience be praiſed, we ſhall be virtuous and ſcientific; but, if vice and ignorance be praiſed, we ſhall be vicious and ignorant. National taſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on national inſtruction. Vicious writers, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preachers, and vicious teachers of children, will form a nation to reliſh and applaud vice. What muſt be the taſte of a people where ſchools are ſchools of atheiſm, pulpits the pulpits of immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the preſs groans with licenſed blaſphemies? The ſyſtem of national inſtruction, therefore, claims the primary attention of the patriotic philoſopher. If, my brothers, we have any influence, hither let us direct it. A good deed here, is not a ſolitary, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated benefaction; it extends itſelf to millions, and paſſes down through a ſucceſſion of generations. He who ſnatches a poiſonous dreg from a fountain whoſe ſtreams water a kingdom, ſaves a nation from the deleterious ruin.</p>
            <p>IF the durability of acquiſition give its greateſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; if a belief in the ſoul's immortality be the ſtrongeſt incitement to great and good actions; if this alone involves the idea of accountability, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, of hopes and fears, whoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are unbounded and eternal; if the deſtruction of this demoliſh the laſt barrier againſt vice, the laſt aſylum of virtue, with what indignation ought
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035254_0020_1001B2B71EE43400"/>
we to regard the modern moral revolutioniſts, who explode this doctrine? The ſoul's mortality is the firſt article of their creed. They wiſhed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men for deeds of enormity. This could not be done while they felt themſelves morally account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. They have, therefore, laboured to convince their votaries that the cloſe of life is the termination of exiſtence. What have been the conſequences? Behold them in only one dreadful aggregation of facts. From this cauſe have originated moſt of the extravagances, vices, crimes and atrocities of the French revolution. Here have been hatched, and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and ſledged for ſlight, all their full grown ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; ſacrilege, blaſphemy and parricidal aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination, throw themſelves out from this foul neſt of newly generated abominations, hover over Europe like flights of demons, and darken and contaminate the moral hemiſphere of the world.</p>
            <p>WHILE, therefore, we view the extent of nature and the difficulty of excelling; while we give vigour to our energies and animate our perſeverance with the hope of ſelf approbation, the proſpect of applauſe, and the certain immortality of all our mental acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, let us exalt our conceptions of human nature, correct our taſte for moral beauty, purify the public mind into approbation of none but elevated actions, and repel from credibility whatever might leſſen a belief in our eternal exiſtence and future retribution. As mere ſearchers after truth, we ought to do this; as friends of ourſelves, of our nation, of humanity, we ought to do it. Deception and fanciful theory have aſſumed the robes of truth and philoſophy. An all-transforming ſpirit of innovation has ſtalked forth among the nations. He lays hold of the maſſy baſis of all philoſophy, and is even now labouring to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all civil, moral and religious inſtitutions. Let
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035254_0021_1001CF674365DB98"/>
us not fall whelmed beneath their ruins; let us riſe up againſt this dreadful demon, and triumphantly defend whatever wiſdom has deviſed, or experience improved, or time conſecrated by long hallowed and unviolated veneration.</p>
