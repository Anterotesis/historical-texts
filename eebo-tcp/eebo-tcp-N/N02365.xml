            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Juſt Rebuke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is an approved Maxim, <hi>That every wiſe Man propoſes an End in all his Deſigns and Actions.</hi> Hence it follows, That from the Deſign and End of ſuch Actions they may be denominated Good or Ill.</p>
            <p>It was given out here at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that there was a Piece in the Preſs, intended as an Anſwer to <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> &amp;c. [a little Book which had been the Subject of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſome Time before.] At laſt it came out under the Title of <hi>A Dialogue ſhewing what's therein to be found.</hi> I confeſs I was at firſt at a Loſs to find a Meaning to it; and after further Peruſal, could find nothing to the Purpoſe; nor any Thing like Argument to diſprove any Thing contain'd in <hi>Ways and Means</hi>; That being a Probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Eſſay upon Trade, not dogmatically determining, but modeſtly ſubmitted to the Judicious for Amendment, Probation, or Confutation, as better Judgments might ſee Cauſe. But this Performance, without ſhewing any reaſonable Cauſe, makes the ſaid Book, which was the Author's ſincere Endeavours for a publick Good, to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Subject of Drollery, Deriſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely, and that in a very ungenteel Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002807_0003_0fe63f37f2de1458"/>
all which I ſhall wipe off by the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lines.</p>
            <p>But firſt I ſhall here remark the Occaſion of my firſt ſetting Pen to Paper, <hi>viz.</hi> Some Years ſince, ſome ingenious Perſons and Well-wiſhers to their Country's Happineſs, when they ſaw the Province near the Brink of Ruin, occaſion'd by the encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging inſtead of clogging the injurious Parts of Trade, (Foreign Liquors eſpecially) and diſregarding our own Product and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, as <hi>Iron, Homp, Malt,</hi> &amp;c. the chief Dependance of the Country being on the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Market, which was glutted with ſuch great Quantities of Bread and Flour that often ſold cheaper there than they were bought here; and the Price here ſo low, that the Husbandman could ſcarce live by his Labour, much leſs extricate himſelf from the Incumbrances which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lay under; Silver and Gold, (the Caſh we had in the Country) continually drain'd by our Wine-Trade (and ſometimes for Rum when it would purchaſe that Commodity better than Bread and Flour,) and making Remittances till the little we had left, was ſtill decreaſing, and ſerv'd rather to debaſe the Price of our Vendibles than help Trade.</p>
            <p>Then it was that thoſe Well-wiſhers to their Country, exerted themſelves to make
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002807_0004_0fe63f38f8199280"/>
ſome Eſſays for its Relief, and to open the Eyes of the People. The firſt was, <hi>Some Remedies,</hi> then a <hi>Dialogue betwixt</hi> R. Rich <hi>and</hi> R. Plowman, and other Manuſcripts, which were ſuch clear Diſplays of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing State of the Country, that the People generally ſenſible thereof, and of the Exigencies and Straits they labour'd under, did by their Repreſentations and Petitions to their Repreſentatives in Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, obtain from the Legiſlature (according to the Practice of our Neighbouring Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>New-York</hi>) a Paper-Credit or Currency: How far it has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Ends propoſed, is obvious to all judging Men, who do not wilfully ſhut their Eyes.</p>
            <p>The Manner of Emiſſion being by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Loan-Office, where every Man that had an Eſtate in Fee, free of Incumbrance, might by mortgaging the ſame to the ſaid Office, be admitted to take out half the Value of ſuch Eſtate, not exceeding the Sum reſtricted ſo long, as any Bills re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Office, without Preference to one above another.</p>
            <p>Thus Numbers of Inhabitants whoſe Eſtates had lain dead, were furniſh'd with Stock for Trade, or to lend to others whoſe Inclinations led them thereunto, which gave the quickeſt Puſh to Trade that has been known for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002807_0005_0fe63f38fa1074c8"/>But the Conſideration of our <hi>Weſt-India</hi>-Market, being over ſtockt with Bread and Flour, and for that Reaſon grown very low, as is before noted, put me on Thoughts of contributing to that Good, thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Perſons had ſo happily begun, and from like good Will to my Country, ſet Pen to Paper at ſome Spare-Hours.</p>
            <p>This I did by an Eſſay ſtiled <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Humbly ſubmitted to the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Authority of the Governments on</hi> Delaware, wherein I demonſtrated it to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Intereſt of all thoſe Colonies to preſerve a good Underſtanding betwixt themſelves in Matters of Trade, as moſt conducive to their mutual Benefit, hoping it might excite their Concurrence. And I have underſtood, than many are fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from the Arguments theſe advanc'd, how much it will be their Intereſt to come into thoſe Meaſures.</p>
            <p>It was put out without a Name, and the Printer under an Obligation of Secreſy: The Reaſon of ſuch Injunction was, That as we are unhappily in Parties, the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices too often ariſing from thence, might not fruſtrate the good Deſign and End thereof; which was not that minute Thing, <hi>the Name of an Author,</hi> as the <hi>Dialogiſt</hi> is ſo little and vain to ſuggeſt. Whence he takes his Meaſures, I know not, unleſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002807_0006_0fe63f4200c962b0"/>
from himſelf. And as I have elſewhere ſaid, ſo I now again ſincerely aver, to have no other View but the publick Good and Intereſt of thoſe Colonies in theſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; maugre the Suggeſtion of <hi>Simon,</hi> or any other malevolent Perſon whatſoever. For what thinking Man can judge other-ways, but that it muſt be the Effect of Ill-will thus to jeſt, ſcoff and deride (inſtead of confute) the honeſt Intention of the Eſſayer, which, tho' it ſhould not have effectually done the Good intended, or had not repreſented the State of thoſe Colonies ſo exactly, or had not propoſed ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Remedies for our Calamities, as ſome abler Hand might have done; yet might have excited ſuch an one to do it better: Nor could it poſſibly be of ill Conſequence to any, carrying with it no Manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the Conduct of any Man, either in a publick or private Capacity, keeping my ſelf ſo within the Bounds of Modeſty and Indifference, as might free me from the Byaſs of Party-Heat, and render what I did, leaſt obnoxious to Cavil.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all my Precaution, and without any Provocation or Reaſon that I know of, out comes the comical <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> on purpoſe, no Doubt, to prevent its intended Service. <hi>Dialogue</hi> is a Way of writing moſt liable to Exceptions of any,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002807_0007_0fe63f4202a49320"/>
eſpecially in Controverſy; for unleſs the Writer is a Man of great Integrity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he may make his Antagoniſt ſpeak Nonſence, and put a Senſe on his Words which he never meant; repreſent him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, contradictory, contemptible, or what elſe he pleaſes, as to Fact, or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and by that Art, form ſuch monſtrous Ideas of his Adverſary, in the Minds of People, as may beget invincible Prejudice to the beſt of Perſons and Things; repreſent his Adverſary by a Man of Straw of his own making, and then fight with it.</p>
            <p>How far the <hi>Dialogiſt</hi> is culpable in thoſe or other Reſpects, is what I have to ſhew in theſe Examinations of his Performance, and ſhall accordingly denominate his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as a Juſtice to my ſelf, and my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Intentions in that Eſſay.</p>
            <p>In the Perſon of <hi>Simon,</hi> he ſays, <hi>He loves Dialogue,</hi> and makes that his Option which every one has a Right to do as well as to chooſe the Subject. And if he had kept to the juſt Rule of Dialogue, I ſhould not fault him for That— He tells us next, <hi>'Tis commended of old.</hi> To this I accede, for it is as ancient as <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> the Comedian, who by his ludicrous Wit, rendred <hi>Socrates</hi> contemptible to the People, of whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved much better Treatment, being eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the wiſeſt and beſt of Men in that

               <hi>Page</hi> 10. The <hi>Dialogiſt</hi> has a Paſſage, which being in a different Character, I take to be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002807_0009_0fe63f45dcd85e70"/>
a Citation out of <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> which runs thus, <hi>That the Generality of People are ſo addicted to them</hi> (Rum <hi>and other Spirits</hi>) <hi>that neither Regard to publick Intereſt or private, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Soul, will divert them from the frequent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it.</hi> To which he ſubjoins, <q>And yet thoſe very Dictators miſs very few Days in the Week, wherein they do not begin in the Morning with that ruinous new Invention of <hi>White Bitter,</hi> and compleat the Evening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The ſole Dictator of that Paſſage in <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> is the ſame Perſon and Reaſon that now dictates my Pen, and I diſclaim and reject this Inſinuation as a groſs Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo far is it from Truth, That in a Series of above nine Septinaries of my Age, (nigh Forty Years whereof I have ſpent in this Country) I was never guilty thereof one Day; and I doubt not, but moſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders who know me, will be my Witneſſes, ſo far as they have Knowledge of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>

               </q> He would do well to let us know whence he makes this Inference.</p>
            <p>That theſe Terms are proper to the Subject then diſcours'd of, no Man of a common Underſtanding will deny: And if they had been unapplicable to the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, impertinent or improperly apply'd to the Subject, it would very well become his Sagacity to detect its erroneous Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it's preſum'd, That was too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a Task. And therefore paſſes it off with a Scoff, <hi>No Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have the like Quirks of Wit in other Places; for from the abundance of Science or Conceit, he will allow the reſt of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſo ſmall a Pittance of Underſtanding, as if, to uſe his own Words in another Caſe, he had <hi>monopolis'd a Character,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

his Prejudice to ſo known a Benefit as our Paper-Currency is, ſhould render his Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any Force? Does he think that ſcandalous Inſinuations with which the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue</hi> is replete, can be convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? It muſt certainly be Deſtitution of better Argument that puts him on ſuch mean Ways of trifling: The Query, <hi>Is not this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done with a Witneſs?</hi> is anſwered in the Negative, and the contrary prov'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. In the 16th <hi>Page</hi> he allows, That what he had noted in the 15th Page, to be Inconſiſtences in <hi>Ways and Means. May not all be Inconſiſtences?

            </p>
            <p>Theſe are meer Inſinuations, abuſively to ſcandalize the Legiſlature, who have taken all the Care and Circumſpection imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both in its Security, and to avoid ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more than was neceſſary.

               <hi>Page</hi> 20. is a continu'd Praiſe of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt,</hi> and of his Moderation to Debtors; to which I ſhall not be Negative; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who he, or thoſe others are. But to what Purpoſe is all this, unleſs to caſt a Miſt on his Reader? For here are three Things ſuggeſted,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That whoſoever had Country-Produce, or any Thing elſe to buy Money with, might have it.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>I have before remark'd, that I have been at a Loſs to underſtand the <hi>Dialogiſt</hi>; and here I can only gueſs what to underſtand by it; which may be ſuppos'd to be thoſe Things, <hi>viz.</hi> the Non-neceſſity of Paper-Money; and a Contradiction to <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> Page 4, 5, 6. where the languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State of the Country is ſhewn in many pregnant Inſtances; Trade and Credit ſunk, private and publick, and Law-Suits conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually growing on us. All which being
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002807_0015_0fe63f62e2cf3588"/>
urged to ſhew the Neceſſity of a Paper-Currency, it had become a fair Antagoniſt to have ſhewn the Falſhood thereof, and have derected by clear Reaſoning, and not by Drollery: And now by artful Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of what might, or might not be the Practice of a few to infer generally; for to ſay, <hi>Whoever of the Debtors had Country-Produce or any Thing elſe to buy Money,</hi> (meaning I ſuppoſe) Silver and Gold, it may perhaps be true of <hi>his</hi> Debtors, yet as generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, I deny to be true.

               </gap>d by others? So little of underſtanding as he will allow me, as not to underſtand Words of common Uſe; yet I ſhall adventure to tell him, it is very falſe Reaſoning to make general Concluſions from particular Caſes. And the contrary was notorious from the Numbers of Law-Suits commenc'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd Quarterly; beſides the Number of Priſoners, 'tis ſaid beyond what was ever known in <hi>America,</hi> in any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies. And Laſtly, <hi>How ready and willing they were to take the Country-Produce.</hi> This may be a Truth of a great Number. For ſuch was the Scarcity of Gold and Silver, that the Farmer not able
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002807_0016_0fe63ee6663e9a88"/>
to purchaſe it with his Crop, forc'd the Shops to take it, and they again impos'd the ſame on the Merchant till it became pretty cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Trade; but at ſo low a Price, the Farmer could not live by it. The Silver had been bought up for Merchandize, ſo that none paſs'd in common Payments, and Gold ſo far exhauſted, that little but Cut Pieces, and ſome Scraps paſſed, and That melting up for Remittances, before Paper-Money came out; and nothing elſe being a Legal Tender or Diſcharge to a Bond, the Law-Suits increaſed, and when an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was made to paſs a Bill for making ſome Species of Country-Produce a Legal Tender, it was rejected, which made a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Currency of abſolute Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 22 begins with a Strain of Politicks, and may be allow'd to be inſtructive, had thoſe <hi>Quondam</hi> Patriots, when in Power, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified by Practice, what is ſo patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally talk'd of.

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002807_0017_0fe63f63e6d957d0"/>
were a Number of well-intending Men in ſome Degree of Power ſtill as a Ballance, who</hi> not only <hi>rejoiced,</hi> but exerted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, preferring the publick Good to all Fear and Apprehenſion of private Damage, who having given ſufficient Proof of their Ability and Probity, and as true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Patriots, in Spite of Floods of Oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy and Contempt, have been and ſtill are ſteady in their Purſuit for the publick Tranquility as far as human Prudence can give a Proſpect, and I hope will continue ſo to be</p>

            <p>Is it an imaginary Principal which ſo many Freeholders have ſupported by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging their Eſtates? and whereby others have freed theirs?</p>
            <p>Is it an imaginary Principal which is generally accepted for Diſcharge of Bonds, and all Manner of Debts, and will again purchaſe Lands, Cargoes, and all manner of Vendibles, build Houſes, Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and anſwer all the neceſſary Uſes of Money in Way of Trade, except to ſend out of the Country for Merchandize? Our Silver and Gold did ſerve that Purpoſe ſo long as there was any to be gotten: But when that was gone, and no Proſpect, or indeed Poſſibility (as our Trade was then mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) of bringing more in, not ſo much as any Thing near to anſwer the Demand for carrying away, our Trade and Credit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had inevitably been rack'd, had we not been made ſenſible of our Danger, and had good <hi>Pilots</hi> at hand to bring us off from the Danger that was ſo near us, that we had in a great Degree ſuffer'd for Want of a Currency, which now being happily ſupply'd, the Want of Gold for Remittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is in a great Meaſure ſupply'd alſo by building Ships, and encouraging Trade, which we have ſtill a fair Proſpect of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002807_0019_0fe63f6884bcd460"/>
by the Exportation of Timber to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and perhaps Hemp in Time, which will be a great Help to pay for <hi>European</hi> Goods; and if we can but diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the extravagant Uſe of Foreign Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, by encouraging our own Product, we may in all Probability, have Silver and Gold in Returns for our Flour, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly we had. But why ſo angry at its being let out on Intereſt to defray the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Charges of the Office, <hi>&amp;c</hi>?

            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 24.

               </gap>d, might be inſtructive, had he concluded there, or continu'd his Preaching to the End of his Performance. But inſtead of that, in the following Page he reſumes his wonted Levity, ſo that I doubt his Preaching will be of little Benefit, for he falls to Drolling on the Word <hi>Negative,</hi> with which he is <hi>well pleaſed and diverted</hi>; and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be <hi>the Sot, the Rambler,</hi> the <hi>Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift and the Slip-Seaſon,</hi> which he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where inveighs againſt, but now is making Sport for them: But a Man of Sobriety will hardly thinks it deſerves a Smile, as Comical as himſelf may imagine it to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 26. He caſts his Javelin at <hi>Ways and Means</hi>; but only ſtrikes a Man of Straw of his own making, thus; <hi>I was ſo ſimple as to imagine it intended that I ſhould believe that laborious, induſtrious People</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Palatines</hi>) <hi>are to make us rich without Extent of Land or its Fertility, or a great deal of its Produce; and even without People</hi> (ſimply) <hi>and that without all theſe, Wheat, Hemp, and all the enumerated, are to be raiſed and produced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I conceive is his <hi>Logical</hi> Inference on the <hi>Negatives,</hi> to which he adds an Irony
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002807_0021_0fe63f698bd19e98"/>
on the Word (<hi>ſmith</hi>) which Word was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily added; for without it, he might have had ſome Ground for Cavil; for my plain Meaning was, That a great Number of idle and profligate Perſons, of <hi>Convicts, and the Scum of Goals,</hi> &amp;c. were not the Riches of a Country, and no judicious Perſon can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are. But he continues from the ſame Logical Forge, <hi>I am offended that</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latines <hi>ſhould be put in the Front,</hi> &amp;c. If his Prejudice to <hi>Palatines</hi> had not ſowred his Temper, he could never have made ſuch Deductions from my Words in <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> pag. 11. <hi>as put in the Front, monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize a Character</hi>; for 'tis plain to any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Man, That induſtrious and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People, <hi>Palatines,</hi> and others, are there oppoſed to Convicts, or Scum of Goals, of which many have come of late, and in all Probability may do no more Good here, than in the Places from whence they came, But induſtrious, honeſt People are beneficial to the Publick, increaſe Trade and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' here is nothing of Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence given to <hi>Palatines,</hi> above <hi>prior Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants</hi>; nor are they ſo much as brought in Competition with the firſt Settlers and Improvers of the Province.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Diſcourſe with the Woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> whoſe Queſtion concerning the Place of Worſhip was anſwered by two Negatives, <hi>viz. Neither in this Mountain, nor yet at</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, &amp;c. and then affirmatively <hi>in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> in Oppoſition to the Superſtition of the one, and Formality of the other. The next Example I cite is the firſt <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which, by ſome is thought to be deſigned by the Penman, as a Preface to that Book, where the Beatitudes there mention'd are predicated by three Negatives, <hi>Walketh not
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002807_0023_0fe63f719fece9a0"/>
in the Counſel of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, nor ſtandeth in the Way of Sinners; nor ſitteth in the Seat of the Scornful.</hi> Then it's added in Contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: <hi>But his Delight is in the Law of the Lord:</hi> And if the Dialogiſt had not ſate in the Seat of the Scornful; but had delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Law, whether Internal or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, I perſwade my ſelf he would not have found ſuch Pleaſure in his Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; all the Examples of this Kind in the ſacred Writings are too numerous to inſert here.</p>
            <p>But to recur to ſecular Matters, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Word <hi>Negative.</hi> Suppoſe one ſhould ask me, which is the beſt Form of Government, I would anſwer negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus;</p>
            <p>'Tis not a <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not an <hi>Oligarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not an <hi>Olocracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe being Names we borrow from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who wrote of Politicks, I would next proceed to a Definition thus: A Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny is, when a ſingle Perſon governs by an abſolute Power, for his own private Good, as in <hi>France.</hi> But where a ſingle Perſon governs for the publick Good, that is called a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as in <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Oligarchy</hi> is, where a Number govern for their own private Good, as at <hi>Athens,</hi> under the thirty two Tyrants; and at <hi>Rome,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002807_0024_0fe63f7389e0a7f0"/>
Firſt</hi> under the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> and next under the' two <hi>Triumvirates</hi> ſucceſſively, which made Way for enſlaving the freeſt People in the World, and ſuch at this preſent are the Lords of <hi>Poland,</hi> where the Subjects are Vaſſals.</p>
            <p>But where a Number govern for the Good of the whole, that is called an <hi>Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy,</hi> as in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Olocracy</hi> is the Miſ-rule of a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or a Rabble, as at <hi>Naples,</hi> under <hi>Maſſanello.</hi> But where the Multitude rule well, and for a common Good, this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Democracy</hi>; but theſe are generally on the Brink of Confuſion, and ſeldom of long Continuance.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſplay'd, <hi>Negatively</hi> and <hi>Poſitively,</hi> the Vices and Vertues of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Forms of Government from as good Authors as any amongſt us, who ſet up for Politicks, I conclude a Government happily conſtituted, as the Monarchy of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> conſiſting of a limited <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> a noble <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> and a juſt and prudent <hi>Democracy,</hi> This, in Anſwer to the Queſtion, I pronounce (with Anceſtral Zeal,) the beſt Form of Government, where it is practicable.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Page</hi> 27, to 33. is a long Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on Oeconomy, which I like very well, for the moſt Part; and if it were generally

I cannot omit to obſerve how ready he is to turn from his moſt ſerious Diſcourſes to Jeſting, as if Satyr was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come habitual to him, he makes his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical <hi>Jenny</hi>'s Improvidences and Neglect (the Subject thereof,) to try his Skill, in undervaluing the <hi>wretched tatter'd Stuff call'd Money.</hi> But I ſuppoſe he will acknowledge, 'twas an untoward Blunder to make <hi>Jenny</hi> ſay, <hi>"If our wiſe Folk had done ſo,</hi> (that is, ſav'd ſome Caſh Yearly out of what ſhe rais'd, beſides balancing with every body) <hi>"they needed never have made Paper-Money.</hi> This Stroke does not fall, as I ſuppoſe, it was intended, on the Makers of Paper-Money, (when there was no other Way to ſupport Trade and Credit;) but on our <hi>Quondam</hi> Patriots, who did not find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with their private Intereſt to clog the injurious Parts of Trade: But ſo much of our Produce was annually confounded on Foreign Liquors, that the Remainder would not ballance our other Trade. And inſtead of adding ſomething Yearly to the Caſh we

had, we were ſtill drawing out, as long as any was to be had. But not to dwell long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on his Trifling, I paſs on to his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Concluſion, which is but a few Lines after his Waggery with <hi>Jenny</hi>'s Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerbread.

               <hi>Page</hi> 35. <hi>I have indeed been ſunk in my Spirits, and ready to weep at the melancholy Proſpect before us.</hi> There is certainly Cauſe of Complaint of Levity, Rudeneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at many Times of Concourſe, as at Fairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and too often in private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: But I would hope better of thoſe others there mention'd. But the <hi>Dialogiſt</hi> ſeems to deſpair of a Reformation, leaving Things too indefinitely at the worſt for mending. I acknowledge evil Cuſtoms and Manners grow worſe for Indulgence, and with Care had been taken to prevent their Growth to what they now are, long ago, which might have more eaſily been done then, than now. However, I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hopes of a Reformation in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in our Morals, as we have happily ſeen in our Politicks; and that, as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſo laudable Undertakings, the one may be conducive to promote the other: A good Step was made towards it laſt <hi>November</hi> Fair, where a very corrupt Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Youth, was totally ſuppreſs'd at that Time by the preſent Mayor. One End of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002807_0027_0fe63f7b528f53d8"/>
Government is the Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. This the <hi>Dialogiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>he could hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh it in their Power; and that Preventa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or diſcouraging Meaſures, might or could be taken to Effect.</hi> But I perceive he likes not the Means which he apprehends is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, that is, an <hi>Impoſt on Rum.</hi> I think an Impoſt on Rum and Wine is a Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Importation, and every Diſcouragement on thoſe Foreign Liquors is an Encouragement of our own Product, and nothing can deſerve more to be tax'd for the publick Revenue, than ſo publick a Miſchief, which not only devours a great Part of our Produce, that the <hi>Weſt-India</hi>-Markets will, or can take of us; but alſo hinders the Conſumption of abundance of Barley, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which might otherwiſe be raiſed for Malt, which would be in a Manner clear Gain; for ſo much leſs Flour might often ſell for as much in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> as the whole Quantity now ſent, which often gluts the Markets, to the great Loſs of the Adventurers; two Casks of Bread or Flour not yielding at ſuch a Time what one would do, when there is a reaſonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it. What he ſays of making a Law, that none ſhould drink a Dram, or to direct how many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable; I think none will deny; for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of any one ſo wild as to propoſe
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002807_0028_0fe63f7ed38f1480"/>
ſuch Abſurdities; but it does not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow, that Dram-drinking may not be diſcouraged, and Beer and Cyder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> brought more into Uſe. In Hopes of which we ought to wait and ſee what elſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may prudently fall upon, and every Well-wiſher to the publick Good, will lend a Hand to promote it.</p>
            <p>I thought to have concluded here; but on a Review of thoſe laſt recited Pages of the <hi>Dialogiſt,</hi> I find him ſo much in Love with Rum (tho in Charity I believe not, for <hi>perſonal Exceſs,</hi> as private Intereſt) that he is averſe to an Impoſt on it, as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to our own Diſtillers, whom he repreſents as a Sort of Manſlayers, by <hi>turning off the poor Creatures the ſooner</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Drinkers of their Spirits) and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes phiſically to determine Rum the <hi>more wholſome,</hi> which is a Controverſy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from my Deſign, in writing <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> where I left the Deciſion of this Point to the Gentlemen of that Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But why Rum diſtilled from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes here, may not be as wholeſom as Rum diſtilled from Melaſſes in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> is what he ſhould have ſhewn while his Hand was in, and not have turn'd us off with his <hi>Ipſe dixit.</hi> For in <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> pag. 39, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I endeavour'd to ſhew
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002807_0029_0fe63f7ed6095798"/>
the great Detriment it was to the publick Intereſt of this Province, to lay out ſo great a Part of our Product on Rum, in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> when far leſs might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Melaſſes enough there to make the ſame Quantity of Rum here. And the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of what was uſually laid out for Rum would return in Money, or <hi>European</hi> Goods, and encourage Manufactory, Trade, and Navigation, as moſt conducive to a publick Good. But theſe are Thoughts foreign to ſome Part of Mankind.</p>
            <p>He ſays, <hi>Page</hi> 38. <hi>Beſides, 'tis worth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether to encourage Diſtilling would not encreaſe the pernicious Cuſtom of Dram-Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We ſee what Methods are taken by moſt of thoſe already in the Occupation, to promote and tempt to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> To which I anſwer, that the Method of Rum-ſelle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Beer was not good.</hi> Now if the Diſtillers have any Methods more prevalent to promote and tempt to the Uſe, he ſhould let the World know it, to prevent the Temptation.</p>
            <p>He ſays, <hi>And it</hi> (meaning Rum) <hi>may be demonſtrated is generally purchaſed with our own Produce cheaper and more advantagiouſly, by employing our Veſſels,</hi> &amp;c. The Word <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi>
